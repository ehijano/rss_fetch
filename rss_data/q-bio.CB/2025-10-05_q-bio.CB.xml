      <title>Learning Explicit Single-Cell Dynamics Using ODE Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end (besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions. Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST database of gene interactions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Mutation as a Mechanism for the Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 New Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the future evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical challenge, particularly due to the pivotal role of spike protein mutations. It is therefore essential to develop evolutionary models capable of continuously integrating new experimental data. In this study, we employ a cladogram algorithm that incorporates established assumptions for mutant representation -- using both four-letter and two-letter formats -- along with an n-mer distance algorithm to construct a cladogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. This tree accurately captures the observed changes across macro-lineages. We introduce a stochastic method for generating new strains on this tree based on spike protein mutations. For a given set A of existing mutation sites, we define a set X comprising x randomly generated mutation sites on the spike protein. The intersection of A and X, denoted as set Y, contains y sites. Our analysis indicates that the position of a generated strain on the tree is primarily determined by x. Through large-scale stochastic sampling, we predict the emergence of new macro-lineages. As x increases, the dominance among macro-lineages shifts: lineage O surpasses N, P surpasses O, and eventually Q surpasses P. We identify threshold values of x that delineate transitions between these macro-lineages. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for predicting the timeline of macro-lineage emergence. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 evolution adheres to statistical principles: the emergence of new strains can be driven by randomly generated spike protein sites, and large-scale stochastic sampling reveals evolutionary patterns underlying the rise of distinct macro-lineages.</description>
