      <title>A Note on the Existence of Equal Time Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schroedinger picture, which underpins the Wavefunction of the Universe framework to compute Cosmological Correlators, is known to be generically problematic in QFT because of the required infinite localization of the fields in time. We study under which conditions momentum space equal time correlators of scalar fields are finite in flat space. We identify cases where they can be divergent even after renormalizing the theory, while also providing sufficient conditions for their existence. Concrete examples are discussed, covering the well known $\lambda\phi^4$ model, composite operators and effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Superselection Rules, Bosonization Duality in 1+1 Dimensions and Momentum-Space Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the presence of conserved charges on the momentum-space entanglement of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). We show that if a given model has superselection sectors, then it allows for different notions of momentum modes, each associated with a complete set of commuting observables. Applying this idea to investigate the entanglement of momentum degrees of freedom on both sides of the abelian Bosonization duality, we find that different tensor product partitions are mapped into each other and give explicit examples to sustain our findings. The conditions on which our conclusions may be generalized to other duality transformations, which require the introduction of a notion stricter than the most general possible, are laid and directions for further work are given.</description>

      <title>Curvature of an exotic 7-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the Gromoll-Meyer sphere, one of Milnor's exotic $7$-spheres. We focus on a Kaluza-Klein Ansatz, with a round $S^4$ as base space, unit $S^3$ as fibre, and $k=1,2$ $SU(2)$ instantons as gauge fields, where all quantities admit an elegant description in quaternionic language. The metric's moduli space coincides with the $k=1,2$ instantons' moduli space quotiented by the isometry of the base, plus an additional $\mathbb{R}^+$ factor corresponding to the radius of the base, $r$. We identify a "center" of the $k=2$ instanton moduli space with enhanced symmetry. This $k=2$ solution is used together with the maximally symmetric $k=1$ solution to obtain a metric of maximal isometry, $SO(3)\times O(2)$, and to compute its Ricci tensor explicitly. This allows us to put a bound on $r$ to ensure positive Ricci curvature, which implies various energy conditions for an $8$-dimensional static space-time. The construction opens for a concrete examination of the properties of the sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Analytic Bounds on the Spectrum of Crossing Symmetric S-Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive two rigorous constraints on the spectrum of massive states in weakly coupled theories with massless scalars in the adjoint representation of a large-$N$ gauge group. First, we show that the presence of massive spinning states necessitates the existence of lighter states with lower spins. Explicitly, if there exists a massive state with spin $J &gt; 2$, then there must be a state with spin $J-1$ and a non-zero mass lower than that of the lightest spin-$J$ state, a state with spin $J-2$ and a mass lower than that of the lightest spin-($J-1$) particle and so on until we reach a mass below which only states with spin less than 2 are exchanged. Second, we find strict upper bounds on the masses of the lightest states at any spin. If there are spin-$J$ states in the spectrum, the maximum mass of the lightest spin-($J+1$) state is determined by the masses of the lightest spin-$J$ and $(J-1)$ states. In the approximation that this bound applies to pion scattering in real world QCD, we find it gives a window of only ${\sim}150$ MeV for the expected mass of the yet unmeasured spin-7 meson.</description>

      <title>Beyond the ensemble paradigm in low dimensional quantum gravity: Schwarzian density, quantum chaos and wormhole contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on periodic orbit theory we address the individual-system versus ensemble interpretation of quantum gravity from a quantum chaos perspective. To this end we show that the spectrum of geodesic motion on high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, described by the Selberg trace formula, displays a Schwarzian ($\sinh 2\pi\sqrt{E}$) mean level density. Due to its chaotic classical limit, this quantum system also shows all universal signatures of quantum chaos. These two properties imply a possible duality to Jackiw-Teitelboim-type quantum gravity at the level of a single system instead of an ensemble of systems like matrix theories and SYK models. Beyond the universal regime we show how the full wormhole geometry on the gravity side emerges from the discreteness of the set of periodic orbits. Thereby, we take initial steps towards a duality between gravitational and mesoscopic chaotic quantum systems through the topological, respectively, periodic orbit expansions of their correlators.</description>

      <title>Towards new relativistic doubly $\kappa$-deformed D=4 quantum phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new noncommutative (NC) models of quantum phase spaces, containing a pair of $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e algebras, with two independent $\kappa$ and $\tilde{\kappa}$-deformations in space-time and fourmomenta sectors. The first quantum phase space can be obtained by contractions $M,R\to \infty$ of recently introduced doubly $\kappa$-deformed $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$-Yang models, with the parameters $M,R$ describing inverse space-time and fourmomenta curvatures and constant four-vectors $a_\mu, b_\mu$ determining one of nine types of $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$ deformations. The second model is provided by the non-linear doubly $\kappa$-deformed TSR algebra spanned by 14 coset $\hat{o}(1,5)/\hat {o}(2)$ generators. The basic algebraic difference between the two models is the following: the first one, described by $\hat{o}(1,5)$ Lie algebra can be supplemented by the Hopf algebra structure, while the second model contains the quantum phase space commutators $[\hat{x}_\mu,\hat{q}_\nu]$ describing the quantum-deformed Heisenberg algebra relations with the standard numerical $i\hbar\eta_{\mu\nu}$ term.</description>

      <title>Large Orders and Strong-Coupling Limit in Functional Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-order behavior of the functional renormalization group (FRG). For a model in dimension zero, we establish Borel-summability for a large class of microscopic couplings. Writing the derivatives of FRG as contour integrals, we express the Borel-transform as well as the original series as integrals. Taking the strong-coupling limit in this representation, we show that all short-ranged microscopic disorders flow to the same universal fixed point. Our results are relevant for FRG in disordered elastic systems.</description>

      <title>Nucleation of charged quantum de-Sitter$_{3}$ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct charged, static black holes in three-dimensional de Sitter (dS$_{3}$) space that exactly account for semi-classical backreaction effects due to quantum conformal matter. This is accomplished using braneworld holography, where an accelerating, electrically charged anti-de Sitter$_{4}$ black hole localizes on a Randall-Sundrum end-of-the-world brane. Absent of backreaction, the black hole disappears, leaving a chemical conical defect. The "quantum" black hole has a physical parameter space characterized by a shark-fin diagram, with extremal, Nariai, and ultracold limits. We give a detailed analysis of the horizon thermodynamics, where we find the heat capacity of charged and neutral dS$_{3}$ black holes features Schottky peaks. In particular, for a specific temperature range, charged quantum black holes behave as thermal systems with a finite number of energy levels available to their underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, beyond which many energy levels become available. Finally, we compute the probability of nucleating quantum dS black holes. Our work gives a first step to study quantum matter backreaction effects on dS black hole decay.</description>

      <title>A note on 't Hooft-line defect integrated correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the perturbative expansion of a particular integrated correlator of two superconformal primary operators in the stress tensor multiplet of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the presence of a half-BPS 't Hooft-line defect. The calculation is based on a recently derived expression for this physical observable in terms of a two-dimensional lattice sum with manifest automorphic properties under the electromagnetic duality group. When the gauge group is $SU(2)$, this analysis matches with the presented supersymmetric localisation approach while for higher-rank gauge groups, where no alternative formulation is available, the methods introduced prove to be crucial in obtaining the perturbative expansion of integrated correlators for 't Hooft-line defects.</description>

      <title>Geometric realization from irrelevant deformations induced by the stress-energy tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the deformations driven by the stress-energy tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator $\mathcal O$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation and the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results. As several applications of the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational models. Besides, the deformations of Lagrangians for scalar field theories are performed.</description>

      <title>Supergravity solutions for D$p$-D$(6-p)$ bound states: from $p=7$ to $p=-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near horizon geometries of D$p$-branes with $p\neq 3$ are singular with a running dilaton. Bound states of D$p$ branes with their magnetic cousins, D$(6-p)$ branes, can stabilise the dilaton such that an AdS factor might appear in the near horizon region, potentially leading to a chain of AdS vacua of the form $AdS_{p+2}\times S^{p+2} \times \mathbb{T}^{6-2p}$. The solutions with $p=-1, 1, 3$ are supersymmetric with the cases $p=1, 3$ being well-known examples already. We construct the explicit (partially smeared) brane bound state solutions for all such configurations where the cases $p=-1,2$ are entirely novel and we find no AdS geometry for these. The two novel classes of solutions feature ghost branes (negative tension branes), and we suggest they are physical for the D$(-1)-$D$7$ solutions but unphysical for the D$2-$D$4$ solutions. The bound state of a D$(-1)$ and a D7 brane in supergravity was only hinted upon recently in \cite{Aguilar-Gutierrez:2022kvk} and here we correct the solution in order to preserve supersymmetry and find that the dilaton can indeed be stabilised which indicates there could be a holographic dual matrix theory which generalises the IKKT matrix model to allow for conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Comments on Celestial CFT and $AdS_{3}$ String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, Ogawa et al. (2024) proposed a model for celestial conformal field theory (CFT) based on the $H_{3}^{+}$-Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) model. In this paper, we extend the model advanced by Ogawa et al. (2024), demonstrating how it can holographically generate tree-level MHV scattering amplitudes for both gluons and gravitons when analytically continued to the ultra-hyperbolic Klein space $\mathbf{R}_{2}^{2}$, thereby offering an alternative to celestial Liouville theory. We construct a holographic dictionary in which vertex operators and conformal primaries in celestial CFT are derived from their worldsheet counterparts in Euclidean $AdS_{3}$ (bosonic) string theory. Within this dictionary, we derive the celestial stress-energy tensor, compute the two- and three-point functions, and determine the celestial operator product expansion (OPE). Additionally, we derive a system of partial differential equations that characterises the celestial amplitudes of our model, utilising the Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations and worldsheet Ward identities. In the Appendix, we provide a concise introduction to the $H_{3}^{+}$-WZNW model, with emphasis on its connection to Euclidean $AdS_{3}$ string theory.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping line defects in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study correlators of insertions along 1/2 BPS line defects in the holographic dual to type IIB string theory in $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ with mixed Ramond-Ramond and Neveu Schwarz-Neveu Schwarz three-form flux. These defects break the symmetries of the bulk CFT$_2$ as $PSU(1,1|2)^2\times SO(4) \rightarrow PSU(1,1|2)\times SU(2)$, defining displacement and tilt supermultiplets. We focus on the two-, three- and four-point functions of these supermultiplets, which we compute using analytic conformal bootstrap up to next-to-leading order in their strong coupling expansion. We obtain a bootstrap result that only depends on two OPE coefficients. We perform a Witten diagram check of the bootstrap result, obtaining an holographic interpretation of the two OPE coefficients that are not constrained by the bootstrap procedure.</description>

      <title>Do neutrinos bend? Consequences of an ultralight gauge field as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18300v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ultralight gauge boson could address the missing cosmic dark matter, with its transverse modes contributing to a relevant component of the galactic halo today. We show that, in the presence of a coupling between the gauge boson and neutrinos, these transverse modes affect the propagation of neutrinos in the galactic core. Neutrinos emitted from galactic or extra-galactic supernovae could be delayed by $\delta t = \left(10^{-8}-10^1\right)\,$s for the gauge boson masses $m_{A'} = \left(10^{-23}-10^{-19}\right)\,$eV and the coupling with the neutrino $g= 10^{-27}-10^{-20}$. While we do not focus on a specific formation mechanism for the gauge boson as the dark matter in the early Universe, we comment on some possible realizations. We discuss model-dependent current bounds on the gauge coupling from fifth-force experiments, as well as future explorations involving supernovae neutrinos. We consider the concrete case of the DUNE facility, where the coupling can be tested down to $g \simeq 10^{-27}$ for neutrinos coming from a supernova event at a distance $d = 10\,$kpc from Earth.</description>

      <title>On the maximal superintegrability of strongly isochronous Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study strongly isochronous Hamiltonians that generate periodic time evolution with the same basic period for a dense set of initial values. We explain that all such Hamiltonians are maximally superintegrable, and show that if the system is subjected to Hamiltonian reduction based on a compact symmetry group and certain conditions are met, then the reduced Hamiltonian is strongly isochronous with the original basic period. We utilize these simple observations for demonstrating the maximal superintegrability of rational spin Calogero--Moser type models in confining harmonic potential.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Solutions in Non-Minimally Coupled Weyl Connection Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m black hole solutions are found in the context of a non-minimal matter-curvature coupling with the Weyl connection, both in vacuum and in the presence of a cosmological constant-like matter content. This special case of non-metricity leads to black hole solutions with non-vanishing scalar curvature. Moreover, vacuum Schwarzschild solutions differ from the ones from a constant curvature scenario in $f(R)$ theories with the appearance of a coefficient in the term linear in r and a corrected "cosmological constant". Non-vacuum Shwarzschild solutions have formally the same solutions as in the previous case with the exception being the physical interpretation of a cosmological constant as the source of the matter Lagrangian as not a simple reparametrization of the $f(R)$ description. Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m solutions cannot be found in vacuum, but only in the presence of matter fields, such that the solutions also differ from the constant curvature scenario in $f(R)$ theories by the term linear in r and corrected/dressed charge and cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Superfluids in expanding backgrounds and attractor times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the behavior of an out-of-equilibrium superfluid, composed of a $U(1)$ Goldstone mode coupled to hydrodynamic modes in a M\"uller-Israel-Stewart theory, in expanding backgrounds relevant to heavy ion collision experiments and cosmology. For suitable initial conditions, the evolution of the hydrodynamic variables leads to a change in the potential of the Goldstone mode, spontaneously breaking the symmetry. After some time, the condensate becomes small, leading the system evolution to be well described via hydrodynamic attractors for a timescale that we determine in Bjorken and Gubser flows. We define this new timescale as the \textit{attractor time} and show its dependence on initial conditions. In the case of the Gubser flow, we provide for the first time a complete description of the nonlinear evolution of the system, including a novel nonlinear regime of constant anisotropy not found in the Bjorken evolution. Finally, we consider the superfluid in the dynamical FLRW (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Roberston-Walker) background, where we observe a similar attractor behavior, dependent on the initial conditions, that at late times approaches a regime dominated by the condensate.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Higgs and deconfinement-Higgs transitions in three-dimensional $Z(2)$ LGT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine by numerical simulation the phase structure of the three-dimensional Abelian lattice gauge theory (LGT) with $Z(2)$ gauge fields coupled to $Z(2)$-valued Higgs fields. Concretely, we explore two different order parameters which are able to distinguish the three phases of the theory: (i) the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator used to discriminate between deconfinement and confinement/Higgs phases and (ii) the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator proposed recently to distinguish confinement and Higgs phases. The latter operator is an analog of the overlap Edwards-Anderson order parameter for spin-glasses. According to it, the Higgs phase is realized as a glassy phase of the gauge system. For this reason standard tricks for simulations of spin-glass phases are utilized in this work, namely tempered Monte Carlo and averaging over replicas. In addition, we also present results for a certain definition of distance between Higgs field configurations. Finally, we calculate various gauge-invariant correlation functions in order to extract the corresponding masses.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Topology of Kiselev-AdS Black Holes within f (R, T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological charge and the conditions for the existence of the photon sphere (PS) in Kiselev-AdS black holes within \(f(R, T)\) gravity. We employ two different methods based on Duan's topological current \(\phi\)-mapping theory viz analize of temperature and the generalized Helmholtz free energy methods to study the topological classes of our black hole. By considering the mentioned black hole, we discuss the critical and zero points (topological charges and topological numbers) for different parameters. Our findings reveal that the Kiselev parameter \(\omega\) and the \(f(R, T)\) gravity parameter \(\gamma\) influence the number of topological charges of black holes, leading to novel insights into topological classifications. We observe that for given values of the free parameters, there exist total topological charges (\(Q_{total} = -1\)) for T-method and total topological numbers (\(W = +1\)) for the generalized Helmholtz free energy method. Our research findings elucidate that, in contrast to the scenario where \(\omega = 1/3\), in other cases, increasing the parameter \(\gamma\) increases the number of total topological charges for the black hole. Interestingly, for the phantom field (\(\omega = -4/3\)), we observed that decreasing the parameter \(\gamma\) increases the number of topological charges. Additionally, we study the results for the photon sphere. The studied models clearly reveal that the simultaneous presence of \(\gamma\) and \(\omega\) effectively expands the permissible range for \(\gamma\). In other words, the model can exhibit black hole behavior over a larger domain. Additionally, it is evident that with the stepwise reduction of \(\omega\), the region covered by singularity also diminishes and becomes more restricted. However, An interesting point about all three ranges is the elimination of the forbidden region in this model.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional QCD at finite density and its 't Hooft-Veneziano limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact solution of one-dimensional lattice gauge theory at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential is reviewed for the gauge groups $G=Z(N),U(N),SU(N)$ for all values of $N$ and the number of fermion flavors $N_f$. Calculated are the partition function, free energy, the Polyakov loop expectation values, baryon density, quark condensate, meson and baryon correlation functions. Detailed analysis of the exact solutions is done for $N=2,3$ with one and two fermion flavors. In the large $N_f$ limit we uncover the Roberge-Weiss phase transition and discuss its remnants at finite $N_f$. In the case of $N_f$ degenerate flavors we also calculate 1) the large $N$ limit, 2) the large $N_f$ limit and 3) the 't Hooft-Veneziano limit of all models. The critical behavior of the models in these limits is studied and the phase structure is described in details. A comparison of all limits with $U(3)$ and $SU(3)$ QCD is also performed. In order to achieve these results we explore several representations of the partition function of one-dimensional QCD obtained and described in the text.</description>

      <title>The Landau Bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advocate a strategy of bootstrapping Feynman integrals from just knowledge of their singular behavior. This approach is complementary to other bootstrap programs, which exploit non-perturbative constraints such as unitarity, or amplitude-level constraints such as gauge invariance. We begin by studying where a Feynman integral can become singular, and the behavior it exhibits near these singularities. We then characterize the space of functions that we expect the integral to evaluate to, in order to formulate an appropriate ansatz. Finally, we derive constraints on where each singularity can appear in this ansatz, and use information about the expansion of the integral around singular points in order to determine the value of all remaining free coefficients. Throughout, we highlight how constraints that have previously only been derived for integrals with generic masses can be extended to integrals involving particles of equal or vanishing mass. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by bootstrapping a number of examples, including the four-point double box with a massive internal loop.</description>

      <title>Tidal response beyond vacuum General Relativity with a canonical definition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal effects on compact objects provide profound theoretical insights into the structure of the field equations, and are wonderful probes of the equation of state of matter, the nature of black holes and of the underlying theory of gravity. The natural framework for understanding tides is a perturbative scheme. Here, we point out ambiguities in determining tidal response functions within such a framework, which may lead to bias in constraining physical parameters with gravitational-wave observations if the computed quantities are not properly linked to observables. We propose a Canonical Tidal Response Function (CTRF) definition to compare values of tides in theories beyond vacuum General Relativity in a unified manner. As an example, we provide black hole tidal response functions, including both conservative and dissipative pieces, in various theories of gravity. Tidal dissipation Love numbers for black holes are derived here for the first time in most of the non-Einsteinian theories considered in this paper.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct an action of the fundamental groupoid of the Swiss-cheese operad (the parenthesized permutation and braid operad) on $C_1$-cofinite module categories of a vertex operator algebra. Based on this result, we show that when a boundary conformal field theory has locally $C_1$-cofinite chiral symmetry, all operator product expansions converge absolutely on open regions in the configuration spaces of the upper half-plane and define real analytic functions (the correlation functions), independent of orders and parentheses of OPEs.</description>

      <title>Slow it down: axion-photon conversion down to the non-relativistic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a magnetic field, axions can convert into photons and viceversa. The phenomenology of the conversion is captured by a system of two coupled Klein-Gordon equations, which, assuming that the axion is relativistic, is usually recast into a pair of first order Schr\"odinger-like equations. In such a limit, focusing on a constant magnetic field and plasma frequency, the equations admit an exact analytic solution. The relativistic limit significantly simplifies the calculations; therefore, it is widely used in phenomenological applications. In this work, we discuss how to evaluate the axion-photon system evolution without relying on such relativistic approximation. In particular, we give an exact analytical solution, valid for any axion energy, in the case that both the magnetic field and plasma frequency are constant. Moreover, we devise an analytic perturbative expansion that allows for tracking the conversion probability in a slightly inhomogeneous magnetic field or plasma frequency, whose characteristic scale of variation is much larger than the typical axion-photon oscillation length. Finally, we discuss a case of resonant axion-photon conversion giving useful simplified formulae that might be directly applied to dark matter axions converting in neutron star magnetospheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion generative models transform noise into data by inverting a process that progressively adds noise to data samples. Inspired by concepts from the renormalization group in physics, which analyzes systems across different scales, we revisit diffusion models by exploring three key design aspects: 1) the choice of representation in which the diffusion process operates (e.g. pixel-, PCA-, Fourier-, or wavelet-basis), 2) the prior distribution that data is transformed into during diffusion (e.g. Gaussian with covariance $\Sigma$), and 3) the scheduling of noise levels applied separately to different parts of the data, captured by a component-wise noise schedule. Incorporating the flexibility in these choices, we develop a unified framework for diffusion generative models with greatly enhanced design freedom. In particular, we introduce soft-conditioning models that smoothly interpolate between standard diffusion models and autoregressive models (in any basis), conceptually bridging these two approaches. Our framework opens up a wide design space which may lead to more efficient training and data generation, and paves the way to novel architectures integrating different generative approaches and generation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</description>

Abstract: We construct a concrete model of Horndeski bounce with strong gravity in the past. Within this model we show that the correct spectra of cosmological perturbations may be generated at early contracting epoch, with mild fine-tuning ensuring that the scalar spectral tilt $n_S$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with observations. The smallness of $r$ is governed by the smallness of the scalar sound speed. Arbitrarily small values of $r$ are forbidden in our setup because of the strong coupling in the past. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to generate perturbations in a controllable way, i.e. in the regime where the background evolution and perturbations are legitimately described within classical field theory and weakly coupled quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a general theory of k-inlation and find out, that it may be in strong coupling regime. We derive accurate conditions of classical description validity using unitarity bounds for this model. Next, we choose simple toy model of k-inflation and obtain the explicit condition, which guarantees that the generation of perturbations is performed in a controllable way, i.e the exit from the effective horizon occurs in the weak coupling regime. However, for the same toy model the corresponding experimental bounds on a non-linear parameter $f^{\text{equil}}_{\text{NL}}$ associated with non-Gaussianities of the curvature perturbation provide much stronger constraint than strong coupling absence condition. Nevertheless, for other known models of inflation this may not be the case. Generally, one should always check if classical description is legitimate for chosen models of inflation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of spinodal decomposition in holographic superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear dynamical evolution of spinodal decomposition in a first-order superfluid phase transition using a simple holographic model in the probe limit. We first confirm the linear stability analysis based on quasinormal modes and verify the existence of a critical length scale related to a gradient instability -- negative speed of sound squared -- of the superfluid sound mode, which is a consequence of a negative thermodynamic charge susceptibility. We present a comparison between our case and the standard Cahn-Hilliard equation for spinodal instability, in which a critical length scale can be also derived based on a diffusive instability. We then perform several numerical tests which include the nonlinear time evolution directly from an unstable state and fast quenches from a stable to an unstable state in the spinodal region. Our numerical results provide a real time description of spinodal decomposition and phase separation in one and two spatial dimensions. We reveal the existence of four different stages in the dynamical evolution, and characterize their main properties. Finally, we investigate the strength of dynamical heterogeneity using the spatial variance of the local chemical potential and we correlate the latter to other features of the dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>Weaving the (AdS) spaces with partial entanglement entropy threads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we propose a general scheme for reconstructing bulk geometric quantities in a static pure AdS background using the partial entanglement entropy (PEE), a measure of the entanglement structure on the boundary CFT. The PEE between any two points $\mathcal{I}(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$ serves as the fundamental building block of the PEE structure. Following \cite{Lin:2023rbd}, we geometrize any two-point PEE $\mathcal{I}(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$ by the bulk geodesic connecting two boundary points $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$, which we call the PEE thread, with the density of the threads determined by the boundary PEE structure. In the AdS bulk, the set of all the PEE threads forms a continuous ``network'', which we call the PEE network.
  In this paper, we show that the density of the PEE threads passing through any bulk point is exactly $1/(4G)$. Based on this observation we give a complete reformulation of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for a generic boundary region in general dimensional Poincar\'e AdS space. More explicitly, for any static boundary region $A$, the homologous surface $\Sigma_{A}$ that has the minimal number of intersections with the bulk PEE network is exactly the RT surface of $A$, and the minimal number of intersections reproduces the holographic entanglement entropy. The reconstruction for the area of bulk geometric quantities by counting the number of intersections with the bulk PEE network applies to generic bulk geometric quantities. Interestingly, this reconstruction indicates a pure geometric statement, which is exactly the so-called \emph{Crofton formula} in Poincar\'e AdS.</description>

      <title>Comb Channel Lightcone Bootstrap II: Triple-Twist Anomalous Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We advance the multipoint lightcone bootstrap and compute anomalous dimensions of triple-twist operators at large spin. In contrast to the well-studied double-twist operators, triple-twist primaries are highly degenerate so that their anomalous dimension is encoded in a matrix. At large spin, the degeneracy becomes infinite and the matrix becomes an integral operator. We compute this integral operator by studying a particular non-planar crossing equation for six-point functions of scalar operators in a lightcone limit. The bootstrap analysis is based on new formulas for six-point lightcone blocks in the comb-channel. For a consistency check of our results, we compare them to perturbative computations in the epsilon expansion of $\phi^3$ and $\phi^4$ theory. In both cases, we find perfect agreement between perturbative results and bootstrap predictions. As a byproduct of our studies, we complement previous results on triple-twist anomalous dimensions in scalar $\phi^3$ and $\phi^4$ theory at first and second order in epsilon, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We review aspects of the Hartle-Hawking no boundary geometry in the context of slow roll inflation. We give an analytic approximation to the geometry and we explain the rationale for the proposal. We also explain why it gives a prediction for the curvature of the universe that is in disagreement with observations and give a quick review of proposed ways to resolve that disagreement.</description>

      <title>Non-holomorphic modular forms from zeta generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-holomorphic modular forms built from iterated integrals of holomorphic modular forms for SL$(2,\mathbb Z)$ known as equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. A special subclass of them furnishes an equivalent description of the modular graph forms appearing in the low-energy expansion of string amplitudes at genus one. Notably the Fourier expansion of modular graph forms contains single-valued multiple zeta values. We deduce the appearance of products and higher-depth instances of multiple zeta values in equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals, and ultimately modular graph forms, from the appearance of simpler odd Riemann zeta values. This analysis relies on so-called zeta generators which act on certain non-commutative variables in the generating series of the iterated integrals. From an extension of these non-commutative variables we incorporate iterated integrals involving holomorphic cusp forms into our setup and use them to construct the modular completion of triple Eisenstein integrals. Our work represents a fully explicit realisation of the modular graph forms within Brown's framework of equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals and reveals structural analogies between single-valued period functions appearing in genus zero and one string amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized global symmetries, in particular non-invertible and categorical symmetries, have become a focal point in the recent study of quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we investigate aspects of symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs) and anomalies of non-invertible symmetries for 2D QFTs from a string theory perspective. Our primary focus is on an infinite class of 2D QFTs engineered on D1-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau 4-fold singularities. We derive 3D SymTFTs from the topological sector of IIB supergravity and discuss the resulting 2D QFTs, which can be intrinsically relative or absolute. For intrinsically relative QFTs, we propose a sufficient condition for them to exist. For absolute QFTs, we show that they exhibit non-invertible symmetries with an elegant brane origin. Furthermore, we find that these non-invertible symmetries can suffer from anomalies, which we discuss from a top-down perspective. Explicit examples are provided, including theories for $Y^{(p,k)}(\mathbb{P}^2)$, $Y^{(2,0)}(\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1)$, and $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_4$ geometries.</description>

      <title>Decoherence by warm horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Danielson, Satishchandran, and Wald (DSW) have shown that quantum superpositions held outside of Killing horizons will decohere at a steady rate. This occurs because of the inevitable radiation of soft photons (gravitons), which imprint a electromagnetic (gravitational) ``which-path'' memory onto the horizon. Rather than appealing to this global description, an experimenter ought to also have a local description for the cause of decoherence. One might intuitively guess that this is just the bombardment of Hawking/Unruh radiation on the system, however simple calculations challenge this idea -- the same superposition held in a finite temperature inertial laboratory does not decohere at the DSW rate. In this work we provide a local description of the decoherence by mapping the DSW set-up onto a worldline-localized model resembling an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector. We present an interpretation in terms of random local forces which do not sufficiently self-average over long times. Using the Rindler horizon as a concrete example we clarify the crucial role of temperature, and show that the Unruh effect is the only quantum mechanical effect underlying these random forces. A general lesson is that for an environment which induces Ohmic friction on the central system (as one gets from the classical Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force, in an accelerating frame) the fluctuation-dissipation theorem implies that when this environment is at finite temperature it will cause steady decoherence on the central system. Our results agree with DSW and provide the complementary local perspective.</description>

      <title>Supergeometric Quantum Effective Action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supergeometric Quantum Field Theories (SG-QFTs) are theories that go beyond the standard supersymmetric framework, since they allow for general scalar-fermion field transformations on the configuration space of a supermanifold, without requiring an equality between bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. After revisiting previous considerations, we extend them by calculating the one-loop effective action of minimal SG-QFTs that feature non-zero fermionic curvature in two and four spacetime dimensions. By employing an intuitive approach to the Schwinger-DeWitt heat-kernel technique and a novel field-space generalised Clifford algebra, we derive the ultra-violet structure of characteristic effective-field-theory (EFT) operators up to four spacetime derivatives that emerge at the one-loop order and are of physical interest. Upon minimising the impact of potential ambiguities due to the so-called multiplicative anomalies, we find that the EFT interactions resulting from the one-loop supergeometric effective action are manifestly diffeomorphically invariant in configuration space. The extension of our approach to evaluating higher-loops of the supergeometric quantum effective action is described. The emerging landscape of theoretical and phenomenological directions for further research of SG-QFTs is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a recently proposed effective field theory describing electromagnetically or gravitationally interacting massive particles in an expansion about their mass ratio, also known as the self-force (SF) expansion. By integrating out the deviation of the heavy particle about its inertial trajectory, we obtain an effective action whose only degrees of freedom are the lighter particle together with the photon or graviton, all propagating in a Coulomb or Schwarzschild background. The 0SF dynamics are described by the usual background field method, which at 1SF is supplemented by a "recoil operator" that encodes the wobble of the heavy particle, and similarly computable corrections appearing at 2SF and higher. Our formalism exploits the fact that the analytic expressions for classical backgrounds and particle trajectories encode dynamical information to all orders in the couplings, and from them we extract multiloop integrands for perturbative scattering. As a check, we study the two-loop classical scattering of scalar particles in electromagnetism and gravity, verifying known results. We then present new calculations for the two-loop classical scattering of dyons, and of particles interacting with an additional scalar or vector field coupling directly to the lighter particle but only gravitationally to the heavier particle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordinary-derivative (second-derivative) Lagrangian formulation of classical conformal Yang-Mills field in the (A)dS space of six, eight, and ten dimensions is developed. For such conformal field, we develop two gauge invariant Lagrangian formulations which we refer to as generic formulation and decoupled formulation. In both formulations, the usual Yang-Mills field is accompanied by additional vector and scalar fields where the scalar fields are realized as Stueckelberg fields. In the generic formulation, the usual Yang-Mills field is realized as a primary field, while the additional vector fields are realized as auxiliary fields. In the decoupled formulation, the usual Yang-Mills field is realized as massless field, while the additional vector fields together with the Stueckelberg are realized as massive fields. Some massless/massive fields appear with the wrong sign of kinetic terms, hence demonstrating explicitly that the considered models are not unitary. The use of embedding space method allows us to treat the isometry symmetries of (A)dS space manifestly and obtain conformal transformations of fields in a relatively straightforward way. By accompanying each vector field by the respective gauge parameter, we introduce an extended gauge algebra. Levy-Maltsev decomposition of such algebra is noted. Use of the extended gauge algebra setup allows us to present concise form for the Lagrangian and gauge transformations of the conformal Yang-Mills field. Higher-derivative representation of the Lagrangian is also obtained.</description>

Abstract: I propose a generalization of the Liouville action which corresponds to the Nambu-Goto string like the usual Liouville action corresponds to the Polyakov string. The two differ by higher-derivative terms which are negligible classically but revive quantumly. An equivalence with the four-derivative action suggests that the Nambu-Goto string in four dimensions can be described by the (4,3) minimal model analogously to the critical Ising model on a dynamical lattice. While critical indices are the same as in the usual Liouville theory, the domain of applicability becomes broader.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study black hole solutions in double field theory. In the first part, we introduce a solution-generating method and classify black hole solutions into three categories in standard double field theory. To solve the problem of double time, we utilize space/time split double field theory in the second part to derive black hole solutions. By introducing a cosmological constant and imposing the strong constraint, our findings indicate that when considering the entire doubled spacetime, the curvature signifies a generalized AdS vacuum. However, in the subspace of the entire spacetime, black holes and curvature singularities emerge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate equivariant localization of the gravitational on-shell action in odd dimensions, focusing on five-dimensional ungauged supergravity. We analyze the conditions for cancellation of boundary terms, so that the full action integral is given in terms of the odd-dimensional analog of the nuts and bolts of Gibbons-Hawking. We specialize to supersymmetric configurations with an additional ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry preserving the supercharge and provide a formula for the localized on-shell action. We construct asymptotically flat Euclidean supersymmetric non-extremal solutions with two independent rotations and an arbitrary number of electric charges, providing black hole saddles of the gravitational path integral that computes a supersymmetric index, and evaluate their action equivariantly. We find that these Euclidean saddles interpolate between supersymmetric extremal black holes and two-center horizonless microstate geometries. The interpolation involves dialing the temperature and implementing different analytic continuations. The corresponding on-shell action does not depend on temperature but is affected by the analytic continuations.</description>

      <title>Unitary k-designs from random number-conserving quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local random circuits scramble efficiently and accordingly have a range of applications in quantum information and quantum dynamics. With a global $U(1)$ charge however, the scrambling ability is reduced; for example, such random circuits do not generate the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. We establish two results using the statistical mechanics of $k$-fold replicated circuits. First, we show that finite moments cannot distinguish the ensemble that local random circuits generate from the Haar ensemble on the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. Specifically, the circuits form a $k_c$-design with $k_c = O(L^d)$ for a system in $d$ spatial dimensions with linear dimension $L$. Second, for $k &lt; k_c$, we derive bounds on the depth $\tau$ required for the circuit to converge to an approximate $k$-design. The depth is lower bounded by diffusion $k L^2 \ln(L) \lesssim \tau$. In contrast, without number conservation $\tau \sim \text{poly}(k) L$. The convergence of the circuit ensemble is controlled by the low-energy properties of a frustration-free quantum statistical model which spontaneously breaks $k$ $U(1)$ symmetries. We conjecture that the associated Goldstone modes set the spectral gap for arbitrary spatial and qudit dimensions, leading to an upper bound $\tau \lesssim k L^{d+2}$.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum many-body systems in the presence of an exotic antiunitary translation or inversion symmetry involving time reversal. Based on a symmetry-twisting method and spectrum robustness, we propose that a half-integer spin chain that respects any of these two antiunitary crystalline symmetries in addition to the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ global spin-rotation symmetry must either be gapless or possess degenerate ground states. This explains the gaplessness of a class of chiral spin models not indicated by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem and its known extensions. Moreover, we present symmetry classes with minimal sets of generators that give nontrivial Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, argued by the bulk-boundary correspondence in 2D symmetry-protected topological phases as well as lattice homotopy. Our results for detecting the ingappability of 1D quantum magnets from the interplay between spin-rotation symmetries and magnetic space groups are applicable to systems with a broader class of spin interactions, including Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and triple-product interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography of helicity states for general scattering processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum tomography has become an indispensable tool in order to compute the density matrix $\rho$ of quantum systems in Physics. Recently, it has further gained importance as a basic step to test entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities in High-Energy Particle Physics. In this work, we present the theoretical framework for reconstructing the helicity quantum initial state of a general scattering process. In particular, we perform an expansion of $\rho$ over the irreducible tensor operators $\{T^L_M\}$ and compute the corresponding coefficients uniquely by averaging, under properly chosen Wigner D-matrices weights, the angular distribution data of the final particles. Besides, we provide the explicit angular dependence of both the normalised differential cross section and the generalised production matrix $\Gamma$. Finally, we re-derive all our previous results from a quantum-information perspective using the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formalism and we obtain in addition simple analytical expressions for the Wigner $P$ and $Q$ symbols.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Fractalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Adopting quadratic fermionic models on Sierpinski carpet, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic correction for area law in the scaling of entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, different from the fractal structure of the lattice, we observe the emergence of a novel self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Meanwhile, as the direct consequence of the entanglement fractal and beyond a single scaling behavior of entanglement contour in translation-invariant systems, we identify two distinct scaling behaviors in the entanglement contour of fractal systems. For gapped ground states, we observe that the entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.</description>

      <title>NEC violation in $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity in the context of a non-canonical theory via modified Raychaudhuri equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop the Raychaudhuri equation in $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity in the setting of a non-canonical theory, namely K-essence theory. We solve the modified Raychaudhuri equation for the additive form of $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$, which is $f_{1}(\bar{R})+f_{2}(\bar{T})$. For this solution, we employ two different scale factors to give two types of $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ solutions. The ongoing debate between Fisher et. al. and Harko et. al. in 2020 regarding the additive form of $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ may provide a resolution within the modified $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity theory. By conducting a viability test and analyzing energy conditions, we have determined that in the first scenario, the null energy condition (NEC) is violated between two regions where the NEC is satisfied. Additionally, we have observed that this violation of the NEC exhibits a symmetric property during the phase transition. These observations indicate that bouncing events may occur as a result of the symmetrical violation of the NEC during the expansion of the universe. Moreover, this model indicates that resonant-type quantum tunneling may take place during the period when the NEC is violated. The findings of NEC violation through the power law of scale factor may have empirical relevance in contemporary observations. In the second scenario, our model indicates that the strong energy condition is violated, but the NEC and weak energy conditions are satisfied. The effective energy density decreases and is positive, while the effective pressure and equation of state parameters are negative. This suggests that the universe is expanding with acceleration and is dominated by dark energy.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of vacuum pair production in uniform electric fields revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of electron-positron pair production from vacuum in the presence of a uniform time-dependent electric field of arbitrary polarization. Taking into account the interaction with the external classical background in a nonperturbative manner, we quantize the electron-positron field and derive a system of ten quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) showing that the previously-used QKEs are incorrect once the external field rotates in space. We employ then the Wigner-function formalism of the field quantization and establish a direct connection between the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) approach to investigating the vacuum pair-production process and the QKEs. We provide a self-contained description of the two theoretical frameworks rigorously proving their equivalence and present an exact one-to-one correspondence between the kinetic functions involved within the two techniques. Special focus is placed on the analysis of the spin effects in the final particle distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the charge and heat transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter using a novel approximation method within the quasiparticle model. Utilizing the novel collision integrals for both the relaxation time approximation (RTA) and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) models, we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to estimate the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity of the medium. We have investigated the temperature dependence of these transport coefficients. We have also provided a comparison between our findings and those of the standard RTA and standard BGK models. Further, we have explored the temperature dependence of the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parametric integration with hyperlogarithms so far has been successfully used in problems of high energy physics (HEP) and critical statics. In this work, for the first time, it is applied to a problem of critical dynamics, namely, a stochastic model of developed turbulence in high-dimensional spaces, which has a propagator that is non-standard with respect to the HEP: $(-i \omega + \nu k^2)^{-1}$. Adaptation of the hyperlogarithm method is carried out by choosing a proper renormalization scheme and considering an effective dimension of the space. Analytical calculation of the renormalization group functions is performed up to the fourth order of the perturbation theory, $\varepsilon$-expansion of the critical exponent $\omega$ responsible for the infrared stability of the fixed point is obtained.</description>

      <title>Observational test for $f(Q)$ gravity with weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we confront a class of $f(Q)$ gravity models with observational data of galaxy-galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider the $f(Q)$ gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with General Relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter $\alpha$. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting the spherically symmetric solutions which correspond to the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameter in a two-fold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to $r^{-2}$. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective Excess Surface Density (ESD) profile. After that, we employ the group catalog and shape catalog from the SDSS DR7 for the lens and source samples respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using the MCMC. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive $\alpha=1.202^{+0.277}_{-0.179}\times 10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-2}$ at 1 $\sigma$ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by applying the AIC and BIC information criteria. Our results indicate that the $f(Q)$ corrections alongside off-center effects yield a scenario that is slightly favored.</description>

      <title>Gluing together Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Mechanics: a look at the Bell-CHSH inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bell-CHSH inequality in the vacuum state of a relativistic scalar quantum field is revisited by making use of the Hilbert space ${\cal H} \otimes {\cal H}_{AB}$, where ${\cal H}$ and ${\cal H}_{AB}$ stand, respectively, for the Hilbert space of the scalar field and of a generic bipartite quantum mechanical system. The construction of Hermitian, field-dependent, dichotomic operators is devised as well as the Bell-CHSH inequality. Working out the $AB$ part of the inequality, the resulting Bell-CHSH correlation function for the quantum field naturally emerges from unitary Weyl operators. Furthermore, introducing a Jaynes-Cummings type Hamiltonian accounting for the interaction between the scalar field and a pair of qubits, the quantum corrections to the Bell-CHSH inequality in the vacuum state of the scalar field are evaluated till the second order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Extreme softening of QCD phase transition under weak acceleration: first principle Monte Carlo results for gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of gluon plasma subjected to a weak acceleration using first-principle numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We use the Luttinger (Tolman-Ehrenfest) correspondence between temperature gradient and gravitational field to impose acceleration in imaginary time formalism. Under acceleration, the system resides in global thermal equilibrium. Our results indicate that even the weakest acceleration up to $a \simeq 27$ MeV drastically softens the deconfinement phase transition, converting the first-order phase transition of a static system to a soft crossover for accelerating gluons. The accelerating environment can be relevant to the first moments of the early Universe and the initial glasma regime of relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, our results imply that the acceleration, if present, may also inhibit the detection of the thermodynamic phase transition from quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting scalar dark matter around binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves can provide crucial insights about the environments in which black holes live. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations to study the behaviour of self-interacting scalar (wave-like) dark matter clouds accreting onto isolated and binary black holes. We find that repulsive self-interactions smoothen the ``spike'' of an isolated black hole and saturate the density. Attractive self-interactions enhance the growth and result in more cuspy profiles, but can become unstable and undergo explosions akin to the superradiant bosenova that reduce the local cloud density. We quantify the impact of self-interactions on an equal-mass black hole merger by computing the dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal for a range of couplings. We find that repulsive self-interactions saturate the density of the cloud, thereby reducing the dephasing. For attractive self-interactions, the dephasing may be larger, but if these interactions dominate prior to the merger, the dark matter can undergo bosenova during the inspiral phase, disrupting the cloud and subsequently reducing the dephasing.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>
