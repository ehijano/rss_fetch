      <title>Impact of Imprecision of the Time Delay on Imaging Result in Confocal Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confocal microwave imaging (CMI) algorithm, which is used in radar imaging, has been applied to microwave medical imaging (MMI) [1, 2]. In MMI, the diseased region to be imaged has different electromagnetic characteristics from that of the surroundings. Time -domain MMI system often radiates an ultra-wideband pulse and then collect the backscatter signals with an antenna array. The time delay is then compensated for every unit in the array according to the time flight to each focal point within the region of interest. The compensated signals are finally summed to calculate the pixel value of each focal point. This process is repeated to achieve the value for all focal points in a 3D space to reconstruct the image. Since the method is only constrained in the time domain, the complexity is minimal, and an image can be obtained usually in few seconds. This paper discusses the robustness of CMI in MMI. Specifically, we analyzed the variation of image contrast as errors occur in the time-delay calculation. A simplified model of breast cancer detection was implemented to study the relationship between time-shift errors and the impact on images, quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Development of a 3D-printed canine head phantom for veterinary radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop the Ultimate Phantom Dog for Orthovoltage Glioma Treatment (UPDOG), an anatomically-correct phantom which mimics a dog's head, for quality assurance (QA) of kilovoltage (kV) radiotherapy treatments.
  Methods: A computed tomography (CT) scan of a canine glioma patient was segmented into bone and soft tissue using 3DSlicer. The segments were converted to stereolithographic (STL) files and smoothed in Fusion360. A slit to accommodate a radiochromic film (RCF) was added at the location of the glioma tumor. UPDOG was 3D printed on a polyjet printer using VeroUltraWhite ($\rho$ = 1.19-1.20 g/cm\textsuperscript{3}) for the bone and Agilus30 ($\rho$ = 1.14-1.15 g/cm\textsuperscript{3}) for the soft tissue. CT scans of UPDOG were acquired on a clinical CT scanner. An LD-V1 RCF was inserted into UPDOG and irradiated with a kV x-ray source from two angles. The delivered dose to the RCF was compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations performed in TOPAS.
  Results: The bone and soft tissue segments in UPDOG were mimicked the patient anatomy well with tube voltage-dependent CT numbers. The contrast in HU was of 49, 47 and 50 HU for the 80, 100, and 120 kVp scans, respectively, sufficient for anatomy visualization. The irradiations delivered a maximum dose to RCF of 284 mGy which was compared to the results of MC simulations using a depth dose curve and central-axis (CAX) beam profiles. The mean difference in CAX profiles and PDD between RCF and MC results was 15.9\% and 2.3\%, respectively.
  Conclusions: We have demonstrated that UPDOG is a useful QA tool for kV canine radiotherapy. UPDOG successfully anatomically mimicked the dog anatomy, with a reduced but sufficient bone contrast. We showed that dose delivered to a canine glioma with kV x-rays can be successfully measured with an RCF positioned at the tumor location.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Coupling Coil System: A Novel Radiofrequency Coil Solution for MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of radiofrequency (RF) coils has a significant impact on the quality and speed of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Consequently, rigid coils with attached cables are commonly employed to achieve optimal SNR performance and parallel imaging capability. However, since the adoption of MRI in clinical imaging, both patients and doctors have long suffered from the poor examination experience and physical strain caused by the bulky housings and cumbersome cables of traditional coils. This paper presents a new architectural concept, the Near-Field Coupling (NFC) coil system, which integrates a pickup coil array within the magnet with an NFC coil worn by the patient. In contrast to conventional coils, the NFC coil system obviates the necessity for bed-mounted connectors. It provides a lightweight, cost-effective solution that enhances patient comfort and supports disposable, custom designs for the NFC coils. The paper also derives the SNR expression for the NFC coil system, proposes two key design principles, and demonstrates the system's potential in SNR and parallel imaging through an implementation case.</description>

      <title>Controlling sharpness, SNR and SAR for 3D FSE at 7T by end-to-end learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To non-heuristically identify dedicated variable flip angle (VFA) schemes optimized for the point-spread function (PSF) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multiple tissues in 3D FSE sequences with very long echo trains at 7T. Methods: The proposed optimization considers predefined SAR constraints and target contrast using an end-to-end learning framework. The cost function integrates components for contrast fidelity (SNR) and a penalty term to minimize image blurring (PSF) for multiple tissues. By adjusting the weights of PSF/SNR cost-function components, PSF- and SNR-optimized VFAs were derived and tested in vivo using both the open-source Pulseq standard on two volunteers as well as vendor protocols on a 7T MRI system with parallel transmit extension on three volunteers. Results: PSF-optimized VFAs resulted in significantly reduced image blurring compared to standard VFAs for T2w while maintaining contrast fidelity. Small white and gray matter structures, as well as blood vessels, are more visible with PSF-optimized VFAs. Quantitative analysis shows that the optimized VFA yields 50% less deviation from a sinc-like reference PSF than the standard VFA. The SNR-optimized VFAs yielded images with significantly improved SNR in a white and gray matter region relative to standard (81.2\pm18.4 vs. 41.2\pm11.5, respectively) as trade-off for elevated image blurring. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of end-to-end learning frameworks to optimize VFA schemes in very long echo trains for 3D FSE acquisition at 7T in terms of PSF and SNR. It paves the way for fast and flexible adjustment of the trade-off between PSF and SNR for 3D FSE.</description>

      <title>Computer-mediated therapies for stroke rehabilitation: a systematic review and meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of different forms of virtual reality (VR) treatments as either immersive virtual reality (IVR) or non-immersive virtual reality (NIVR) in comparison to conventional therapy (CT) in improving physical and psychological status among stroke patients. METHODS: The literature search was conducted on seven databases. ACM Digital Library, Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Scopus. The effect sizes of the main outcomes were calculated using Cohen's d. Pooled results were used to present an overall estimate of the treatment effect using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 22 randomized controlled trials were evaluated. 3 trials demonstrated that immersive virtual reality improved upper limb activity, function and activity of daily life in a way comparable to CT. 18 trials showed that NIVR had similar benefits to CT for upper limb activity and function, balance and mobility, activities of daily living and participation. A comparison between the different forms of VR showed that IVR may be more beneficial than NIVR for upper limb training and activities of daily life. CONCLUSIONS: This study found out that IVR therapies may be more effective than NIVR but not CT to improve upper limb activity, function, and daily life activities. However, there is no evidence of the durability of IVR treatment. More research involving studies with larger samples is needed to assess the long-term effects and promising benefits of immersive virtual reality technology.</description>

      <title>electronCT -- An Imaging Technique Using Very-high Energy Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronCT technique is an imaging method based on the multiple Coulomb scattering of relativistic electrons and has potential applications in medical and industrial imaging. It utilizes a pencil beam of electrons in the very high energy electron (VHEE, 50-250 MeV) range and a single detection layer for the determination of the beam profile. The technique constitutes a projectional, two-dimensional imaging method and thus also qualifies for the tomographic reconstruction of samples. Given the simplicity of the technical setup and its location behind the sample, the electronCT technique has potential synergies with VHEE radiotherapy, making use of the same electron source for both treatment and diagnostics and thus being a candidate for in-situ imaging and patient localization. At the same time, several technical challenges arise from the measurement technique when applied for the imaging of living beings. Measurements performed at the ARES linear particle accelerator at an electron energy of 155 MeV using a mouse phantom and a Timepix3 silicon pixel detector assembly demonstrate the feasibility of this technique. Both projectional and tomographic reconstructions are presented and the potential and limits of the technology are discussed.</description>

      <title>Physics-Regularized Multi-Modal Image Assimilation for Brain Tumor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical models in the form of partial differential equations represent an important prior for many under-constrained problems. One example is tumor treatment planning, which heavily depends on accurate estimates of the spatial distribution of tumor cells in a patient's anatomy. Medical imaging scans can identify the bulk of the tumor, but they cannot reveal its full spatial distribution. Tumor cells at low concentrations remain undetectable, for example, in the most frequent type of primary brain tumors, glioblastoma. Deep-learning-based approaches fail to estimate the complete tumor cell distribution due to a lack of reliable training data. Most existing works therefore rely on physics-based simulations to match observed tumors, providing anatomically and physiologically plausible estimations. However, these approaches struggle with complex and unknown initial conditions and are limited by overly rigid physical models. In this work, we present a novel method that balances data-driven and physics-based cost functions. In particular, we propose a unique discretization scheme that quantifies the adherence of our learned spatiotemporal tumor and brain tissue distributions to their corresponding growth and elasticity equations. This quantification, serving as a regularization term rather than a hard constraint, enables greater flexibility and proficiency in assimilating patient data than existing models. We demonstrate improved coverage of tumor recurrence areas compared to existing techniques on real-world data from a cohort of patients. The method holds the potential to enhance clinical adoption of model-driven treatment planning for glioblastoma.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Ultrasound for Periodontal Soft Tissue Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodontal diseases affect 45.9\% of adults aged 30 or older in the United States. Current diagnostic methods for clinical assessment of these diseases are visual examination and bleeding on probing that are subjective, qualitative, and/or invasive. Thus, there is a critical need for research on noninvasive modalities for periodontal tissue characterization. Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) has shown promising results in noninvasive characterization of various soft tissues; however, it has not been used in periodontics. This study is among initial investigations into the application of QUS for periodontal tissue characterization in the literature. Here, QUS analysis of oral soft tissues (alveolar mucosa and gingiva) is performed in an in vivo animal study including 10 swine. US scanning was performed at the first molar of all four oral quadrants, resulting in a total of 40 scans. We investigated first order speckle statistics of oral tissues by using the two-parameter Burr (power-law b and scale factor l) and Nakagami models (shape factor m and scale factor $\alpha$). Parametric imaging of these parameters was created using a sliding kernel method sweeping regions of interest with a kernel size of 10 wavelengths from a phantom study. Results showed that the difference between gingiva and alveolar mucosa were statistically significant using Burr and Nakagami parameters ($p-value&lt;0.0001$). The Burr b and Nakagami m were higher in gingiva while the Burr l and Nakagami {$\alpha$} were higher in alveolar mucosa. Findings from QUS analyses agreed with observation from histology that showed denser stains for gingiva. Linear classifications of these tissues using 2D parameter spaces of the Burr and Nakagami models resulted in a segmentation accuracy of 93.51\% and 90.91\%, respectively. We propose that QUS holds promising potentials as an augmented tool for disease diagnosis in periodontology.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are a key focus of current research in nuclear physics. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo \b{eta}+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes or incorrect calibration of the planning CT. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>
