      <title>Quasar lifetime measurements from extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae at $z\sim 6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of billion-solar-mass black holes hosted in luminous quasars within the first gigayear of cosmic history poses a challenge to our understanding of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. The problem is further exacerbated by the very short quasar lifetimes of $t_{\rm Q}\lesssim 10^6$ years, as derived from the extent of their proximity zone (PZ) sizes observed in the quasars' rest-UV spectra. However, the quasar lifetime estimates based on the extents of the proximity zones may be underestimated, as time-variable obscuration effects might have limited the quasars' emission along our sightline in the past. In this work, we present independent quasar lifetime measurements for six quasars at $z \sim 6$ leveraging the extended nebular emission perpendicular to our line-of-sight. We use observations from the Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to search for extended Ly$\alpha$ emission in the circumgalactic medium around quasars with small proximity zones and estimate their lifetimes as the light travel time between the SMBH and the outer edge of the nebula. We find agreement between the independent lifetime estimates. For one object we find a proximate absorption system prematurely truncating the extent of the quasar's proximity zone, which thus results in an expected discrepancy between the lifetime estimates. Our results provide further evidence that the quasars' current accretion episode has only recently begun, challenging our models of SMBH growth.</description>

      <title>Metallicity of Active Galactic Nuclei from ultraviolet and optical emission lines I: Carbon abundance dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallicity ($Z$) estimates based on ultraviolet (UV) emission lines from the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been found to differ from those derived from optical lines. However, the origin of this discrepancy ($ZR$) remains poorly understood. To investigate the source of $ZR$, we compiled from the literature the fluxes of narrow near-UV ($1000 &lt; \lambda(\angstrom) &lt; 2000)$ and optical ($3000 &lt; \lambda(\angstrom) &lt; 7000)$ emission line measurements for a sample of 11 AGNs (9 at $z&lt;0.4$ and 2 at $z\sim2.4$). Metallicity values for our sample were derived using a semi-empirical calibration based on the $C43$=log[(\ion{C{iv}$\lambda$1549+\ion{C{iii}]$\lambda$1909)/\ion{He}{ii}$\lambda$1640] emission-line ratio and compared with those obtained via direct measurement of the electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$-method) and via calibrations based on optical emission-lines. The source of the discrepancy was investigated in terms of the ionization parameter ($U$), electron density ($N_{\rm e}$), and carbon abundance (C/H). We found a weak correlation between $ZR$, $U$ and $N_{\rm e}$. However, a moderate correlation was observed between $ZR$ and direct estimates of C/H, suggesting that the previously assumed (C/O)-$Z$ relations in photoionization models used to derive UV carbon-line calibrations may not be valid for AGNs. By combining a large set of abundance estimates for local star-forming regions with those of our AGN sample, we derived a new (C/O)-$Z$ relation. Comparisons between the results of photoionization models that assume this new abundance relation and the UV observational data of our sample produce $Z$ values derived from the $C43$ index that are consistent with those obtained using the $T_{\rm e}$-method.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Core-Core Collision in Barnard 68</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prestellar core Barnard 68 (B68) is a prototypical source to study the initial conditions and chemical processes of star formation. A previous numerical simulation suggested the southeastern bullet is impacting on the main body of B68. In order to obtain more observational evidence, mapping observations of the ground state SO ($1_0-0_1$) emission line at 30 GHz were made with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. Based on the velocity field and channel maps derived from SO, three velocity components were clearly detected. The velocity field of the main body indicates rotation and is well fitted by a solid-body rotation model. The measured radial velocity difference between the bullet and the main core is about 0.4 km s$^{-1}$, which is almost equal to the velocity obtained by the previous numerical simulation. Therefore, the bullet is most likely impacting onto the rotating main body of B68. A 1D spherical non-LTE Monte-Carlo radiation transfer RATRAN code is performed to derive the radial abundance profile of SO by analyzing the observed velocity-integrated intensity. SO is depleted inside a 60$^{\prime\prime}$ (0.02 pc) radius from the core. The abundance stays constant at 2.0$\times$10$^{-9}$ for radii larger than 60$^{\prime\prime}$ from the center of the main core. The abundance is enhanced at the interface of the bullet and the main core indicating that shock waves were produced by the collision between the bullet and the main core. In conclusion, based on the kinematical and chemical analysis, our observational results support the previously proposed core-core collision scenario in B68.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Free-floating Planet Mass Function with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-floating planets comprise one of the most enigmatic populations of exoplanets in the Galaxy. Though ground-based observations point to a large abundance of these worlds, little is known about their origins and demographics. In the coming years, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey is expected to detect several hundred free-floating planets, providing the first opportunity to characterize these worlds at the population level. We present a first study of Roman's prospects for reconstructing the mass distribution of free-floating planets through population-level statistical inference. We find that depending on the true underlying mass distribution of free-floating planets in the Galaxy, Roman will be able to improve upon existing estimates of the abundance by orders of magnitudes in the largely unexplored mass range below that of Earth. When applied to Roman's observations, the methodology we present herein will be capable of discriminating between different hypothesized mass distributions at high statistical significance, opening a new window into the origins of these rogue worlds.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Core Properties of Hybrid Stars from Future High-Precision Measurements of Their Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observations of neutron stars (NSs) are expected to measure NS radii to better than $\sigma=0.1$ km accuracy, providing unprecedented opportunities to extract novel information about the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores. Within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model for NS EOS encapsulating a first-order hadron-quark phase transition and satisfying all known constraints from both nuclear physics and astrophysics, we investigate how NS radius data with higher precision may better inform us about (1) the NS crust-core transition density $\rho_{cc}$, (2) the hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$, quark matter fraction $F_{\rm{QM}}$ and its radius $R_{\rm{QM}}$, and (3) high-density NS EOS parameters. Using fiducial NS radius data with mocked precisions varying from $\sigma=1.0$ km to 0.1 km, we found (a) the most probable crust-core transition density $\rho_{cc}$ and its 68\% confidence boundaries are essentially unaffected by $\sigma$ especially for massive NSs; (b) our answers to the questions (2) and (3) listed above depend sensitively on the prior range of hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$ assumed. Using its fiducial range of $(1.0-6.0)\rho_0$, the posterior PDF($\rho_t$) has a major peak around $(1.7-2.0)\rho_0$ that is sufficient but unnecessary in describing all existing NS radius data, and a minor peak around $(3.0-5.0)\rho_0$ consistent with the indication about $\rho_t$ of recent Beam Energy Scan Experiments at RHIC. Narrowing down the prior range of $\rho_t$ to $(3.0-6.0)\rho_0$, NS radius data with smaller $\sigma$ can constrain more stringently the posterior PDF($\rho_t$), $F_{\rm{QM}}$, $R_{\rm{QM}}$ and several high-density hadronic EOS parameters.</description>

      <title>Multiple generation star formation in Cepheus Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the young stellar moving group ASCC 127 using Gaia DR3 data, significantly expanding its membership to 3,971 stars -- double the number identified in previous studies. Using kinematic and distance criteria, ASCC 127 is divided into five subgroups (Groups 1-5) with ages spanning from 15 to 32 Myr. Groups 1-5 are spatially linked to the Cepheus Flare star-forming region, revealing potential evidence of four sequential star formation episodes at approximately 32 Myr, 20 Myr, 15 Myr, and 7 Myr. Through dust and gas mapping, we identify a spatial cavity extending several tens of parsecs, which may have resulted from feedback processes such as supernovae associated with earlier generations of stars in the region. This structure, along with the larger Loop III feature, indicates that feedback from massive stars likely influenced the interstellar medium (ISM). By integrating young stellar populations with ISM studies, we provide a detailed picture of the feedback-driven star formation history in the Cepheus Flare region.</description>

      <title>Can We Probe Spacetime Non-commutativity Through Tidal Deformability of Compact Objects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of spacetime non-commutativity on the tidal deformability of compact objects and explore the feasibility of detecting non-commutative (NC) effects through gravitational wave (GW) observations. We considered NC modifications to spacetime geometry based on de Sitter gauge theory of gravity and calculate their impact on tidal deformability. While several types of compact objects have been proposed as candidates for probing spacetime non-commutativity, particularly at the horizon scales, our study showed analytically that, for compact objects with non-singular metric at their surface (such as neutron stars and boson stars), the NC correction to their tidal deformability converge to a finite value at the black-hole-compactness limit, eliminating infinite enhancement at the horizon scales. We then compute the NC corrections for neutron stars and boson stars, considering several different models, and analyze their imprints on the GW signals. By comparing the results, we assess the scale of NC effects across different compactness regimes and discuss the conditions under which these NC effects can be amplified. While our findings suggest that the leading-order NC correction dominates the tidal deformability of a compact object near the black-hole-compactness limit, we demonstrate that neutron stars and boson stars are not viable candidates to constrain spacetime non-commutativity, while relying on the tidal deformability through GW observations.</description>

      <title>The Jackknife method as a new approach to validate strong lens mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of a mass model in the strong lensing analysis is crucial for unbiased predictions of physical quantities such as magnifications and time delays. While the mass model is optimized by changing parameters of the mass model to match predicted positions of multiple images with observations, positional uncertainties of multiple images often need to be boosted to take account of the complex structure of dark matter in lens objects, making the interpretation of the chi-square value difficult. We introduce the Jackknife method as a new method to validate strong lens mass models, specifically focusing on cluster-scale mass modeling. In this approach, we remove multiple images of a source from the fitting and optimize the mass model using multiple images of the remaining sources. We then calculate the multiple images of the removed source and quantitatively evaluate how well they match the observed positions. We find that the Jackknife method performs effectively in simulations using a simple model. We also demonstrate our method with mass modeling of the galaxy cluster MACS J0647.7+7015. We discuss the potential of using the Jackknife method to validate the error estimation of the physical quantities by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Initial Mass Function of Early Dark Matter-free Gas Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the remarkable strides made by JWST is the discovery of the earliest star clusters found to date. These have been proposed as early progenitors of globular clusters, which are known to come from the early stages of star formation in the Universe. This is an exciting development in modern astronomy, as it offers an opportunity to connect theoretical models of globular cluster formation to actual observations of these high-redshift structures. In this work, we aim to develop observational signatures of a star cluster formation route known as supersonically induced gas objects, which are dark matter-less gas clouds in the early Universe proposed as a potential origin of some globular clusters. For the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, meaning that they have a flatter IMF slope compared to very young low-metallicity star clusters in the local Universe, and they also have extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to their local counterparts.</description>

      <title>Powerful nuclear outflows and circumgalactic medium shocks driven by the most luminous known obscured quasar in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report integral field spectroscopy observations with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on board JWST targeting the 60 kpc environment surrounding the most luminous obscured quasar known at $z=4.6$. We detect ionized gas filaments on 40 kpc scales connecting a network of merging galaxies likely to form a cluster. We find regions of low ionization consistent with large-scale shock excitation surrounding the central dust-obscured quasar, out to distances nearly eight times the effective stellar radius of the quasar host galaxy. In the nuclear region, we find an ionized outflow driven by the quasar with velocities reaching 13,000 km s$^{-1}$, one of the fastest discovered to date with an outflow rate of 2000 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and a kinetic luminosity of 6$\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ resulting in coupling efficiency between the bolometric luminosity of the quasar and the outflow of 5%. The kinetic luminosity of the outflow is sufficient to power the turbulent motion of the gas on galactic and circumgalactic scales and is likely the primary driver of the radiative shocks on interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium scales. This provides compelling evidence supporting long-standing theoretical predictions that powerful quasar outflows are a main driver in regulating the heating and accretion rate of gas onto massive central cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>Constraining the potential of the Milky Way using stellar streams and the Inverse Time Integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method for constraining the potential of the Milky Way using stellar streams with a known progenitor. The method expresses the stream in angle-action coordinates and integrates the orbits of the stars backwards in time to obtain the stripping point positions of the stream stars relative to the cluster. In the potential that generated the stream, the stars return approximately to the cluster centre. In a different potential, they are redirected to different locations. The free parameters of the model are estimated by maximising the degree of clustering of the stripping point distribution. We test this method with the stellar stream of the globular cluster M68 (NGC 4590). We use an N-body code to simulate the stream and generate a realistic star sample using a model of the Gaia selection function. We also simulate the expected observational uncertainties, and estimate the heliocentric distances and radial velocities of the stream stars from the cluster orbit. Using this sample of stars, we recover the values of four free parameters characterising the potential of the disc and the dark halo to an accuracy of about 10 per cent of the correct values. We show that this accuracy is improved up to about 2 per cent using the expected end-of-mission Gaia data. In addition, we obtain a strong correlation between the mass of the disc and the dark halo axis ratio, which is explained by the fact that the stream flows close and parallel to the disc plane.</description>

      <title>The Merging Galaxy Cluster Environment Affects the Morphology of Radio-AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has previously been found that the galaxy cluster environment can affect the fueling and evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This work examines the effect of the merging cluster environment on the properties of radio-AGN by comparing the radio morphology of cluster members in a sample of four merging and eight relaxed galaxy clusters at low redshift (z&lt;0.2). Using 144-MHz data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and Zooniverse, we classify the radio morphology of the radio-detected cluster members using the following morphology classes: compact, compact extended, extended, jetted, and disturbed. We find that the merging cluster environment has a statistically significant, higher population proportion of disturbed (bent and head tail) sources, indicating that the merging environment can affect the morphology of cluster radio-AGN. We also investigate the number of AGN that are detected in the radio data only, and the number that are detected in both the radio and optical data in mergers and non-mergers. We find that the merging cluster environment has a higher population proportion of AGN that are identified only as radio-AGN compared to AGN that are identified as both radio and optical AGN. Overall, we find that the merging environment affects certain radio-AGN (disturbed and only radio identified AGN), but not all.</description>

Abstract: Supernova may be the dominant channel by which dust grains accumulate in galaxies during the first Gyr of cosmic time as formation channels important for lower redshift galaxies, e.g., AGB stars and grain growth, may not have had sufficient time to take over. Supernovae (SNe) produce fewer small grains, leading to a flatter attenuation law. In this work, we fit observations of 138 spectroscopically confirmed $z&gt;6$ galaxies adopting standard spectral energy distribution modeling assumptions and compare standard attenuation law prescriptions to a flat attenuation law. Compared to SMC dust, flat attenuation close to what may be expected from dust produced in SNe yields up to $0.5$ mag higher $A_V$, and $0.4$ dex larger stellar masses. It also finds better fits to the rest-frame UV photometry with lower $\chi^2_{\rm UV}$, allowing the observed UV luminosities taken from the models to be fainter by $0.2$ dex on average. The systematically fainter observed UV luminosities for fixed observed photometry could help resolve current tension between the ionizing photon production implied by \textit{JWST} observations and the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction. Given these systematic effects and the physical constraint of cosmic time itself, fairly flat attenuation laws that could represent the properties of dust grain produced by SNe should be a standard consideration in fitting to the spectral energy distributions of $z&gt;6$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Massive Black Hole 0.8 kpc from the Host Nucleus Revealed by the Offset Tidal Disruption Event AT2024tvd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) that are spatially offset from the nuclei of their host galaxies offer a new probe of massive black hole (MBH) wanderers, binaries, triples, and recoiling MBHs. Here we present AT2024tvd, the first off-nuclear TDE identified through optical sky surveys. High-resolution imaging with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} shows that AT2024tvd is $0.914\pm 0.010^{\prime\prime}$ offset from the apparent center of its host galaxy, corresponding to a projected distance of $0.808\pm 0.009$ kpc at $z=0.045$. Chandra and VLA observations support the same conclusion for the TDE's X-ray and radio emission. AT2024tvd exhibits typical properties of nuclear TDEs, including a persistent hot UV/optical component that peaks at $L_{\rm bb}\sim 6\times 10^{43}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, broad hydrogen lines in its optical spectra, and delayed brightening of luminous ($L_{\rm X,peak}\sim 3\times 10^{43}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$), highly variable soft X-ray emission. The MBH mass of AT2024tvd is $10^{6\pm1}\,M_\odot$, at least 10 times lower than its host galaxy's central black hole mass ($\gtrsim 10^8\,M_\odot$). The MBH in AT2024tvd has two possible origins: a wandering MBH from the lower-mass galaxy in a minor merger during the dynamical friction phase or a recoiling MBH ejected by triple interactions. Combining AT2024tvd with two previously known off-nuclear TDEs discovered in X-rays (3XMM J2150 and EP240222a), which likely involve intermediate-mass black holes in satellite galaxies, we find that the parent galaxies of all three events are very massive ($\sim 10^{10.9}\,M_\odot$). This result aligns with expectations from cosmological simulations that the number of offset MBHs scales linearly with the host halo mass.</description>

      <title>Study of barred galaxies in IllustrisTNG100: the case of low surface brightness galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we compare the presence of stellar bars in low and high surface brightness galaxies (LSBs and HSBs, respectively) using the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project. The sample consists of 4,244 disc galaxies at $z=0$ with stellar mass M$\star \geq 10^{10}$ M$\odot$. We find a bar fraction of $24 \pm 1.73 \%$ in LSBs, similar to the $28 \pm 0.74\%$ found in HSBs, consistent with observations. For a given stellar mass range, HSBs consistently exhibit a higher bar fraction compared to LSBs, except at M$\star &gt; 10^{11}$ M$\odot$, where the difference vanishes. To explore the origin of this trend and its relation to host galaxy properties, we construct several control samples matched in stellar mass, spin, gas mass fraction, and bulge-to-total mass ratio. For galaxies with M$\star&lt;10^{11}$ M$\odot$, the lower bar fraction in LSBs appears to be associated with their higher spin and gas content -factors known to inhibit bar formation and growth. At the high mass end, only the bulge-to-total mass ratio is capable of enhancing the bar fraction difference, although its effect is limited. We also study the role of the local environment through the tidal parameter. Our results suggest that, unlike in HSBs, where the bar fraction remains largely unaffected, tidal interactions may promote bar formation in LSBs, albeit with a smaller impact than the intrinsic physical properties. These findings provide insight into the physical conditions that shape the presence of bars in LSBs.</description>

      <title>Intracluster light is a biased tracer of the dark matter distribution in clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffuse stellar component of galaxy clusters known as intracluster light (ICL) has been proposed as an observable tracer of the cluster's dark matter (DM) halo. Assessing its reliability as a DM tracer requires understanding how the intracluster stars are energetically linked to the underlying DM distribution, which we investigate at $z\approx0$ in 12 galaxy clusters with $M_{178} = 1.18 - 3.71 \times 10^{14}\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ from the Horizon-AGN simulation. We quantify the orbital energies of these components by their mean specific energies ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$, and find that this quantity is $\approx$ 25 per cent lower for the intracluster stars than the DM, whilst the energetics of the satellite galaxies (a standard DM tracer) are only marginally ($\approx$ 5 per cent) higher than the DM. Importantly, the lower ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$ of the intracluster stars compared to the DM is robust against the precise separation between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the ICL. The specific energy distribution of ICL stars is concentrated towards lower energies and poorly samples the higher energies, where much of the DM resides. Consequently, the intracluster stars have velocity distributions with lower typical speeds and a more centrally-concentrated density profile than the DM. We also find that intracluster stars have more radially-biased orbits than the DM, indicating these components have distinct orbital distributions. This study demonstrates that although the morphology of the ICL may match the DM halo, the ICL is a biased tracer of DM, and these biases must be understood in order to infer properties of the DM from the ICL.</description>

      <title>Searching for star formation towards the Eos molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Eos cloud, recently discovered in the far ultraviolet via H$_2$ fluorescence, is one of the nearest known dark molecular clouds to the Sun, with a distance spanning from $\sim94-136$pc. However, with a mass ($\sim5.5\times10^3$M$_\odot$) just under $40$ per cent that of star forming clouds like Taurus and evidence for net molecular dissociation, its evolutionary and star forming status is uncertain. We use Gaia data to investigate whether there is evidence for a young stellar population that may have formed from the Eos cloud. Comparing isochrones and pre-main sequence evolutionary models there is no clear young stellar population in the region. While there are a small number of $&lt;10$Myr stars, that population is statistically indistinguishable from those in similar search volumes at other Galactic latitudes. We also find no unusual spatial or kinematic clustering toward the Eos cloud over distances $70-150$pc. Overall we conclude that the Eos cloud has most likely not undergone any recent substantial star formation, and further study of the dynamics of the cloud is required to determine whether it will do so in the future.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating UMa3/U1: star cluster or the smallest known galaxy?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is the faintest Milky Way satellite discovered to date, exhibiting a half-light radius of 3 $\pm$ 1 pc and an absolute V-band magnitude of +2.2 $\pm$ 0.4. Previous studies suggest UMa3/U1 is a dwarf galaxy, based on its large internal velocity dispersion and the improbability (indicated by dynamical cluster simulations) of its long-term survival if it were a dark-matter-free star cluster. In this paper, we model the evolution of UMa3/U1 as a star cluster using collisional N-body simulations that include a description of stellar evolution and the external tidal field of the Milky Way, with some simulations including primordial binaries. We find that UMa3/U1 has a substantial remaining lifetime of 2.7 $\pm$ 0.4 Gyr, primarily due to the retention of compact stellar remnants within the cluster. This retention is facilitated by mass segregation and the preferential loss of low-mass stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the observed large velocity dispersion of UMa3/U1 can be successfully reproduced. These results support the possibility that UMa3/U1 is a self-gravitating star cluster. Our simulations reveal that modelling UMa3/U1 as a dark matter free star cluster produces a markedly altered present-day mass function, driven by a strong depletion of low-mass stars. However, the degree of mass segregation among the visible stars is not statistically significant. We therefore recommend that future observations of UMa3/U1 and other very small Milky Way satellites focus on measuring their present-day mass functions to determine their nature.</description>

      <title>The Ancient Egyptian Cosmological Vignette: First Visual Evidence of the Milky Way and Trends in Coffin Depictions of the Sky Goddess Nut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, I test the long-held assumption that the ancient Egyptian sky goddess Nut represented the Milky Way by examining Nut's visual depictions on ancient Egyptian coffins. I assemble a catalog of 555 coffin elements, including 118 cosmological vignettes from the 21st/22nd Dynasties, and report several observations. First, the cosmological vignette on the outer coffin of Nesitaudjatakhet bears a unique feature: a thick, undulating black curve that bisects Nut's star-studded body and recalls the Great Rift that cleaves the Milky Way in two. Similar undulating curves bisect the astronomical ceiling in the tomb of Seti I and appear as part of depictions of Nut in the tombs of Ramesses IV, VI, and IX. Moreover, the undulating curve resembles similar features identified as the Milky Way on the bodies of Navajo, Hopi, and Zuni spiritual beings. Hence, I argue that the undulating curve is a visual representation of the Milky Way and that it supports a previously suggested identification of the Winding Waterway as the Galaxy's Egyptian name. However, the rarity of this feature strengthens the conclusion reached by Graur (2024a): Though Nut and the Milky Way are linked, they are not synonymous. Instead of acting as a representation of Nut, the Milky Way is one more celestial phenomenon that, like the Sun and the stars, is associated with Nut in her role as the sky. Second, Nut's body is decorated with stars in only a quarter of the cosmological vignettes, suggesting that the Egyptians of the 21st/22nd Dynasties may have had a marked preference for the day sky over the night sky. Finally, I discuss the interplay between Nut's cosmological vignette and full-length portraits inside coffins from the New Kingdom to the Roman Period in the context of Nut's combined cosmological and eschatological roles as an embodiment of the coffin.</description>

      <title>Magnetic helicity fluxes in dynamos from rotating inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze direct numerical simulations of large-scale dynamos in inhomogeneous nonhelically driven rotating turbulence with and without shear. The forcing is modulated so that the turbulent intensity peaks in the middle of the computational domain and drops to nearly zero at the two ends above and below the midplane. A large-scale dynamo is driven by an $\alpha$ effect of opposite signs in the two hemispheres. In the presence of shear, the hemispheric magnetic helicity flux from small-scale fields becomes important and can even overcompensate for the magnetic helicity transferred by the $\alpha$ effect between large and small scales. This effect has not previously been observed in nonshearing simulations. Our numerical simulations show that the hemispheric magnetic helicity fluxes are nearly independent of the magnetic Reynolds number, but those between large and small scales, and the consequent dynamo effect, are still found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number -- just like in nonshearing dynamos. However, in contrast to nonshearing dynamos, where the generated mean magnetic field declines with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, it is now found to remain independent of it. This suggests that catastrophic dynamo quenching is alleviated by the shear-induced hemispheric small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes that can even overcompensate the fluxes between large and small scales and thereby cause resistive contributions.</description>

      <title>Abundance Measurements of the Metal-poor M subdwarf LHS 174 Using High-resolution Optical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-poor M subdwarfs are among the oldest stellar populations and carry valuable information about the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. The measurements of chemical abundances of these stars therefore provide essential insights into the nucleosynthesis in the early stages of the Galaxy's formation. We present the detailed spectroscopic analysis of a nearby metal-poor M subdwarf, LHS 174 from its high-resolution optical spectrum, and apply our previously developed spectral fitting code, \texttt{AutoSpecFit}, to measure the abundances of five elements:[O/H]=$-$0.519$\pm$0.081, [Ca/H]=$-$0.753$\pm$0.177, [Ti/H]=$-$0.711$\pm$0.144, [V/H]=$-$1.026$\pm$0.077, and [Fe/H]=$-$1.170$\pm$0.135. We compare the abundances of O, Ti, and Fe derived from this work and those from previous studies and demonstrate the observed data is clearly better matched with the synthetic model generated based on our abundances than those from the other analyses. The accuracy of inferred stellar abundances strongly depends on the accuracy of physical parameters, which motivates us to develop a reliable technique to determine the parameters of low-mass M dwarfs more accurately ever than before and infer abundances with smaller uncertainties.</description>
