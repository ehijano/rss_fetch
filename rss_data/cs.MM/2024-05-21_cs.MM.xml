      <title>Unsupervised Multimodal Clustering for Semantics Discovery in Multimodal Utterances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering the semantics of multimodal utterances is essential for understanding human language and enhancing human-machine interactions. Existing methods manifest limitations in leveraging nonverbal information for discerning complex semantics in unsupervised scenarios. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised multimodal clustering method (UMC), making a pioneering contribution to this field. UMC introduces a unique approach to constructing augmentation views for multimodal data, which are then used to perform pre-training to establish well-initialized representations for subsequent clustering. An innovative strategy is proposed to dynamically select high-quality samples as guidance for representation learning, gauged by the density of each sample's nearest neighbors. Besides, it is equipped to automatically determine the optimal value for the top-$K$ parameter in each cluster to refine sample selection. Finally, both high- and low-quality samples are used to learn representations conducive to effective clustering. We build baselines on benchmark multimodal intent and dialogue act datasets. UMC shows remarkable improvements of 2-6\% scores in clustering metrics over state-of-the-art methods, marking the first successful endeavor in this domain.

      <title>Interoperable Provenance Authentication of Broadcast Media using Open Standards-based Metadata, Watermarking and Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of false and misleading information is receiving significant attention from legislative and regulatory bodies. Consumers place trust in specific sources of information, so a scalable, interoperable method for determining the provenance and authenticity of information is needed. In this paper we analyze the posting of broadcast news content to a social media platform, the role of open standards, the interplay of cryptographic metadata and watermarks when validating provenance, and likely success and failure scenarios. We conclude that the open standards for cryptographically authenticated metadata developed by the Coalition for Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and for audio and video watermarking developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) are well suited to address broadcast provenance. We suggest methods for using these standards for optimal success.</description>

      <title>Rethink Predicting the Optical Flow with the Kinetics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical flow estimation is one of the fundamental tasks in low-level computer vision, which describes the pixel-wise displacement and can be used in many other tasks. From the apparent aspect, the optical flow can be viewed as the correlation between the pixels in consecutive frames, so continuously refining the correlation volume can achieve an outstanding performance. However, it will make the method have a catastrophic computational complexity. Not only that, the error caused by the occlusion regions of the successive frames will be amplified through the inaccurate warp operation. These challenges can not be solved only from the apparent view, so this paper rethinks the optical flow estimation from the kinetics viewpoint.We propose a method combining the apparent and kinetics information from this motivation. The proposed method directly predicts the optical flow from the feature extracted from images instead of building the correlation volume, which will improve the efficiency of the whole network. Meanwhile, the proposed method involves a new differentiable warp operation that simultaneously considers the warping and occlusion. Moreover, the proposed method blends the kinetics feature with the apparent feature through the novel self-supervised loss function. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments and ablation studies prove that the proposed novel insight into how to predict the optical flow can achieve the better performance of the state-of-the-art methods, and in some metrics, the proposed method outperforms the correlation-based method, especially in situations containing occlusion and fast moving. The code will be public.</description>

      <title>Context-Enhanced Video Moment Retrieval with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current methods for Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) struggle to align complex situations involving specific environmental details, character descriptions, and action narratives. To tackle this issue, we propose a Large Language Model-guided Moment Retrieval (LMR) approach that employs the extensive knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve video context representation as well as cross-modal alignment, facilitating accurate localization of target moments. Specifically, LMR introduces a context enhancement technique with LLMs to generate crucial target-related context semantics. These semantics are integrated with visual features for producing discriminative video representations. Finally, a language-conditioned transformer is designed to decode free-form language queries, on the fly, using aligned video representations for moment retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LMR achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming the nearest competitor by up to 3.28\% and 4.06\% on the challenging QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks, respectively. More importantly, the performance gains are significantly higher for localization of complex queries.</description>

      <title>ProtT3: Protein-to-Text Generation for Text-based Protein Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) excel in understanding textual descriptions of proteins, as evident in biomedical question-answering tasks. However, their capability falters with raw protein data, such as amino acid sequences, due to a deficit in pretraining on such data. Conversely, Protein Language Models (PLMs) can understand and convert protein data into high-quality representations, but struggle to process texts. To address their limitations, we introduce ProtT3, a framework for Protein-to-Text Generation for Text-based Protein Understanding. ProtT3 empowers an LM to understand protein sequences of amino acids by incorporating a PLM as its protein understanding module, enabling effective protein-to-text generation. This collaboration between PLM and LM is facilitated by a cross-modal projector (i.e., Q-Former) that bridges the modality gap between the PLM's representation space and the LM's input space. Unlike previous studies focusing on protein property prediction and protein-text retrieval, we delve into the largely unexplored field of protein-to-text generation. To facilitate comprehensive benchmarks and promote future research, we establish quantitative evaluations for protein-text modeling tasks, including protein captioning, protein question-answering, and protein-text retrieval. Our experiments show that ProtT3 substantially surpasses current baselines, with ablation studies further highlighting the efficacy of its core components. Our code is available at https://github.com/acharkq/ProtT3.</description>

      <title>A Dataset and Baselines for Measuring and Predicting the Music Piece Memorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, humans are constantly exposed to music, whether through voluntary streaming services or incidental encounters during commercial breaks. Despite the abundance of music, certain pieces remain more memorable and often gain greater popularity. Inspired by this phenomenon, we focus on measuring and predicting music memorability. To achieve this, we collect a new music piece dataset with reliable memorability labels using a novel interactive experimental procedure. We then train baselines to predict and analyze music memorability, leveraging both interpretable features and audio mel-spectrograms as inputs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore music memorability using data-driven deep learning-based methods. Through a series of experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that while there is room for improvement, predicting music memorability with limited data is possible. Certain intrinsic elements, such as higher valence, arousal, and faster tempo, contribute to memorable music. As prediction techniques continue to evolve, real-life applications like music recommendation systems and music style transfer will undoubtedly benefit from this new area of research.</description>

      <title>Parents and Children: Distinguishing Multimodal DeepFakes from Natural Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled the generation of realistic deepfakes from textual prompts in natural language. While these models have numerous benefits across various sectors, they have also raised concerns about the potential misuse of fake images and cast new pressures on fake image detection. In this work, we pioneer a systematic study on deepfake detection generated by state-of-the-art diffusion models. Firstly, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the performance of contrastive and classification-based visual features, respectively extracted from CLIP-based models and ResNet or ViT-based architectures trained on image classification datasets. Our results demonstrate that fake images share common low-level cues, which render them easily recognizable. Further, we devise a multimodal setting wherein fake images are synthesized by different textual captions, which are used as seeds for a generator. Under this setting, we quantify the performance of fake detection strategies and introduce a contrastive-based disentangling method that lets us analyze the role of the semantics of textual descriptions and low-level perceptual cues. Finally, we release a new dataset, called COCOFake, containing about 1.2M images generated from the original COCO image-caption pairs using two recent text-to-image diffusion models, namely Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2.0.</description>

      <title>Bringing Textual Prompt to AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-Generated Images (AGIs) have inherent multimodal nature. Unlike traditional image quality assessment (IQA) on natural scenarios, AGIs quality assessment (AGIQA) takes the correspondence of image and its textual prompt into consideration. This is coupled in the ground truth score, which confuses the unimodal IQA methods. To solve this problem, we introduce IP-IQA (AGIs Quality Assessment via Image and Prompt), a multimodal framework for AGIQA via corresponding image and prompt incorporation. Specifically, we propose a novel incremental pretraining task named Image2Prompt for better understanding of AGIs and their corresponding textual prompts. An effective and efficient image-prompt fusion module, along with a novel special [QA] token, are also applied. Both are plug-and-play and beneficial for the cooperation of image and its corresponding prompt. Experiments demonstrate that our IP-IQA achieves the state-of-the-art on AGIQA-1k and AGIQA-3k datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/Coobiw/IP-IQA.</description>
