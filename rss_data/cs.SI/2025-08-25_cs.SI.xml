      <title>The Gender Gap in Science Communication on TikTok and YouTube: How Platform Dynamics Shape the Visibility of Female Science Communicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms facilitate the dissemination of science and access to it. However, gender inequalities in the participation and visibility of communicators persist. This study examined the differences in reach and audience response between YouTube and TikTok from a gender perspective. To do so, the ten most influential science accounts on YouTube and TikTok were selected, with the sample divided equally between men and women, to conduct a comparative study. A total of 4293 videos on TikTok and 4825 on YouTube were analyzed, along with 277,528 comments, considering metrics of views and interaction. The results show that on YouTube, men received more likes and views, while on TikTok, audience response was more balanced. The participation of women on both platforms also had a differential impact, as the number of women engaging with content on YouTube negatively correlated with interaction levels, whereas on TikTok, their impact was slightly positive. In conclusion, TikTok emerges as a more inclusive space for scientific communication, though structural challenges remain on both platforms, encouraging further research into strategies that promote gender equity in online science communication.</description>

      <title>Dense Subgraph Clustering and a New Cluster Ensemble Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose DSC-Flow-Iter, a new community detection algorithm that is based on iterative extraction of dense subgraphs. Although DSC-Flow-Iter leaves many nodes unclustered, it is competitive with leading methods and has high-precision and low-recall, making it complementary to modularity-based methods that typically have high recall but lower precision. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel cluster ensemble technique that combines DSC-Flow-Iter with modularity-based clustering, to provide improved accuracy. We show that our proposed pipeline, which uses this ensemble technique, outperforms its individual components and improves upon the baseline techniques on a large collection of synthetic networks.</description>

      <title>Learning Short-Term and Long-Term Patterns of High-Order Dynamics in Real-World Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world networks have high-order relationships among objects and they evolve over time. To capture such dynamics, many works have been studied in a range of fields. Via an in-depth preliminary analysis, we observe two important characteristics of high-order dynamics in real-world networks: high-order relations tend to (O1) have a structural and temporal influence on other relations in a short term and (O2) periodically re-appear in a long term. In this paper, we propose LINCOLN, a method for Learning hIgh-order dyNamiCs Of reaL-world Networks, that employs (1) bi-interactional hyperedge encoding for short-term patterns, (2) periodic time injection and (3) intermediate node representation for long-term patterns. Via extensive experiments, we show that LINCOLN outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods in the dynamic hyperedge prediction task.</description>

      <title>Straddling Two Platforms: From Twitter to Mastodon, an Analysis of the Evolution of an Unfinished Social Media Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media have been fundamental in the daily lives of millions of people, but they have raised concerns about content moderation policies, the management of personal data, and their commercial exploitation. The acquisition of Twitter (now X) by Elon Musk in 2022 generated concerns among Twitter users regarding changes in the platform's direction, prompting a migration campaign by some user groups to the federated network Mastodon. This study reviews the onboarding of users to this decentralised platform between 2016 and 2022 and analyses the migration of 19,000 users who identified themselves as supporters of the platform switch. The results show that the migration campaign was a reactive response to Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter and was led by a group of highly active academics, scientists, and journalists. However, a complete transition was not realised, as users preferred to straddle their presence on both platforms. Mastodon's decentralisation made it difficult to exactly replicate Twitter's communities, resulting in a partial loss of these users' social capital and greater fragmentation of these user communities, which highlights the intrinsic differences between both platforms.</description>

      <title>Connected Theorems: A Graph-Based Approach to Evaluating Mathematical Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of mathematical results plays a central role in assessing researchers' contributions and shaping the direction of the field. Currently, such evaluations rely primarily on human judgment, whether through journal peer review or committees at research institutions. To complement these traditional processes, we propose a data-driven approach. We construct a hierarchical graph linking theorems, papers, and fields to capture their citation relationships. We then introduce a PageRank-style algorithm to compute influence scores for these entities. Using these scores, we analyze the evolution of field rankings over time and quantify the impact between fields. We hope this framework can contribute to the development of more advanced, quantitative methods for evaluating mathematical research and serve as a complement to expert assessment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM-Based Social Bot via an Adversarial Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing Large Language Model (LLM) agents that exhibit human-like behavior, encompassing not only individual heterogeneity rooted in unique user profiles but also adaptive response to socially connected neighbors, is a significant research challenge. Social media platforms, with their diverse user data and explicit social structures, provide an ideal testbed for such investigations. This paper introduces EvoBot, an \textbf{Evo}lving LLM-based social \textbf{Bot} that significantly enhances human-like generative capabilities through a novel adversarial learning framework. EvoBot is initialized by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on representative data from social media and then iteratively refines its generation of sophisticated, human-like content via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This refinement is guided by feedback from a co-adapting \textbf{Detector} which concurrently improves its ability to distinguish EvoBot from humans, thereby creating an increasingly challenging learning environment for EvoBot. Experiments demonstrate that EvoBot generates content aligned with diverse user profiles, increasingly bypassing the co-adapting Detector through human-like expression. Moreover, it exhibits strong social responsiveness, more accurately modeling real-world opinion dynamics and information spread in multi-agent simulations. The framework also yields a more robust Detector, underscoring its broader utility for both advanced agent development and related detection tasks.

      <title>Using Generative AI to Uncover What Drives Player Enjoyment in PC and VR Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As video games continue to evolve, understanding what drives player enjoyment remains a key challenge. Player reviews provide valuable insights, but their unstructured nature makes large-scale analysis difficult. This study applies generative AI and machine learning, leveraging Microsoft Phi-4 LLM and XGBoost, to quantify and analyze game reviews from Steam and Meta Quest stores. The approach converts qualitative feedback into structured data, enabling comprehensive evaluation of key game design elements, monetization models, and platform-specific trends. The findings reveal distinct patterns in player preferences across PC and VR games, highlighting factors that contribute to higher player satisfaction. By integrating Google Cloud for largescale data storage and processing, this study establishes a scalable framework for game review analysis. The study's insights offer actionable guidance for game developers, helping optimize game mechanics, pricing strategies, and player engagement.</description>

      <title>Do Multimodal LLMs See Sentiment?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach, achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively, across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up, which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing, while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.</description>

      <title>Personalized Pricing Through Strategic User Profiling in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional user profiling techniques rely on browsing history or purchase records to identify users' willingness to pay. This enables sellers to offer personalized prices to profiled users while charging only a uniform price to non-profiled users. However, the emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies has caused users to actively avoid on-site data tracking. Today, major online sellers have turned to public platforms such as online social networks to better track users' profiles from their product-related discussions. This paper presents the first analytical study on how users should best manage their social activities against potential personalized pricing, and how a seller should strategically adjust her pricing scheme to facilitate user profiling in social networks. We formulate a dynamic Bayesian game played between the seller and users under asymmetric information. The key challenge of analyzing this game comes from the double couplings between the seller and the users as well as among the users. Furthermore, the equilibrium analysis needs to ensure consistency between users' revealed information and the seller's belief under random user profiling. We address these challenges by alternately applying backward and forward induction, and successfully characterize the unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in closed form. Our analysis reveals that as the accuracy of profiling technology improves, the seller tends to raise the equilibrium uniform price to motivate users' increased social activities and facilitate user profiling. However, this results in most users being worse off after the informed consent policy is imposed to ensure users' awareness of data access and profiling practices by potential sellers. This finding suggests that recent regulatory evolution towards enhancing users' privacy awareness may have unintended consequences of reducing users' payoffs.</description>

      <title>Effective Clustering for Large Multi-Relational Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling diverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade extensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning models.
  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive experiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit that DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.</description>

      <title>Price of Uncertainty for Consensus Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many game-theoretic models assume that players have access to accurate information, but uncertainty in observed data is frequently present in real-world settings. In this paper, we consider a model of uncertainty where adversarial perturbations of relative magnitude $1+\varepsilon$ are introduced to players' observed costs. The effect of uncertainty on social cost is denoted as the price of uncertainty. We prove a tight bound on the price of uncertainty for consensus games of $\Theta(\varepsilon^2 n^2)$ for all $\varepsilon = \Omega\mathopen{}\left(n^{-1/4}\right)$. This improves a previous lower bound of $\Omega(\varepsilon^3 n^2)$ as well as a previous upper bound of $O(\varepsilon n^2)$.</description>

      <title>How does node centrality in a financial network affect asset price prediction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In complex financial networks, systemically important nodes usually play crucial roles. Asset price forecasting is important for describing the evolution of a financial network. Naturally, the question arises as to whether node centrality impacts the effectiveness of price forecasting. To explore this, we examine networks composed of major global assets and investigate how node centrality affects price forecasting using a hybrid random forest algorithm. Our findings reveal two counterintuitive phenomena: (i) factors with low centrality usually have better forecasting ability, and (ii) nodes with low centrality can be predicted more accurately in direction. These unexpected observations can be explained from the perspective of information theory. Moreover, our research suggests a criterion for factor selection: when predicting an asset price in a complex system, factors with low centrality should be selected rather than only factors with high centrality. Finally, we verify the robustness of our results using an alternative deep learning method.</description>

      <title>Self-reinforcing cascades: A spreading model for beliefs or products of varying intensity or quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of how things spread often assume that transmission mechanisms are fixed over time. However, social contagions--the spread of ideas, beliefs, innovations--can lose or gain in momentum as they spread: ideas can get reinforced, beliefs strengthened, products refined. We study the impacts of such self-reinforcement mechanisms in cascade dynamics. We use different mathematical modeling techniques to capture the recursive, yet changing nature of the process. We find a critical regime with a range of power-law cascade size distributions with non-universal scaling exponents. This regime clashes with classic models, where criticality requires fine tuning at a precise critical point. Self-reinforced cascades produce critical-like behavior over a wide range of parameters, which may help explain the ubiquity of power-law distributions in empirical social data.</description>

      <title>Seeing Sarcasm Through Different Eyes: Analyzing Multimodal Sarcasm Perception in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrating increasingly human-like abilities, a pivotal question emerges: do different LVLMs interpret multimodal sarcasm differently, and can a single model grasp sarcasm from multiple perspectives like humans? To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. We further validate our findings on a diverse 100-sample mini-benchmark, incorporating multiple datasets, expanded prompt variants, and representative commercial LVLMs. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension.

      <title>On Word-of-Mouth and Private-Prior Sequential Social Learning</title>

Abstract: Social learning constitutes a fundamental framework for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and subsequently adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting theoretically and through numerical simulations, noting that some agents benefit from using the belief of the last agent, while others experience performance deterioration.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Message Imbalance in Fraud Detection with Dual-View Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning has become a mainstream method for fraud detection due to its strong expressive power, which focuses on enhancing node representations through improved neighborhood knowledge capture. However, the focus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global topological information and increased risk of node-specific information being overwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign nodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation, we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate Message imbalance in Fraud Detection (MimbFD). Specifically, we design a topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust node representations, enhancing the stable association between node representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes. Finally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the results demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud detection.</description>
