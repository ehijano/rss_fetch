      <title>Evidence for easy-plane XY ferromagnetism in heavy-fermion quantum-critical CeRh6Ge4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report $^{73}$Ge nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) and magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in the heavy-fermion quantum-critical ferromagnet CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$. NQR and NMR spectral measurements at the two non-equivalent Ge sites reveal electric field gradient tensors and the directions of their principal axes relative to the hexagonal basal plane. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ experiments reveal a clear critical slowing down approaching the ferromagnetic transition. $1/T_1$ in the paramagnetic state is found to be predominantly caused by fluctuating 4$f$-local moments. The Knight shift shows Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperature and a deviation from this below $T^\ast$ $\approx$ 25 K possibly due to a mixture of crystalline electric field effects and Kondo screening. Order-parameter-like behavior of hyperfine fields at the Ge sites and ferromagnetic signal enhancement are observed in Zeeman-perturbed NQR, with uniform ferromagnetic order and a small ordered moment of $\approx$ 0.26 $\mu_B$/Ce confined within the $ab$-plane. The ordered moment shows a notable in-plane magnetic stiffness against out-of-plane radiofrequency fields and has an (XY-type) in-plane isotropic nature. Our results reveal a strong easy-plane anisotropy of 4$f$-electron moment and suggest an involved interplay of hybridization and local moment physics in this quantum critical heavy-fermion ferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the Impact of Quenched Disorder on 2D Electron Wigner Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron Wigner solids (WSs)1-12 provide an ideal system for understanding the competing effects of electron-electron and electron-disorder interactions, a central unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Progress in this topic has been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements as well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory comparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density ($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$ devices with varying long-range ($n_\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range ($n_\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC simulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus allowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify two distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the magnitude of $n_\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\mathrm{SR} \lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior is dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid phases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel oscillations. In contrast, when $n_\mathrm{SR} \gg n_e$ these features are suppressed and a more robust amorphous WS phase emerges that persists to higher $n_e$, highlighting the importance of short-range disorder in this regime. Our work establishes a new framework for studying disordered quantum solids via a combined experimental-theoretical approach.</description>

      <title>$\eta$-pairing in the model with two-particle hybridization of conduction and localized electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of a model, that takes into account two-particle hybridization of conduction and localized electrons, the effective interaction between conduction electrons is calculated. It is shown that this interaction is attractive when the energy of the localized electron corresponding to the two-particle state lies in the conduction band above the Fermi energy. The magnitude of the attractive interaction is minimal for $\eta$-paired states of conduction electrons. We generalize the original $\eta$-pairing construction for the proposed model and show that the superconducting state can indeed be realized.</description>

      <title>The spin Hall conductivity in the hole-doped bilayer Haldane-Hubbard model with odd-parity ALM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin current generated electrically is among the core phenomena of spintronics for driving high-performance spin device applications. Here, on the basis of systematic investigations for the hole doped single-layer Haldane-Hubbard(HH) model, we propose a new bilayer HH model to realize the compensated odd-parity spin splitting and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity where the two layers are connected by the time reversal transformation. Our results show that the vanishing layer-dependent electric potential $V_{L}$ gives rise to odd-parity ALM protected by the combined symmetry $TM_{xy}$ with $T$ and $M_{xy}$ being the time reversal and mirror reflection perpendicular to $z$ axis, and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity simultaneously. In addition, though the staggered magnetization within each layer is substantially impacted by the layer-dependent electric potential, small $V_{L}$'s only bring negligible changes to the net magnetization and the spin Hall conductivity, indicating that the alternating spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall conductivity are insusceptible to external elements. Most importantly, our work provides a general framework for the simultaneous realization of the compensated odd-parity spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall conductivity in collinear magnets, in terms of stacked multi-layer systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Singlet and Classical N\'eel-Ordered Ground States in MoX3 (X = I, Br) Spin-3/2 Dimerized Antiferromagnetic Chain Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report that MoX3 (X = I, Br) are rare van der Waals materials that exhibit signatures of both quantum spin chains with a spin singlet ground state and classical Neel order. Bulk single crystals grown by chemical vapor transport exhibit classical antiferromagnetic ground states with a transition temperature of ~40 K as revealed by susceptibility and specific heat measurements. Above 40 K, the susceptibilities show the large, broad peaks associated with a quantum spin-singlet ground state and large singlet-triplet gaps of 21 meV and 25 meV. Monte Carlo simulations, density matrix renormalization-group calculations for finite spin-3/2 chains, and density functional theory reproduce the experimental behavior, confirming the interplay between strong one-dimensional intrachain and weak three-dimensional interchain couplings. MoX3 offers a unique platform for exploring quantum magnetism and magnetic excitations at the atomic chain limit, as these materials combine a 1D van der Waals motif, spin chain behavior, and classical interchain order.</description>

      <title>The anisotropic Heisenberg model close to the Ising limit: triangular lattice vs. effective models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated by recent experiments on materials representing the realization of the anisotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ model on the triangular lattice, we explore further properties of such a model in the easy-axis regime $\alpha = J_\perp/J_z &lt; 1$, as well as effective models that also capture such physics. We show that anisotropic Heisenberg models on the honeycomb lattice and even on the square lattice reveal similarities to the full triangular lattice in the magnetization curve as well as in the transverse magnetization (superfluid) order parameter $m_\perp$ at finite fields. Still, at $\alpha \ll 1$, results reveal gapless excitations and small but finite $m_\perp &gt;0 $ at effective fields corresponding to the triangular case without the field. In contrast, several additional numerical studies of the full model on the triangular lattice confirm the existence of the gap at $\alpha \ll 1$. In particular, the magnetization curve $m(h)$ as well as the spin stiffness $\rho_s$ indicate (at zero field) a transition/crossover from gapped to gapless regime at $\alpha \sim \alpha^*$ with $\alpha^* \lesssim 0.5$. We also show that deviations from the linear spin-wave theory and the emergence of the gap can be traced back to the strong effective repulsion between magnon excitations, having similarity to strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Possible Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons in a S = 5/2 honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnets offer a unique platform for exploring exotic quantum phases and quantum phase transitions through external magnetic fields. A prominent example is the field-induced Bose--Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons near the saturation field. While this behavior has been observed in low-spin systems, its realization in high-spin, quasi-two-dimensional magnets -- where multiple on-site excitations are possible -- remains exceptionally rare. Here, we report thermodynamic and density functional theory results on single crystals of the honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnet K$_{4}$MnMo$_{4}$O$_{15}$ with $S = 5/2$. The system undergoes a field-induced transition to a fully polarized state at the critical field $\mu_{0}H_{\rm s} = 6.4$~T. Our results reveal possible thermodynamic signatures of magnon BEC, $T_{\mathrm{N}} \sim (H_{\rm s} - H)^{2/d}$ ($d = 3$), expanding the purview of BEC-driven quantum criticality to a high-spin, quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnets with negligibly small anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality at the end of a pseudogap phase in superconducting infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many unconventional superconductors, the strange-metal regime is thought to emerge from quantum criticality, yet in cuprates this link is obscured by the enigmatic pseudogap. Superconducting infinite-layer nickelates provide a new arena to test this paradigm but are constrained to thin films, precluding calorimetry. We use the Seebeck coefficient as a low-temperature proxy for entropy per carrier and uncover a clear quantum-critical thermodynamic signature: in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at the onset of $T$-linear resistivity ($x=0.20$), $S/T$ diverges logarithmically upon cooling, $S/T \propto \log T$. Boltzmann transport based on ARPES-derived band structure reproduces the high-temperature magnitude and sign of $S/T$ and reveals a threefold mass renormalization at the Fermi level. To identify the terminating phase, we analyze Hall data across Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ and show that its temperature evolution is quantitatively captured by a minimal two-band model in which a strongly correlated Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ Fermi surface exhibits Planckian $T$-linear scattering while the rare-earth Nd-$s$ pocket remains Fermi-liquid-like. Inverting the zero-temperature Hall response reveals a collapse of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band carrier density from $1+p$ to $p$ holes across the critical doping, without long-range magnetic order -- mirroring the cuprate pseudogap transition in cuprates. These results establish a quantum critical point at the end of a pseudogap-like phase in infinite-layer nickelates and unify the broader paradigm among correlated superconductors that strange metal behaviour is intimately linked to quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Error thresholds of toric codes with transversal logical gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$, a $26\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained correspondingly.</description>

      <title>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Topological Robustness of Anyon Tunneling at $\nu = 1/3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling exponent $g$ of the quasiparticle propagator for incompressible fractional quantum Hall states in the Laughlin sequence is expected to be robust against perturbations that do not close the gap. Here we probe the topological robustness of the chiral Luttinger liquid at the boundary of the $\nu=1/3$ state by measuring the tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes as a function of quantum point contact transmission. We demonstrate that for transmission $t\geq 0.7$ the tunneling conductance is well-described by the first two terms of a perturbative series expansion corresponding to $g=1/3$. We further demonstrate that the measured scaling exponent is robustly pinned to $g=1/3$ across the plateau, only deviating as the bulk state becomes compressible. Finally we examine the impact of weak disorder on the scaling exponent, finding it insensitive. These measurements firmly establish the topological robustness of anyon tunneling at $\nu=1/3$ and substantiate the chiral Luttinger liquid description of the edge mode.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Variational Principles for Hybrid Non-Unitary Dynamics: Application to Driven-Dissipative Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce time-dependent variational principles to study the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum many-body systems, including dynamics described by the full Lindblad master equation, the non-Hermitian dynamics corresponding to the no-click limit of the fully post-selected quantum trajectories, and the dynamics described by a hybrid Lindbladian with a control parameter $\alpha$ which interpolates between the full post-selection and averaging over all quantum trajectories. As an application we study the non-unitary dynamics of a lossy or driven-dissipative BCS superconductors, evolving in presence of two-body losses and two-body pumps. We show that the non-Hermitian limit acts as a singular limit of the hybrid dissipative dynamics, leading to a sharp modification of the universal approach to the driven-dissipative steady-states. By considering the dissipative dynamics with pair losses, we show that, as the non-Hermitian limit is approached, the density dynamics sharply evolves from a universal power-law to exponential decay that converges towards a quasi-steady plateau characterized by the freezing of the particle depletion due to pair losses. The reached quasi-stationary density increases as a function of the dissipation rate highlighting the emergence of a non-Hermitian Zeno effect in the lossy dynamics. For the driven-dissipative case, we show that, in the non-Hermitian limit, the system gets trapped into an effective negative temperature state, thus skipping the infinite temperature steady-state reached in the presence of finite contribution of the quantum jumps. We rationalize these findings in terms of the conservation of the length of the pseudospins which, in the non-Hermitian limit, suppresses the effective single-particle losses and pumps acting on the non-condensed particles.</description>

Abstract: We investigate entanglement detection in quantum materials through criteria based on the simultaneous suppression of collective matter excitations. Unlike other detection schemes, these criteria can be applied to continuous and unbounded variables. By considering a system of interacting dipoles on a lattice, we show the detection of collective entanglement arising from two different physical mechanisms, namely, the ferroelectric ordering and the dressing of matter degrees of freedom by light. In the latter case, the detection shows the formation of a collective entangled phase not directly related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. These results open a new perspective for the entanglement characterization of competing orders in quantum materials, and have direct application to quantum paraelectrics with large polariton splittings.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases of Many-Body Localized Systems: Beyond Eigenstate Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00825v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an anomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries - called quantum cellular automata (QCA) - we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. We considerably develop the study of the topology of QCA, allowing us to classify static and driven ALT phases in low dimensions. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases) - which we also classify in low dimensions - and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.</description>

      <title>Spin excitations of the Shastry-Sutherland model -- altermagnetism and deconfined quantum criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frustrated quantum magnets can host a variety of exotic spin excitations, including fractionalized spin excitations coupled to emergent gauge fields at deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) and chiral magnons in altermagnets. Here, we investigate the spin excitation spectra of the highly frustrated $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) Shastry-Sutherland model, focusing on the evolution of low-energy collective modes from the N\'{e}el AFM phase to the plaquette valence bond solid (PVBS). We demonstrate that the AFM state exhibits altermagnetic behavior, characterized by a non-relativistic splitting between two chiral magnon bands. Furthermore, we identify two additional low-energy excitations: a Higgs mode in the longitudinal excitation channel and an $S=0$ excitation with vanishing spectral weight. As the system approaches the AFM-to-PVBS transition, both these modes soften along with the lowest-energy triplet and singlet modes in the PVBS state. The closing gap of the Higgs mode, combined with the nearly degenerate velocities of $S=1$ and $S=0$ excitations, provides spectral evidence that the AFM-to-PVBS transition is proximate to a DQCP with emergent $O(4)$ symmetry. Our results help clarify the spectral signature of a broad class of symmetry enhanced quantum phase transitions including deconfined quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities</title>

Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Tuning Charge Order in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br, Cl) via Uniaxial Strain</title>

Abstract: In condensed matter physics, experimental control of the properties of materials realizes the aspiration to physically govern the properties of materials and demonstrates an understanding of their underlying physics. In recent years, meaningful progress has been made towards a description of the physics of correlated electron systems, but examples of control of these systems remain rare. In this work, we confirm a phase diagram theoretically proposed for organic Mott insulators. We use $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br,Cl) (BEDT-TTF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafuvalene) materials as experimental realization of the proposed model and demonstrate the ability to tune them both ways across a phase border between a Mott insulator with a uniformly distributed charge and a charge ordered state through the application of uniaxial strain. We induce charge order at 33 K in the quantum dipole liquid material $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Br through the application of tensile strain of 0.4% along the c-axis. We suppress charge order down to 10 K in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Cl by applying a tensile strain of 1.6% along the b-axis. We use Raman scattering spectroscopy to probe both the charge state and a soft mode of collective dipole fluctuations close to the phase border.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic equilibrium in multi-Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hydrostatic equilibrium of multi-Weyl semimetals, a class of systems with Weyl-like quasi-particles but anisotropic dispersion relation $\omega^2 \sim k_\parallel^2 + k_\perp^{2n}$, with $n$ a possitive integer. A characteristic feature of multi-Weyl systems is the lack of Lorentz invariance, instead, they possess the reduced spacetime symmetry $(SO(1,1)\times SO(2))\ltimes \mathbb R^4$. In this work we propose a covariant formulation for the low energy theory, allowing for a minimal coupling of the fermion field to external geometric background and $U(1)$ gauge field. The non-Lorentzian structure of the field theory demands introducing an Aristotelian spacetime analogous to the so-called stringy Newton-Cartan geometry \cite{Andringa:2012uz}. Our proposal allows for a systematic study of the hydrostatic properties via the derivation of the partition function of the system. In addition to multi-Weyl models, our formulation can be applied to systems with similar spacetime symmetry groups, such as Bjorken flow.</description>

      <title>Probing fractional quantum Hall effect by photoluminescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states - fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states realized without an external magnetic field - in twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers represents a significant development in condensed matter physics. Notably, these states were first observed via photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Surprisingly, a general theoretical understanding of PL is not available even for the standard FQH states. For an ideal two-dimensional system, the energy of the emitted photon is predicted to be independent of the correlations, but we show that the PL intensity contains valuable information. Specifically, we predict that at finite temperatures, the PL intensity peaks at the Jain fillings \nu = n/(2n \pm 1), and away from these fillings, the binding energies of the composite-fermion excitons and trions can be deduced from the temperature dependence of the intensity. We discuss implications for PL experiments in semiconductor quantum wells and twisted TMD bilayers.</description>

      <title>Instability of the Haldane Phase: Roles of Charge Fluctuations and Hund's Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the stability of the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase in spin-1/2 Heisenberg and half-filled Hubbard ladders coupled by ferromagnetic Hund's interactions. Using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze key signatures of the Haldane phase: long-range string order, finite spin gap, and characteristic entanglement spectrum degeneracies. In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetric entanglers for non-invertible SPT phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (SPT), due to the lack of a stacking structure, do not have symmetric entanglers (globally symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits) connecting them. Using topological holography, we argue that a symmetric entangler should in fact exist for $1+1$d systems whenever the non-invertible symmetry has SPT phases connected by fixed-charge dualities (FCD). Moreover, we construct an explicit example of a symmetric entangler for the two SPT phases with $\mathrm{Rep}(A_4)$-symmetry, as a matrix product unitary (MPU).</description>

      <title>Transmon qutrit-based simulation of spin-1 AKLT systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qutrit-based quantum circuits could help reduce the overall circuit depths, and hence the effect of noise, when the system of interest has a local dimension of three. Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of qutrits useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate microwave pulse gates to a low error rate to operate transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki), which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena, such as topologically protected ground states, string order, and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. To establish the advantage of qutrits over qubits in the presence of noise, we present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase using tensor network simulations. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Influence of Fermi Surface Geometry and Van Hove Singularities on the Optical Response of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the sensitivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ to Fermi surface reconstructions under strain, we investigate how Fermi surface geometry and Van Hove singularities influence the optical Hall response and polar Kerr effect. Within a three-orbital model, we explore the impact of chemical potential and interlayer hopping on superconducting pairing and response functions. We find that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}+ig$ symmetries are the leading candidates for the quasi-2D orbital, while a chiral $p$-wave state in the quasi-1D orbitals is essential for generating an accessible Kerr angle. The Lifshitz transition is shown to affect coherence factors and density-of-states peaks, producing sharp signatures in $T_c$ and optical transport. Inter-orbital charge transfer further enhances these effects by modifying the balance between quasi-1D and quasi-2D contributions. These results provide a framework for interpreting Kerr effect experiments in multi-orbital superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization is predicted to enhance the critical temperature of disordered superconductors. Despite a huge body of theoretical work based on non-linear sigma models, experiments are lacking to understand correlated electrons in disordered potentials. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated groundstate. We analyze the statistical properties of tunneling conductance maps of increasingly localized states as we approach the edge of the valence band. Using multifractal analysis, we show that the system follows an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NLsMs). We anticipate that this symmetry may be broken in specific - e.g. chiral electronic phases. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis can equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments, thus providing a powerful tool to probe the underlying symmetries of disordered electronic phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00796v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Braids and Beams: Exploring Fractional Statistics with Mesoscopic Anyon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyon colliders -- quantum Hall devices where dilute quasiparticle beams collide at a quantum point contact -- provide an interferometer-free probe of anyonic exchange phases through current cross correlations. Within a non-equilibrium bosonization framework, the normalized cross-correlations take a universal form depending only on the exchange phase and the dynamical exponent, enabling experimental demonstration of anyonic statistics. This result can be interpreted as time-domain interference -- braiding in time rather than spatial exclusion or real-space interferometry. Extension to hierarchical states shows that the semiclassical step-function description of quasiparticles fails at large statistical angles. Introducing a finite soliton width resolves this issue and enables quantitative modeling of charge-$e/5$ quasiparticle collisions.</description>
