      <title>Phenomenon of self-oscillation in bubble dynamics: Bouncing acoustic bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-oscillations underlie many natural phenomena such as heartbeat, ocean waves, and the pulsation of variable stars. From pendulum clocks to the behavior of animal groups, self-oscillation is one of the keys to the understanding of synchronization phenomena and hence the collective behavior of interacting systems. In this study, we consider two closely spaced bubbles pulsating in the kHz range in response to ultrasonic excitation. A translational bouncing motion emerges from their interaction with a much lower frequency than the bubble pulsation frequency. Our analysis reveals that the observed bubble bouncing exhibits the main features of self-oscillation, such as negative damping and the emergence of a limit cycle. These results highlight unexpected nonlinear effects in the field of microbubbles and give insights into the understanding of synchronization in large bubble clouds.</description>

      <title>Paradox of description for motion of a hydrodynamic discontinuity in a potential and incompressible flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic discontinuities in an external potential and incompressible flow are investigated. Using the reaction front as an example in a 2D stream, an overdetermined system of equations is obtained that describes its motion in terms of the surface itself. Assuming that the harmonic flux approaching discontinuity is additional smooth, these equations can be used to determine the motion of this discontinuity without taking into account the influence of the flow behind the front, as well as the entire external flow. It is well known that for vanishingly low viscosity, the integral relation on the boundary (Dirichlet, Neumann problems) connects the tangential and normal components of the velocity. Knowing one of them along the boundary of the discontinuity, one can determine the entire external flow. However, assuming the external flow is smooth, this will also be the case for all derivatives of velocity with respect to coordinates and time. Then a paradox arises, knowing the position of the discontinuity and the velocity data at a point on its surface, it is possible to determine the motion of this discontinuity without taking into account the influence of the flow behind the front, as well as the entire external flow. There is no physical explanation for this mechanism. It is possible that a boundary layer is formed in front of the front, where viscosity plays a significant role and Euler equations are violated. It is argued that the classical idea of the motion of hydrodynamic discontinuities in the smooth, potential and incompressible flow in the external region should be supplemented in this case.</description>

      <title>Fourier neural operator for large eddy simulation of compressible Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourier neural operator (FNO) framework is applied to the large eddy simulation (LES) of three-dimensional compressible Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) turbulence with miscible fluids at Atwood number $A_t=0.5$, stratification parameter $Sr=1.0$, and Reynolds numbers $Re=10000$ and 30000. The FNO model is first used for predicting three-dimensional compressible turbulence. The different magnitudes of physical fields are normalized using root mean square values for an easier training of FNO models. In the \emph{a posteriori} tests, the FNO model outperforms the velocity gradient model (VGM), the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM), and implicit large eddy simulation (ILES) in predicting various statistical quantities and instantaneous structures, and is particularly superior to traditional LES methods in predicting temperature fields and velocity divergence. Moreover, the computational efficiency of the FNO model is much higher than that of traditional LES methods. FNO models trained with short-time, low Reynolds number data exhibit a good generalization performance on longer-time predictions and higher Reynolds numbers in the \emph{a posteriori} tests.</description>

      <title>Numerical validation of scaling laws for stratified turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical progress using multiscale asymptotic analysis has revealed various possible regimes of stratified turbulence. Notably, buoyancy transport can either be dominated by advection or diffusion, depending on the effective P\'eclet number of the flow. Two types of asymptotic models have been proposed, which yield measurably different predictions for the characteristic vertical velocity and length scale of the turbulent eddies in both diffusive and non-diffusive regimes. The first, termed a `single-scale model', is designed to describe flow structures having large horizontal and small vertical scales, while the second, termed a `multiscale model', additionally incorporates flow features with small horizontal scales, and reduces to the single-scale model in their absence. By comparing predicted vertical velocity scaling laws with direct numerical simulation data, we show that the multiscale model correctly captures the properties of strongly stratified turbulence within spatiotemporally-intermittent turbulent patches. Meanwhile its single-scale reduction accurately describes the more orderly layer-like flow outside those patches.</description>

      <title>Resolving turbulence and drag over textured surfaces using texture-less simulations: the case of slip/no-slip textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of surface texture on an overlying turbulent flow for the case of textures made of an alternating slip/no-slip pattern, a common model for superhydrophobic surfaces but also a particularly simple form of texture. For texture sizes $L^+ \lesssim 20$, we have previously reported that turbulence remained smooth-wall-like, other than experiencing an apparent origin offset for different flow components. For slip/no-slip textures, this effect reduced to the flow experiencing slip conditions in the streamwise and spanwise directions and zero transpiration at the surface. The overlying turbulence effectively perceived such boundary conditions at least up to texture sizes $L^+ \approx 50$. However, beyond $L^+ \approx 20$ the texture interacted with the overlying turbulence in a non-homogeneous fashion, additional Reynolds stresses arose and turbulence was no longer smooth-wall-like. This is the typical effect of surface texture observed for rough surfaces, and results in an increase in drag relative to smooth-wall flows. In this paper, we argue that this occurs because the texture modifies the overlying turbulence through non-linear, cross-advective terms between the background turbulence and the texture-coherent flow directly induced by the surface topology. To verify this, we conduct homogeneous-slip-length simulations where we introduce additional, forcing terms in the Navier-Stokes equations to capture the effect of this non-linear interaction on the background turbulence. The interaction can then be accounted for without the need to resolve the surface texture. We show that the additional terms quantitatively capture the changes in the flow up to texture sizes $L^+ \approx 70$--$100$, including not just the roughness function but also the flow statistics and structure.</description>

      <title>Turbulent cascade arrests and the formation of intermediate-scale condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy cascades lie at the heart of the dynamics of turbulent flows. In a recent study of turbulence in fluids with odd-viscosity [de Wit \textit{et al.}, Nature \textbf{627}, 515 (2024)], the two-dimensionalization of the flow at small scales leads to the arrest of the energy cascade and selection of an intermediate scale, between the forcing and the viscous scales. To investigate the generality of this phenomenon, we study a shell model that is carefully constructed to have three-dimensional turbulent dynamics at small wavenumbers and two-dimensional turbulent dynamics at large wavenumbers. The large scale separation that we can achieve in our shell model allows us to examine clearly the interplay between these dynamics, which leads to an arrest of the energy cascade at a transitional wavenumber and an associated accumulation of energy at the same scale. Such pile-up of energy around the transitional wavenumber is reminiscent of the formation of condensates in two-dimensional turbulence, \textit{but, in contrast, it occurs at intermediate wavenumbers instead of the smallest wavenumber</description>

      <title>Sparse space-time resolvent analysis for statistically-stationary and time-varying flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolvent analysis provides a framework to predict coherent spatio-temporal structures of largest linear energy amplification, through a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the resolvent operator, obtained by linearizing the Navier--Stokes equations about a known turbulent mean velocity profile. Resolvent analysis utilizes a Fourier decomposition in time, which has thus-far limited its application to statistically-stationary or time-periodic flows. This work develops a variant of resolvent analysis applicable to time-evolving flows, and proposes a variant that identifies spatio-temporally sparse structures, applicable to either stationary or time-varying mean velocity profiles. Spatio-temporal resolvent analysis is formulated through the incorporation of the temporal dimension to the numerical domain via a discrete time-differentiation operator. Sparsity (which manifests in localisation) is achieved through the addition of an L1-norm penalisation term to the optimisation associated with the SVD. This modified optimization problem can be formulated as a nonlinear eigenproblem, and solved via an inverse power method. We first demonstrate the implementation of the sparse analysis on statistically-stationary turbulent channel flow, and demonstrate that the sparse variant can identify aspects of the physics not directly evident from standard resolvent analysis. This is followed by applying the sparse space-time formulation on systems that are time-varying: a time-periodic turbulent Stokes boundary layer, and then a turbulent channel flow with a sudden change in pressure gradient. We present results demonstrating how the sparsity-promoting variant can either change the quantitative structure of the leading space-time modes to increase their sparsity, or identify entirely different linear amplification mechanisms compared to non-sparse resolvent analysis.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional turbulence above topography: condensation transition and selection of minimum enstrophy solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional flows above topography, revisiting the selective decay (or minimum-enstrophy) hypothesis of Bretherton and Haidvogel. We derive a `condensed branch' of solutions to the variational problem where a domain-scale condensate coexists with a flow at the (smaller) scale of the topography. The condensate arises through a supercritical bifurcation as the conserved energy of the initial condition exceeds a threshold value, a prediction that we quantitatively validate using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). We then consider the forced-dissipative case, showing how weak forcing and dissipation select a single dissipative state out of the continuum of solutions to the energy-conserving system predicted by selective decay. As the forcing strength increases, the condensate arises through a supercritical bifurcation for topographic-scale forcing and through a subcritical bifurcation for domain-scale forcing, both predictions being quantitatively validated by DNS. This method provides a way of determining the equilibrated state of forced-dissipative flows based on variational approaches to the associated energy-conserving system, such as the statistical mechanics of 2D flows or selective decay.</description>

      <title>Straight to zigzag transition of foam pseudo Plateau borders on textured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of liquid foams follows simple geometric rules formulated by Plateau 150 years ago. By placing such foam on a microtextured hydrophilic surface, we show that the bubble footprint exhibits a morphological transition. This transition concerns the liquid channels, also called pseudo Plateau borders, which are straight between vertices on a smooth surface. We demonstrate experimentally that for a sufficiently large roughness size compared to the width of the liquid channels, the footprint adopts a zigzag shape. This transition is associated with the absence of a wetting film between the pillars caused by capillary suction of the foam, observed by confocal microscopy. We rationalize the number of zigzag segments by a geometric distribution describing the observations made with the footprint perimeter and the mesh size of the asperities.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Deep Learning Based Super-Resolution For The Shallow Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the nonlinear shallow water equations as benchmark, we demonstrate that a simulation with the ICON-O ocean model with a 20km resolution that is frequently corrected by a U-net-type neural network can achieve discretization errors of a simulation with 10km resolution. The network, originally developed for image-based super-resolution in post-processing, is trained to compute the difference between solutions on both meshes and is used to correct the coarse mesh every 12h. Our setup is the Galewsky test case, modeling transition of a barotropic instability into turbulent flow. We show that the ML-corrected coarse resolution run correctly maintains a balance flow and captures the transition to turbulence in line with the higher resolution simulation. After 8 day of simulation, the $L_2$-error of the corrected run is similar to a simulation run on the finer mesh. While mass is conserved in the corrected runs, we observe some spurious generation of kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Development of low-dissipative projection method framework integrating various high-order time integration schemes using OpenFOAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A low-dissipative solution framework integrating various types of high-order time scheme is proposed and implemented based on the open-source C++ library OpenFOAM. This framework aims to introduce different categories of low-dissipative time integration schemes into a unified solver convenient for comparison of scheme performance in finite volume computational fluid dynamics code, contributing to the development of low dissipation scheme appropriate for scale-resolving turbulence simulation. To demonstrate this general framework's ability of including a wide range of time integration method, in addition to typical Runge--Kutta family schemes of linear single-step method, two more complex linear multi-step method, Adams--Bashforth family and Adams--Bashforth--Moutton family schemes, are implemented with the projection algorithm, which increase the options of time discretization. The unified solver obtained by the solution framework select the specified time scheme from a variety of alternatives in runtime rather than maintaining multiple solvers with each compiled for a single scheme, while new scheme can be easily added according to the basic idea of this universal framework. Further research on the stability of the explicit scheme indicates that a multi-step method with an appropriate order may be an optimal choice when taking both the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency into account in unstable problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking bifurcations, where a flow state with a certain symmetry undergoes a transition to state with a different symmetry, are ubiquitous in fluid mechanics. Much can be understood about the nature of these transitions from symmetry alone, using the theory of groups and their representations. Here we show how the extensive databases on groups in crystallography can be exploited to yield insights into fluid-dynamical problems. In particular, we demonstrate the application of the crystallographic layer groups to problems in fluid layers, using thermal convection as an example. Crystallographic notation provides a concise and unambiguous description of the symmetries involved, and we advocate its broader use by the fluid dynamics community.</description>

      <title>Migration of two Interacting Micro-Confined Deformable Drops Under an Imposed Temperature Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tiny drop of one liquid, suspended within another, may be set into motion aligned with an imposed thermal gradient, as influenced by thermocapillary action stemming from the gradients in interfacial tension due to the local variations in temperature. In real-world situations, however, such drops do not remain in isolation, as they interact with their neighbouring entities including other drops in the proximity as well as a nearby solid boundary, setting up a complex interplay between the confinement-mediated interactions and three-dimensional nature of the droplet dynamics. In this study, we present numerical solutions for the migration dynamics of a tightly-confined drop-couple, incorporating deformable interfaces, film flow, and Marangoni effects in the presence of dynamically evolving thermocapillary stresses induced by an imposed uniform temperature gradient. Unlike prior investigations, our work highlights the influence of the confinement towards orchestrating non-trivial features of drop migration, as dictated by an intricate coupling of the thermal and flow fields amidst the interferences of the domain boundaries. The study reveals that hydrodynamic interactions resulting from a juxtaposition of these influences deform the drops in a unique manner as compared to the characteristics evidenced from previously reported studies, causing a distortion of the local thermal fields around them. The consequent alteration in the drop velocities is shown to govern their migration in a distinctive manner, presenting unique signatures as compared to more restrictive scenarios studied previously. These findings hold significance in designing thermocapillary-driven micro-confined systems for controlling drop trajectories under an imposed thermal field, bearing far-reaching implications in a plethora of overarching applications ranging from droplet microfluidics to space technology.</description>

      <title>Strongly stable dual-pairing summation by parts finite difference schemes for the vector invariant nonlinear shallow water equations -- I: Numerical scheme and validation on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an energy/entropy stable and high order accurate finite difference method for solving the nonlinear (rotating) shallow water equations (SWE) in vector invariant form using the newly developed dual-pairing and dispersion-relation preserving summation-by-parts finite difference operators. We derive new well-posed boundary conditions for the SWE in one space dimension, formulated in terms of fluxes and applicable to linear and nonlinear SWEs. For the nonlinear SWE, entropy stability ensures the boundedness of numerical solution but does not guarantee convergence. Adequate amount of numerical dissipation is necessary to control high frequency errors which could negatively impact accuracy in the numerical simulations. Using the dual-pairing summation by parts framework, we derive high order accurate and nonlinear hyper-viscosity operator which dissipates entropy and enstrophy. The hyper-viscosity operator effectively minimises oscillations from shocks and discontinuities, and eliminates high frequency grid-scale errors. The numerical method is most suitable for the simulations of subcritical flows typically observed in atmospheric and geostrophic flow problems. We prove a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete approximations of both linear and nonlinear SWE. Convergence, accuracy, and well-balanced properties are verified via the method of manufactured solutions and canonical test problems such as the dam break and lake at rest. Numerical simulations in two-dimensions are presented which include the rotating and merging vortex problem and barotropic shear instability, with fully developed turbulence.</description>
