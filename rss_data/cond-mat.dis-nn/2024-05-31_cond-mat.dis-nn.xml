      <title>Neural Scaling Laws From Large-N Field Theory: Solvable Model Beyond the Ridgeless Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many machine learning models based on neural networks exhibit scaling laws: their performance scales as power laws with respect to the sizes of the model and training data set. We use large-N field theory methods to solve a model recently proposed by Maloney, Roberts and Sully which provides a simplified setting to study neural scaling laws. Our solution extends the result in this latter paper to general nonzero values of the ridge parameter, which are essential to regularize the behavior of the model. In addition to obtaining new and more precise scaling laws, we also uncover a duality transformation at the diagrams level which explains the symmetry between model and training data set sizes. The same duality underlies recent efforts to design neural networks to simulate quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Computing Elastic Tensors of Amorphous Materials from First-Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in modern semiconductor devices increasingly depend on the utilization of amorphous materials and the reduction of material thickness, pushing the boundaries of their physical capabilities. The mechanical properties of these thin layers are critical in determining both the operational efficacy and mechanical integrity of these devices. Unlike bulk crystalline materials, whose calculation techniques are well-established, amorphous materials present a challenge due to the significant variation in atomic topology and their non-affine transformations under external strain. This study introduces a novel method for computing the elastic tensor of amorphous materials, applicable to both bulk and ultra-thin films in the linear elastic regime using Density Functional Theory. We exemplify this method with a-SiO2, a commonly used dielectric. Our approach accounts for the structural disorder inherent in amorphous systems, which, while contributing to remarkable material properties, complicates traditional elastic tensor computation. We propose a solution involving the inability of atomic positions to relax under internal relaxation, near the boundaries of the computational unit cell, ensuring the affine transformations necessary for linear elasticity. This method's efficacy is demonstrated through its alignment with classical Young's modulus measurements, and has potential for broad application in fields such as Technology Computer Aided Design and stress analysis via Raman spectra. The revised technique for assessing the mechanical properties of amorphous materials opens new avenues for exploring their impact on device reliability and functionality.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics of principal minors: Cavity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determinants are useful to represent the state of an interacting system of (effectively) repulsive and independent elements, like fermions in a quantum system and training samples in a learning problem. A computationally challenging problem is to compute the sum of powers of principal minors of a matrix which is relevant to the study of critical behaviors in quantum fermionic systems and finding a subset of maximally informative training data for a learning algorithm. Specifically, principal minors of positive square matrices can be considered as statistical weights of a random point process on the set of the matrix indices. The probability of each subset of the indices is in general proportional to a positive power of the determinant of the associated sub-matrix. We use Gaussian representation of the determinants for symmetric and positive matrices to estimate the partition function (or free energy) and the entropy of principal minors within the Bethe approximation. The results are expected to be asymptotically exact for diagonally dominant matrices with locally tree-like structures. We consider the Laplacian matrix of random regular graphs of degree $K=2,3,4$ and exactly characterize the structure of the relevant minors in a mean-field model of such matrices. No (finite-temperature) phase transition is observed in this class of diagonally dominant matrices by increasing the positive power of the principal minors, which here plays the role of an inverse temperature.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Correlations in Elastic Moduli and Local Stresses at the Unjamming Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the behavior of spatially heterogeneous elastic moduli as well as the correlations between local moduli in model solids with short-range repulsive potentials. We show through numerical simulations that local elastic moduli exhibit long-range correlations, similar to correlations in the local stresses. Specifically, the correlations in local shear moduli exhibit anisotropic behavior at large lengthscales characterized by pinch-point singularities in Fourier space, displaying a structural pattern akin to shear stress correlations. Focussing on two-dimensional jammed solids approaching the unjamming transition, we show that stress correlations exhibit universal properties, characterized by a quadratic $p^2$ dependence of the correlations as the pressure $p$ approaches zero, independent of the details of the model. In contrast, the modulus correlations exhibit a power-law dependence with different exponents depending on the specific interaction potential. Furthermore, we illustrate that while affine responses lack long-range correlations, the total modulus, which encompasses non-affine behavior, exhibits long-range correlations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Descent-like relaxation is equivalent to Metropolis dynamics in discrete optimization and inference problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) substantially different from Metropolis Monte Carlo dynamics? This is a fundamental question at the time of understanding the most used training algorithm in the field of Machine Learning, but it received no answer until now. Here we show that in discrete optimization and inference problems, the dynamics of an SGD-like algorithm resemble very closely that of Metropolis Monte Carlo with a properly chosen temperature, which depends on the mini-batch size. This quantitative matching holds both at equilibrium and in the out-of-equilibrium regime, despite the two algorithms having fundamental differences (e.g.\ SGD does not satisfy detailed balance). Such equivalence allows us to use results about performances and limits of Monte Carlo algorithms to optimize the mini-batch size in the SGD-like algorithm and make it efficient at recovering the signal in hard inference problems.</description>

      <title>A random matrix model for the density of states of jammed soft spheres with applied stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the addition of applied stress to a random block matrix model introduced by Parisi to study the Hessian matrix of soft spheres near the jamming point. In the infinite dimensional limit the applied stress translates the spectral distribution to the left, leading to a stability constraint. With negative stress, as in the case of a random network of stretched elastic springs, the spectral distribution is translated to the right, and the density of states has a peak before the plateau.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning the Disorder Landscape of Majorana Nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a practical machine learning approach to determine the disorder landscape of Majorana nanowires by using training of the conductance matrix and inverting the conductance data in order to obtain the disorder details in the system. The inversion carried out through machine learning using different disorder parametrizations turns out to be unique in the sense that any input tunnel conductance as a function of chemical potential and Zeeman energy can indeed be inverted to provide the correct disorder landscape. Our work opens up a qualitatively new direction of directly determining the topological invariant and the Majorana wave-function structure corresponding to a transport profile of a device using simulations that quantitatively match the specific conductance profile. In addition, this also opens up the possibility for optimizing Majorana systems by figuring out the (generally unknown) underlying disorder only through the conductance data. An accurate estimate of the applicable spin-orbit coupling in the system can also be obtained within the same scheme.</description>

      <title>Statistics of local level spacings in single- and many-body quantum chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of local level spacings and study their statistics within a random-matrix-theory approach. In the limit of infinite-dimensional random matrices, we determine universal sequences of mean local spacings and of their ratios which uniquely identify the global symmetries of a quantum system and its internal -- chaotic or regular -- dynamics. These findings, which offer a new framework to monitor single- and many-body quantum systems, are corroborated by numerical experiments performed for zeros of the Riemann zeta function, spectra of irrational rectangular billiards and many-body spectra of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Rydberg platform for non-ergodic chiral quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for engineering chiral interactions in Rydberg atoms via a directional antiblockade condition, where an atom can change its state only if an atom to its right (or left) is excited. The scalability of our scheme enables us to explore the many-body dynamics of kinetically constrained models with unidirectional character. We observe non-ergodic behavior via either scars, confinement, or localization, upon simply tuning the strength of two driving fields acting on the atoms. We discuss how our mechanism persists in the presence of classical noise and how the degree of chirality in the interactions can be tuned, opening towards the frontier of directional, strongly correlated, quantum mechanics using neutral atoms arrays.</description>

      <title>Performance Assessment of Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: Challenges and Directions for Materials' Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are one of the main techniques in the materials science toolbox, able to bridge ab initio accuracy with the computational efficiency of classical force fields. This allows simulations ranging from atoms, molecules, and biosystems, to solid and bulk materials, surfaces, nanomaterials, and their interfaces and complex interactions. A recent class of advanced MLIPs, which use equivariant representations and deep graph neural networks, is known as universal models. These models are proposed as foundational models suitable for any system, covering most elements from the periodic table. Current universal MLIPs (UIPs) have been trained with the largest consistent dataset available nowadays. However, these are composed mostly of bulk materials' DFT calculations. In this article, we assess the universality of all openly available UIPs, namely MACE, CHGNet, and M3GNet, in a representative task of generalization: calculation of surface energies. We find that the out-of-the-box foundational models have significant shortcomings in this task, with errors correlated to the total energy of surface simulations, having an out-of-domain distance from the training dataset. Our results show that while UIPs are an efficient starting point for fine-tuning specialized models, we envision the potential of increasing the coverage of the materials space towards universal training datasets for MLIPs.</description>
