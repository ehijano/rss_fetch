      <title>The Gaia parallax discrepancy for the cluster Pismis 19, and separating $\delta$ Scutis from Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-Gaia distances for the open cluster Pismis 19 disagree with Gaia parallaxes. A 2MASS $JK_s$ red clump distance was therefore established for Pismis 19 ($2.90\pm0.15$ kpc), which reaffirms that zero-point corrections for Gaia are required (e.g., Lindegren et al.~2021). OGLE GD-CEP-1864 is confirmed as a member of Pismis 19 on the basis of DR3 proper motions, and its 2MASS+VVV color-magnitude position near the tip of the turnoff. That $0^{\rm d}.3$ variable star is likely a $\delta$ Scuti rather than a classical Cepheid. The case revealed a pertinent criterion to segregate those two populations in tandem with the break in the Wesenheit Leavitt Law ($\simeq 0^{\rm d}.5$). Just shortward of that period discontinuity are $\delta$ Scutis, whereas beyond the break lie first overtone classical Cepheids mostly observed beyond the first crossing of the instability strip.</description>

      <title>Properties of Turbulent Convection and Large-Scale Flows in a Rotating F-type Star Revealed by 3D Realistic Radiative Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear coupling between stellar convection and rotation is of great interest because it relates to understanding both stellar evolution and activity. We investigated the influence of rotation and the Coriolis force on the dynamics and thermodynamic structure of an F-type main-sequence star with a shallow outer convection zone. We performed a series of 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of a 1.47Msun star for different rotation rates (periods of rotation 1 and 14 days) and with computational domains placed at latitudes of 0degrees (equator), 30degrees, and 60degrees. Because the star has a relatively shallow convection zone (28.5 Mm thick or about 2.81% R*), we model its dynamics from the upper layers of the radiative zone, the whole convection zone, and the low atmosphere. The simulation results show a weak shift of the ionization zones to the photosphere and a decrease of the stellar radius by about 29 km at the equator and about 58 km at higher latitudes in the presence of rotation with a period of 1 day. The models presented reveal the formation of radial differential rotation, meridional flows, latitude-dependent roll-like structures of convection, a tachocline, the presence of a gravity-darkening effect, and others. In this paper, we primarily discuss the properties of the outer convection zone for different rotation rates. Detailed analysis of the properties of the tachocline, the overshoot layer, and small-scale turbulence will be discussed in follow-on papers.</description>

      <title>SIP-IFVM: A time-evolving coronal model with an extended magnetic field decomposition strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-evolving magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) coronal modeling, driven by a series of time-dependent photospheric magnetograms, represents a new generation of coronal simulations. This approach offers greater realism compared to traditional coronal models constrained by a static magnetogram. However, its practical application is seriously limited by low computational efficiency and poor numerical stability. Therefore, we propose an extended magnetic field decomposition strategy and implement it in the implicit MHD model to develop a coronal model that is both efficient and numerically stable enough for simulating the long-term evolutions of the global corona. The traditional decomposition strategies split the magnetic field into a time-invariant potential field and a time-dependent component $\mathbf{B}_1$. It works well for quasi-steady-state coronal simulations where $\left|\mathbf{B}_1\right|$ is typically small. However, as the inner-boundary magnetic field evolves, $\left|\mathbf{B}_1\right|$ can grow significantly larger and its discretization errors often lead to nonphysical negative thermal pressure, ultimately causing the code to crash. In this paper, we mitigate such undesired situations by introducing a temporally piecewise-constant variable to accommodate part of the non-potential field and remain $\left|\mathbf{B}_1\right|$ consistently small throughout the simulations. We incorporate this novel magnetic field decomposition strategy into our implicit MHD coronal model and apply it to simulate the evolution of coronal structures within 0.1 AU over two solar-maximum Carrington rotations. The results show that this coronal model effectively captures observations and performs more than 80 times faster than real time using only 192 CPU cores, making it well-suited for practical applications in simulating the time-evolving corona.</description>

      <title>Observations and Radiative Transfer Simulations of the Carbon-rich AGB star V Oph with VLTI/MATISSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are among the most important contributors of enriched materials to the interstellar medium due to their strong stellar winds. To fully characterize mass loss on the AGB, it is necessary to determine the distributions of dust and gas around the stars, where the dust begins to condense from the gas, and how this extended atmospheric structure evolves over the pulsational period of the star. We present an analysis of L-band (2.8-4.2 $\mu$m) interferometric observations of the carbon-rich AGB star V Oph made with the MATISSE instrument at the VLTI at the maximum and minimum of the star's visual light curve. Using the radiative transfer software RADMC-3D, we model the circumstellar dust shell, and find stellar radii of 395 and 495 $R_{\odot}$ at the two phases, and dust radii of 790 and 742.5 $R_{\odot}$ at the two epochs, respectively. By adding C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN gas to the RADMC-3D models, we are able to fit the visibility spectra well, with some deviations at the 3.11 $\mu$m feature. Reasons for this deviation and interpretation of the best fitting models are discussed in the text, and we discuss motivations for follow-up imaging observations of V Oph.</description>

      <title>Gaia 19cwm - an eclipsing dwarf nova of WZ Sge type with a magnetic white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07447v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral and photometric studies of the cataclysmic variable Gaia 19cwm (or ZTF19aamkwxk) have been performed. Based on the analysis of long-term variability, it is concluded that the object belongs to WZ Sge type stars. The light curves show eclipses recurring with an orbital period of $86.32048 \pm 0.00005$ min, as well as an out-of-eclipse variability with a period of $\approx 6.45$ min. The latter period is stable for $\sim 4$ years and appears to correspond to the rotation of a magnetic white dwarf, i.e., Gaia 19cwm is an intermediate polar. The Gaia 19cwm spectra show photospheric lines of the white dwarf, and Doppler tomograms demonstrate the presence of an accretion disk and a hot spot. Analysis of the eclipse light curve gives an estimates of the white dwarf mass $M_1 = 0.66\pm0.06$ M$_{\odot}$, the donor mass $M_2 = 0.073 \pm 0.015$ M$_{\odot}$, and the orbital inclination $i=83.8 \pm 1.1^{\circ}$. Modeling of the spectral energy distribution gives the white dwarf temperature of $T_{eff}\approx 13000 $ K. The X-ray luminosity $L_X = (1.6 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{31}$ erg/s allows to assign Gaia 19cwm to a small group of low-luminosity intermediate polars.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Polar Magnetic Fields using Ca II K Polar Network as a Proxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polar magnetic field plays a crucial role in the solar dynamo model and contributes to predicting future solar cycles. However, continuous and direct measurements of this polar field have been available only since 1976, with data provided by the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO). Recent findings suggest that the Ca ii K Polar Network Index (PNI) can serve as a promising proxy for estimating the polar field of the Sun. In this study, we aim to reconstruct the polar field for the pre-1976 period by leveraging Ca ii K data from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO; 1904-2007) and modern Ca ii K observations from the Rome Precision Solar Photometric Telescope (Rome-PSPT; 2000-2022). We employ an automatic adaptive threshold technique to detect polar networks and calculate PNI values. Then, we calibrate these PNI values with the WSO polar field to reconstruct the polar field over 119 years.</description>

      <title>The Impacts of Magnetogram Projection Effects on Solar Flare Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the impacts of magnetogram projection effects on machine learning-based solar flare forecasting models. Utilizing a methodology proposed by Falconer et al. (2016), we correct for projection effects present in Georgia State University's Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares (SWAN-SF) benchmark data set. We then train and run a support vector machine classifier on the corrected and uncorrected data, comparing differences in performance. Additionally, we provide insight into several other methodologies that mitigate projection effects, such as stacking ensemble classifiers and active region location-informed models. Our analysis shows that data corrections slightly increase both the true positive (correctly predicted flaring samples) and false positive (non-flaring samples predicted as flaring) prediction rates, averaging a few percent. Similarly, changes in performance metrics are minimal for the stacking ensemble and location-based model. This suggests that a more complicated correction methodology may be needed to see improvements. It may also indicate inherent limitations when using magnetogram data for flare forecasting.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Observation of Mini-Filament Eruptions Near Coronal Hole Boundary and Their Response in Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated mini-filament (MF) eruptions near coronal hole (CH) boundaries to explore their role in coronal dynamics and their potential contributions to the solar wind. Using high-resolution H$\alpha$ images from the 1.6m Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory and EUV data from AIA 193 \AA~ from Solar Dynamic Observatory, we analyzed 28 MFE events over 7.5 hours of observation spanning 5 days. Three largest MF eruptions triggered distinct coronal responses: two consecutive MFEs produced a small-scale eruptive coronal ejection, while the other generated a jet-like brightening. Furthermore, the 25 smaller-scale MFEs were associated with localized brightenings in coronal bright points (CBPs). These findings suggest that MFs play a significant role in transferring mass and magnetic flux to the corona, particularly within CH regions. We found certain trend that the size of MFEs is correlated with the EUV emissions. In addition, we observed magnetic flux cancellation associated with MFEs. However, except for a few largest MFEs, quantitative analysis of magnetic field evolution is beyond the capability of the data. These results underscore the importance of MFEs in the dynamic coupling between the chromosphere and corona, highlighting their potential role in shaping heliospheric structures. Although current study covers smallest MFEs ever studied, future higher-cadence, more accurate magnetograms and multi-wavelength observations are essential to fully resolve the fine-scale dynamics of these ubiquitous solar phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Tentative Detection of a Point Source in the Disk Gap of HD 100546 with VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS Sparse Aperture Masking Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-analyze VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS K and H-band sparse aperture masking interferometry data of the transition disk HD 100546 observed in 2018 and 2021, respectively. We fit geometrical models to the closure phases extracted from both datasets. We compare three model classes: a forward scattering disk, a forward scattering disk plus an arbitrary asymmetric disk feature and a forward scattering disk plus an unresolved point source in the disk-gap. We find that the forward scattering disk plus point source model is the best representation of the data. We find that this point source candidate moved from a position of sep. = $39.9^{+2.8}_{-3.3}$ mas, P.A. = $124.1^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$ degrees to a sep. = $50.0^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$ mas, P.A. = $106.4^{+1.4}_{-1.4}$ degrees between 2018 and 2021. Both of these positions are well within the $\sim$13 au ($\sim$120 mas) disk-gap, favouring the point source interpretation. We explore the orbital parameter space that is consistent with the measured relative astrometry. We find orbits either with a similar orientation to the outer disk, with a high eccentricity $e \gtrapprox 0.65$, or orbits with a large relative inclination ($\sim$60 degrees) to the outer disk, and any eccentricity. Despite the significance of the observed point-source signal, follow-up observations will be necessary to conclusively determine its nature.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Staircase delta Scuti Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of the previously classified delta Scuti variable star MW Camelopardalis using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Telescope sparked a deeper inquiry due to the unexpected patterns within the target's observed-calculated graph. From the shape of the O-C diagram we have designed these objects as Staircase delta Scuti. The pattern was found to be replicated in the O-C graphs of seven additional targets. The objects are TIC 17931346, TIC 44845403, TIC 123580083, TIC 173503902, TIC 302394816, TIC 194944219, and TIC 396465600. The Q value for the targets, their position in the delta Scuti Leavitt Law, and location in the instability strip would show these objects to be low mass, fundamental pulsators, near the red edge of the instability strip. We also discuss the impact this phenomenon could have on the analysis of all pulsating variable stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Cryoscope -- a new 50 sq. deg field-of-view, 1.2 m aperture, K-dark survey telescope to be located at Dome C, Antarctica. Cryoscope has an innovative optical-thermal design wherein the entire telescope is cryogenically cooled. Cryoscope also explores new detector technology to cost-effectively tile the full focal plane. Leveraging the dark Antarctic sky and minimizing telescope thermal emission, Cryoscope achieves unprecedented deep, wide, fast and red observations, matching and exceeding volumetric survey speeds from the Ultraviolet Explorer, Vera Rubin Observatory, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. By providing coverage beyond wavelengths of 2 $\mu$m, we aim to create the most comprehensive dynamic movie of the most obscured reaches of the Universe. Cryoscope will be a dedicated discovery engine for electromagnetic emission from coalescing compact binaries, Earth-like exoplanets orbiting cold stars, and multiple facets of time-domain, stellar and solar system science. In this paper, we describe the scientific drivers and technical innovations for this new discovery engine operating in the K-dark passband, why we choose to deploy it in Antarctica, and the status of a fifth-scale prototype designed as a Pathfinder to retire technological risks prior to full-scale implementation.</description>

      <title>Multi-band study of the flaring mode emission in the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the flaring mode of the transitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) PSR J1023+0038 during its X-ray sub-luminous state, using strictly simultaneous X-ray, UV, optical, and radio observations. The X-ray flares exhibit UV and optical counterparts and coincide with the brightest radio flare observed in the past decade, reaching 1.2 mJy at 6 GHz and lasting ~1 hour. During the flare, the optical polarization drops from ~1.4% to ~0.5%, indicating the emergence of an unpolarized component. We propose that the thickening of the disc, which enlarges the shock region between the pulsar wind and the accretion flow and may drive the X-ray flaring observed in tMSPs, enhances the ionization level of the disc, thereby generating an increased number of free electrons. These electrons could then be channelled by magnetic field lines into the jet. This increased jet mass-loading could drive the associated radio and optical variability. The radio spectral evolution during flares is consistent with synchrotron self-absorption in jet ejecta or internal shocks within the compact jet. We infer radio polarization upper limits (&lt;8.7%, &lt;2.3%, and &lt;8.2%, before, during, and after the radio flare) that further support a compact jet origin but do not rule out discrete ejections. Our findings suggest that tMSPs could serve as essential laboratories for investigating jet-launching mechanisms, mainly because they operate under very low mass accretion rates. This accretion regime has not been explored before in the context of the accretion-ejection coupling.</description>

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>

Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with the solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes, then they may persist long enough to quiescently provide enough mass in dense matter regions to allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~5 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to form quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a metastable transition between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars with event horizons, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of mesons.</description>

      <title>The SPIRou Legacy Survey: near-infrared and optical radial velocity analysis of Gl 480 and Gl 382 using SPIRou, HARPS and CARMENES spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07086v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Advancements in the field of exoplanetary research have extended radial velocity (RV) observations from the optical to the near-infrared (nIR) domain. M dwarf stars, characterized by their lower masses and higher prevalence of rocky planets, have become a focal point of investigation. This study uses data from the near-infrared spectropolarimeter SPIRou and data available in the literature from the HARPS and CARMENES spectrographs operating in the optical to analyze RVs of two nearby M dwarfs, Gl 480 and Gl 382.
  Aims: This work aims to detect and characterize exoplanetary companions around Gl 480 and Gl 382 by mitigating stellar activity effects through advanced data analysis techniques. The study seeks to improve the reliability of RV signals by integrating multi-wavelength observations and stellar activity diagnostics.
  Methods: The study employs a comprehensive approach that combines the line-by-line (LBL) framework with the Wapiti (Weighted principAl comPonent analysIs reconsTructIon) method to correct for systematics in SPIRou data. Through an extensive analysis of available stellar activity indicators and by combining optical data from the HARPS and CARMENES instruments, we perform a joint analysis of RV measurements in both the nIR and optical domains.
  Results: Our analysis confirms the detection of a planet orbiting Gl 480 with a period of $9.5537 \pm 0.0005$ d and a minimum mass of $8.8 \pm 0.7$ M$_\oplus$. Additionally, we detect a tentative signal at 6.4 d, whose significance depends strongly on the choice of Gaussian Process priors constrained by stellar activity indicators and would require further observations for confirmation. In contrast, no planetary signals are detected for Gl 382, where RV variations are dominated by stellar activity.</description>

      <title>Flat U-Net: An Efficient Ultralightweight Model for Solar Filament Segmentation in Full-disk H$\alpha$ Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar filaments are one of the most prominent features observed on the Sun, and their evolutions are closely related to various solar activities, such as flares and coronal mass ejections. Real-time automated identification of solar filaments is the most effective approach to managing large volumes of data. Existing models of filament identification are characterized by large parameter sizes and high computational costs, which limit their future applications in highly integrated and intelligent ground-based and space-borne observation devices. Consequently, the design of more lightweight models will facilitate the advancement of intelligent observation equipment. In this study, we introduce Flat U-Net, a novel and highly efficient ultralightweight model that incorporates simplified channel attention (SCA) and channel self-attention (CSA) convolutional blocks for the segmentation of solar filaments in full-disk H$\alpha$ images. Feature information from each network layer is fully extracted to reconstruct interchannel feature representations. Each block effectively optimizes the channel features from the previous layer, significantly reducing parameters. The network architecture presents an elegant flattening, improving its efficiency, and simplifying the overall design. Experimental validation demonstrates that a model composed of pure SCAs achieves a precision of approximately 0.93, with dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and recall rates of 0.76 and 0.64, respectively, significantly outperforming the classical U-Net. Introducing a certain number of CSA blocks improves the DSC and recall rates to 0.82 and 0.74, respectively, which demonstrates a pronounced advantage, particularly concerning model weight size and detection effectiveness. The data set, models, and code are available as open-source resources.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Chemical Complexity in the W75N Star-Forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07621v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of NOEMA interferometric observations of the high-mass star-forming region W75N(B) with a focus on molecular composition and distribution of prebiotic molecules in the source's multiple cores. Over twenty molecules are identified across the region, with many being fit for column density, rotational temperature, spectral line full width half maximum, and v$_{lsr}$. This work includes the first known detection and initial analysis of complex organic molecules in the MM2 and MM3 regions. Furthermore, parameter maps were created from the six molecules that were well fit across multiple regions. The molecular emission was imaged and correlated across different molecules and the continuum to reveal structural features. From the spatial and spectral analysis of the MM1 region, these results concur with those from other studies showing that there is a difference in chemical composition between the MM1a and MM1b regions, with sulfur-bearing molecules tracing MM1a and organic molecules tracing MM1b. The molecular emission imaged toward the MM3 region reveals two peaks, possibly indicating the presence of multiple young stellar objects. These results provide detailed quantitative information about the physical parameters and distributions of molecules in this source. Additionally, these results are part of a follow-up of a single-dish survey of multiple star-forming regions and are discussed in this context.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SPectra Analysis and Retrievable Catalog Lab (SPARCL) at NOIRLab's Astro Data Lab was created to efficiently serve large optical and infrared spectroscopic datasets. It consists of services, tools, example workflows and currently contains spectra for over 7.5 million stars, galaxies and quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. We aim to eventually support the broad range of spectroscopic datasets that will be hosted at NOIRLab and beyond. Major elements of SPARCL include capabilities to discover and query for spectra based on parameters of interest, a fast web service that delivers desired spectra either individually or in bulk as well as documentation and example Jupyter Notebooks to empower users in their research. More information is available on the SPARCL website (https://astrosparcl.datalab.noirlab.edu).</description>

      <title>Higher-order moment convergent method in weakly anisotropic plasma and the NLVFP code for solution of the 0D-2V Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fusion plasma and space plasma are typical non-equilibrium and nonlinear systems, with the interactions between different species well described by the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equations. The transport of mass, momentum, energy, and temperature relaxation are important issues, which are affected by the collision term of VFP even in so-called collisionless plasma domain. Hence, nonlinearity and collisions are important features in large regime. A successful numerical simulation for non-equilibrium plasma has to be able to conserve mass, momentum and energy, while satisfying Boltzmann's H-theorem and higher-order moment convergence. An expansion of the distribution function in spherical harmonics (Legendre basis when the velocity space exhibits axisymmetry) in angle coordinate and in King basis in speed coordinate of velocity space is well suited to address these requirements. This paper reviews the formulation of the 0D-2V VFP equation in terms of spherical harmonics coupled with King function and its solution in our NLVFP code. In this topic review, we will introduce the background physics related to the nonlinear VFP simulation, then describe NLVFP for 0D-2V homogeneous, weakly anisotropic plasma with utilization of the Shkarofsky's form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth (FPRS) collision operator.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Fall: Stationary and super-Keplerian spiral arms generated by accretion streamers in protostellar discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Late-stage infall onto evolved protoplanetary discs is an important source of material and angular momentum replenishment, and disc substructures. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model streamer-disc interactions for a prograde streamer. The initially parabolic streamer interacts with the disc material to excite disc eccentricity, which can last on the order of $10^5$ years. We found that the spiral arms the streamer excited in the disc can have a variety of pattern speeds, ranging from stationary to super-Keplerian. Spiral arms with various pattern speeds can exist simultaneously, providing a way to diagnose them in observations. Streamer induced spirals appear similar to those generated by a massive outer companion, where the pitch angle of the spiral increases towards the source of the perturbation. Additionally, the spirals arms can show large and sudden pitch angle changes. Streamer induced spirals are long-lived, lasting approximately $3-4\times$ longer than the initial streamer infall timescale ($\sim$$10^4$ years). After the initial interaction with the disc, a long lasting low $m$ azimuthal mode persists in the disc.</description>

      <title>An anisotropic plasma model of the heliospheric interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pioneering model of the interaction between the solar wind and the surrounding interstellar medium that includes the possibility of different pressures in directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. The outer heliosheath region is characterized by a low rate of turbulent scattering that would permit development of pressure anisotropy. The effect is best seen on the interstellar side of the heliopause, where a narrow region develops with an excessive perpendicular pressure resembling a plasma depletion layer typical of planetary magnetspheres. The magnitude of this effect for typical heliospheric conditions is relatively small owing to proton-proton collisions. We show, however, that if the circumstellar medium is warm and tenuous, a much broader anisotropic boundary layer can exist, with a dominant perpendicular pressure in the southern hemisphere and a dominant parallel pressure in the north.</description>

      <title>The First Spin-Orbit Obliquity of an M dwarf/brown dwarf System: An eccentric and aligned TOI-2119 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first instance of an M dwarf/brown dwarf obliquity measurement for the TOI-2119 system using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. TOI-2119 b is a transiting brown dwarf orbiting a young, active early M dwarf ($T_{\rm{eff}}$ = 3553 K). It has a mass of 64.4 M$_{\rm{J}}$ and radius of 1.08 R$_{\rm{J}}$, with an eccentric orbit ($e$ = 0.3) at a period of 7.2 days. For this analysis, we utilise NEID spectroscopic transit observations and ground based simultaneous transit photometry from the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) and the Las Campanas Remote Observatory (LCRO). We fit all available data of TOI-2119 b to refine the brown dwarf parameters and update the ephemeris. The classical Rossiter-McLaughlin technique yields a projected star-planet obliquity of $\lambda=-0.8\pm1.1^\circ$ and a three-dimensional obliquity of $\psi=15.7\pm5.5^\circ$. Additionally, we spatially resolve the stellar surface of TOI-2119 utilising the Reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique to determine the projected star-planet obliquity as $\lambda=1.26 \pm 1.3^{\circ}$. Both of these results agree within $2\sigma$ and confirm the system is aligned, where TOI-2119 b joins an emerging group of aligned brown dwarf obliquities. We also probe stellar surface activity on the surface of TOI-2119 in the form of centre-to-limb variations as well as the potential for differential rotation. Overall, we find tentative evidence for centre-to-limb variations on the star but do not detect evidence of differential rotation.</description>

      <title>Light curves and spectra for stellar collisions between main-sequence stars in galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-velocity stellar collisions in galactic nuclei produce ejecta that generate potentially observable electromagnetic radiation, making them promising nuclear transients. However, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these collisions, which would more frequently involve main-sequence stars, remain largely unexplored. Here, using 3D hydrodynamics and 1D radiation-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and observables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between terminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision configurations. The ejecta produce bright UV flares with bolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 0.5 d and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15 mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H I Balmer lines. These properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity, and stellar masses. We provide fitting formulae to describe these correlations. Detecting these flares requires sub-day cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT, combined with spectroscopic observations to disentangle degeneracies and infer collision characteristics.</description>
