      <title>Key-agreement exists if and only if the "interactive vs non interactive Kolmogorov problem" is not in ioBPP: a short proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ball, Liu, Mazor and Pass proved that the existence of key-agreement protocols is equivalent to the hardness of a certain problem about interactive Kolmogorov complexity. We generalize the statement and give a short proof of the difficult implication.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Median and Center in the Ulam Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical rank aggregation problem seeks to combine a set X of n permutations into a single representative "consensus" permutation. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental rank aggregation tasks under the well-studied Ulam metric: computing a median permutation (which minimizes the sum of Ulam distances to X) and computing a center permutation (which minimizes the maximum Ulam distance to X) in two settings.
  $\bullet$ Continuous Setting: In the continuous setting, the median/center is allowed to be any permutation. It is known that computing a center in the Ulam metric is NP-hard and we add to this by showing that computing a median is NP-hard as well via a simple reduction from the Max-Cut problem. While this result may not be unexpected, it had remained elusive until now and confirms a speculation by Chakraborty, Das, and Krauthgamer [SODA '21].
  $\bullet$ Discrete Setting: In the discrete setting, the median/center must be a permutation from the input set. We fully resolve the fine-grained complexity of the discrete median and discrete center problems under the Ulam metric, proving that the naive $\widetilde{O}(n^2 L)$-time algorithm (where L is the length of the permutation) is conditionally optimal. This resolves an open problem raised by Abboud, Bateni, Cohen-Addad, Karthik C. S., and Seddighin [APPROX '23]. Our reductions are inspired by the known fine-grained lower bounds for similarity measures, but we face and overcome several new highly technical challenges.</description>

      <title>Online and feasible presentability: from trees to modal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether every computable member of a given class of structures admits a fully primitive recursive (also known as punctual) or fully P-TIME copy. A class with this property is referred to as punctually robust or P-TIME robust, respectively. We present both positive and negative results for structures corresponding to well-known representations of trees, such as binary trees, ordered trees, sequential (or prefix) trees, and partially ordered (poset) trees. A corollary of one of our results on trees is that semilattices and lattices are not punctually robust. In the main result of the paper, we demonstrate that, unlike Boolean algebras, modal algebras - that is, Boolean algebras with modality - are not punctually robust. The question of whether distributive lattices are punctually robust remains open. The paper contributes to a decades-old program on effective and feasible algebra, which has recently gained momentum due to rapid developments in punctual structure theory and its connections to online presentations of structures.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Proofs in the Ideal Proof System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Ideal Proof System (IPS) introduced by Grochow and Pitassi and pose the question of which tautologies admit symmetric proofs, and of what complexity. The symmetry requirement in proofs is inspired by recent work establishing lower bounds in other symmetric models of computation. We link the existence of symmetric IPS proofs to the expressive power of logics such as fixed-point logic with counting and Choiceless Polynomial Time, specifically regarding the graph isomorphism problem. We identify relationships and tradeoffs between the symmetry of proofs and other parameters of IPS proofs such as size, degree and linearity. We study these on a number of standard families of tautologies from proof complexity and finite model theory such as the pigeonhole principle, the subset sum problem and the Cai-F\"urer-Immerman graphs, exhibiting non-trivial upper bounds on the size of symmetric IPS proofs.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative weights, equalizers, and P=PPAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.08934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, by using multiplicative weights in a game-theoretic thought experiment (and an important convexity result on the composition of multiplicative weights with the relative entropy function), a symmetric bimatrix game (that is, a bimatrix matrix wherein the payoff matrix of each player is the transpose of the payoff matrix of the other) either has an interior symmetric equilibrium or there is a pure strategy that is weakly dominated by some mixed strategy. Weakly dominated pure strategies can be detected and eliminated in polynomial time by solving a linear program. Furthermore, interior symmetric equilibria are a special case of a more general notion, namely, that of an "equalizer," which can also be computed efficiently in polynomial time by solving a linear program. An elegant "symmetrization method" of bimatrix games [Jurg et al., 1992] and the well-known PPAD-completeness results on equilibrium computation in bimatrix games [Daskalakis et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2009] imply then the compelling P = PPAD.</description>

      <title>Quantum computational complexity of matrix functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dividing line between classical and quantum computational power in estimating properties of matrix functions. More precisely, we study the computational complexity of two primitive problems: given a function $f$ and a Hermitian matrix $A$, compute a matrix element of $f(A)$ or compute a local measurement on $f(A)|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$, with $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$ an $n$-qubit reference state vector, in both cases up to additive approximation error. We consider four functions -- monomials, Chebyshev polynomials, the time evolution function, and the inverse function -- and probe the complexity across a broad landscape covering different problem input regimes. Namely, we consider two types of matrix inputs (sparse and Pauli access), matrix properties (norm, sparsity), the approximation error, and function-specific parameters. We identify BQP-complete forms of both problems for each function and then toggle the problem parameters to easier regimes to see where hardness remains, or where the problem becomes classically easy. As part of our results, we make concrete a hierarchy of hardness across the functions; in parameter regimes where we have classically efficient algorithms for monomials, all three other functions remain robustly BQP-hard, or hard under usual computational complexity assumptions. In identifying classically easy regimes, among others, we show that for any polynomial of degree $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ both problems can be efficiently classically simulated when $A$ has $O(\log n)$ non-zero coefficients in the Pauli basis. This contrasts with the fact that the problems are BQP-complete in the sparse access model even for constant row sparsity, whereas the stated Pauli access efficiently constructs sparse access with row sparsity $O(\log n)$. Our work provides a catalog of efficient quantum and classical algorithms for fundamental linear-algebra tasks.</description>
