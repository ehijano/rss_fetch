      <title>Identification of Mean-Field Dynamics using Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of transformer architectures to approximate the mean-field dynamics of interacting particle systems exhibiting collective behavior. Such systems are fundamental in modeling phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, including gas dynamics, opinion formation, biological networks, and swarm robotics. The key characteristic of these systems is that the particles are indistinguishable, leading to permutation-equivariant dynamics. We demonstrate that transformers, which inherently possess permutation equivariance, are well-suited for approximating these dynamics. Specifically, we prove that if a finite-dimensional transformer can effectively approximate the finite-dimensional vector field governing the particle system, then the expected output of this transformer provides a good approximation for the infinite-dimensional mean-field vector field. Leveraging this result, we establish theoretical bounds on the distance between the true mean-field dynamics and those obtained using the transformer. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations on the Cucker-Smale model for flocking, and the mean-field system for training two-layer neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Reduced Order Model for Finite Element Method in Time Domain Electromagnetic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time domain simulations of electromagnetic problems are highly valuable in engineering applications, as they allow for the analysis of transient behavior and broadband responses. These simulations utilize time stepping schemes, where each solution is derived from the solutions of previous time steps. Although each time step involves relatively straightforward computations, the high dimensionality of the problem can significantly increase the overall computational time.
  This work introduces a reduced order model (ROM) for finite element method in time domain (FEMTD) simulations, specifically applied to microwave devices. The proposed methodology, called ROMTD, enables efficient analysis of time evolution in electromagnetic problems while substantially reducing computational demands. Its main advantage is the use of a much smaller number of degrees of freedom (DoFs) to capture the same electromagnetic dynamics, compared to the large number of DoFs typically required by traditional methods such as finite difference in time domain (FDTD) and FEMTD. To construct the ROM basis, a novel criterion for selecting FEMTD solutions is introduced, ensuring that only the most relevant snapshots are retained.
  The capabilities of the ROMTD approach are demonstrated through various examples, including a quad-mode dielectric resonator filter, a side-coupled four-pole filter in quarter-mode substrate integrated waveguide technology, and a microstrip dual-band bandpass planar filter. These examples illustrate the potential of the proposed ROMTD strategy to efficiently solve time evolution problems in electromagnetics, providing significant reduction in computation time without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>An evaluation of machine learning/molecular mechanics end-state corrections with mechanical embedding to calculate relative protein-ligand binding free energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of machine-learning (ML) potentials offers significant accuracy improvements compared to molecular mechanics (MM) because of the inclusion of quantum-mechanical effects in molecular interactions. However, ML simulations are several times more computationally demanding than MM simulations, so there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. One possible compromise are hybrid machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) approaches with mechanical embedding that treat the intramolecular interactions of the ligand at the ML level and the protein-ligand interactions at the MM level. Recent studies have reported improved protein-ligand binding free energy results based on ML/MM with mechanical embedding, arguing that intramolecular interactions like torsion potentials of the ligand are often the limiting factor for accuracy. This claim is evaluated based on 108 relative binding free energy calculations for four different benchmark systems. As an alternative strategy, we also tested a tool that fits the MM dihedral potentials to the ML level of theory. Overall, the relative binding free energy results from MM with Open Force Field 2.2.0, MM with ML-fitted torsion potentials, and the corresponding ML/MM end-state corrected simulations show no statistically significant differences in the mean absolute errors (between 0.8 and 0.9 kcal/mol). Therefore, a well-parameterized force field is on a par with simple mechanical embedding ML/MM simulations for protein-ligand binding. In terms of computational costs, the reparametrization of poor torsional potentials is preferable over employing computationally intensive ML/MM simulations of protein-ligand complexes with mechanical embedding. Also, the refitting strategy leads to lower variances of the protein-ligand binding free energy results than the ML/MM end-state corrections.</description>

      <title>Everything everywhere all at once, a probability-based enhanced sampling approach to rare events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460, 2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.</description>

      <title>Learning to generate high-dimensional distributions with low-dimensional quantum Boltzmann machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, researchers have been exploring ways to generalize Boltzmann machines (BMs) to quantum systems, leading to the development of variations such as fully-visible and restricted quantum Boltzmann machines (QBMs). Due to the non-commuting nature of their Hamiltonians, restricted QBMs face trainability issues, whereas fully-visible QBMs have emerged as a more tractable option, as recent results demonstrate their sample-efficient trainability. These results position fully-visible QBMs as a favorable choice, offering potential improvements over fully-visible BMs without suffering from the trainability issues associated with restricted QBMs. In this work, we show that low-dimensional, fully-visible QBMs can learn to generate distributions typically associated with higher-dimensional systems. We validate our findings through numerical experiments on both artificial datasets and real-world examples from the high energy physics problem of jet event generation. We find that non-commuting terms and Hamiltonian connectivity improve the learning capabilities of QBMs, providing flexible resources suitable for various hardware architectures. Furthermore, we provide strategies and future directions to maximize the learning capacity of fully-visible QBMs.</description>

      <title>Neural network distillation of orbital dependent density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) offers a desirable balance between quantitative accuracy and computational efficiency in practical many-electron calculations. Its central component, the exchange-correlation energy functional, has been approximated with increasing levels of complexity ranging from strictly local approximations to nonlocal and orbital-dependent expressions with many tuned parameters. In this work, we formulate a general way of rewriting complex density functionals using deep neural networks in a way that allows for simplified computation of Kohn-Sham potentials as well as higher functional derivatives through automatic differentiation, enabling access to highly nonlinear response functions and forces. These goals are achieved by using a recently developed class of robust neural network models capable of modeling functionals, as opposed to functions, with explicitly enforced spatial symmetries. Functionals treated in this way are then called global density approximations and can be seamlessly integrated with existing DFT workflows. Tests are performed for a dataset featuring a large variety of molecular structures and popular meta-GGA density functionals, where we successfully eliminate orbital dependencies coming from the kinetic energy density, and discover a high degree of transferability to a variety of physical systems. The presented framework is general and could be extended to more complex orbital and energy dependent functionals as well as refined with specialized datasets.</description>

      <title>BI-EqNO: Generalized Approximate Bayesian Inference with an Equivariant Neural Operator Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference offers a robust framework for updating prior beliefs based on new data using Bayes' theorem, but exact inference is often computationally infeasible, necessitating approximate methods. Though widely used, these methods struggle to estimate marginal likelihoods accurately, particularly due to the rigid functional structures of deterministic models like Gaussian processes and the limitations of small sample sizes in stochastic models like the ensemble Kalman method. In this work, we introduce BI-EqNO, an equivariant neural operator framework for generalized approximate Bayesian inference, designed to enhance both deterministic and stochastic approaches. BI-EqNO transforms priors into posteriors conditioned on observation data through data-driven training. The framework is flexible, supporting diverse prior and posterior representations with arbitrary discretizations and varying numbers of observations. Crucially, BI-EqNO's architecture ensures (1) permutation equivariance between prior and posterior representations, and (2) permutation invariance with respect to observational data. We demonstrate BI-EqNO's utility through two examples: (1) as a generalized Gaussian process (gGP) for regression, and (2) as an ensemble neural filter (EnNF) for sequential data assimilation. Results show that gGP outperforms traditional Gaussian processes by offering a more flexible representation of covariance functions. Additionally, EnNF not only outperforms the ensemble Kalman filter in small-ensemble settings but also has the potential to function as a "super" ensemble filter, capable of representing and integrating multiple ensemble filters for enhanced assimilation performance. This study highlights BI-EqNO's versatility and effectiveness, improving Bayesian inference through data-driven training while reducing computational costs across various applications.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Particle-In-Cell Simulations of Two-Dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present three-dimensional (3D) Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study the stability of 2D Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes in a magnetized plasma with a finite background magnetic field. The simulations were performed using the Plasma Simulation Code (PSC) [Germaschewski et al., J. of Comp. Phys. 318, 305 (2016)], as in our recent study using 2D PIC simulations [McClung et al., Phys. Plasmas 31, 042302 (2024)], in order to see if and how the previous results would change with 3D effects. We found that solutions that are stable (unstable) in 2D simulations are still stable (unstable) in the new 3D simulations. However, the instability develops slower in 3D than in 2D and forms an unstable spiral wave structure that is in-phase along the axial direction. We have also simulated cases with an electron density bump (EDB) at the center, in addition to cases with an electron density hole (EDH) considered in our previous study, and found differences in the unstable spiral wave structures between the two cases. Additionally, we have generalized our simulations to have an increased electron thermal velocity, as well as using initial conditions solved from the complete Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations. We found that these generalizations did not change the overall behavior of the simulations and the instability that evolves.</description>

Abstract: In this paper the finite-difference time-domain general vector auxiliary differential equation method [Greene, J. H. and A. Taflove, Opt. Express 14, 8305 (2006)], nonlinear polarization vector is extended to include anisotropy, in nonlinear isotropic media at optical frequencies. The theory is presented for extending the method in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and then simulation results are presented for the simplified 2D transverse magnetic polarization case, revisiting the fused silica example introduced in the 2006 paper including the anisotropic part of the nonlinear polarization vector. The simulation results including the anisotropic part of the polarization vector were compared with isotropic polarization vector simulation results.</description>

      <title>Governing equation discovery of a complex system from snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems in physics, chemistry, and biology that evolve over time with inherent randomness are typically described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A fundamental challenge in science and engineering is to determine the governing equations of a complex system from snapshot data. Traditional equation discovery methods often rely on stringent assumptions, such as the availability of the trajectory information or time-series data, and the presumption that the underlying system is deterministic. In this work, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-free framework, called Sparse Identification of Differential Equations from Snapshots (SpIDES), that discovers the governing equations of a complex system from snapshots by utilizing the advanced machine learning techniques to perform three essential steps: probability flow reconstruction, probability density estimation, and Bayesian sparse identification. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of SpIDES by successfully identifying the governing equation of an over-damped Langevin system confined within two potential wells. By extracting interpretable drift and diffusion terms from the SDEs, our framework provides deeper insights into system dynamics, enhances predictive accuracy, and facilitates more effective strategies for managing and simulating stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Large-Eddy Simulations of Stochastic Burgers Turbulence Using Fully Conservative Higher-Order Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) in turbulent flows continues to be a critical area of research, particularly in understanding the behavior of small-scale turbulence structures and their impact on resolved scales. In this study, we focus on the LES of turbulent flows, particularly the one-dimensional Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE), using fully conservative higher-order schemes. The interaction between spatial discretization and SubGrid-Scale (SGS) modeling is explored rigorously by validating these schemes against analytical solutions for both the Linear Advection-Diffusion (LAD) equation and the Non-Linear Burgers (NLB) equation under laminar conditions. This ensures robustness before applying the approach to LES of stochastic turbulence. The study investigates how second-order and fourth-order discretization schemes influence the dynamic coefficients of various SGS models, including Constant Smagorinsky (CS), Dynamic Smagorinsky (DS), Dynamic Wong-Lilly (DWL), 1.5-order Turbulent Kinetic Energy Deardorff (TKED), Equilibrium Heinz (EH), and Dynamic Heinz (DH) models. The second-order scheme was found to amplify fluctuations in dynamic SGS coefficients due to its higher numerical dissipation, contrasting with the more stable behavior observed with the fourth order scheme, which better captures resolved scales and results in smaller dynamic coefficients. Despite inherent differences in SGS models and discretization schemes, the final velocity distributions in one dimensional turbulence simulations were remarkably consistent, suggesting a limited influence of SGS modeling on large-scale structures in simplified turbulence scenarios. However, notable variations in resolved-scale kinetic energy were uncovered, emphasizing the importance of accurately capturing small-scale turbulence structures for precise energy dissipation predictions in LES.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of an Accurate Algebraic Scheme for Sharp Interface Advection in Multiphase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an efficient algebraic scheme known as MULES for sharp interface advection, verified against various schemes including first-order upwind, second-order central, van Leer flux limiter, and Geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VOF). Two problems involving a droplet in a two-dimensional (2D) vortex and a stationary droplet were examined. The model assessed the effects of the Interface Compression (IC) coefficient, ranging from 0 to 2, analyzing parameters such as Interface Advection Error (IAE) and Mass Conservation Error (MCE). Results indicated that increasing IC values enhanced interface tracking accuracy but introduced non-physical instabilities at higher values, compromising mass conservation. Specifically, the IAE decreased from 4.8% to 3.95% as IC increased from 0 to 2, showing a favorable effect until IC surpassed 1.4, where IAE fluctuated around 4%. Conversely, the MCE rose steeply from 0% to 23.19%, driven by parasitic currents and numerical instabilities. Additionally, MULES and van Leer flux limiter schemes evaluated volume fraction smoothing effects. Initial filtering reduced Dimensionless Pressure Difference (DPD) and Capillary Number (Ca), stabilizing the solution, but excessive filtering reintroduced numerical errors and instabilities. With one filtering step, DPD reduced by 0.23 and Ca dropped significantly by 73.31%, improving solution stability. However, further filtering increased DPD and Ca, reflecting the reintroduction of numerical errors. The maximum velocity of parasitic flow around the droplet initially decreased by almost 75% but increased by 30.92% with excessive filtering. IAE increased from 0.7 to 0.9 with initial filtering, then decreased to 0.63 with additional steps, indicating improved solver performance on smoother interfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel implementation of density functional theory integrated with single-site dynamical mean-field theory to investigate the complex properties of strongly correlated materials. This comprehensive first-principles many-body computational toolkit, termed $\texttt{Zen}$, utilizes the Vienna $\textit{ab initio}$ simulation package and the $\texttt{Quantum ESPRESSO}$ code to perform density functional theory calculations and generate band structures for realistic materials. The challenges associated with correlated electron systems are addressed through two distinct yet complementary quantum impurity solvers: the natural orbitals renormalization group solver for zero temperature and the hybridization expansion continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo solver for finite temperature. Additionally, this newly developed toolkit incorporates several valuable post-processing tools, such as $\texttt{ACFlow}$, which employs the maximum entropy method and the stochastic pole expansion method for the analytic continuation of Matsubara Green's functions and self-energy functions. To validate the performance of this toolkit, we examine three representative cases: the correlated metal SrVO$_{3}$, the nickel-based unconventional superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$, and the wide-gap Mott insulator MnO. The results obtained demonstrate strong agreement with experimental findings and previously available theoretical results. Notably, we successfully elucidate the quasiparticle peak and band renormalization in SrVO$_{3}$, the dominance of Hund correlation in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$, and the pressure-driven insulator-metal transition as well as the high-spin to low-spin transition in MnO. These findings suggest that $\texttt{Zen}$ is proficient in accurately describing the electronic structures of $d$-electron correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of orientation averages and its application to molecular physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In molecular physics, it is often necessary to average over the orientation of molecules when calculating observables, in particular when modelling experiments in the liquid or gas phase. Evaluated in terms of Euler angles, this is closely related to integration over two- or three-dimensional unit spheres, a common problem discussed in numerical analysis. The computational cost of the integration depends significantly on the quadrature method, making the selection of an appropriate method crucial for the feasibility of simulations. After reviewing several classes of spherical quadrature methods in terms of their efficiency and error distribution, we derive guidelines for choosing the best quadrature method for orientation averages and illustrate these with three examples from chiral molecule physics. While Gauss quadratures allow for achieving numerically exact integration for a wide range of applications, other methods offer advantages in specific circumstances. Our guidelines can also by applied to higher-dimensional spherical domains and other geometries. We also present a Python package providing a flexible interface to a variety of quadrature methods.</description>

      <title>Variational Benchmarks for Quantum Many-Body Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continued development of computational approaches to many-body ground-state problems in physics and chemistry calls for a consistent way to assess its overall progress. In this work, we introduce a metric of variational accuracy, the V-score, obtained from the variational energy and its variance. We provide an extensive curated dataset of variational calculations of many-body quantum systems, identifying cases where state-of-the-art numerical approaches show limited accuracy, and future algorithms or computational platforms, such as quantum computing, could provide improved accuracy. The V-score can be used as a metric to assess the progress of quantum variational methods toward a quantum advantage for ground-state problems, especially in regimes where classical verifiability is impossible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source CUDA-based package that consists of a compilation of exponential integrators where the action of the matrix exponential or the $\varphi_l$ functions on a vector is approximated using the method of polynomial interpolation at Leja points. Using a couple of test examples on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, we show that one can achieve significant speedups using CUDA over the corresponding CPU code. LeXInt, written in a modular format, facilitates easy integration into any existing software package, and can be used for temporal integration of any differential equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired activation functions and quantum Chebyshev-polynomial network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by the significant advantages offered by quantum computing, research in quantum machine learning has increased in recent years. While quantum speed-up has been demonstrated in some applications of quantum machine learning, a comprehensive understanding of its underlying mechanisms for improved performance remains elusive. Our study address this problem by investigating the functional expressibility of quantum circuits integrated within a convolutional neural network (CNN). Through numerical experiments on the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Letter datasets, our hybrid quantum-classical CNN model demonstrates superior feature selection capabilities and substantially reduces the required training steps compared to classical CNNs. Notably, we observe similar performance improvements when incorporating three other quantum-inspired activation functions in classical neural networks, indicating the benefits of adopting quantum-inspired activation functions. Additionally, we developed a hybrid quantum Chebyshev-polynomial network (QCPN) based on the properties of quantum activation functions. We demonstrate that a three-layer QCPN can approximate any continuous function, a feat not achievable by a standard three-layer classical neural network. Our findings suggest that quantum-inspired activation functions can reduce model depth while maintaining high learning capability, making them a promising approach for optimizing large-scale machine-learning models. We also outline future research directions for leveraging quantum advantages in machine learning, aiming to unlock further potential in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Ionization potential of radium monofluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ionization potential (IP) of radium monofluoride (RaF) was measured to be 4.969(2)[10] eV, revealing a relativistic enhancement in the series of alkaline earth monofluorides. The results are in agreement with a relativistic coupled-cluster prediction of 4.969[7] eV, incorporating up to quantum electrodynamics corrections. Using the same computational methodology, an improved calculation for the dissociation energy ($D_{0}$) of 5.54[5] eV is presented. This confirms that radium monofluoride joins the small group of diatomic molecules for which $D_{0}&gt;\mathrm{IP}$, paving the way for precision control and interrogation of its Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>From PINNs to PIKANs: Recent Advances in Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a key tool in Scientific Machine Learning since their introduction in 2017, enabling the efficient solution of ordinary and partial differential equations using sparse measurements. Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the training and optimization of PINNs, covering aspects such as network architectures, adaptive refinement, domain decomposition, and the use of adaptive weights and activation functions. A notable recent development is the Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANS), which leverage a representation model originally proposed by Kolmogorov in 1957, offering a promising alternative to traditional PINNs. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in PINNs, focusing on improvements in network design, feature expansion, optimization techniques, uncertainty quantification, and theoretical insights. We also survey key applications across a range of fields, including biomedicine, fluid and solid mechanics, geophysics, dynamical systems, heat transfer, chemical engineering, and beyond. Finally, we review computational frameworks and software tools developed by both academia and industry to support PINN research and applications.</description>
