      <title>Volumetric (dilatant) plasticity in geodynamic models and implications on thermal dissipation and strain localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present a new thermomechanical geodynamic, numerical implementation that incorporates Maxwell viscoelastic rheology accounting for temperature-dependent power-law dislocation creep and pressure-sensitive, non-associated Drucker-Prager brittle failure, as well as for volumetric stresses and strains during viscoplastic flow, a departure from the traditional incompressible assumptions. In solving for energy conservation, we incorporate the heat source term resulting from irreversible mechanical deformations, which embodies viscoelastic and viscoplastic work, and by considering the total stress tensor and total inelastic strain rate tensors, including dilatant plasticity effects for lithospheric-scale applications, instead of only the shear terms as is usually assumed for incompressible materials. This form of the work term thus allows to consider, volumetric deformation and to couple the energy equation to the constitutive description, and hence the stress balance, via the evolving temperature field. Code design enables us to switch individual features of this general rheology ``on or off'' and thus to benchmark this implementation with published numerical experiments of crustal-scale shortening experiments. We investigate whether ``brittle-plastic'' compressibility can promote or inhibit localization of deformation and thermal evolution during compression for crustal, and upper mantle rheology. For both crustal-scale and lithospheric-scale experiments, we establish that the feedback from volumetric dissipation, while contributing to temperature increase along with shear dissipation, can potentially slow down heat production per unit time, depending on the choice of boundary conditions. Our new implementation can be used to address buckling problems and collision tectonics.</description>

      <title>Short-term Streamflow and Flood Forecasting based on Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and Residual Error Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate short-term streamflow and flood forecasting are critical for mitigating river flood impacts, especially given the increasing climate variability. Machine learning-based streamflow forecasting relies on large streamflow datasets derived from rating curves. Uncertainties in rating curve modeling could introduce errors to the streamflow data and affect the forecasting accuracy. This study proposes a streamflow forecasting method that addresses these data errors, enhancing the accuracy of river flood forecasting and flood modeling, thereby reducing flood-related risk. A convolutional recurrent neural network is used to capture spatiotemporal patterns, coupled with residual error learning and forecasting. The neural network outperforms commonly used forecasting models over 1-6 hours of forecasting horizons, and the residual error learners can further correct the residual errors. This provides a more reliable tool for river flood forecasting and climate adaptation in this critical 1-6 hour time window for flood risk mitigation efforts.</description>

      <title>Penetrative rotating magnetoconvection subject to lateral variations in temperature gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection-driven flows in planetary interiors exhibit rich dynamics owing to multiple spatio-temporally varying forcing conditions and physical constraints. In particular, the churning of liquid metals in the Earth's outer core, responsible for the dynamic geomagnetic field, is subjected to lower mantle thermal heterogeneity. Besides, the plausible existence of a stable stratification layer below the mantle influences the columnar convection. These additional symmetry-breaking constraints, motivated from geophysical scenario of the Earth's thermal core--mantle interaction, modulate the otherwise periodic and axially invariant convection flow patterns. Thus, the present study focuses on qualitative characterization and parametric quantification of rotating penetrative convection in the presence of magnetic induction effects with an aim to understand the role of the lower mantle on core convection thermally. Using complementing computational and theoretical calculations, the present study estimates the depth of penetration in bounded and unbounded fluid domains. Apart from qualitative differences in convective flow patterns from the reference homogeneous configurations, the additional constraints spatially modulate the extent of penetration into stable regions. Confinement effects, adding to the damping of penetrative convection, arising out of boundary constraints are quantified for bounded geometry. Appropriate normalizations, implemented to eliminate such effects, result in amended penetration depth estimates that align with the qualitative characteristics obtained for unbounded domains. Exact closed-form expressions for the depth of penetration are obtained, providing insights into the role of individual contributions of multiple physical constraints. Implications are speculated for realistic, yet unreachable, regimes of geophysical conditions of planetary cores.</description>

      <title>Toward Routing River Water in Land Surface Models with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14212v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States (CONUS) has demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it using historical streamflow measurements. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in catchments not used in training) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model: a gain in median NSE from 0.56 to 0.64 (time-split experiment) and from 0.30 to 0.34 (basin-split experiment). Our results show that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</description>
