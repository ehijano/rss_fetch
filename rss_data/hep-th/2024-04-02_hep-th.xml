      <title>The Canvas of Holography in (A)dS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic of holography between anti-de Sitter space holography and de Sitter holography is a very fascinating comparison, which provides many key insights into what we expect from holography in general. In this Essay, we highlight this dynamic with three examples: first, when taking Wheeler-DeWitt states to the asymptotic boundary, the dual interpretation is unclear in de Sitter. Second, what we make of bulk reconstruction and subregion duality in AdS/CFT is not trivially reflected in the dS/CFT scenario. Third, a way of formulating emergence and subregion-subalgebra duality in de Sitter space does not yet exist. With these examples, we provide some musings on this canvas of holography in the settings of (A)dS/CFT.</description>

      <title>General Expressions for On-shell Recursion relations for Tree-level Open String Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a systematic derivation aimed at obtaining general expressions for on-shell recursion relations for tree-level open string amplitudes. Our approach involves applying the BCFW shift to an open string amplitude written in terms of multiple Gaussian hypergeometric functions. By employing binomial expansions, we demonstrate that the shifted amplitudes manifest simple poles, which correspond to scattering channels of intermediate states. Using the residue theorem, we thereby derive a general expression for these relations.</description>

      <title>Jacobi Sigma Models and Twisted Jacobi Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jacobi sigma models are two-dimensional topological non-linear field theories which are associated with Jacobi structures. The latter can be considered as a generalization of Poisson structures. After reviewing the main properties and peculiarities of these models, we focus on the twisted version in which a Wess-Zumino term is included. This modification allows for the target space to be a twisted Jacobi manifold. We discuss in particular the model on the sphere $S^5$.</description>

      <title>Interactions of massless fermionic fields in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All independent interaction vertices involving massless (Fang--Fronsdal) fermions in three dimensions are classified, completing the classification of interactions of massless fields of any spin. Similarly to the bosonic case, we get no independent vertices at quartic or higher order in the fields involving fields with spin $s\geq 3/2$, and cubic vertices only for spins satisfying triangle inequalities, apart from the cases involving (matter) fields with spin $s\leq 1$. Differently from the bosonic cases, we get only one vertex for each triple of spins with two Majorana fermions and one boson, which is parity even (odd) when the sum of the spins of all fields involved is odd (even). When the two Majorana fermions are identical, their coupling to an odd-spin boson is trivialized. We comment on the non-trivial holographic dictionary relating these vertices to $CFT$ correlators in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stringy constraints on primordial electromagnetic fields in axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study primordial electromagnetic fields in effective actions of string theory. In contrast to a conventional scenario of producing primordial electromagnetic fields induced by the axion inflation, we deal with the Dirac-Born-Infeld action as a non-linear generation of Maxwell theory. It turns out that the intensity of generated electromagnetic fields is bounded from above by the string scale which can also be rewritten in terms of supersymmetry breaking scale in the context of type IIB Large Volume Scenario. The instability parameter $\xi$ is constrained by the tadpole cancellation condition of D3-branes and a realization of hierarchy between the string scale and the Hubble scale of inflation.</description>

      <title>A local Generalized second law in crossed product constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show a local generalized second law (the generalized entropy is nondecreasing) in crossed product constructions for both asymptotically flat and asymptotically $AdS$ maximally extended static and Kerr black holes, using modular theory. The new ingredient is the use of results from a recent paper discussing the entropy of the algebra of operators in subregions of arbitrary spacetimes. These results rely on an assumption which we show is true in our setting. In the last part of the paper, we look at modular Hamiltonians of deformed half-spaces in a class of static spacetimes, including the Schwarzschild spacetime. These are computed using path integrals, and we primarily compute them to investigate whether these non-local modular Hamiltonians can be made local by subtracting off pieces from the algebra and its commutant, as has been surmised in the literature. Along the way, the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) also follows in this class of spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Cosmological singularities, holographic complexity and entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study holographic volume complexity for various families of holographic cosmologies with Kasner-like singularities, in particular with $AdS$, hyperscaling violating and Lifshitz asymptotics. We find through extensive numerical studies that the complexity surface always bends in the direction away from the singularity and transitions from spacelike near the boundary to lightlike in the interior. As the boundary anchoring time slice approaches the singularity, the transition to lightlike is more rapid, with the spacelike part shrinking. The complexity functional has vanishing contributions from the lightlike region so in the vicinity of the singularity, complexity is vanishingly small, indicating a dual Kasner state of vanishingly low complexity, suggesting an extreme thinning of the effective degrees of freedom dual to the near singularity region. We also develop further previous studies on extremal surfaces for holographic entanglement entropy, and find that in the IR limit they reveal similar behaviour as complexity.</description>

      <title>Communicating Multiverses in Holographic de-Sitter Braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the wedge holography for the de-Sitter space a bulk theory. First, we discuss a more general mathematical construction of wedge holography in parallel with wedge holography construction for the AdS bulk, and then we construct the wedge holography in the extended static patch. In the first case, we prove that one can construct wedge holography for the de-Sitter bulk for the static patch as well as global coordinate metric on end-of-the-world branes. Extended static patch wedge holography is constructed by joining the two copies of double holography in DS/dS correspondence. We find that wedge holography with extended static patch metric leads to the emergence of communicating universes. Further, we propose a model which provides the theoretical evidence of communicating multiverses.</description>

      <title>Half-sided Translations and the Information Recovery from Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The island paradigm asserts that after the Page time the operators in the interior of an AdS2 eternal black hole in equilibrium with a finite temperature non-gravitating bath can not be reconstructed using the operators in the black hole region outside the horizon. In a recent paper, we demonstrated this using the black hole interior reconstruction proposal due to Leutheusser and Liu, based on the half-sided translations. This was done by introducing a notion of the reduced half-sided translations associated with the algebra of operators restricted to the black hole region outside the horizon, and by showing that albeit the reduced half-sided translations translate operators in the black hole region outside the horizon to the black hole interior before the Page time, it fails to do so after the Page time. In this paper, we demonstrate the second assertion of the island paradigm, which states that after the Page time the operators in the black hole interior can be reconstructed using the operators in the bath. We show that even though before the Page time the reduced half-sided translations associated with the algebra of operators restricted to the bath do not translate operators in the bath to the black hole interior, after the Page time they take them to the black hole interior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thus far, the known wormholes in string theory connecting disjoint boundaries represented by finite volume quotients of hyperbolic spaces leak: they are non-perturbatively unstable towards brane-anti-brane nucleation in the flux backgrounds that support these wormholes. Turning on additional fluxes suppressed this instability, but would not completely eliminate it. We present the first example of a non-perturbatively stable wormhole in type IIB supergravity on a warped squashed conifold with fluxes.</description>

      <title>Building up quantum spacetimes with BCFT Legos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is it possible to read off the quantum gravity dual of a CFT directly from its operator algebra? In this essay, we present a step-by-step recipe synthesizing results and techniques from conformal bootstrap, topological symmetries, tensor networks, a novel symmetry-preserving real-space renormalization algorithm devised originally in lattice models, and the asymptotics of quantum $6j$ symbols, thereby providing an answer in the affirmative. Quantum 2D Liouville theory serves as a simple and explicit example, illustrating how the quantum gravitational path integral can be built up from local pieces of BCFT correlation functions, which we call the ``BCFT Legos''. The constructive map between gravity and CFT naturally and explicitly bridges local geometrical data, algebraic structures, and quantum entanglement, as envisaged by the $\it{It \, from \, Qubit}$ motto.</description>

      <title>Four-Derivative Yang-Mills Couplings in Heterotic Theory through T-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the dimensional reduction of the classical effective action of heterotic string theory on a circle, along with its T-duality symmetry, with the aim of identifying the bosonic couplings. To achieve this, we propose a truncation scheme for the generalized Buscher rules and the reduced action, specifically targeting the truncation of the nonlinear appearance of the scalar component of the Yang-Mills field in the base space. By imposing this truncated T-duality on the reduced action, we successfully determine the four-derivative bosonic couplings in the minimal basis, where field redefinition is imposed. Notably, these couplings, which are associated with the Lorentz Chern-Simons coupling $H\Omega$, exhibit an exact correspondence with the NS-NS couplings found in the Metsaev-Tseytlin action.
  Furthermore, we investigate the bosonic couplings in the maximal basis, where field redefinition is not imposed. In this scenario, the truncated T-duality fixes the effective action up to 17 arbitrary parameters. By assigning specific values to these parameters, we establish a framework in which the NS-NS couplings align with those in the Meissner action. Remarkably, within this scheme, the Yang-Mills couplings precisely coincide with those obtained through the S-matrix method.</description>

      <title>The energy-frequency diagram of the (1+1)-dimensional $\Phi^4$ oscillon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two different methods are used to study the existence and stability of the (1+1)-dimensional $\Phi^4$ oscillon. The variational technique approximates it by a periodic function with a set of adiabatically changing parameters. An alternative approach treats oscillons as standing waves in a finite-size box; these are sought as solutions of a boundary-value problem on a two-dimensional domain. The numerical analysis reveals that the standing wave's energy-frequency diagram is fragmented into disjoint segments with $\omega_{n-1} &lt; \omega &lt; \omega_{n-2}$, where $\omega_n=\frac{2}{n+1}$. In the interval $(\omega_{n-1}, \omega_{n-2})$, the structure's small-amplitude wings are formed by the $n$-th harmonic radiation ($n=2,3, ...$). All standing waves are practically stable: perturbations may result in the deformation of the wave's radiation wings but do not affect its core. The variational approximation involving the first, zeroth and second harmonic components provides an accurate description of the oscillon with the frequency in $(\omega_1, \omega_0)$, but breaks down as $\omega$ falls out of that interval.</description>

      <title>Holographic reconstruction of flat spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flat/CFT dictionary between the bulk gravitational theory and boundary conformal field theory is systematically developed in this paper. Asymptotically flat spacetime is built up by asymptotically AdS hyperboloid slices in terms of Fefferman Graham coordinates together with soft modes propagating between different slices near the null boundary. Then we construct the flat holography dictionary based on studying Einstein equation at zero and first order and it turns out that these correspond to the description of hard and soft sector for the field theory from the boundary point of view. The explicit expression for energy-stress tensor is also determined by performing holographic renormalisation on the Einstein Hilbert action. By studying the anomalies of the energy-stress tensor, we obtain the leading and subleading contribution to the central charge. Einstein equations in the bulk are related to the Ward identities of the boundary theory and we find that the boundary CFT energy-stress tensor is not conserved due to the existence of radiative soft modes which will generate the energy flow through the null boundary.</description>

      <title>Is $\gamma_{KLS}$-generalized statistical field theory complete?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter we introduce some field-theoretic approach for computing the critical properties of $\gamma_{KLS}$-generalized systems undergoing continuous phase transitions, namely $\gamma_{KLS}$-statistical field theory. From this new approach emerges the new generalized O($N$)$_{\gamma_{KLS}}$ universality class, which is capable of encompassing nonconventional critical exponents for real imperfect systems known as manganites not described by standard statistical field theory. We compare the generalized results with those obtained from measurements in manganites. The agreement was satisfactory, where the relative errors are $&lt; 5\%$ for the most of manganites used. Although the present approach describes the aforementioned nonconventional critical indices, we show that it is not complete. For example, it does not explain the results for some other manganites, being explained only for nonextensive statistical field theory recently introduced in literature. So, $\gamma_{KLS}$-statistical field theory has to be discarded for statistical mechanics generalization purposes.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of entanglement and hadronization in jet production: lessons from the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possible link between entanglement and thermalization, and the dynamics of hadronization are addressed by studying the real-time response of the massive Schwinger model coupled to external sources. This setup mimics the production and fragmentation of quark jets, as the Schwinger model and QCD share the properties of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. By using quantum simulations on classical hardware, we study the entanglement between the produced jets, and observe the growth of the corresponding entanglement entropy in time. This growth arises from the increased number of contributing eigenstates of the reduced density matrix with sufficiently large and close eigenvalues. We also investigate the physical nature of these eigenstates, and find that at early times they correspond to fermionic Fock states. We then observe the transition from these fermionic Fock states to meson-like bound states as a function of time. In other words, we observe how hadronization develops in real time. At late times, the local observables at mid-rapidity (such as the fermion density and the electric field) approach approximately constant values, suggesting the onset of equilibrium and approach to thermalization.</description>

      <title>Sharp departure beyond post-Newtonian formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{\,PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our non-perturbative formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{\,PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set joint bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 irrespective of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Spatially Varying Cosmological Constant Induced by Field Fluctuations in Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in our universe have sparked controversy. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that some of these black holes may have seeded from the direct collapse of dark energy domains with density significantly higher than the surrounding regions. The mechanism of the origin of such domains relies on the inflationary evolution of a scalar field acting in D dimensions, which is associated with the cosmological constant in our four-dimensional spacetime manifold. Inner space quantum fluctuations of the field during inflation are responsible for the spatial variations of the dark energy density in our space. This finding holds particular significance, especially considering recent evidence from pulsar timing array observations, which supports the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background consisting of SMBH mergers.</description>

      <title>Order of the SU(N_f) x SU(N_f) chiral transition via the functional renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group directly formulated in $d=3$ spatial dimensions with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators. We find infrared fixed points spanned throughout the entire flavor number range that are inaccessible in the $\epsilon$ expansion. Stability analyses around the fixed points show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_A(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order transition, which could become almost continuous if the axial symmetry breaking is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of matter domination in the Universe is one of the most exciting open puzzles in particle physics and cosmology. Despite many theoretical developments, the actual reason behind baryon-antibaryon asymmetry is still unknown. Our aim here is to examine this phenomenon in the framework of modified gravity theories, which have impressively elucidated the contemporary accelerated expansion of the universe as well as the early phase. Consequently, this letter sets its sights on the task of constraining a specific variant of modified gravity, namely, $f(Q)$ gravity, in conjunction with gravitational baryogenesis. The Power Law model and recently proposed DGP-like $f(Q)$ models are considered to find the baryon-to-entropy ratio and compare them with the observed value, that is ${n_B}/s=9.42\times 10^{-11}$. Furthermore, we impose constraints on the additional degrees of freedom introduced by this modified theory of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the entanglement entropy for a massive Klein-Gordon field in two Schwarzschild-like quantum black hole spacetimes, also including a nonminimal coupling term with the background scalar curvature. To compute the entanglement entropy, we start from the standard spherical shell discretisation procedure, tracing over the degrees of freedom residing inside an imaginary surface. We estimate the free parameters for such quantum metrics through a simple physical argument based on Heisenberg uncertainty principle, along with alternative proposals as asymptotic safety, trace anomaly, and graviton corpuscular scaling. Our findings reveal a significant decrease in entropy compared to the area law near the origin for the quantum metrics. In both scenarios, the entanglement entropy converges to the expected area law sufficiently far from the origin. We then compare these results to the entropy scaling in regular Hayward and corrected-Hayward spacetimes to highlight the main differences with such regular approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing provides a promising approach for solving the real-time dynamics of systems consist of quarks and gluons from first-principle calculations that are intractable with classical computers. In this work, we start with an initial problem of the ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering and present an efficient and precise approach to quantum simulate the dynamics on the light front. This approach employs the eigenbasis of the asymptotic scattering system and implements the compact scheme for basis encoding. It exploits the operator structure of the light-front Hamiltonian of the scattering system, which enables the Hamiltonian input scheme that utilizes the quantum Fourier transform for efficiency. It utilizes the truncated Taylor series for the dynamics simulations. The qubit cost of our approach scales logarithmically with the Hilbert space dimension of the scattering system. The gate cost has optimal scaling with the simulation error and near optimal scaling with the simulation time. These scalings make our approach advantageous for large-scale dynamics simulations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate our approach with a simple scattering problem and benchmark the results with those from the Trotter algorithm and the classical calculations, where good agreement between the results is found.</description>

Abstract: We investigate detailed properties of imaginary rotating matter with gluons and quarks at high temperature. Previously, we showed that imaginary rotation induces perturbative confinement of gluons at the rotation center. We perturbatively calculate the Polyakov loop potential and find inhomogeneous confinement above a certain threshold of imaginary angular velocity. We also evaluate the quark contribution to the Polyakov loop potential and confirm that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the perturbatively confined phase.</description>

Abstract: We show that a stable vortex soliton, carrying a constant magnetic flux, exists in the homogeneous medium of axions with a constant time-derivative. Axions can be bound in the vortex, having energy less than the axion mass. If the observed magnetic fields in galaxies are those of the vortex, the axion-photon coupling has to be smaller than $10^{-17}\,{\rm GeV^{-1}}$. Otherwise, axions decay too quickly to constitute dark matter in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Study of Curved Domain-wall Fermions on a Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we consider fermion systems on square lattice spaces with a curved domain-wall mass term. In a similar way to the flat case, we find massless and chiral states localized at the wall. In the case of $S^1$ and $S^2$ domain-wall embedded into a square lattice, we find that these edge states feel gravity through the induced spin connection. In the conventional continuum limit of the higher dimensional lattice, we find a good consistency with the analytic results in the continuum theory. We also confirm that the rotational symmetry is recovered automatically.
  We also discuss the effect of a $U(1)$ gauge connection on a two-dimensional lattice fermion with the $S^1$ domain-wall mass term. We find that the gauge field changes the eigenvalue spectrum of the boundary system by the Aharanov-Bohm effect and generates an anomaly of the time-reversal ($T$) symmetry. Our numerical evaluation is consistent with the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index, which describes the cancellation of the $T$ anomaly by the topological term on the bulk system. When we squeeze the flux inside one plaquette while keeping the total flux unchanged, the anomaly inflow undergoes a drastic change. The intense flux gives rise to an additional domain wall around the flux. We observe a novel localized mode at the flux, canceling the $T$ anomaly on the wall instead of the topological term in the bulk.
  We apply the study to a problem in condensed matter physics. It is known that inside topological insulators, a vortex or monopole acquires a fractional electric charge and turns into a dyon. Describing the topological insulator as a negative mass region of a Dirac fermion, we provide a microscopic description of this phenomenon in terms of the dynamical domain-wall creation.</description>

      <title>Membrane Paradigm Approach to the Johannsen-Psaltis Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Johannsen-Psaltis black hole is a phenomenologically viable metric obtained by judiciously deforming the Kerr black hole such that the metric is asymptotically flat and causal; and is consistent with the weak field, post-Newtonian tests of gravity; but has additional hairs besides its mass and angular momentum. As it deviates from the Kerr black hole in the strong coupling regime, it is a useful metric to test the Kerr Hypothesis that states that all astrophysical black holes are of the Kerr type. Here we give a membrane description of this black hole that effectively amounts to replacing the observable part of the black hole with a fluid with thermal properties. A time-like membrane, a stretched horizon local in time is assumed to exist. This membrane is expected to approximate the null event horizon which is highly non-local in time. We derive the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid and all the transport coefficients using the action formulation to the membrane as advocated by Parikh and Wilczek. In the fluid description, one observes that the finiteness of the transport coefficients constrains the additional hairs of the Johannsen-Psaltis black hole. Analytically continuing the pressure of the fluid to all values of the radial coordinate $r$, one obtains interesting Van der Waals-type behavior of the pressure of the fluid which diverges at the radius of the outer ergosphere, lending support, from the Membrane Paradigm's perspective to the claim that relativistic astrophysical jets are produced by the ergoregion of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of instrument noise and astrophysical fluctuations on measurements of the first black hole photon ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently envisioned extensions of the Event Horizon Telescope to space will soon target the black hole photon ring: a narrow ring-shaped imprint of a black hole's strong gravity produced in its images by highly bent photon trajectories. In principle, the shape of the photon ring encodes information about the geometry of the underlying black hole spacetime. In practice, however, whether or not this information can be extracted from the ring shape depends on several factors, ranging from the astrophysical details of the emitting source (such as the magnitude of its plasma fluctuations) to the specific configuration of the interferometric array (such as the separation between its telescopes, or the level of noise in its instruments). Here, we employ a phenomenological model to assess the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and instrument noise on the inferred shape of the photon ring. Our systematic study of several astrophysical profiles suggests that this shape can be measured even in the presence of instrument noise across a wide range of baselines. The measurement accuracy and precision appear relatively insensitive to the noise level, up to a sharp threshold beyond which any measurement becomes incredibly challenging (at least without recourse to more sophisticated data analysis methods). Encouragingly, we find that only a few snapshot images are generally needed to overcome the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and correctly infer the ring diameter. Inference becomes more challenging when analyzing the visibility amplitude in a baseline window that is not entirely dominated by a single photon ring. Nevertheless, in most cases, it is still possible to fit a ring shape with the correct fractional asymmetry. These results provide excellent prospects for future precision measurements of black hole spin and fundamental astrophysics via black hole imaging.</description>

Abstract: Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe may give rise to potentially measurable signatures in the cosmic microwave background. We explore different machine learning approaches to classify harmonic-space realizations of the microwave background in the test case of Euclidean $E_1$ topology (the 3-torus) with a cubic fundamental domain of a size scale significantly smaller than the diameter of the last scattering surface. Different machine learning approaches are capable of classifying the harmonic-space realizations with accuracy greater than 99% if the topology scale is half of the diameter of the last-scattering surface and orientation of the topology is known. For distinguishing random rotations of these sky realizations from realizations of the covering space, the extreme gradient boosting classifier algorithm performs best with an accuracy of 88%. Slightly lower accuracies of 83% to 87% are obtained with the random forest classifier along with one- and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks. The techniques presented here can also accurately classify non-rotated cubic $E_1$ topology realizations with a topology scale slightly larger than the diameter of the last-scattering surface, if provided enough training data. This work identifies the prospects and the main challenges for developing machine learning techniques that are capable of accurately classifying observationally viable topologies.</description>

      <title>Candidate Phases for SU(2) Adjoint QCD$_4$ with Two Flavors from $\mathcal{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory</title>

Abstract: We study four-dimensional adjoint QCD with gauge group SU(2) and two Weyl fermion flavors, which has an $SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry. The infrared behavior of this theory is not firmly established. We explore candidate infrared phases by embedding adjoint QCD into $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory deformed by a supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass M that preserves all global symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. This includes 't Hooft anomalies that are only visible when the theory is placed on manifolds that do not admit a spin structure. The consistency of this procedure is guaranteed by a nonabelian spin-charge relation involving the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry that is familiar from topologically twisted $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories. Since every vacuum on the Coulomb branch of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory necessarily matches all 't Hooft anomalies, we can generate candidate phases for adjoint QCD by deforming the theories in these vacua while preserving all symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. One such deformation is the supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass M itself, which can be reliably analyzed when M is small. In this regime it gives rise to an exotic Coulomb phase without chiral symmetry breaking. By contrast, the theory near the monopole and dyon points can be deformed to realize a candidate phase with monopole-induced confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. The low-energy theory consists of two copies of a $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model, which we analyze in detail. Certain topological couplings that are likely to be present in this $\mathbb{CP}^1$ model turn the confining solitonic string of the model into a topological insulator. We also examine the behavior of various candidate phases under fermion mass deformations. We speculate on the possible large-M behavior of the deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory and conjecture that the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ phase eventually becomes dominant.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Free and Interacting Scalar Field Theories with Bounded Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14702v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a notion of operator growth known as Krylov complexity in free and interacting massive scalar quantum field theories in $d$-dimensions at finite temperature. We consider the effects of mass, one-loop self-energy due to perturbative interactions, and finite ultraviolet cutoffs in continuous momentum space. These deformations change the behavior of Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity and induce effects such as the "staggering" of the former into two families, a decrease in the exponential growth rate of the latter, and transitions in their asymptotic behavior. We also discuss the relation between the existence of a mass gap and the property of staggering, and the relation between our ultraviolet cutoffs in continuous theories and lattice theories.</description>

      <title>Fayet-Iliopoulos D-Term in Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic String Orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fayet-Iliopoulos $D$-term is a common feature in $\mathcal{N}=1$ string vacua that contain an anomalous $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and arises from a one--loop diagram in string perturbation theory. The same diagram is generated in string vacua in which supersymmetry is broken directly at the string scale, either via spontaneous Scherk-Schwarz breaking, in which case the gravitino mass is determined by the radius of the circle used in the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism, or via explicit supersymmetry breaking by the GSO projections. We analyse the resulting would-be Fayet-Illiopoulos $D$-term in the non-supersymmetric string vacua and its contribution to the vacuum energy. A numerical estimate in an explicit tachyon-free string-derived model suggests that the would-be $D$-term contribution may uplift the vacuum energy to a positive value.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Refined Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Distance Conjecture of Ooguri and Vafa holds that any infinite-distance limit in the moduli space of a quantum gravity theory must be accompanied by a tower of exponentially light particles, which places tight constraints on the low-energy effective field theories in these limits. One attempt to extend these constraints to the interior of moduli space is the refined Distance Conjecture, which holds that the towers of light particles predicted by the Distance Conjecture must appear any time a modulus makes a super-Planckian excursion in moduli space. In this note, however, we point out that a tower which satisfies the Distance Conjecture in an infinite-distance limit of moduli space may be parametrically heavier than the Planck scale for an arbitrarily long geodesic distance. This means that the refined Distance Conjecture, in its most naive form, does not place meaningful constraints on low-energy effective field theory. This motivates alternative refinements of the Distance Conjecture, which place an absolute upper bound on the tower mass scale in the interior of moduli space. We explore two possibilities, providing evidence for them and briefly discussing their implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of Parisi where a single particle hops on an infinite-dimensional hypercube, under the influence of a uniform but disordered magnetic flux. We reinterpret the hypercube as the Fock-space graph of a many-body Hamiltonian and the flux as a frustration of the return amplitudes in Fock space. We will identify the set of observables that have the same correlation functions as the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DS-SYK) model, and hence the hypercube model is an equally good quantum model for near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_{1}$ (NAdS$_2$/NCFT$_1$) holography. Unlike the SYK model, the hypercube Hamiltonian is not $p$ local. Instead, the SYK model can be understood as a Fock-space model with similar frustrations. Hence we propose this type of Fock-space frustration as the broader characterization for NAdS$_2$/NCFT$_1$ microscopics, which encompasses the hypercube and the DS-SYK models as two specific examples. We then speculate on the possible origin of such frustrations.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Thermodynamics of Charged Black Holes in Higher Derivative Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connection between bulk and boundary thermodynamics in Einstein-Maxwell theory is well established using AdS/CFT correspondence. In the context of general higher derivative gravity coupled to a U(1) gauge field, we examine the resemblance of the first law of thermodynamics between bulk and boundary, followed by an extended phase space description on both sides. Higher derivative terms related to different powers of the string theory parameter $\alpha'$ emerged from a consistent truncation in the bulk supergravity action. We demonstrate that one must include the fluctuation of $\alpha'$ in the bulk thermodynamics as a bookkeeping tool to match the bulk first law and Smarr relation with the boundary side. Consequently, the Euler relation and the boundary first law are altered by adding two central charges ($\mathtt{a}$, $\mathtt{c}$). To support our general conclusion, we consider the black hole in Gauss-Bonnet gravity and the general four-derivative theory. Finally, we examine the bulk and boundary aspects of the extended phase space description for higher derivative corrected black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study a model in nonlinear electrodynamics in the presence of a CPT-even term that violates Lorentz symmetry. The Lorentz-breaking vector, in addition to the usual background magnetic field, produces interesting effects in the dispersion relations. The consequences on the vacuum refractive index and the group velocity are studied. Vacuum birefringence is discussed in the case the nonlinear electrodynamics is a Euler-Heisenberg model.</description>

Abstract: We survey recent developments in a novel kind of generalized global symmetry, the non-invertible symmetry, in diverse spacetime dimensions. We start with several different but related constructions of the non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry in the Ising model, and conclude with a new interpretation for the neutral pion decay and other applications.

      <title>Celestial holography from Chiral strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11799v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we studied the relationship between celestial holography and chiral strings. Chiral strings differ from the usual string theory by a change of boundary conditions on the string propagators. It is shown that chiral strings would reproduce graviton amplitudes and could serve as an alternative description of Einstein's gravity. Celestial holography is a proposed duality between gravity in asymptotically flat space-time and a CFT living on its conformal boundary. Since both are CFT descriptions of gravity, we investigate the potential connection between these two formalisms. In this paper, we find that both the energetic as well as conformal soft theorems could be derived from the OPEs of vertex operators of chiral strings. All operators in the CCFT can be described by Mellin transforming the vertex operators in the chiral string theories, and the OPE coefficients of CCFT can also be obtained from the world-sheet description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ scattering amplitudes in curved space to model the dynamics of a light probe particle with mass $m$ orbiting in the background spacetime induced by a heavy gravitational source with mass $M$. Observables are organized as an expansion in $m/M$ to all orders in $G$ -- the gravitational self-force expansion. An essential component of our analysis is the backreaction of the heavy source which we capture by including the associated light degrees of freedom. As illustration we consider a Schwarzschild background and verify geodesic motion as well as the first-order self-force correction to two-body scattering through ${\cal O}(G^3)$. Amplitudes in curved space offer several advantages, and further developments along these lines may advance the computation of gravitational-wave signals for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the bulk reconstruction in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We demonstrate that the subregion duality fails to hold, highlighting discrepancies between operators in causal wedge reconstruction and those in global reconstruction at the leading order in the large $N$ limit. We argue the invalidity of the entanglement wedge reconstruction, attributing it to non-perturbative finite $N$ effects or quantum gravity effects due to the trans-Planckian modes near the horizon. Nevertheless, we propose the subregion complementarity, illustrating that different CFT operators can describe a bulk subregion. While we expect that this complementarity is valid outside the horizon in general eternal black holes, it is inapplicable for single-sided black holes where a semi-classical description at the stretched horizon is absent.</description>

Abstract: The Emergent String Conjecture of Lee, Lerche, and Weigand holds that every infinite-distance limit in the moduli space of a quantum gravity represents either a decompactification limit or an emergent string limit in some duality frame. Within the context of 5d supergravities coming from M-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds, we find evidence for this conjecture by studying (a) the gauge couplings and (b) the BPS spectrum, which is encoded in the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of the threefold. In the process, we disuss a testable geometric consequence of the Emergent String Conjecture, and we verify that it is satisfied in all complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds in products of projective spaces (CICYs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Page curve plotted by the typical random state approximation is not applicable to a system with conserved quantities, such as the evaporation process of a charged black hole during which the electric charge does not radiate out with a uniform rate macroscopically. In this context the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy may play a significant role in describing the entanglement structure of such a system. We attempt to impose constraints on microscopic quantum states to match with the macroscopic phenomenon of the charge radiation during black hole evaporation. Specifically, we consider a simple qubit system with conserved spin/charge serving as a toy model for the evaporation of charged black holes. We propose refined rules for selecting a random state with conserved quantities to simulate the distribution of charges during the different stages of evaporation, and obtain refined Page curves that exhibit distinct features in contrast to the original Page curve. We find the refined Page curve may have a different Page time and exhibit asymmetric behavior on both sides of the Page time. Such refined Page curves may provide more realistic description for the entanglement between the charged black hole and radiation during the process of evaporation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of holographic homogeneous solids (HHS) at finite temperature and in presence of a background shear strain by means of a large scale quasi-normal mode analysis which extends beyond the hydrodynamic limit. We find that mechanical instability can arise either as a result of a complex speed of sound -- gradient instability -- or of a negative diffusion constant. Surprisingly, the simplest HHS models are linearly stable for arbitrarily large values of the background strain. For more complex HHS, the onset of the diffusive instability always precedes that of the gradient instability, which becomes the dominant destabilizing process only above a critical value of the background shear strain. Finally, we observe that the critical strains for the two instabilities approach each other at low temperatures. We conclude by presenting a phase diagram for HHS as a function of temperature and background shear strain which shows interesting similarities with the physics of superfluids in presence of background superfluid velocity.</description>

Abstract: Flat space cosmologies (FSCs) are time dependent solutions of three-dimensional (3D) gravity with a vanishing cosmological constant. They can be constructed from a discrete quotient of empty 3D flat spacetime and are also called shifted-boost orbifolds. Using this quotient structure, we build a new and generalized Selberg zeta function for FSCs, and show that it is directly related to the scalar 1-loop partition function. We then propose an extension of this formalism applicable to more general quotient manifolds $\mathcal M/\mathbb Z$, based on representation theory of fields propagating on this background. Our prescription constitutes a novel and expedient method for calculating regularized 1-loop determinants, without resorting to the heat kernel. We compute quasinormal modes in the FSC using the zeroes of a Selberg zeta function, and match them to known results.</description>

To do so, we compute the spatial shift suffered by the EFT modes at a fixed time slice within the WKB approximation and the regime of validity of the EFT. We analyze the bounds arising on shift-symmetric scalars and curved space generalizations of Galileons.</description>

Abstract: An AdS$_2$ black hole in equilibrium with a finite temperature non-gravitating bath comes with a Hawking-like information paradox. The resolution of this paradox requires introducing an island for the bath after the Page time. Since the island region contains the black hole interior, the consistency of the island paradigm demands the failure of any interior reconstruction proposal that uses only the operators in the AdS$_2$ region outside the black hole horizon after the Page time. In this paper, we investigate the consistency of the island paradigm using the black hole interior reconstruction proposal due to Leutheusser and Liu. They argued that the operators in the interior of a black hole can be reconstructed by the half-sided translations of the operators outside the black hole horizon. However, in order to illustrate the island paradigm we need to modify the Leutheusser-Liu proposal by introducing the notion of the reduced half-sided translations. The reduced half-sided translations, unlike the half-sided translations, have non-trivial action only on the operators in the AdS$_2$ black hole region. As a result, the reconstructed interior operators are expressed only using the operators in the AdS$_2$ region outside the black hole horizon. We demonstrate the consistency of the island paradigm by showing that the reduced half-sided translations which successfully reconstruct the operators in the black hole interior before the Page time become trivial after the Page time, and hence fail to reconstruct the interior operators after the Page time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Propagating chiral magnetic waves (CMW) are expected to exist in chiral plasmas due to the interplay between the chiral magnetic and chiral separation effects induced by the presence of a chiral anomaly. Unfortunately, it was pointed out that, because of the effects of electric conductivity and dissipation, CMW are overdamped and therefore their signatures are unlikely to be seen in heavy-ion collision experiments and in the quark gluon plasma. Nonetheless, the chiral anomaly plays a fundamental role in Weyl semimetals and their anomalous transport properties as well. Hence, CMW could be potentially observed in topological semimetals using table-top experiments. By using a holographic model for strongly coupled Weyl semimetals, we investigate in detail the nature of CMW in presence of Coulomb interactions and axial charge relaxation and estimate whether, and in which regimes, CMW could be observed as underdamped collective excitations in topological materials.</description>

      <title>The Entropy of Dynamical Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole$-$valid to leading order for perturbations off of a stationary black hole background$-$in an arbitrary classical diffeomorphism covariant Lagrangian theory of gravity in $n$ dimensions. In stationary eras, this formula agrees with the usual Noether charge formula, but in nonstationary eras, we obtain a nontrivial correction term. In general relativity, our formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole is $1/4$ of the horizon area plus a term involving the integral of the expansion of the null generators of the horizon, which we show is $1/4$ of the area of the apparent horizon to leading order. Our formula for entropy in a general theory of gravity obeys a "local physical process version" of the first law of black hole thermodynamics. For first order perturbations sourced by external matter that satisfies the null energy condition, our entropy obeys the second law of black hole thermodynamics. For vacuum perturbations, the second law is obeyed at leading order if and only if the "modified canonical energy flux" is positive (as is the case in general relativity but presumably would not hold in general theories). We obtain a general relationship between our formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole and a formula proposed independently by Dong and by Wall. We then consider the generalized second law in semiclassical gravity for first order perturbations of a stationary black hole. We show that the validity of the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) on a Killing horizon is equivalent to the generalized second law using our notion of black hole entropy but using a modified notion of von Neumann entropy for matter. On the other hand, the generalized second law for the Dong-Wall entropy is equivalent to an integrated version of QNEC, using the unmodified von Neumann entropy for the entropy of matter.</description>

      <title>Universality of pseudo-Goldstone damping near critical points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, in studies of holographic models and hydrodynamics with spontaneous breaking of approximate symmetries, it has been proposed that the damping of pseudo-Goldstone modes at finite temperatures is universally constrained in the way that $\Omega_{\varphi}/m_{\varphi}^2\simeq D_{\varphi}$ in the broken phase, where $\Omega_{\varphi}$ and $m_{\varphi} $ are the relaxation rate at zero wavenumber and the mass of pseudo-Goldstones, $D_{\varphi}$ is the Goldstone diffusivity in the limit of purely spontaneous breaking. In this paper, we investigate the pseudo-Goldstone damping in a purely relaxational O($N$) model by performing the functional renormalization group calculations at the full quantum and stochastic level within the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We find that, away from the critical temperature, the proposed relation is always valid. When the temperature is very close to the critical value such that the mass of the Higgs mode is comparable to the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone modes, the pseudo-Goldstone damping displays a novel scaling behavior that follows $\Omega_\varphi/m_\varphi^2\propto m_{\varphi}^{\Delta_\eta}$ with a correction $\Delta_\eta$ controlled by the critical universalities. Moreover, we study how the correction depends on the value of $N$ and show that $\Delta_\eta \rightarrow 0$ when fluctuations are infinitely suppressed in the large $N$ limit. In this case, the proposed relation works even in the critical region. Finally, we match our results to the dissipative sector of the pion dynamics near the chiral phase transition.</description>

      <title>Bjorken and threshold asymptotics of a space-like structure function in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06787v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a coordinate space structure function ${\cal E}(z^2m^2,\lambda)$ in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model to the next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion. We analytically perform the twist expansion in the Bjorken limit through double Mellin representations. Hard and non-perturbative scaling functions are naturally generated in their Borel representations with detailed enumerations and explicit expressions provided to all powers. The renormalon cancellation at $t=n$ between the hard functions at powers $p$ and the non-perturbative functions at powers $p+n$ are explicitly verified, and the issue of ``scale-dependency'' of the perturbative and non-perturbative functions is explained naturally. Simple expressions for the leading power non-perturbative functions are also provided both in the coordinate space and the momentum-fraction space ($0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) with ``zero-mode-type'' subtractions at $\alpha=0$ discussed in detail. In addition to the Bjorken limit, we also perform the threshold expansion of the structure function up to the next-to-next-to-leading threshold power exactly and investigate the resurgence relation between threshold and ``Regge'' asymptotics. We also prove that the twist expansion is absolutely convergent for any $0&lt;z^2&lt;\infty$ and any $ \lambda \in iR_{\ge 0}$.</description>

Abstract: The Poincar\'e symmetry can be contracted in two ways to yield the Galilei symmetry and the Carroll symmetry. The Schr\"odinger equation exhibits the Galilei symmetry and is a fundamental equation in Galilean quantum mechanics. However, the question remains: what is the quantum equation that corresponds to the Carroll symmetry? In this paper, we derive a novel equation, called the Carroll-Schr\"odinger equation, which describes the quantum dynamics in the Carrollian framework. We also introduce the Carroll-Schr\"odinger algebra, which is a conformal extension of the centrally extended Carroll algebra, and show that it is the symmetry algebra of the Carroll-Schr\"odinger equation in two dimensions. We generalize our results to arbitrary dimensions and discuss some possible applications and extensions of our work.</description>

Abstract: We discuss giant graviton expansions for the Schur index of ${\cal N}=4$ $U(N)$ SYM with the insertion of Wilson lines of the fundamental and the anti-fundamental representations. We first propose a double-sum giant graviton expansion and numerically confirm that it correctly reproduces the line-operator index. We also find that it reduces to a simple-sum expansion when we treat the index as a Taylor series with respect to a specific fugacity.</description>

      <title>More on Black Holes Perceiving the Dark Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last two years the dark dimension scenario has emerged as focal point of many research interests. In particular, it functions as a stepping stone to address the cosmological hierarchy problem and provides a colosseum for dark matter contenders. We reexamine the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. We re-assess limits on the abundance of PBHs as dark matter candidates from $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from Hawking evaporation. We re-evaluate constraints from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of the Galactic center which offer the best and most solid upper limits on the dark matter fraction composed of PBHs. The revised mass range which allows PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter is estimated to be $10^{15} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. We demonstrate that due to the constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission, quantum corrections due to the speculative memory burden effect do not modify this mass range. We also investigate the main characteristics of PBHs which are localized in the bulk. We show that PBHs localized in the bulk can make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. Finally, we comment on the black holes that could be produced if one advocates a space with two boundaries for the dark dimension.</description>

      <title>Topological actions of Temperley-Lieb algebras and Representation Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Temperley-Lieb algebras $\textrm{TL}_n(\delta)$ at $\delta = 1$. Since $\delta = 1$, we can consider the multiplicative monoid structure and ask how this monoid acts on topological spaces. Given a monoid action on a topological space, we get an algebra action on each homology group. The main theorem of this paper explicitly deduces the representation structure of the homology groups in terms of a natural filtration associated with our $\textrm{TL}_n$-space. As a corollary of this result, we are able to study stability phenomena. There is a natural way to define representation stability in the context of $\textrm{TL}_n(1)$, and the presence of filtrations enables us to define a notion of topological stability. We are able to deduce that a filtration-stable sequence of $\textrm{TL}_n$-spaces results in representation-stable sequence of homology groups. This can be thought of as the analogue of the statement that the homology of configuration spaces forms a finitely generated $\textrm{FI}$-module.</description>

Abstract: The shortest distance around the Universe through us is unlikely to be much larger than the horizon diameter if microwave background anomalies are due to cosmic topology. We show that observational constraints from the lack of matched temperature circles in the microwave background leave many possibilities for such topologies. We evaluate the detectability of microwave background multipole correlations for sample cases. Searches for topology signatures in observational data over the large space of possible topologies pose a formidable computational challenge.</description>

      <title>On Thermodynamic Stability of Black Holes. Part I: Classical Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical thermodynamic stability of the standard black hole solutions by implementing the intrinsic necessary and sufficient conditions for stable global and local thermodynamic equilibrium. The criteria for such equilibria are quite generic and well-established in classical thermodynamics, but they have not been fully utilized in black hole physics. We show how weaker or incomplete conditions could lead to misleading or incorrect results for the thermodynamic stability of the system. We also stress the importance of finding all possible local heat capacities in order to fully describe the classical equilibrium picture of black holes. Finally, we thoroughly investigate the critical and phase transition curves and the limits of the classical analysis. This paper is the first in the line of intended works on thermodynamic stability of black holes in modified theories of gravity and holography.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger as a Quantum Programmer: Estimating Entanglement via Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying entanglement is an important task by which the resourcefulness of a quantum state can be measured. Here we develop a quantum algorithm that tests for and quantifies the separability of a general bipartite state, by making use of the quantum steering effect, the latter originally discovered by Schr\"odinger. Our separability test consists of a distributed quantum computation involving two parties: a computationally limited client, who prepares a purification of the state of interest, and a computationally unbounded server, who tries to steer the reduced systems to a probabilistic ensemble of pure product states. To design a practical algorithm, we replace the role of the server by a combination of parameterized unitary circuits and classical optimization techniques to perform the necessary computation. The result is a variational quantum steering algorithm (VQSA), which is a modified separability test that is better suited for the capabilities of quantum computers available today. We then simulate our VQSA on noisy quantum simulators and find favorable convergence properties on the examples tested. We also develop semidefinite programs, executable on classical computers, that benchmark the results obtained from our VQSA. Our findings here thus provide a meaningful connection between steering, entanglement, quantum algorithms, and quantum computational complexity theory. They also demonstrate the value of a parameterized mid-circuit measurement in a VQSA and represent a first-of-its-kind application for a distributed VQA.</description>

Abstract: In earlier work of two of the authors, two 1-loop polynomial invariants of cusped 3-manifolds were constructed using combinatorial data of ideal triangulations, and conjectured to be equal to the $\mathbb{C}^2$ and the $\mathbb{C}^3$-torsion polynomials. Here, we prove this conjecture for all fibered 3-manifolds with toroidal boundary, and we illustrate our theorems with exact computations of the 1-loop and the torsion polynomials. As further evidence for the conjecture, we confirm it for more than 6,600 nonfibered manifolds, and use this data to explore the extent to which the $\mathbb{C}^2$-torsion determines the Thurston norm.</description>

      <title>The Heterotic-Ricci flow and its three-dimensional solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel curvature flow, the Heterotic-Ricci flow, as the two-loop renormalization group flow of the Heterotic string common sector and study its three-dimensional compact solitons. The Heterotic-Ricci flow is a coupled curvature evolution flow, depending on a non-negative real parameter $\kappa$, for a complete Riemannian metric and a three-form $H$ on a manifold $M$. Its most salient feature is that it involves several terms quadratic in the curvature tensor of a metric connection with skew-symmetric torsion $H$. When $\kappa = 0$ the Heterotic-Ricci flow reduces to the generalized Ricci flow and hence it can be understood as a modification of the latter via the second-order correction prescribed by Heterotic string theory, whereas when $H=0$ and $\kappa &gt;0$ the Heterotic-Ricci flow reduces to a constrained version of the RG-2 flow and hence it can be understood as a generalization of the latter via the introduction of the three-form $H$. Solutions of Heterotic supergravity with trivial gauge bundle, which we call Heterotic solitons, define a particular class of three-dimensional solitons for the Heterotic-Ricci flow and constitute our main object of study. We prove a number of structural results for three-dimensional Heterotic solitons, obtaining the complete classification of compact three-dimensional strong Heterotic solitons as hyperbolic three-manifolds or quotients of the Heisenberg group equipped with a left-invariant metric. Furthermore, we prove that all Einstein three-dimensional Heterotic solitons have constant dilaton. In this direction, we prove that Einstein Heterotic solitons with constant dilaton are rigid and therefore cannot be deformed into a solution with non-constant dilaton. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first rigidity result for compact supergravity solutions in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</description>

      <title>Constraint on cosmological constant in generalized Skryme-teleparallel system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Einstein-Skyrme system is understood to defy the "no hair" conjecture by possessing black-hole solutions with fractional baryon number outside the event horizon. In this article, we extend the study of the Skyrme system to teleparallel gravity framework. We consider two scenarios, the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) and generalized teleparallel gravity $f(T)$. In our analysis, we compute the fractional baryon number beyond the black-hole horizon and its correlation with the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$). In the TEGR context, where $f(T) = -T - 2\Lambda$, the results match with the Einstein-Skyrme model, assuming a positive $\Lambda$. More interestingly, in generalized teleparallel gravity scenario, defined by $f(T) = -T - \tau T^2 - 2\Lambda$, we show that the existence of a solution demands that not only must $\Lambda$ be positive but has to lie in a range, $\Lambda_{min} &lt; \Lambda &lt; \Lambda_{max}$. While the upper bound depends inversely on $\tau$, the lower bound is a linear function of it. Hence, in the limiting case with generalized teleparallel gravity converging towards TEGR ($\tau \rightarrow 0$), the constraints on the cosmological constant relax to the Einstein Skryme system ($\Lambda_{min}$ approaches zero and $\Lambda_{max}$ becomes unbounded). On the other hand, in f(T) gravity, vanishing cosmological constant solution is found only if the lower bound on the energy of the soliton is very large.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non--commutativity as a Perturbation in the Schwarzschild Black Hole: Quasinormal Modes, Scattering, and Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, by a novel approach to studying the scattering of a Schwarzschild black hole, the non--commutativity is introduced as a perturbation. We begin by reformulating the Klein--Gordon equation for the scalar field in a new form that takes into account the deformed non--commutative spacetime. Using this formulation, an effective potential for the scattering process is derived. To calculate the quasinormal modes, we employ the WKB method and also utilize fitting techniques to investigate the impact of non--commutativity on the scalar quasinormal modes. We thoroughly analyze the results obtained from these different methods. Moreover, the greybody factor and absorption cross section are investigated. Additionally, we explore the behavior of null geodesics in the presence of non--commutativity. Specifically, we examine the photonic, and shadow radius as well as the light trajectories for different non--commutative parameters. Therefore, by addressing these various aspects, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of non--commutativity on the scattering of a Schwarzschild--like black hole and its implications for the behavior of scalar fields and light trajectories.</description>

      <title>Scalar Cosmological Perturbations from Quantum Entanglement within Lorentzian Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the dynamics of (isotropic) scalar perturbations from the mean-field hydrodynamics of full Lorentzian quantum gravity, as described by a two-sector (timelike and spacelike) Barrett-Crane group field theory (GFT) model. The rich causal structure of this model allows us to consistently implement in the quantum theory the causal properties of a physical Lorentzian reference frame composed of four minimally coupled, massless, and free scalar fields. Using this frame, we are able to effectively construct relational observables that are used to recover macroscopic cosmological quantities. In particular, small isotropic scalar inhomogeneities emerge as a result of (relational) nearest-neighbor two-body entanglement between degrees of freedom of the underlying quantum gravity theory. The dynamical equations we obtain for geometric and matter perturbations show agreement with those of classical general relativity in the long-wavelength, super-horizon limit. In general, deviations become important for sub-horizon modes, which seem to be naturally associated with a trans-Planckian regime in our physical reference frame. We argue that these trans-Planckian corrections are quantum gravitational in nature. However, we explicitly show that for some physically interesting solutions these quantum gravity effects can be quite small, leading to a very good agreement with the classical GR behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic radiation emitted by an accelerated charged particle can be described theoretically as the interaction of the charge with the so-called Fulling-Davies-Unruh thermal bath in the coordinate frame co-accelerated with the charge. We present a similar analysis on the gravitational radiation from a classical point mass uniformly accelerated, being pulled by a string satisfying the weak energy condition. In particular, we derive the interaction rate (with fixed transverse momentum) of this system of the point mass and string in the Fulling-Davies-Unruh thermal bath in the co-accelerated frame and show that it equals the graviton emission rate calculated in the standard method in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Feynman integrals in general cannot be expressed as well-studied special functions, they can be calculated systematically and efficiently using the \texttt{AMFlow} method in combination with differential equations in the kinematic space. Therefore, it is constructive to define Feynman integrals as a new class of special functions (or transcedental numbers if there is no kinematic variable). Several crucial avenues for further exploration in this direction are outlined.</description>

      <title>Screening fifth forces in scalar-vector-tensor theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a screening mechanism in the context of scalar-vector-tensor (SVT) theories. This screening mechanism is based on both the derivative self-interactions of the vector field and the interactions of the scalar field with the vector field and curvature. We calculate the field equations in a spherically symmetric space-time, and then, we study the conditions for which this mechanism is successful in a weak gravitational background. In order to corroborate these analytical results, we have performed a numerical integration of the full equations. Finally, the corrections to the gravitational potentials have also been computed. We conclude that the present model, including both kinds of interactions, can avoid the propagation of the additional longitudinal mode arising in these theories. We also show that the space parameter of the model is compatible with solar system constraints. This result extends the previous one found in the literature for generalized Proca theories to the case of SVT theories in the presence of scalar-vector interactions.</description>

      <title>Study of scalar particles through the Klein-Gordon equation under rainbow gravity effects in Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our investigation, we explore the quantum dynamics of charge-free scalar particles through the Klein-Gordon equation within the framework of rainbow gravity's, considering the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda (BML) space-time background. The BML solution is characterized by the magnetic field strength along the axis of symmetry direction which is related with the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the topological parameter $\alpha$ of the geometry. The behavior of charge-free scalar particles described by the Klein-Gordon equation is investigated, utilizing two sets of rainbow functions: (i) $f(\chi)=\frac{(e^{\beta\,\chi}-1)}{\beta\,\chi}$,\, $h(\chi)=1$ and (ii) $f(\chi)=1$,\, $h(\chi)=1+\frac{\beta\,\chi}{2}$. Here $0 &lt; \Big(\chi=\frac{|E|}{E_p}\Big) \leq 1$ with $E$ represents the particle's energy, $E_p$ is the Planck's energy, and $\beta$ is the rainbow parameter. We obtain the approximate analytical solutions for the scalar particles and conduct a thorough analysis of the obtained results. Afterwards, we study the quantum dynamics of quantum oscillator fields within this BML space-time, employing the Klein-Gordon oscillator. Here also, we choose the same sets of rainbow functions and obtained approximate eigenvalue solution for the oscillator fields. Notably, we demonstrate that the relativistic approximate energy profiles of charge-free scalar particles and oscillator fields get influenced by the topology of the geometry and the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we show that the energy profiles of scalar particles get modifications by the rainbow parameter and the quantum oscillator fields by both the rainbow parameter and the frequency of oscillation</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, our focus is on investigating the impact of cosmological constant on relativistic quantum systems comprising spin-0 scalar particles. Our analysis centers around the Klein-Gordon equation, and we obtain both approximate and exact analytical solutions for spin-0 particles of the quantum system. Afterwards, we explore quantum oscillator fields by considering the Klein-Gordon oscillator within the same space-time characterized by a cosmological constant. We obtain an approximate expression for the energy eigenvalue of the oscillator fields. In fact, the energy spectrum in both scenarios are examined and show the influences of the cosmological constant and geometry's topology. Our investigation is situated within the context of a magnetic universe-a four-dimensional cosmological space-time recognized as the Bonnor-Melvin universe</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of the relativistic quantum dynamics of spin-0 scalar particles, as described by the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) equation, within the framework of a magnetic space-time. Our focus is on the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda (BML) solution, a four-dimensional magnetic universe characterized by a magnetic field that varies with axial distance. To initiate this investigation, we derive the radial equation using a suitable wave function ansatz and subsequently employ special functions to solve it. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to include Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau oscillator fields within the same BML space-time background. We derive the corresponding radial equation and solve it using special functions. Significantly, our results show that the geometry's topology and the cosmological constant (both are related with the magnetic field strength) influences the eigenvalue solution of spin-0 DKP fields and DKP-oscillator fields, leading to substantial modifications in the overall outcomes</description>

      <title>Muon $g-2$ and Proton Lifetime in SUSY SU(5) GUTs with Split Superpartners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the interplay of the muon $g-2$ anomaly and the proton decay in the SUSY SU(5) GUTs with generation-independent scalar soft masses. In these scenarios, we introduce a number of $\bf 5+{\bar 5}$ messenger fields with doublet-triplet splitting in general gauge mediation to transmit SUSY breaking to the visible sector by gauge loops. As a result, squarks and sleptons receive generation-independent soft SUSY breaking masses, which are split already at the messenger scale. Taking into account the perturbative unification of gauge couplings as well as the bounds from electroweak precision and vacuum stability bounds, we showed the parameter space in general gauge mediation to explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly with smuon and sneutrino loops while evading the strong bounds on squarks and gluinos from the Large Hadron Collider. We also obtained the dominant Higgsino contributions to the proton decay mode, $p\to K^+{\bar\nu}$, with general generation-independent sparticle masses for squarks and sleptons. Even for split scalar soft masses in our model, however, we found that the bounds from the proton decay are satisfied only if the effective Yukawa couplings of the colored Higgsinos are suppressed further by a factor of order $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$. We illustrated how such a suppression factor is realized in orbifold GUTs in the extra dimension where the colored Higgsinos in the bulk are not coupled to the matter fields localized at the orbifold fixed points at the leading order.</description>

      <title>The resonant history of gravitational atoms in black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can produce superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons. When the black hole is part of a binary system, its cloud can undergo resonances and ionization. These processes leave a distinct signature on the gravitational waveform that depends on the cloud's properties. To determine the state of the cloud by the time the system enters the band of future millihertz detectors, we study the chronological sequence of resonances encountered during the inspiral. For the first time, we consistently take into account the nonlinearities induced by the orbital backreaction and we allow the orbit to have generic eccentricity and inclination. We find that the resonance phenomenology exhibits striking new features. Resonances can "start" or "break" above critical thresholds of the parameters, which we compute analytically, and induce dramatic changes in eccentricity and inclination. Applying these results to realistic systems, we find two possible outcomes. If the binary and the cloud are sufficiently close to counter-rotating, the cloud survives in its original state until the system enters in band; otherwise, the cloud is destroyed during a resonance at large separations, but leaves an imprint on the eccentricity and inclination. In both scenarios, we characterize the observational signatures, with particular focus on future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider massive scalar field perturbations in the background of black holes immersed in Chaplygin-like dark fluid (CDF), and we analyze the photon sphere modes, the de Sitter modes as well as the near extremal modes and discuss their dominance, by using the pseudospectral Chebyshev method and the third order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. We also discuss the impact of the parameter representing the intensity of the CDF on the families of quasinormal modes. Mainly, we find that the propagation of a massive scalar field is stable in this background, and it is characterized by quasinormal frequencies with a smaller oscillation frequency and a longer decay time compared to the propagation of the same massive scalar field within the Schwarzschild-de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <title>Wormhole solutions under the effect of dark matter in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the background of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, this work investigates three distinct dark matter halo profiles to test the possibility of generalised wormhole geometry within the galactic halo regions. The current study aims to accomplish these goals by examining various dark matter profiles including Universal Rotation Curves (URC), Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model-I, and NFW model-II inside two distinct $f(R, L_m)$ gravity models. According to the $f(R, L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + L_m^\alpha$ model, the DM halo density profiles produce suitable shape functions that meet all the necessary requirements for exhibiting the wormhole geometries with appropriate choice of free parameters. In addition, to examine DM profiles under the $f(R, L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + (1 + \lambda R)L_m$ model, we consider a specific shape function. Further, we observed that the derived solution from both two models violates the null energy constraints, confirming that the DM supports wormholes to maintain in the galactic halo.</description>
