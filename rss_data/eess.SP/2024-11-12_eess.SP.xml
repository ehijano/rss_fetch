      <title>Demo: Multi-Modal Seizure Prediction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This demo presents SeizNet, an innovative system for predicting epileptic seizures benefiting from a multi-modal sensor network and utilizing Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Epilepsy affects approximately 65 million people worldwide, many of whom experience drug-resistant seizures. SeizNet aims at providing highly accurate alerts, allowing individuals to take preventive measures without being disturbed by false alarms. SeizNet uses a combination of data collected through either invasive (intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG)) or non-invasive (electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)) sensors, and processed by advanced DL algorithms that are optimized for real-time inference at the edge, ensuring privacy and minimizing data transmission. SeizNet achieves &gt; 97% accuracy in seizure prediction while keeping the size and energy restrictions of an implantable device.</description>

      <title>Filter-Banks for Ultra-Wideband Communications: Advantages and Design Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, filter-bank multicarrier spread spectrum (FBMC-SS) has been proposed as a candidate waveform for ultra-wideband (UWB) communications. It has been noted that FBMC-SS is a perfect match to this application, leading to a trivial method of matching to the required spectral mask at different regions of the world. FBMC-SS also allows easy rejection of high-power interfering signals that may appear over different parts of the UWB spectral band. In this paper, we concentrate on the use of staggered multitone spread spectrum (SMT-SS) for UWB communications. SMT makes use of offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM) to transmit data symbols over narrowband, overlapping subcarrier bands. This form of FBMC-SS is well-suited to UWB communications because it has good spectral efficiency and a flat power spectral density (PSD), resulting in good utilization of the UWB spectral mask. Additionally, we explore new methods for multi-coding that result in higher bit rates than previous FBMC-SS systems. Moreover, we study methods for equalizing the UWB multipath channel and cancelling narrowband interference. Excellent performance of the proposed methods are substantiated by presenting simulation results.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Newton OMP Approach for Super-Resolution Channel Estimation and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel estimation and extrapolation are fundamental issues in MIMO communication systems. In this paper, we proposed the quasi-Newton orthogonal matching pursuit (QNOMP) approach to overcome these issues with high efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The algorithm consists of two stages on the super-resolution recovery: we first performed a cheap on-grid OMP estimation of channel parameters in the sparsity domain (e.g., delay or angle), then an off-grid optimization to achieve the super-resolution. In the off-grid stage, we employed the BFGS quasi-Newton method to jointly estimate the parameters through a multipath model, which improved the speed and accuracy significantly. Furthermore, we derived the optimal extrapolated solution in the linear minimum mean squared estimator criterion, revealed its connection with Slepian basis, and presented a practical algorithm to realize the extrapolation based on the QNOMP results. Special treatment utilizing the block sparsity nature of the considered channels was also proposed. Numerical experiments on the simulated models and CDL-C channels demonstrated the high performance and low computational complexity of QNOMP.</description>

      <title>Altitude-Dependent Cellular Spectrum Occupancy: from Measurements to Stochastic Geometry Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for aerial connectivity with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) across diverse settings, ranging from urban to rural scenarios, requires developing a better understanding of spectrum occupancy at aerial corridors. In particular, understanding the altitude-dependent behavior of spectrum occupancy in cellular networks, which could be used in the future for enabling beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) UAV connectivity, is critical. While there are existing models for characterizing altitude-dependent interference in the literature, they are not validated with data and need to be compared with real-world measurements. To address these gaps, in this paper, we conduct cellular spectrum occupancy measurements at various sub-6 GHz bands for altitudes up to 300 meters, in both urban and rural environments. To model the spectrum occupancy measurements, we introduce two different approaches: a theoretical model utilizing stochastic geometry with altitude-dependent factors (SOSGAD), and a ray-tracing model tailored to site-specific line of sight (LOS) and non-LOS scenarios. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the SOSGAD model as the UAV altitude increases. Through comparative analysis, we assess the effectiveness of the SOSGAD and ray-tracing models for characterizing actual spectrum occupancy as a function of altitude. Our results show that the proposed SOSGAD model can be tuned to closely characterize the real-world spectrum occupancy behavior as the UAV altitude increases.</description>

      <title>Low Dynamic Range for RIS-aided Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following paper presents a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system model scenario, where a base station communicates with a user, and a bi-static sensing unit, i.e. the passive radar (PR), senses targets using downlink signals. Given that the RIS aids with communication and sensing tasks, this paper introduces new interfering paths that can overwhelm the PR with unnecessarily high power, namely the path interference (PI), \textit{which is itself a combination of two interfering paths, the direct path interference (DPI) and the reflected path interference (RPI)}. For this, we formulate an optimization framework that allows the system to carry on with its ISAC tasks, through analog space-time beamforming at the sensing unit, in collaboration with RIS phase shift and statistical transmit covariance matrix optimization, while minimizing the PI power. As the proposed optimization problem is non-convex, we tailor a block-cyclic coordinate descent (BCCD) method to decouple the non-convex sub-problem from the convex one. A Riemannian conjugate gradient method is devised to generate the RIS and PR space-time beamforming phase shifts per BCCD iteration, while the convex sub-problem is solved via off-the-shelf solvers. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solver when compared with benchmarking ones.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Semantic Communication and Cooperative Tracking Control for a UAV Swarm over Wireless MIMO Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the semantic communication and cooperative tracking control for an UAV swarm comprising a leader UAV and a group of follower UAVs, all interconnected via unreliable wireless multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Initially, we develop a dynamic model for the UAV swarm that accounts for both the internal interactions among the cooperative follower UAVs and the imperfections inherent in the MIMO channels that interlink the leader and follower UAVs. Building on this model, we incorporate the power costs of the UAVs and formulate the communication and cooperative tracking control challenge as a drift-plus-penalty optimization problem. We then derive a closed-form optimal solution that maintains a decentralized semantic architecture, dynamically adjusting to the tracking error costs and local channel conditions within the swarm. Employing Lyapunov drift analysis, we establish closed-form sufficient conditions for the stabilization of the UAV swarm's tracking performance. Numerical results demonstrate the significant enhancements in our proposed scheme over various state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>SuperResolution Radar Gesture Recognitio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible." Driver's interaction with a vehicle via automatic gesture recognition is expected to enhance driving safety by decreasing driver's distraction. Optical and infrared-based gesture recognition systems are limited by occlusions, poor lighting, and varying thermal conditions and, therefore, have limited performance in practical in-cabin applications. Radars are insensitive to lighting or thermal conditions and, therefore, are more suitable for in-cabin applications. However, the spatial resolution of conventional radars is insufficient for accurate gesture recognition. The main objective of this research is to derive an accurate gesture recognition approach using low-resolution radars with deep learning-based super-resolution processing. The main idea is to reconstruct high-resolution information from the radar's low-resolution measurements. The major challenge is the derivation of the real-time processing approach. The proposed approach combines conventional signal processing and deep learning methods. The radar echoes are arranged in 3D data cubes and processed using a super-resolution model to enhance range and Doppler resolution. The FFT is used to generate the range-Doppler maps, which enter the deep neural network for efficient gesture recognition. The preliminary results demonstrated the proposed approach's efficiency in achieving high gesture recognition performance using conventional low-resolution radars.</description>

      <title>AE-DENet: Enhancement for Deep Learning-based Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based methods have demonstrated remarkable achievements in addressing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channel estimation challenges. However, existing DL-based methods mainly rely on separate real and imaginary inputs while ignoring the inherent correlation between the two streams, such as amplitude and phase information that are fundamental in communication signal processing. This paper proposes AE-DENet, a novel autoencoder(AE)-based data enhancement network to improve the performance of existing DL-based channel estimation methods. AE-DENet focuses on enriching the classic least square (LS) estimation input commonly used in DL-based methods by employing a learning-based data enhancement method, which extracts interaction features from the real and imaginary components and fuses them with the original real/imaginary streams to generate an enhanced input for better channel inference. Experimental findings in terms of the mean square error (MSE) results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of all state-of-the-art DL-based channel estimators with negligible added complexity. Furthermore, the proposed approach is shown to be robust to channel variations and high user mobility.</description>

      <title>A Practical Validation of RIS Detection and Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication is a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless communication networks, allowing for the reshaping of wireless channels without requiring traditional radio frequency (RF) active components. While their passive nature makes RISs highly attractive, it also presents a challenge: RISs cannot actively identify themselves to user equipments (UEs). Recently, a new method has been proposed to detect and identify RISs by letting them modulate their identities in the signals reflected from their surfaces. In this letter, we first propose a new and simpler modulation method for RISs and then validate the concept of RIS detection and identification (RIS-ID) using a real-world experimental setup. The obtained results validate the RIS-ID concept and show the effectiveness of our proposed modulation method over different operating scenarios and systems settings.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming with Application in High-Resolution Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental technique in array signal processing, beamforming plays a crucial role in amplifying signals of interest while mitigating interference and noise. When uncertainties exist in the signal model or the data size of snapshots is limited, the performance of beamformers significantly degrades. In this article, we comprehensively study the conceptual system, theoretical analysis, and algorithmic design for robust beamforming. Particularly, four technical approaches for robust beamforming are discussed, including locally robust beamforming, globally robust beamforming, regularized beamforming, and Bayesian-nonparametric beamforming. In addition, we investigate the equivalence among the methods and suggest a unified robust beamforming framework. As an application example, we show that the resolution of robust beamformers for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation can be greatly refined by incorporating the characteristics of subspace methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging perception from radar data can assist multiple communication tasks, especially in highly-mobile and large-scale MIMO systems. One particular challenge, however, is how to distinguish the communication user (object) from the other mobile objects in the sensing scene. This paper formulates this \textit{user identification} problem and develops two solutions, a baseline model-based solution that maps the objects angles from the radar scene to communication beams and a scalable deep learning solution that is agnostic to the number of candidate objects. Using the DeepSense 6G dataset, which have real-world measurements, the developed deep learning approach achieves more than $93.4\%$ communication user identification accuracy, highlighting a promising path for enabling integrated radar-communication applications in the real world.</description>

      <title>Performance of Linear Receive Beamforming for Continuous Aperture Arrays (CAPAs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of linear receive beamforming in continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based uplink multiuser communications is analyzed. Continuous linear beamforming techniques are proposed for CAPA receivers under the criteria of maximum-ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean-square error (MMSE). i) For MRC beamforming, a closed-form expression is derived to maximize per-user signal power, and the achieved uplink rate and mean-square error (MSE) in detecting received data symbols are analyzed. ii) For ZF beamforming, a closed-form expression for the beamformer is derived based on channel correlation to eliminate interference, with a function space interpretation provided to demonstrate its optimality in simultaneously nullifying user interference and maximizing signal power. iii) For MMSE beamforming, it is proven that MMSE beamforming is the optimal linear receive approach for CAPAs in maximizing per-user rate and minimizing MSE. A closed-form expression for the MMSE beamformer is then derived, along with the achievable sum-rate and sum-MSE. The proposed linear beamforming techniques are further compared with those for conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs) to highlight the advantages of CAPAs. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that: i) for both CAPAs and SPDAs, the considered linear beamformers can be expressed as weighted sums of each user's spatial response, with weights determined by channel correlation; ii) CAPAs achieve higher sum-rates and lower sum-MSEs than SPDAs under ZF and MMSE beamforming; and iii) SPDAs may outperform CAPAs with MRC beamforming in interference-dominated scenarios, such as high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, highlighting the importance of effective interference management design for CAPAs.</description>

      <title>Antenna Coding Empowered by Pixel Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel antennas, based on discretizing a continuous radiation surface into small elements called pixels, are a flexible reconfigurable antenna technology. By controlling the connections between pixels via switches, the characteristics of pixel antennas can be adjusted to enhance the wireless channel. Inspired by this, we propose a novel technique denoted antenna coding empowered by pixel antennas. We first derive a physical and electromagnetic based communication model for pixel antennas using microwave multiport network theory and beamspace channel representation. With the model, we optimize the antenna coding to maximize the channel gain in a single-input single-output (SISO) pixel antenna system and develop a codebook design for antenna coding to reduce the computational complexity. We analyze the average channel gain of SISO pixel antenna system and derive the corresponding upper bound. In addition, we jointly optimize the antenna coding and transmit signal covariance matrix to maximize the channel capacity in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) pixel antenna system. Simulation results show that using pixel antennas can enhance the average channel gain by up to 5.4 times and channel capacity by up to 3.1 times, demonstrating the significant potential of pixel antennas as a new dimension to design and optimize wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>An Overview on IRS-Enabled Sensing and Communications for 6G: Architectures, Fundamental Limits, and Joint Beamforming Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview on intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled sensing and communication for the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, in which IRSs are strategically deployed to proactively reconfigure wireless environments to improve both sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance. First, we exploit a single IRS to enable wireless sensing in the base station's (BS's) non-line-of-sight (NLoS) area. In particular, we present three IRS-enabled NLoS target sensing architectures with fully-passive, semi-passive, and active IRSs, respectively. We compare their pros and cons by analyzing the fundamental sensing performance limits for target detection and parameter estimation. Next, we consider a single IRS to facilitate integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), in which the transmit signals at the BS are used for achieving both S&amp;C functionalities, aided by the IRS through reflective beamforming. We present joint transmit signal and receiver processing designs for realizing efficient ISAC, and jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and reflective beamforming at the IRS to balance the fundamental performance tradeoff between S&amp;C. Furthermore, we discuss multi-IRS networked ISAC, by particularly focusing on multi-IRS-enabled multi-link ISAC, multi-region ISAC, and ISAC signal routing, respectively. Finally, we highlight various promising research topics in this area to motivate future work.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Aided Federated Learning with Over-the-Air Aggregation: Joint Optimization of Positioning, Beamforming, and User Selection</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in wireless computing effectively utilizes communication bandwidth, yet it is vulnerable to errors during the analog aggregation process. While removing users with unfavorable channel conditions can mitigate these errors, it also reduces the available local training data for FL, which in turn hinders the convergence rate of the training process. To tackle this issue, we propose the use of movable antenna (MA) techniques to enhance the degrees of freedom within the channel space, ultimately boosting the convergence speed of FL training. Moreover, we develop a coordinated approach for uplink receiver beamforming, user selection, and MA positioning to optimize the convergence rate of wireless FL training in dynamic wireless environments. This stochastic optimization challenge is reformulated into a mixed-integer programming problem by utilizing the training loss upper bound. We then introduce a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method to solve the mixed-integer mixed programming problem. Experimental results indicate that incorporating MA techniques significantly accelerates the training convergence of FL and greatly surpasses conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Static Cell-Free Massive MIMO ISAC: Performance Analysis and Power Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integarted sensing and communications (ISAC) system with maximum-ratio transmission schemes combined with multistatic radar-type sensing. Our focus lies on deriving closed-form expressions for the achievable communications rate and the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB), which serve as performance metrics for communications and sensing operations, respectively. The expressions enable us to investigate important operational characteristics of multistatic cell-free massive MIMO-ISAC, including the mutual effects of communications and sensing as well as the advantages stemming from using numerous distributed antenna arrays for each functionality. Furthermore, we optimize the power allocation among the access points to maximize the communications rate while guaranteeing the CRLB constraints and total transmit power budget. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed power allocation approach.</description>

      <title>Annotation and synchronization of smartphone inertial measurement unit and motion capture data collected in a laboratory setting to study gait and balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Validating smartphone sensor-based tests to study gait and balance against reference measurement systems in a laboratory setting poses several technical challenges related to data quality and data processing. One challenge is to guarantee the correct annotation of the data, which is required to ensure that only data collected during the same test execution are compared across measurement systems in subsequent analyses. A second challenge is to accurately synchronize the data across the different systems. Here, we propose innovative solutions for both challenges and illustrate their use in the example of comparing smartphone sensor data collected with the Floodlight technology with data collected with a motion capture system. These solutions form important tools for guaranteeing the data quality and data integrity required for the validation of gait and balance characteristics measured by digital health technology tools such as the Floodlight technology.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Polynomial Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An estimation method is presented for polynomial phase signals, i.e., those adopting the form of a complex exponential whose phase is polynomial in its indices. Transcending the scope of existing techniques, the proposed estimator can handle an arbitrary number of dimensions and an arbitrary set of polynomial degrees along each dimension; the only requirement is that the number of observations per dimension exceeds the highest degree thereon. Embodied by a highly compact sequential algorithm, this estimator exhibits a strictly linear computational complexity in the number of observations, and is efficient at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). To reinforce the performance at low and medium SNRs, where any phase estimator is bound to be hampered by the inherent ambiguity caused by phase wrappings, suitable functionalities are incorporated and shown to be highly effective.</description>

      <title>DeepCRF: Deep Learning-Enhanced CSI-Based RF Fingerprinting for Channel-Resilient WiFi Device Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents DeepCRF, a new framework that harnesses deep learning to extract subtle micro-signals from channel state information (CSI) measurements, enabling robust and resilient radio-frequency fingerprinting (RFF) of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices across diverse channel conditions. Building on our previous research, which demonstrated that micro-signals in CSI, termed micro-CSI, most likely originate from RF circuitry imperfections and can serve as unique RF fingerprints, we develop a new approach to overcome the limitations of our prior signal space-based method. While the signal space-based method is effective in strong line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, we show that it struggles with the complexities of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, compromising the robustness of CSI-based RFF. To address this challenge, DeepCRF incorporates a carefully trained convolutional neural network (CNN) with model-inspired data augmentation, supervised contrastive learning, and decision fusion techniques, enhancing its generalization capabilities across unseen channel conditions and resilience against noise. Our evaluations demonstrate that DeepCRF significantly improves device identification accuracy across diverse channels, outperforming both the signal space-based baseline and state-of-the-art neural network-based benchmarks. Notably, it achieves an average identification accuracy of 99.53% among 19 COTS WiFi network interface cards in real-world unseen scenarios using 4 CSI measurements per identification procedure.</description>

      <title>An Electrocardiogram Monitoring Device Based on STM32</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in aging populations, with rising rates of heart-related incidents in middle-aged and even younger individuals. Currently available electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring technologies, such as bedside monitors are bulky and cumbersome, limiting their potential accessibility for continuous, real-time monitoring. Therefore, we propose a portable digital ECG monitoring system that can accurately measure heart rate, analyze the ECG in real-time, and wirelessly send data to the cloud platform. The device comprises a custom-designed circuit to capture ECG signals, with analog-to-digital conversion and heart rate measurement performed by an STM32F429 microcontroller. In addition, real-time monitoring is achieved through the L610-4G module, which transmits data to Tencent Cloud, enabling users to access their ECG data remotely while being notified by instant alerts for abnormal heart rates. Moreover, healthcare professionals can view historic ECG data for further clinical analysis of patient progression and make evidence-based decisions. The proposed system features portability and accuracy, enabling the user to access extended ECG data easily. It provides the ability to minimize redundant clinical assessments, thus offering considerable advantages to patients and healthcare practitioners.</description>

      <title>Multi-Connectivity Solutions for Rural Areas: Integrating Terrestrial 5G and Satellite Networks to Support Innovative IoT Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G cellular networks are now a reality and promise to improve key performance indicators (KPIs), such as Gbps data rates and latencies in the order of milliseconds. While some of these KPIs are achievable in urban scenarios, rural areas often face challenging connectivity conditions due to the lack of terrestrial network (TN) infrastructure. To solve this problem, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) such as satellite-based solutions, have been introduced to provide coverage in remote regions. Therefore, a multi-connectivity approach can be integrated to simultaneously serve an end-user by merging satellite and cellular links in a joint approach. This study explores, using experimental data, the benefits of both TN-TN and TN-NTN multi-connectivity in rural environments. The results obtained demonstrate that a traditional single-connectivity approach may not be sufficient to provide service to rural environments due to the KPIs requirements given several use cases within these rural areas. The multi-connectivity strategy, which jointly integrates 5G and satellite networks, meets the network availability requirements for latency, downlink throughput, and uplink throughput KPIs at least 98%, 99%, and 95% of the time, respectively, for several use cases, such as precision agriculture, livestock monitoring, and forest management. These include applications like microclimate monitoring, remote operational support, early pest detection, and real-time tracking of livestock transport.</description>

      <title>Sensing Capacity for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems in Low-Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning significance of the low-altitude economy (LAE) has garnered considerable interest, largely fuelled by the widespread deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To tackle the challenges associated with the detection of unauthorized UAVs and the efficient scheduling of authorized UAVs, this letter introduces a novel performance metric, termed sensing capacity, for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. This metric, which quantifies the capability of a base station (BS) to detect multiple UAVs simultaneously, leverages signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and probability of detection (PD) as key intermediate variables. Through mathematical derivations, we can derive a closed-form solution for the maximum number of UAVs that can be detected by the BS while adhering to a specific SNR constraint. Furthermore, an approximate solution based on PD constraints is proposed to facilitate the efficient determination of the threshold for the maximum number of detectable UAVs. The accuracy of this analytical approach is verified through extensive simulation results.</description>

      <title>DoF Analysis and Beamforming Design for Active IRS-aided Multi-user MIMO Wireless Communication in Rank-deficient Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its ability of significantly improving data rate, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) will be a potential crucial technique for the future generation wireless networks like 6G. In this paper, we will focus on the analysis of degree of freedom (DoF) in IRS-aided multi-user MIMO network. Firstly, the DoF upper bound of IRS-aided single-user MIMO network, i.e., the achievable maximum DoF of such a system, is derived, and the corresponding results are extended to the case of IRS-aided multiuser MIMO by using the matrix rank inequalities. In particular, in serious rank-deficient, also called low-rank, channels like line-of-sight (LoS), the network DoF may doubles over no-IRS with the help of IRS. To verify the rate performance gain from augmented DoF, three closed-form beamforming methods, null-space projection plus maximize transmit power and maximize receive power (NSP-MTP-MRP), Schmidt orthogonalization plus minimum mean square error (SO-MMSE) and two-layer leakage plus MMSE (TLL-MMSE) are proposed to achieve the maximum DoF. Simulation results shows that IRS does make a dramatic rate enhancement. For example, in a serious deficient channel, the sum-rate of the proposed TLL-MMSE aided by IRS is about twice that of no IRS. This means that IRS may achieve a significant DoF improvement in such a channel.</description>

      <title>FedCVD: The First Real-World Federated Learning Benchmark on Cardiovascular Disease Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are currently the leading cause of death worldwide, highlighting the critical need for early diagnosis and treatment. Machine learning (ML) methods can help diagnose CVDs early, but their performance relies on access to substantial data with high quality. However, the sensitive nature of healthcare data often restricts individual clinical institutions from sharing data to train sufficiently generalized and unbiased ML models. Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging approach, which offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across multiple participants without compromising the privacy of the individual data owners. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been limited prior research applying FL to the cardiovascular disease domain. Moreover, existing FL benchmarks and datasets are typically simulated and may fall short of replicating the complexity of natural heterogeneity found in realistic datasets that challenges current FL algorithms. To address these gaps, this paper presents the first real-world FL benchmark for cardiovascular disease detection, named FedCVD. This benchmark comprises two major tasks: electrocardiogram (ECG) classification and echocardiogram (ECHO) segmentation, based on naturally scattered datasets constructed from the CVD data of seven institutions. Our extensive experiments on these datasets reveal that FL faces new challenges with real-world non-IID and long-tail data. The code and datasets of FedCVD are available https://github.com/SMILELab-FL/FedCVD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of interference caused by incumbent radios to UWB devices is presented. Through an extensive set of measured spectral activities in the low-band IEEE802.15.4 UWB operating channels, we explore the outage probabilities of a UWB system when it is equipped with an intelligent detector for combating interferers and compare them against those of a naive system that has no interference avoidance capability. Our results reveal that a UWB system with an effective interference avoidance capability may lead to a few orders of magnitude improvement in its outage probabilities. The measured outage probabilities are confirmed through measuring the frame error rate of a simulated filter-bank UWB transceiver system when impacted by the interferences obtained through our experiments.</description>

      <title>LOS/NLOS Estimators for mmWave Cellular Systems With Blockages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designers of millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular systems need to evaluate line-of-sight (LOS) maps to provide good service to users in urban scenarios. In this letter, we derive estimators to obtain LOS maps in scenarios with potential blocking elements. Applying previous stochastic geometry results, we formulate the optimal Bayesian estimator of the LOS map using a limited number of actual measurements at different locations. The computational cost of the optimal estimator is derived and is proven to be exponential in the number of available data points. An approximation is discussed, which brings the computational complexity from exponential to quasi-linear and allows the implementation of a practical estimator. Finally, we compare numerically the optimal estimator and the approximation with other estimators from the literature and also with an original heuristic estimator with good performance and low computational cost. For the comparison, both synthetic layouts and a real layout of Chicago have been used.</description>

Abstract: A variational Bayesian inference for measured wave intensity, such as X-ray intensity, is proposed in this paper. The data is popular to obtain information about unobservable features of an object, such as a material sample and the components of it. The proposed method assumes particles represent the wave, and their behaviors are stochastically modeled. The inference is accurate even if the data is noisy because of a smooth prior setting. Moreover, in this paper, two experimental results show feasibility of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank + Sparse Decomposition (LR+SD) for EEG Artifact Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concurrent EEG-fMRI recordings are advantageous over serial recordings, as they offer the ability to explore the relationship between both signals without the compounded effects of nonstationarity in the brain. Nonetheless, analysis of simultaneous recordings is challenging given that a number of noise sources are introduced into the EEG signal even after MR gradient artifact removal with balistocardiogram artifact being highly prominent. Here, we present an algorithm for automatically removing residual noise sources from the EEG signal in a single process using low rank + sparse decomposition (LR+SD). We apply this method to both experimental and simulated EEG data, where in the latter case the true EEG signature is known. The experimental data consisted of EEG data collected concurrently with fMRI (EEG-fMRI) as well as alone outside the scanning environment while subjects viewed Gabor flashes, a perceptual task known to produce event related power diminutions in the alpha spectral band. On the simulated data, the LR+SD method was able to recover the pure EEG signal and separate it from artifact with up to three EEG sources. On the experimental data, LR+SD was able to recover the diminution in alpha spectral power that follows light flashes in concurrent EEG-fMRI data, which was not detectable prior to artifact removal. At the group level, we found that the signal-to-noise ratio was increased ~34\% following LR+SD cleaning, as compared independent component analysis (ICA) in concurrently collected EEG-fMRI data. We anticipate that this method will be highly useful for analyzing simultaneously collected EEG-fMRI data, and downstream for exploring the coupling between these two modalities.</description>

      <title>Prion-ViT: Prions-Inspired Vision Transformers for Temperature prediction with Specklegrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiber Specklegram Sensors (FSS) are widely used in environmental monitoring due to their high sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, yet the complex, nonlinear nature of specklegram data poses significant challenges for conventional predictive models. This study introduces a novel Prion-Vision Transformer (Prion-ViT) model, inspired by biological prion memory mechanisms, to enhance long-term dependency modeling for accurate temperature prediction using FSS data. By leveraging a persistent memory state, the Prion-ViT effectively retains and propagates essential features across multiple layers, thereby improving prediction accuracy and reducing mean absolute error (MAE) to "0.52 Degree Celsius" outperforming traditional models like ResNet, Inception Net V2, and existing transformer-based architectures. The study addresses the specific challenges of applying Vision Transformers (ViTs) to FSS data and demonstrates that the prion-inspired memory mechanism offers a robust solution for capturing complex optical interference patterns in specklegrams. These findings establish Prion-ViT as a promising advancement for real-time industrial temperature monitoring applications, with potential applicability to other optical sensing domains.</description>

Abstract: Early identification of respiratory irregularities is critical for improving lung health and reducing global mortality rates. The analysis of respiratory sounds plays a significant role in characterizing the respiratory system's condition and identifying abnormalities. The main contribution of this study is to investigate the performance when the input data, represented by cochleogram, is used to feed the Vision Transformer architecture, since this input classifier combination is the first time it has been applied to adventitious sound classification to our knowledge. Although ViT has shown promising results in audio classification tasks by applying self attention to spectrogram patches, we extend this approach by applying the cochleogram, which captures specific spectro-temporal features of adventitious sounds. The proposed methodology is evaluated on the ICBHI dataset. We compare the classification performance of ViT with other state of the art CNN approaches using spectrogram, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, constant Q transform, and cochleogram as input data. Our results confirm the superior classification performance combining cochleogram and ViT, highlighting the potential of ViT for reliable respiratory sound classification. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts in developing automatic intelligent techniques with the aim to significantly augment the speed and effectiveness of respiratory disease detection, thereby addressing a critical need in the medical field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for high-speed, reliable wireless connectivity in 6G networks necessitates innovative approaches to overcome the limitations of traditional Radio Access Network (RAN). Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) and Network-Controlled Repeater (NCR) have emerged as promising technologies to address coverage challenges in high-frequency millimeter wave (mmW) bands by enhancing signal reach in environments susceptible to blockage and severe propagation losses. In this paper, we propose an optimized deployment framework aimed at minimizing infrastructure costs while ensuring full area coverage using only RIS and NCR. We formulate a cost-minimization optimization problem that integrates the deployment and configuration of these devices to achieve seamless coverage, particularly in dense urban scenarios. Simulation results confirm that this framework significantly reduces the network planning costs while guaranteeing full coverage, demonstrating RIS and NCR's viability as cost-effective solutions for next-generation network infrastructure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06193v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) technologies, with a predominance of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements in various applications, which have attracted great interests from both academia and industry. Although some noteworthy advancements have been made in this area, a comprehensive exploration of the intricate relationship between AIGC and communication networks remains relatively limited. To address this issue, this paper conducts an exhaustive survey from dual standpoints: firstly, it scrutinizes the integration of LLMs and AIGC technologies within the domain of communication networks; secondly, it investigates how the communication networks can further bolster the capabilities of LLMs and AIGC. Additionally, this research explores the promising applications along with the challenges encountered during the incorporation of these AI technologies into communication networks. Through these detailed analyses, our work aims to deepen the understanding of how LLMs and AIGC can synergize with and enhance the development of advanced intelligent communication networks, contributing to a more profound comprehension of next-generation intelligent communication networks.</description>

      <title>Early Prediction of Natural Gas Pipeline Leaks Using the MKTCN Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural gas pipeline leaks pose severe risks, leading to substantial economic losses and potential hazards to human safety. In this study, we develop an accurate model for the early prediction of pipeline leaks. To the best of our knowledge, unlike previous anomaly detection, this is the first application to use internal pipeline data for early prediction of leaks. The modeling process addresses two main challenges: long-term dependencies and sample imbalance. First, we introduce a dilated convolution-based prediction model to capture long-term dependencies, as dilated convolution expands the model's receptive field without added computational cost. Second, to mitigate sample imbalance, we propose the MKTCN model, which incorporates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network as the fully connected layer in a dilated convolution model, enhancing network generalization. Finally, we validate the MKTCN model through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that MKTCN outperforms in generalization and classification, particularly under severe data imbalance, and effectively predicts leaks up to 5000 seconds in advance. Overall, the MKTCN model represents a significant advancement in early pipeline leak prediction, providing robust generalization and improved modeling of the long-term dependencies inherent in multi-dimensional time-series data.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Type and Severity in Low-Frequency, Low Bit-Depth Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) in rotating machinery utilizing a single microphone and a data-driven methodology, effectively diagnosing 42 classes of fault types and severities. The research leverages sound data from the imbalanced MaFaulDa dataset, aiming to strike a balance between high performance and low resource consumption. The testing phase encompassed a variety of configurations, including sampling, quantization, signal normalization, silence removal, Wiener filtering, data scaling, windowing, augmentation, and classifier tuning using XGBoost. Through the analysis of time, frequency, mel-frequency, and statistical features, we achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.54% and an F-Beta score of 99.52% with just 6 boosting trees at an 8 kHz, 8-bit configuration. Moreover, when utilizing only MFCCs along with their first- and second-order deltas, we recorded an accuracy of 97.83% and an F-Beta score of 97.67%. Lastly, by implementing a greedy wrapper approach, we obtained a remarkable accuracy of 96.82% and an F-Beta score of 98.86% using 50 selected features, nearly all of which were first- and second-order deltas of the MFCCs.</description>

      <title>Physics-Compliant Modeling and Scaling Laws of Multi-RIS Aided MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) enables the control of wireless channels to improve coverage. To further extend coverage, multi-RIS aided systems have been explored, where multiple RISs steer the signal via a multi-hop path. However, deriving a physics-compliant channel model for multi-RIS aided systems is still an open problem. In this study, we fill this gap by modeling multi-RIS aided systems through multiport network theory, and deriving a channel model accounting for impedance mismatch, mutual coupling, and structural scattering. The derived physics-compliant model differs from the model widely used in literature, which omits the RIS structural scattering. To quantify this difference, we derive the channel gain scaling laws of the two models under line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath channels. Theoretical insights, validated by numerical results, show an important discrepancy between the physics-compliant and the widely used models, increasing with the number of RISs and multipath richness. In a multi-hop system aided by four 128-element RISs with multipath channels, optimizing the RISs using the widely used model and applying their solutions to the physics-compliant model achieves only 7% of the maximum channel gain. This highlights how severely mismatched channel models can be, calling for more accurate models in communication theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional machine learning approaches assume that data comes from a single generating mechanism, which may not hold for most real life data. In these cases, the single mechanism assumption can result in suboptimal performance. We introduce a clustering framework that eliminates this assumption by grouping the data according to the relations between the features and the target values and we obtain multiple separate models to learn different parts of the data. We further extend our framework to applications having streaming data where we produce outcomes using an ensemble of models. For this, the ensemble weights are updated based on the incoming data batches. We demonstrate the performance of our approach over the widely-studied real life datasets, showing significant improvements over the traditional single-model approaches.</description>

      <title>Brillouin photonics engine in the thin-film lithium niobate platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is revolutionizing low-noise lasers and microwave photonic systems. However, despite extensive explorations of a low-loss and versatile integrated platform for Brillouin photonic circuits, current options fall short due to limited technological scalability or inadequate SBS gain. Here we introduce the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform as the go-to choice for integrated Brillouin photonics applications. We report the angle-dependent strong SBS gain in this platform, which can overcome the intrinsic propagation loss. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first stimulated Brillouin laser in TFLN with a tuning range &gt; 20 nm and utilize it to achieve high-purity RF signal generation with an intrinsic linewidth of 9 Hz. Finally, we devise a high-rejection Brillouin-based microwave photonic notch filter, for the first time, integrating an SBS spiral, an on-chip modulator, and a tunable ring all within the same platform. This TFLN-based Brillouin photonics engine uniquely combines the scalability of this platform and the versatility of SBS. Moreover, it bridges SBS with other functionalities in the TFLN platform, unlocking new possibilities for Brillouin-based applications with unparalleled performances.</description>

      <title>A Novel Combined Data-Driven Approach for Electricity Theft Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-way flow of information and energy is an important feature of the Energy Internet. Data analytics is a powerful tool in the information flow that aims to solve practical problems using data mining techniques. As the problem of electricity thefts via tampering with smart meters continues to increase, the abnormal behaviors of thefts become more diversified and more difficult to detect. Thus, a data analytics method for detecting various types of electricity thefts is required. However, the existing methods either require a labeled dataset or additional system information which is difficult to obtain in reality or have poor detection accuracy. In this paper, we combine two novel data mining techniques to solve the problem. One technique is the Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC), which can find the correlations between the non-technical loss (NTL) and a certain electricity behavior of the consumer. MIC can be used to precisely detect thefts that appear normal in shapes. The other technique is the clustering technique by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP). CFSFDP finds the abnormal users among thousands of load profiles, making it quite suitable for detecting electricity thefts with arbitrary shapes. Next, a framework for combining the advantages of the two techniques is proposed. Numerical experiments on the Irish smart meter dataset are conducted to show the good performance of the combined method.</description>

      <title>Polarization Aware Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a polarization-aware movable antenna (PAMA) framework that integrates polarization effects into the design and optimization of movable antennas (MAs). While MAs have proven effective at boosting wireless communication performance, existing studies primarily focus on phase variations caused by different propagation paths and leverage antenna movements to maximize channel gains. This narrow focus limits the full potential of MAs. In this work, we introduce a polarization-aware channel model rooted in electromagnetic theory, unveiling a defining advantage of MAs over other wireless technologies such as precoding: the ability to optimize polarization matching. This new understanding enables PAMA to extend the applicability of MAs beyond radio-frequency, multipath-rich scenarios to higher-frequency bands, such as mmWave, even with a single line-of-sight (LOS) path. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating polarization considerations into MAs significantly enhances efficiency, link reliability, and data throughput, paving the way for more robust and efficient future wireless networks.</description>

Abstract: This research focuses on real-time monitoring and analysis of track and field athletes, addressing the limitations of traditional monitoring systems in terms of real-time performance and accuracy. We propose an IoT-optimized system that integrates edge computing and deep learning algorithms.

Experimental results show that this system significantly outperforms traditional methods in response time, data processing accuracy, and energy efficiency, particularly excelling in complex track and field events. This research not only enhances the precision and efficiency of athlete monitoring but also provides new technical support and application prospects for sports science research.</description>

      <title>Research on an intelligent fault diagnosis method for nuclear power plants based on ETCN-SSA combined algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing fault diagnosis methods is crucial for nuclear power professionals to achieve efficient and accurate fault diagnosis for nuclear power plants (NPPs). The performance of traditional methods is limited by their dependence on complex feature extraction and skilled expert knowledge, which can be time-consuming and subjective. This paper proposes a novel intelligent fault diagnosis method for NPPs that combines enhanced temporal convolutional network (ETCN) with sparrow search algorithm (SSA). ETCN utilizes temporal convolutional network (TCN), self-attention (SA) mechanism and residual block for enhancing performance. ETCN excels at extracting local features and capturing time series information, while SSA adaptively optimizes its hyperparameters for superior performance. The proposed method's performance is experimentally verified on a CPR1000 simulation dataset. Compared to other advanced intelligent fault diagnosis methods, the proposed one demonstrates superior performance across all evaluation metrics. This makes it a promising tool for NPP intelligent fault diagnosis, ultimately enhancing operational reliability.</description>

      <title>Optimized Quality of Service prediction in FSO Links over South Africa using Ensemble Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibre optic communication system is expected to increase exponentially in terms of application due to the numerous advantages over copper wires. The optical network evolution presents several advantages such as over long-distance, low-power requirement, higher carrying capacity and high bandwidth among others Such network bandwidth surpasses methods of transmission that include copper cables and microwaves. Despite these benefits, free-space optical communications are severely impacted by harsh weather situations like mist, precipitation, blizzard, fume, soil, and drizzle debris in the atmosphere, all of which have an impact on the Quality of Service (QoS) rendered by the systems. The primary goal of this article is to optimize the QoS using the ensemble learning models Random Forest, ADaBoost Regression, Stacking Regression, Gradient Boost Regression, and Multilayer Neural Network. To accomplish the stated goal, meteorological data, visibility, wind speed, and altitude were obtained from the South Africa Weather Services archive during a ten-year period (2010 to 2019) at four different locations: Polokwane, Kimberley, Bloemfontein, and George. We estimated the data rate, power received, fog-induced attenuation, bit error rate and power penalty using the collected and processed data. The RMSE and R-squared values of the model across all the study locations, Polokwane, Kimberley, Bloemfontein, and George, are 0.0073 and 0.9951, 0.0065 and 0.9998, 0.0060 and 0.9941, and 0.0032 and 0.9906, respectively. The result showed that using ensemble learning techniques in transmission modeling can significantly enhance service quality and meet customer service level agreements and ensemble method was successful in efficiently optimizing the signal to noise ratio, which in turn enhanced the QoS at the point of reception.</description>

      <title>Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal Air Quality Sensor Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of affordable Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for air pollution monitoring has increased in recent years due to their scalability and cost-effectiveness. However, accurately calibrating these sensors in uncontrolled environments remains a significant challenge. While expensive reference sensors can provide accurate ground truth data, they are often deployed on a limited scale due to high costs, leading to a scarcity of labeled data. In diverse urban environments, data distributions constantly shift due to varying factors such as traffic patterns, industrial activities, and weather conditions, which impact sensor readings. Consequently, traditional machine learning models -- despite their increasing deployment for environmental sensor calibration -- often struggle to provide reliable pollutant measurements across different locations due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method specifically tailored for regression tasks on graph-structured data. Our approach leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the relationships between sensors. To effectively capture critical spatial-temporal interactions, we incorporate spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), which extend GNNs by incorporating temporal dynamics. To handle the resulting larger embeddings, we propose a domain adaptation method using a closed-form solution inspired by the Tikhonov-regularized least-squares problem. This method leverages Cholesky decomposition and power iteration to align the subspaces between source and target domains. By aligning these subspaces, our approach allows low-cost IoT sensors to learn calibration parameters from expensive reference sensors. This facilitates reliable pollutant measurements in new locations without the need for additional costly equipment.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LSTM for Predictive Modeling of Satellite Clock Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite clock bias prediction plays a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of satellite navigation systems. In this paper, we propose an approach utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict satellite clock bias. We gather data from the PRN 8 satellite of the Galileo and preprocess it to obtain a single difference sequence, crucial for normalizing the data. Normalization allows resampling of the data, ensuring that the predictions are equidistant and complete. Our methodology involves training the LSTM model on varying lengths of datasets, ranging from 7 days to 31 days. We employ a training set consisting of two days' worth of data in each case. Our LSTM model exhibits exceptional accuracy, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.11 $\times$ 10$^{-11}$. Notably, our approach outperforms traditional methods used for similar time-series forecasting projects, being 170 times more accurate than RNN, 2.3 $\times$ 10$^7$ times more accurate than MLP, and 1.9 $\times$ 10$^4$ times more accurate than ARIMA. This study holds significant potential in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of low-power receivers used in various devices, particularly those requiring power conservation. By providing more accurate predictions of satellite clock bias, the findings of this research can be integrated into the algorithms of such devices, enabling them to function with heightened precision while conserving power. Improved accuracy in clock bias predictions ensures that low-power receivers can maintain optimal performance levels, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and effectiveness of satellite navigation systems. Consequently, this advancement holds promise for a wide range of applications, including remote areas, IoT devices, wearable technology, and other devices where power efficiency and navigation accuracy are paramount.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Predictive Maintenance in Mining Mobile Machinery through a TinyML-enabled Hierarchical Inference Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mining machinery operating in variable environments faces high wear and unpredictable stress, challenging Predictive Maintenance (PdM). This paper introduces the Edge Sensor Network for Predictive Maintenance (ESN-PdM), a hierarchical inference framework across edge devices, gateways, and cloud services for real-time condition monitoring. The system dynamically adjusts inference locations--on-device, on-gateway, or on-cloud--based on trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and battery life, leveraging Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) techniques for model optimization on resource-constrained devices. Performance evaluations showed that on-sensor and on-gateway inference modes achieved over 90\% classification accuracy, while cloud-based inference reached 99\%. On-sensor inference reduced power consumption by approximately 44\%, enabling up to 104 hours of operation. Latency was lowest for on-device inference (3.33 ms), increasing when offloading to the gateway (146.67 ms) or cloud (641.71 ms). The ESN-PdM framework provides a scalable, adaptive solution for reliable anomaly detection and PdM, crucial for maintaining machinery uptime in remote environments. By balancing accuracy, latency, and energy consumption, this approach advances PdM frameworks for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Joint Age-State Belief is All You Need: Minimizing AoII via Pull-Based Remote Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Age of incorrect information (AoII) is a recently proposed freshness and mismatch metric that penalizes an incorrect estimation along with its duration. Therefore, keeping track of AoII requires the knowledge of both the source and estimation processes. In this paper, we consider a time-slotted pull-based remote estimation system under a sampling rate constraint where the information source is a general discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) process. Moreover, packet transmission times from the source to the monitor are non-zero which disallows the monitor to have perfect information on the actual AoII process at any time. Hence, for this pull-based system, we propose the monitor to maintain a sufficient statistic called {\em belief} which stands for the joint distribution of the age and source processes to be obtained from the history of all observations. Using belief, we first propose a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to be used at the monitor as opposed to existing martingale estimators in the literature. Second, we obtain the optimality equations from the belief-MDP (Markov decision process) formulation. Finally, we propose two belief-dependent policies one of which is based on deep reinforcement learning, and the other one is a threshold-based policy based on the instantaneous expected AoII.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Oversampling in Uplink Massive MIMO-OFDM with Low-Resolution ADCs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have emerged as an efficient solution for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to reap high data rates with reasonable power consumption and hardware complexity. In this paper, we analyze the performance of oversampling in uplink massive MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems with low-resolution ADCs. Considering both the temporal and spatial correlation of the quantization distortion, we derive an approximate closed-form expression of an achievable sum rate, which reveals how the oversampling ratio (OSR), the ADC resolution, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) jointly affect the system performance. In particular, we demonstrate that oversampling can effectively improve the sum rate by mitigating the impact of the quantization distortion, especially at high SNR and with very low ADC resolution. Furthermore, we show that the considered low-resolution massive MIMO-OFDM system can achieve the same performance as the unquantized one when both the SNR and the OSR are sufficiently high. Numerical simulations confirm our analysis.</description>

      <title>Stein Variational Gradient Descent-based Detection For Random Access With Preambles In MTC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional preamble detection algorithms have low accuracy in the grant-based random access scheme in massive machine-type communication (mMTC). We present a novel preamble detection algorithm based on Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) at the second step of the random access procedure. It efficiently leverages deterministic updates of particles for continuous inference. To further enhance the performance of the SVGD detector, especially in a dense user scenario, we propose a normalized SVGD detector with momentum. It utilizes the momentum and a bias correction term to reduce the preamble estimation errors during the gradient descent process. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based approaches in terms of detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>Extreme Point Pursuit -- Part I: A Framework for Constant Modulus Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study develops a framework for a class of constant modulus (CM) optimization problems, which covers binary constraints, discrete phase constraints, semi-orthogonal matrix constraints, non-negative semi-orthogonal matrix constraints, and several types of binary assignment constraints. Capitalizing on the basic principles of concave minimization and error bounds, we study a convex-constrained penalized formulation for general CM problems. The advantage of such formulation is that it allows us to leverage non-convex optimization techniques, such as the simple projected gradient method, to build algorithms. As the first part of this study, we explore the theory of this framework. We study conditions under which the formulation provides exact penalization results. We also examine computational aspects relating to the use of the projected gradient method for each type of CM constraint. Our study suggests that the proposed framework has a broad scope of applicability.</description>

Abstract: In the first part of this study, a convex-constrained penalized formulation was studied for a class of constant modulus (CM) problems. In particular, the error bound techniques were shown to play a vital role in providing exact penalization results. In this second part of the study, we continue our error bound analysis for the cases of partial permutation matrices, size-constrained assignment matrices and non-negative semi-orthogonal matrices. We develop new error bounds and penalized formulations for these three cases, and the new formulations possess good structures for building computationally efficient algorithms. Moreover, we provide numerical results to demonstrate our framework in a variety of applications such as the densest k-subgraph problem, graph matching, size-constrained clustering, non-negative orthogonal matrix factorization and sparse fair principal component analysis.</description>

      <title>Channel Deduction: A New Learning Framework to Acquire Channel from Outdated Samples and Coarse Estimate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How to reduce the pilot overhead required for channel estimation? How to deal with the channel dynamic changes and error propagation in channel prediction? To jointly address these two critical issues in next-generation transceiver design, in this paper, we propose a novel framework named channel deduction for high-dimensional channel acquisition in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, it makes use of the outdated channel information of past time slots, performs coarse estimation for the current channel with a relatively small number of pilots, and then fuses these two information to obtain a complete representation of the present channel. The rationale is to align the current channel representation to both the latent channel features within the past samples and the coarse estimate of current channel at the pilots, which, in a sense, behaves as a complementary combination of estimation and prediction and thus reduces the overall overhead. To fully exploit the highly nonlinear correlations in time, space, and frequency domains, we resort to learning-based implementation approaches. By using the highly efficient complex-domain multilayer perceptron (MLP)-mixer for crossing space-frequency domain representation and the recurrence-based or attention-based mechanisms for the past-present interaction, we respectively design two different channel deduction neural networks (CDNets). We provide a general procedure of data collection, training, and deployment to standardize the application of CDNets. Comprehensive experimental evaluations in accuracy, robustness, and efficiency demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, which reduces the pilot overhead by up to 88.9% compared to state-of-the-art estimation approaches and enables continuous operating even under unknown user movement and error propagation.</description>

      <title>HiSAC: High-Resolution Sensing with Multiband Communication Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC ) systems are expected to perform accurate radar sensing while having minimal impact on communication. Ideally, sensing should only reuse communication resources, especially for spectrum which is contended by many applications. However, this poses a great challenge in that communication systems often operate on narrow subbands with low sensing resolution. Combining contiguous subbands has shown significant resolution gain in active localization. However, multiband ISAC remains unexplored due to communication subbands being highly sparse (non-contiguous) and affected by phase offsets that prevent their aggregation (incoherent). To tackle these problems, we design HiSAC, the first multiband ISAC system that combines diverse subbands across a wide frequency range to achieve super-resolved passive ranging. To solve the non-contiguity and incoherence of subbands, HiSAC combines them progressively, exploiting an anchor propagation path between transmitter and receiver in an optimization problem to achieve phase coherence. HiSAC fully reuses pilot signals in communication systems, it applies to different frequencies and can combine diverse technologies, e.g., 5G-NR and WiGig. We implement HiSAC on an experimental platform in the millimeter-wave unlicensed band and test it on objects and humans. Our results show it enhances the sensing resolution by up to 20 times compared to single-band processing while occupying the same spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early prediction of seizures and timely interventions are vital for improving patients' quality of life. While seizure prediction has been shown in software-based implementations, to enable timely warnings of upcoming seizures, prediction must be done on an edge device to reduce latency. Ideally, such devices must also be low-power and track long-term drifts to minimize maintenance from the user. This work presents SPIRIT: Stochastic-gradient-descent-based Predictor with Integrated Retraining and In situ accuracy Tuning. SPIRIT is a complete system-on-a-chip (SoC) integrating an unsupervised online-learning seizure prediction classifier with eight 14.4 uW, 0.057 mm2, 90.5 dB dynamic range, Zoom Analog Frontends. SPIRIT achieves, on average, 97.5%/96.2% sensitivity/specificity respectively, predicting seizures an average of 8.4 minutes before they occur. Through its online learning algorithm, prediction accuracy improves by up to 15%, and prediction times extend by up to 7x, without any external intervention. Its classifier consumes 17.2 uW and occupies 0.14 mm2, the lowest reported for a prediction classifier by &gt;134x in power and &gt;5x in area. SPIRIT is also at least 5.6x more energy efficient than the state-of-the-art.</description>

Abstract: Civilian communication during disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and military conflicts is crucial for saving lives. Nevertheless, several challenges exist during these circumstances such as the destruction of cellular communication and electricity infrastructure, lack of line of sight (LoS), and difficulty of localization under the rubble. In this article, we discuss key enablers that can boost communication during disasters, namely, satellite and aerial platforms, redundancy, silencing, and sustainable networks aided with wireless energy transfer (WET). The article also highlights how these solutions can be implemented in order to solve the failure of communication during disasters. Finally, it sheds light on unresolved challenges, as well as future research directions.</description>

      <title>From Theory to Reality: A Design Framework for Integrated Communication and Computing Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel flexible and scalable framework to design integrated communication and computing (ICC) -- a.k.a. over-the-air computing (AirComp)-- receivers. To elaborate, while related literature so far has generally focused either on theoretical aspects of ICC or on the design of beamforming (BF) algorithms for AirComp, we propose a framework to design receivers capable of simultaneously detecting communication symbols and extracting the output of the AirComp operation, in a manner that can: a) be systematically generalized to any nomographic function, b) scaled to a massive number of user equipments (UEs) and edge devices (EDs), and c) support the multiple computation streams. For the sake of illustration, we demonstrate the proposed method under a setting consisting of the uplink from multiple single-antenna UEs/EDs simultaneously transmitting communication and computing signals to a single multiple-antenna base station (BS)/access point (AP). The receiver, which seeks to detect all communication symbols and minimize the distortion over the computing signals, requires that only a fraction of the transmit power be allocated to the latter, therefore coming close to the ideal (but unattainable) condition that computing is achieved "for free", without taking resources from the communication system. The design leverages the Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework relying only on element-wise scalar operations, which allows for its use in massive settings, as demonstrated by simulation results incorporating up to 200 antennas and 200 UEs/EDs. They also demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method under all various loading conditions, with the performance of the scheme approaching fundamental limiting bounds in the under/fully loaded cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we statistically analyze the radar cross section (RCS) of different test targets present in an indoor factory (InF) scenario specified by 3rd Generation Partnership Project considering bistatic configuration. The test targets that we consider are drones, humans, quadruped robot and a robotic arm. We consider two drones of different sizes and five human subjects for RCS characterization. For the drones, we measure the RCS when they are are flying over a given point and while they are rotating over the same point. For human subjects, we measure the RCS while standing still, sitting still and walking. For quadruped robot and robotic arm, we consider a continuous random motion emulating different tasks which they are supposed to perfom in typical InF scenario. We employ different distributions, such as Normal, Lognormal, Gamma, Rician, Weibull, Rayleigh and Exponential to fit the measurement data. From the statistical analysis, we gather that Lognormal distribution can fit all the considered targets in the InF scenario.</description>

      <title>Efficient Position Determination of Highly Directional RF Emitters via Iterated Beampattern Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The localization of RF emitters has attracted significant attention particularly within the domain of electronic warfare. Most localization methods found in open literature are based on omnidirectional emitters. Directional emitters significantly modulate received signal strength (RSS) resulting in degraded performance for localization techniques not modeling this behavior. This paper introduces a direct position determination (DPD) approach utilizing RSS information and adaptive beamforming to localize emitters at very low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The technique is then applied to directional emitters taking the imposed RSS modulation into account using a beampattern library. This results in significantly improved localization region confidence as compared to omnidirectional assumption approaches.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) offers the potential to simplify deployment by reducing the need for real-time remote control between a base station (BS) and an RIS. However, we highlight two major challenges posed by autonomy. The first is implementation complexity, as autonomy requires hybrid RISs (HRISs) equipped with additional on-board hardware to monitor the propagation environment and conduct local channel estimation (CHEST), a process known as probing. The second challenge, termed probe distortion, reflects a form of the observer effect: during probing, an HRIS can inadvertently alter the propagation environment, potentially disrupting the operations of other communicating devices. While implementation complexity has been extensively studied, probe distortion remains largely unexplored. To further assess the potential of autonomous RISs, this paper comprehensively and pragmatically studies fundamental trade-offs posed by these challenges. We examine the robustness of an HRIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system under minimal design choices that reflect the essential elements and stringent conditions, including (a) two extremes of implementation complexity realized through minimalist operational designs of two HRIS hardware architectures, and (b) an oblivious BS that fully embraces probe distortion. To make our analysis possible, we propose a physical-layer orchestration framework that aligns HRIS and mMIMO operations. We provide empirical evidence showing that autonomous RIS holds promise even under these strict conditions and propose new research directions, particularly for advancing the understanding of probe distortion.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Estimation via $f$-Divergence and Data Derangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20025</link>

Abstract: Estimating mutual information accurately is pivotal across diverse applications, from machine learning to communications and biology, enabling us to gain insights into the inner mechanisms of complex systems. Yet, dealing with high-dimensional data presents a formidable challenge, due to its size and the presence of intricate relationships. Recently proposed neural methods employing variational lower bounds on the mutual information have gained prominence. However, these approaches suffer from either high bias or high variance, as the sample size and the structure of the loss function directly influence the training process. In this paper, we propose a novel class of discriminative mutual information estimators based on the variational representation of the $f$-divergence. We investigate the impact of the permutation function used to obtain the marginal training samples and present a novel architectural solution based on derangements. The proposed estimator is flexible since it exhibits an excellent bias/variance trade-off. The comparison with state-of-the-art neural estimators, through extensive experimentation within established reference scenarios, shows that our approach offers higher accuracy and lower complexity.</description>

      <title>Delayed Memory Unit: Modelling Temporal Dependency Through Delay Gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely recognized for their proficiency in modeling temporal dependencies, making them highly prevalent in sequential data processing applications. Nevertheless, vanilla RNNs are confronted with the well-known issue of gradient vanishing and exploding, posing a significant challenge for learning and establishing long-range dependencies. Additionally, gated RNNs tend to be over-parameterized, resulting in poor computational efficiency and network generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Delayed Memory Unit (DMU). The DMU incorporates a delay line structure along with delay gates into vanilla RNN, thereby enhancing temporal interaction and facilitating temporal credit assignment. Specifically, the DMU is designed to directly distribute the input information to the optimal time instant in the future, rather than aggregating and redistributing it over time through intricate network dynamics. Our proposed DMU demonstrates superior temporal modeling capabilities across a broad range of sequential modeling tasks, utilizing considerably fewer parameters than other state-of-the-art gated RNN models in applications such as speech recognition, radar gesture recognition, ECG waveform segmentation, and permuted sequential image classification.</description>

      <title>A Novel RFID Authentication Protocol Based on A Block-Order-Modulus Variable Matrix Encryption Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10593v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, authentication for mobile radio frequency identification (RFID) systems with low-cost RFID sensor tags is studied. Firstly, an adaptive modulus (AM) encryption algorithm is proposed. Subsequently, in order to enhance the security without additional storage of new key matrices, a self-updating encryption order (SUEO) algorithm is designed. Furthermore, a diagonal block local transpose key matrix (DBLTKM) encryption algorithm is presented, which effectively expands the feasible domain of the key space. Based on the above three algorithms, a novel joint AM-SUEO-DBLTKM encryption algorithm is constructed. Making full use of the advantages of the proposed joint algorithm, a two-way RFID authentication protocol, named AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID, is proposed for mobile RFID systems. In addition, the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and security analysis indicate that the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID protocol can effectively combat various typical attacks. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM algorithm can save 99.59% of tag storage over traditional algorithms. Finally, the low computational complexity as well as the low storage cost of the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID protocol facilitates deployment within low-cost RFID sensor tags.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Quantization Noise Suppression Gains in Digital Phased Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital phased arrays have often been disregarded for millimeter-wave communications since the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are power-hungry. In this paper, we provide a different perspective on this matter by demonstrating analytically and numerically how the ADC resolution can be reduced when using digital phased arrays. We perform a theoretical analysis of the quantization noise characteristics for an OFDM signal received and processed by a digital phased array, using Gaussian approximation of the OFDM signal. In particular, we quantify the quantization noise suppression factor analytically and numerically. This factor describes how much the coherent combining reduces the quantization noise as a function of the number of antennas, which allows for reducing the ADC bit resolution. For instance in a 8-16 antenna digital phased array the ADC resolution can be reduced with 1-2 bits compared to the ADC required for an analog phased array.</description>

      <title>Dark-Field X-Ray Microscopy with Structured Illumination for Three-Dimensional Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a structured illumination technique for dark-field x-ray microscopy optimized for three-dimensional imaging of ordered materials at sub-micrometer length scales. Our method utilizes a coded aperture to spatially modulate the incident x-ray beam on the sample, enabling the reconstruction of the sample's 3D structure from images captured at various aperture positions. Unlike common volumetric imaging techniques such as tomography, our approach casts a scanning x-ray silhouette of a coded aperture for depth resolution along the axis of diffraction, eliminating any need for sample rotation or rastering, leading to a highly stable imaging modality. This modification provides robustness against geometric uncertainties during data acquisition, particularly for achieving sub-micrometer resolutions where geometric uncertainties typically limit resolution. We introduce the image reconstruction model and validate our results with experimental data on an isolated twin domain within a bulk single crystal of an iron pnictide obtained using a dark-field x-ray microscope. This timely advancement aligns with the enhanced brightness upgrade of the world's synchrotron radiation facilities, opening unprecedented opportunities in imaging.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Hysteresis Modeling with Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hysteresis modeling is crucial to comprehend the behavior of magnetic devices, facilitating optimal designs. Hitherto, deep learning-based methods employed to model hysteresis, face challenges in generalizing to novel input magnetic fields. This paper addresses the generalization challenge by proposing neural operators for modeling constitutive laws that exhibit magnetic hysteresis by learning a mapping between magnetic fields. In particular, three neural operators-deep operator network, Fourier neural operator, and wavelet neural operator-are employed to predict novel first-order reversal curves and minor loops, where novel means they are not used to train the model. In addition, a rate-independent Fourier neural operator is proposed to predict material responses at sampling rates different from those used during training to incorporate the rate-independent characteristics of magnetic hysteresis. The presented numerical experiments demonstrate that neural operators efficiently model magnetic hysteresis, outperforming the traditional neural recurrent methods on various metrics and generalizing to novel magnetic fields. The findings emphasize the advantages of using neural operators for modeling hysteresis under varying magnetic conditions, underscoring their importance in characterizing magnetic material based devices.

      <title>Asynchronous Cell-Free Massive MIMO-OFDM: Mixed Coherent and Non-Coherent Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we analyze the performance of mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions approach, which can improve the performance of cell-free multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CF mMIMO-OFDM) systems under asynchronous reception. To this end, we first obtain the achievable downlink sum-rate for the mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions, and then provide a closed-form expression for the case with the maximum ratio precoding. Subsequently, an efficient clustering algorithm is proposed to group access points into different clusters with the same quantized phase shift in each cluster. Numerical results demonstrate that the mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions can effectively improve the sum-rate of CF mMIMO-OFDM systems under asynchronous reception.</description>
