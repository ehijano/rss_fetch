      <title>Early Growth of Structure in Warm Wave Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the growth of structure in wave-like dark matter models, where the field and density spectra are peaked at sub-horizon wavenumbers. Starting with the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system, we derive the scale-dependent evolution of the matter power spectrum during radiation and matter domination. We find a suppression of adiabatic perturbations during radiation domination, controlled by a free-streaming length, and scale-dependent growth of the initially white-noise isocurvature power, controlled by a Jeans scale during matter domination. The results are in qualitative, and in some regimes quantitative, agreement with the quasi-particle picture. We verify the analytic results of the power spectrum with 3+1-dimensional cosmological Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations. We propose an analytic formula for the halo mass function, which is in rough agreement with the simulation results at early times after matter-radiation equality. Our simulations show that early halos typically host a soliton.</description>

      <title>Effective Viscosity in the Intracluster Medium During Magnetic Field Amplification via Turbulent Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters host a hot, diffuse plasma with poorly understood viscosity and magnetic field amplification. Astrophysical plasmas are often modeled with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but low collision rates in environments like the intracluster medium (ICM) hinder thermodynamic equilibrium, causing pressure anisotropies and high viscosity. High-$\beta$ plasmas, dominated by thermal pressure, are prone to instabilities (e.g., firehose, mirror) that limit anisotropy, reduce viscosity, and enable small-scale dynamo-driven magnetic amplification. This study examines viscosity evolution in the ICM during turbulent magnetic field amplification. We performed 3D MHD simulations of forced turbulence with an initially weak, uniform magnetic field. Using the CGL-MHD framework, we incorporate anisotropic pressure dynamics and instability-driven anisotropy limitation. We analyze effective viscosity and dynamo evolution, comparing results with Braginskii-MHD and uniform-viscosity MHD. Results show viscosity decreases over time, allowing magnetic field amplification to saturation levels similar to non-viscous MHD. Viscosity distribution becomes bimodal, reflecting (i) collisional values and (ii) turbulence-dominated values proportional to $10^{-4} L_{\rm turb} U_{\rm turb}$ in unstable regions. At saturation, 60% of plasma retains collisional viscosity. Braginskii-MHD reproduces similar magnetic amplification and viscosity structures. However, uniform-viscosity MHD, where viscosity equals the mean saturated CGL-MHD value, fails to capture the turbulence inertial range. These findings highlight the need for anisotropic viscosity models in studying ICM processes like magnetic topology, cosmic ray transport, and AGN-driven shocks. Moreover, our CGL-MHD and Braginskii-MHD models match the Coma cluster density fluctuation spectrum, reinforcing its weakly collisional nature.</description>

      <title>Inflationary attractors and radiative corrections in light of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which have provided a notable shift in the constraints on $(n_s, r)$ and placed several otherwise viable models of inflation in tension with the latest data, we investigate the possible effects that radiative corrections can have on $\xi$-attractor and $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation. These models, which share much in common with Starobinsky-Higgs inflation, have likewise been put under pressure by these results. We find that percent (and even sub-percent) level radiative corrections can easily shift both of these classes of inflation models comfortably into the regions of parameter space favoured by the most recent constraints. However, the flexibility under such corrections (which one can argue should be generally expected) calls into question to what extent it is possible to precisely pin down model-specific predictions for important cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Dark Energy Models Using Late Universe Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use late Universe probes - Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus compilation, Quasars, and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) BAO data - along with Cosmic Chronometers or Megamasers to constrain various dark energy parameterizations. These include the standard $\Lambda$CDM model ($w_0=-1,w_a=0$), as well as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Transitional Dark Energy (TDE) parameterizations. We find that across all parameterizations, the constrained values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ remain within $(1-2)\sigma$ of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, irrespective of spatial curvature, dataset combinations, or prior choices. We find from Bayesian model comparison that $\Lambda$CDM remains the most favored model for both flat and non-flat cases, with results remaining robust under different priors. Across all dataset combinations, we reaffirm the fact that LRG1 and LRG2 data points from the DESI BAO dataset are responsible for driving the preference for dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>New tests of cosmic distance duality relation with DESI 2024 BAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), as required by the Etherington reciprocity theorem, which connects the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance via the relation \( D_{\rm L}(z) = D_{\rm A}(z)(1+z)^2 \). Our analysis is based on the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements provided by the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)/Extended BOSS (eBOSS), and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) surveys. Specifically, an unbiased test of the CDDR is performed through a novel, model-independent method inspired by the two-point diagnostic approach, with DES-SN5YR and Pantheon type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample reconstructed using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique. This methodology effectively eliminates all nuisance parameters, including the sound horizon scale \( r_{\rm d} \) from BAO and the absolute magnitude \( M_{\rm B} \) from SN Ia. A set of \( N-1 \) independent CDDR ratios \( \eta_{ij} \) are constructed for statistical analysis. At the current observational level, no significant deviation from the CDDR is observed at low redshifts, whereas we find positive evidence ($&gt;2\sigma$ C.L.) of deviation from the CDDR at two high redshifts ($z=2.33$ and $z=2.334$). Therefore, our results confirm that the BAO measurement provides a powerful tool to test such fundamental relation in modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>21 cm Signal from the Thermal Evolution of Lyman-$\alpha$ during Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-$\alpha$ photons couple the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen (HI) to the kinetic temperature during the era of cosmic dawn. During this process, they also exchange energy with the medium, heating and cooling the HI. In addition, we expect X-ray photons to heat the mostly neutral gas during this era. We solve this coupled system (Lyman-$\alpha$-HI system along with X-ray heating) for a period of 500 Myr (redshift range $8 &lt;z &lt; 25$). Our main results are: (a) without X-ray heating, the temperature of the gas reaches an equilibrium which is nearly independent of photon intensity and only weakly dependent on the expansion of the universe. The main determinant of the quasi-static temperature is the ratio of injected and continuum Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, (b) while X-ray photons provide an additional source of heating at initial times, for large enough Lyman-$\alpha$ photon intensity, the system tends to reach the same quasi-static temperature as expected without additional heating. This limit is reached when the density of photons close to the Lyman-$\alpha$ resonance far exceeds the HI number density, (c) we compute the global HI signal for these scenarios. In the limit of the large density of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, the spin temperature of the hyperfine line is fixed. This freezes the global HI signal from the era of cosmic dawn and the cross-over redshift from absorption to emission. This feature depends only on the ratio of injected to continuum Lyman-$\alpha$ photons, and the global HI signal can help us determine this ratio.</description>

      <title>Modeling of the High Column Density systems in The Lyman-Alpha Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-alpha forests observed in the spectra of high-redshift quasars can be used as a tracer of the cosmological matter density to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. Extraction of cosmological information from these studies requires modeling of the forest correlations. While the models depend most importantly on the bias parameters of the intergalactic medium (IGM), they also depend on the numbers and characteristics of high-column-density systems (HCDs) ranging from Lyman-limit systems with column densities log NHI/1cm^{-2} &gt; 17 to damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) with log NHI/1cm^{-2} &gt; 20.2. These HCDs introduce broad damped absorption characteristic of a Voigt profile. Consequently they imprint a component on the power spectrum whose modes in the radial direction are suppressed, leading to a scale-dependent bias. Using mock data sets of known HCD content, we test a model that describes this effect in terms of the distribution of column densities of HCDs, the Fourier transforms of their Voigt profiles and the bias of the halos containing the HCDs. Our results show that this physically well-motivated model describes the effects of HCDs with an accuracy comparable to that of the ad-hoc models used in published forest analyses. We also discuss the problems of applying the model to real data, where the HCD content and their bias is uncertain.</description>

      <title>Simple quintessence models in light of DESI-BAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses from the DESI collaboration suggest that the dark energy density of the Universe may be decreasing with time, slowing the acceleration of the scale factor $a$. Typically these studies are performed assuming an ansatz for the equation of state $w(a)$. In this work, we instead consider simple models of a scalar quintessence potential with linear and quadratic behavior, which could be more representative of real models than particular parametrizations of $w(a)$. We observe a significant preference for dynamical dark energy when using supernova data from DESY5 along with DESI BAO and Planck data, at the cost of slightly exacerbating the Hubble tension. However, when using supernova data from Pantheon+ or Union3, we find only a mild preference for dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Validation of Fast Mocks Generation for CSST Photometric Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak lensing has become a powerful tool for probing the matter distribution in the Universe and constraining cosmological parameters. This paper aims to explore the fast mock generation pipeline to obtain the covariance matrix of the $3\times 2$pt analysis for the upcoming China Space Station Telescope (CSST). We adopt the $N_\mathrm{side}$ pipeline, which generates matter distribution with lognormal assumptions, to create full-sky galaxy mocks with certain two-point statistics. We also employ the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation to test the accuracy of the covariance matrix from the mock-generated galaxy catalogue. Our work validates the accuracy of the $3\times 2$pt statistics in both spherical harmonic space and real space. The critical scale below which the fractional error of correlation exceeds 1$\%$ can decrease as the resolution parameter $N_\mathrm{side}$ increases. After excluding certain scales, the covariance matrix from the mock-generated galaxy catalogue can constrain the cosmological parameters with 0.1$\%$ accuracy. This work demonstrates the potential of $\texttt{GLASS}$ for real-space cosmological measurements and highlights the importance of discarding appropriate scales.</description>

      <title>Decay of dark energy into dark matter in a metric $f(R)$ gravity: effective running Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a modified late-Universe dynamics where dark energy decays into dark matter, within the framework of metric $f(R)$-gravity in the Jordan frame. After a detailed analysis of the modified $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ model, we introduce a theoretical diagnostic tool to capture the emergence of an effective running Hubble constant as a function of redshift. We then compare this theoretical model with the 40-bin analysis of the Supernova Pantheon sample. This comparison allows us to determine the value of the additional free parameter that appears in our model, beyond those of the standard $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ model. Our modified late Universe dynamics provides a good-quality fit to the binned data, improving upon the previous phenomenological interpretation based on a power-law decay. However, unlike the power-law model, our approach cannot be extrapolated to the recombination redshift to match the Hubble constant measured by the Planck satellite. In fact, the dynamics resulting from the binned Pantheon sample analysis address only weakly the Hubble tension between the SH0ES and the Planck Collaboration values of the Hubble constant. Here we provide a convincing representation of the observed deviation of the cosmological dynamics from the $\Lambda$CDM-one, as it out-stands from the low redshift observed sources.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing the impact of the solar modulation on AMS-02 antiproton excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of solar modulation on the antiproton excess observed by AMS-02, which may indicate dark matter (DM) annihilation. We analyze three solar modulation models: the force-field approximation (FFA), a time-, charge-, and rigidity-dependent FFA, and a three-dimensional numerical simulation based on the Parker transport equation. Based on AMS-02 latest antiproton data (2025), our results show that the significance of the DM signal is sensitive to the chosen modulation model, with a 2$\sigma$ signal for the FFA (4$\sigma$ if including data from H, He, C, O, B/C, and B/O) and a reduced significance for more complex models. We also address systematic uncertainties using two methods: the add-in-quadrature method, which assumes uncorrelated uncertainties between energy bins, and the nuisance parameter method, which treats systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters during the fitting process. Fitted to AMS-02 antiproton data, DM annihilation to the $b\bar{b}$ scenario with three different solar modulation models shows that the add-in-quadrature method causes overfitting, whereas the nuisance parameters approach leads to underfitting. Statistically, the signal region of the FFA model using the add-in-quadrature method is the most reliable. This work highlights the need for refined solar modulation models and a better treatment of uncertainties for a conclusive interpretation of the AMS-02 data.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: $w$CDM cosmology from simulation-based inference with persistent homology on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) weak lensing data using persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique that tracks how features like clusters and voids evolve across density thresholds. For the first time, we apply spherical persistent homology to galaxy survey data through the algorithm TopoS2, which is optimized for curved-sky analyses and HEALPix compatibility. Employing a simulation-based inference framework with the Gower Street simulation suite, specifically designed to mimic DES Y3 data properties, we extract topological summary statistics from convergence maps across multiple smoothing scales and redshift bins. After neural network compression of these statistics, we estimate the likelihood function and validate our analysis against baryonic feedback effects, finding minimal biases (under $0.3\sigma$) in the $\Omega_\mathrm{m}-S_8$ plane. Assuming the $w$CDM model, our combined Betti numbers and second moments analysis yields $S_8 = 0.821 \pm 0.018$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.304\pm0.037$-constraints 70% tighter than those from cosmic shear two-point statistics in the same parameter plane. Our results demonstrate that topological methods provide a powerful and robust framework for extracting cosmological information, with our spherical methodology readily applicable to upcoming Stage IV wide-field galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $\Lambda$CDM extensions in light of re-analyzed CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last years with the increasing precision in cosmological observations we have been able to establish an standard model of cosmology, the so-called $\Lambda$CDM, but also find some tensions between cosmological probes that are difficult to explain within the context of this model. We tested several phenomenological extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM with the newest datasets from the chain CMB+BAO+SNIa, to see whether they are able to alleviate the aforementioned tensions. We find that when the updated version of the Planck CMB likelihood (PR4 LoLLiPoP and HiLLiPoP), with respect to the more used likelihoods (PR4 CamSpec and PR3), is considered, the lensing anomaly is reduced, and the preference for $A_L&gt;1$ and $\Omega_k&lt;0$ is less significant. From the CMB+BAO+SNIa dataset, in the context of the parameterization $w_0w_a$CDM we find a preference for a time-evoling dark energy over the rigid cosmological constant which is consistent with the most recent results from DESI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Mass models of galaxy clusters from a non-parametric weak-lensing reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the CLASH sample of galaxy clusters using a new deprojection method for weak gravitational lensing observations. This method is non-parametric, allowing us to infer mass profiles, or equivalently circular velocities, without having to assume a specific halo profile. While this method assumes spherical symmetry, we show that, on average, triaxiality is unlikely to significantly affect our results. We use this method to study the total mass profiles of the CLASH clusters, as well as the relation between their total and baryonic components: (1) We find that the implied circular velocities are consistent with being approximately flat at large radii, akin to the rotation curves of galaxies. (2) We infer radially resolved baryonic mass fractions, finding that these vary significantly from cluster to cluster and depend strongly on the details of the X-ray gas mass profiles. Since the gas mass profiles are poorly constrained at large radii, it is unclear whether the CLASH clusters reach the cosmic baryon fraction expected in $\Lambda$CDM. (3) The non-parametric masses are consistent with the stellar mass--halo mass relation expected in $\Lambda$CDM; fitting parametric NFW halos to the non-parametric mass profiles gives results in overall agreement with the expected mass-concentration relation, though the concentrations are relatively poorly constrained. (4) Galaxy clusters systematically deviate from the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) and the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) defined by galaxies, but the magnitude of the offset depends strongly on the gas mass extrapolation at large radii. Contrary to some previous results based on hydrostatic equilibrium, we find that galaxy clusters may fall on the same BTFR and RAR as galaxies if one adds a suitable positive baryonic mass component.</description>

      <title>pop-cosmos: Insights from generative modeling of a deep, infrared-selected galaxy population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the pop-cosmos model for the evolving galaxy population up to redshift $z\sim6$. The model is trained on distributions of observed colors and magnitudes, from 26-band photometry of $\sim420,000$ galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog with Spitzer IRAC $\textit{Ch. 1}&lt;26$. The generative model includes a flexible distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters, and a depth-dependent photometric uncertainty model, both represented using score-based diffusion models. We use the trained model to predict scaling relationships for the galaxy population, such as the stellar mass function, star-forming main sequence, and gas-phase and stellar metallicity vs. mass relations, demonstrating reasonable-to-excellent agreement with previously published results. We explore the connection between mid-infrared emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-formation rate, finding high AGN activity for galaxies above the star-forming main sequence at $1\lesssim z\lesssim 2$. Using the trained population model as a prior distribution, we perform inference of the redshifts and SPS parameters for 429,669 COSMOS2020 galaxies, including 39,588 with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts. The resulting redshift estimates exhibit minimal bias ($\text{median}[\Delta_z]=-8\times10^{-4}$), scatter ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=0.0132$), and outlier fraction ($6.19\%$) for the full $0&lt;z&lt;6$ spectroscopic compilation. These results establish that pop-cosmos can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to forward-model modern wide--deep surveys for Stage IV cosmology. We publicly release pop-cosmos software, mock galaxy catalogs, and COSMOS2020 redshift and SPS parameter posteriors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Spectator Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for gravitational wave (GW) production sourced by spectator scalar fields during inflation. These fields, while not driving cosmic expansion, generate blue-tilted isocurvature fluctuations that naturally satisfy current CMB constraints at large scales while producing enhanced power spectra at smaller scales accessible to GW detectors. The resulting GW spectrum spans an exceptionally broad frequency range from $10^{-20}$ to $1$ Hz, with amplitudes ranging from $\Omega_{\text{GW}}h^2 \sim 10^{-20}$ to $10^{-12}$ depending on the reheating temperature and spectator field mass. For heavy spectator fields with effective masses near the inflationary Hubble scale $H_I$, the mechanism produces observable signals across multiple detector bands accessible to pulsar timing arrays, space-based interferometers, and ground-based detectors. Our analysis reveals multiple complementary constraints on spectator field parameters. GW-induced limits on the effective number of relativistic species ($\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$) require $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.61 H_I$, stronger than CMB isocurvature bounds alone ($m_\chi \gtrsim 0.54 H_I$). The non-observation of primordial B-modes by \textit{Planck} provides stronger constraints $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.66 H_I$, with projected LiteBIRD sensitivity potentially reaching $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.70 H_I$. This mechanism enables a unique multi-messenger probe of beyond the Standard Model physics during inflation, providing simultaneous constraints on inflationary dynamics, dark matter production, and reheating through current and next-generation GW experiments.</description>

      <title>A new model of spontaneous scalarization of black holes induced by curvature and matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new model of black hole spontaneous scalarization that combines a scalar--Gauss--Bonnet interaction with a non-minimal coupling to a $U(1)$ gauge field (a dark photon or an electromagnetic field). This construction generalizes earlier single-coupling setups and allows both curvature-induced and matter-induced scalarization within one framework, which allows us to overcome the limitations of each mechanism alone. We focus on charged, spherically symmetric black holes and demonstrate that our model substantially expands the range of black hole masses and charges that permit scalar hair. Negative Gauss--Bonnet couplings, previously associated only with near-extremal charges or rapidly spinning black holes, now trigger scalarization for much broader charge intervals. We develop a numerical procedure to solve the field equations, and investigate the various properties of these black holes. This results in new branches emerging at distinct mass thresholds, a behavior not seen in the pure Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet or Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet--Ricci models. The scalar charge depends sensitively on the coupling parameters and on the $U(1)$ charge. Our analysis also shows that these black holes have larger entropy than their Reissner--Nordstr\"om counterparts and can become overcharged, surpassing the usual extremal limit of charge-to-mass ratio. Analyzing the scalar charge behavior suggests that adding matter-coupling appears to stabilize solutions that were previously prone to higher-order instabilities in pure Gauss--Bonnet models with quadratic coupling and broadens the range of possible configurations, making this model a promising candidate for further studies in strong gravity.</description>

      <title>Reheating and relic gravitational waves as remedies for degeneracies of non-canonical natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, a natural non-canonical inflationary model based on a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We analyze the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of the model and identify their degeneracies with respect to the free parameters. Notably, $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ are independent of the model parameters that leads to unresolved degeneracies. Employing the constraints on reheating parameters such as the reheating duration $N_{\rm{reh}}$, the reheating temperature $T_{\rm{reh}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{reh}}$, is found to be insufficient to fully break these degeneracies. However, the relic gravitational wave spectrum provides a way to break degeneracy with respect to the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$, degeneracy with respect to the potential parameter $f$ persist. Finally, we specify the allowed ranges for the inflationary duration $N$ and the parameter $\alpha$, in light of the latest observational data. These results highlight the role of relic gravitational waves in refining inflationary models and illustrate the challenges in fully resolving parameter degeneracies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an interacting dark matter (DM)-dark energy (DE) framework that naturally yields an effective dynamical DE equation of state crossing the phantom barrier at early times, as indicated by recent DESI data, while also accounting for the observed isotropic rotation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) linear polarization. Within this unified framework, we also explain the DM relic abundance without introducing additional fields or couplings. Depending on the DE potential, we identify two viable scenarios: a superheavy freeze-in DM requiring a high reheating temperature, or a strongly interacting dark sector with a GeV-TeV scale thermal DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Unitarity-Conserving Non-Minimally Coupled Inflation and the ACT Spectral Index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration has reported a scalar spectral index $ n_s~=~0.9743~\pm~0.0034 $. This is substantially larger than the classical prediction of non-minimally coupled inflation models such as Higgs Inflation, $n_s \approx 0.965$. Here we revisit the unitarity-conserving non-minimally coupled inflation model proposed in [1]. We show that when the inflaton is a complex non-minimally coupled gauge singlet scalar with additional interactions in the Jordan frame to maintain unitarity, the model predicts $n_s = 0.9730$ and $r \approx 9 \times 10^{-6}$ for scalar self-coupling $\lambda = 0.1$.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic-rays are charged particles moving in magnetic fields. They not only emit well-known synchrotron photons but also gravitational radiation. We clarify the characteristics of the gravitational wave signal in this specific situation and underline some unexpected features. A phenomenological approximation for the radiated power is given. We derive the shape and peaking frequency of the associated stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves for both electrons and protons, either of galactic or extra-galactic origin.</description>

      <title>A new classification of ex-situ and in-situ Galactic globular clusters based on a method trained on Milky Way analogues in the TNG50 cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method combining existing cosmological simulations and orbital integration to study the hierarchical assembly of globular cluster (GC) populations in the Milky Way (MW). Our method models the growth and evolution of GC populations across various galactic environments as well as the dynamical friction and mass loss experienced by these objects. This allows us to track the trajectory of about 18,000 GCs over cosmic time in 198 MW-like galaxies from TNG50. This cosmological-scale tracking of the dynamics of in-situ and ex-situ GC populations with such a large statistical sample allows us to confirm the presence of an overlap between the two populations in MW-like galaxies, occurring below an energy threshold of $E &lt; 0.7 E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$ where $E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$ is the energy of a circular orbit at the galaxy's stellar half-mass radius $r_{\rm hm}^{*}$. Our results challenge the validity of current classification schemes commonly adopted in the literature, which ultimately fail to provide a clear separation between the two populations. Instead, they tend to isolate only a subset of the ex-situ GCs. More precisely, we argue that it is highly unlikely to find in-situ clusters at $E &gt; 0.7 E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$, and that the real challenge lies in distinguishing the two populations below this energy threshold. In this context, we provide new predictions regarding the origins of the MW GCs observed with Gaia, as well as a comparison with existing literature. Additionally, we highlight that even if ex-situ clusters share a common origin, they inevitably lose their dynamical coherence in the $E$-$L_{z}$ space within MW-like galaxies. We observe a dispersion of GC groups as a function of $E$ and $L_{z}$, primarily driven by the evolution of the galactic potential over time and by dynamical friction, respectively.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Origins of Gravitational Potentials in Astrophysical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most astrophysical systems (except for very compact objects such as, e.g., black holes and neutron stars) in our universe are characterized by shallow gravitational potentials, with dimensionless compactness parameter. While the existence and characteristic scales of such virialized systems depend on gravity, we demonstrate that the value of the compactness -- and thus the non-relativistic nature of most astrophysical objects -- arises from microphysical parameters, specifically the fine structure constant and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and is fundamentally independent of the gravitational constant G. It then follows that large-scale astrophysical velocities and escape velocities associated with virialized systems are determined by electromagnetic and atomic physics, not by gravitation, and that the compactness is always set by microphysical scales -- even for the most compact objects, such as neutron stars, where the compactness is determined by quantities like the pion-to-proton mass ratio. This observation, largely overlooked in the literature, explains why the universe is not dominated by relativistic, compact objects and connects the low entropy of the observable universe to underlying microphysics. Our results emphasize the central but underappreciated role played by dimensionless microphysical constants in shaping the macroscopic gravitational landscape of the universe. In particular, we clarify that this independence of compactness from G applies specifically to entire, virialized, naturally formed astrophysical systems -- such as stars, galaxies, and planets -- that have reached equilibrium through self-gravity and microphysical processes. In contrast, arbitrary non-virialized subsystems (e.g., a piece cut from a planet) do not exhibit this property.</description>

Abstract: We question the existence of one-loop corrections to the large-scale power spectrum from small-scale modes in non-slow-roll dynamics which are not volume suppressed by the ratio of the short to long distance scales. One-loop contributions proportional to the long wavelength tree-level power spectrum, and not sharing this suppression, have appeared in studies involving interactions singled out by the non-slow-roll dynamics. In this context, we show the relevance of seemingly irrelevant interactions terms, such as the one provided by total derivative terms (boundary terms), and how they equally lead to non-volume suppressed contributions and exact cancellations.</description>

      <title>Hint of dark matter-dark energy interaction in the current cosmological data?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new constraints on an interacting dark matter\textendash dark energy scenario motivated by string compactification, where a scalar field adiabatically tracks the minimum of an effective potential sourced by dark matter density. In this study, we focus on the Chameleon dark energy model and, for the first time, numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation using a shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions, improving upon earlier works that relied on approximations. We perform a comprehensive MCMC analysis using a combination of datasets including Planck, BAO (SDSS and DESI DR2), Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results show a clear preference for a non-zero dark sector coupling, overcoming previous upper-bound-only constraints due to improved numerical accuracy and data precision. This preference is primarily driven by the late-time ISW effect. Notably, the inclusion of DESI DR2 and SH$_0$ES data increases the inferred interaction strength to $\beta \sim 0.3$ (68\% C.L.) and yields strong statistical support over $\Lambda$CDM, with $\Delta\chi^2_{\rm min} = -4.75, -6.41$ and $\Delta{\rm AIC} = -0.75, -2.41$ respectively. If future data further supports a fifth force in the dark sector, non-linear structure formation could offer additional observational tests of such long-range interactions. This work also remains consistent with recent DESI observations of evolving dark energy, with the effective dark energy equation of state crossing the phantom divide around redshift $z \sim 0.5$, a feature that emerges naturally in our framework due to the scalar field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Markov Walk Exploration of Model Spaces: Bayesian Selection of Dark Energy Models with Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Central to model selection is a trade-off between performing a good fit and low model complexity: A model of higher complexity should only be favoured over a simpler model if it provides significantly better fits. In Bayesian terms, this can be achieved by considering the evidence ratio, enabling choices between two competing models. We generalise this concept by constructing Markovian random walks for exploring the entire model space. In analogy to the logarithmic likelihood ratio in parameter estimation problem, the process is governed by the logarithmic evidence ratio. We apply our methodology to selecting a polynomial for the dark energy equation of state function $w(a)$ on the basis of data for the supernova distance-redshift relation.</description>

      <title>Fast radio bursts as a probe of gravity on cosmological scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential for improving constraints on gravity by leveraging correlations in the dispersion measure derived from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in combination with cosmic shear. Specifically, we focus on Horndeski gravity, inferring the kinetic braiding and Planck mass run rate from a stage-4 cosmic shear mock survey alongside a survey comprising $10^4$ FRBs. For the inference pipeline, we utilise the Boltzmann code hi_class to predict the linear matter power spectrum in modified gravity scenarios, while non-linear corrections are obtained from the halo-model employed in HMcode, including feedback mechanisms. Our findings indicate that FRBs can disentangle degeneracies between baryonic feedback and cosmological parameters, as well as the mass of massive neutrinos. Since these parameters are also degenerate with modified gravity parameters, the inclusion of FRBs can enhance constraints on Horndeski parameters by up to $40$ percent, despite being a less significant measurement. Additionally, we apply our model to current FRB data and use the uncertainty in the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation to impose limits on gravity. However, due to the limited sample size of current data, constraints are predominantly influenced by theoretical priors. Despite this, our study demonstrates that FRBs will significantly augment the limited set of cosmological probes available, playing a critical role in providing alternative tests of feedback, cosmology, and gravity. All codes used in this work are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>COZMIC. I. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Initial Conditions Beyond Cold Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 72 cosmological dark matter-only $N$-body zoom-in simulations with initial conditions beyond cold, collisionless dark matter (CDM), as the first installment of the COZMIC suite. We simulate Milky Way (MW) analogs with linear matter power spectra $P(k)$ for i) thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,4,5,6,6.5,10]~\mathrm{keV}$, ii) fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}\in [25.9,69.4,113,151,185,490]\times 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$, and iii) interacting dark matter (IDM) with a velocity-dependent elastic proton scattering cross section $\sigma=\sigma_0 v^n$ relative particle velocity scaling $n\in [2,4]$, and dark matter mass $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}\in[10^{-4},~ 10^{-2},~ 1]$ GeV. Subhalo mass function (SHMF) suppression is significantly steeper in FDM versus WDM, while dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$ can reduce SHMF suppression for IDM. We fit SHMF models to our simulation results and derive new bounds on WDM and FDM from the MW satellite population, obtaining $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}&gt;5.9~\mathrm{keV}$ and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}&gt;1.4\times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ at $95\%$ confidence; these limits are $\approx 10\%$ weaker and $5\times$ stronger than previous constraints owing to the updated transfer functions and SHMF models, respectively. We estimate IDM bounds for $n=2$ ($n=4$) and obtain $\sigma_0 &lt; 1.0\times 10^{-27}$, $1.3\times 10^{-24}$, and $3.1\times 10^{-23}~\mathrm{cm}^2$ ($\sigma_0 &lt; 9.9\times 10^{-27}$, $9.8\times 10^{-21}$, and $2.1\times 10^{-17}~\mathrm{cm}^2$) for $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}=10^{-4}$, $10^{-2}$, and $1$ GeV, respectively. Thus, future development of IDM SHMF models can improve IDM cross section bounds by up to a factor of $\sim 20$ with current data. COZMIC presents an important step toward accurate small-scale structure modeling in beyond-CDM cosmologies, critical to upcoming observational searches for dark matter physics.</description>

      <title>COZMIC. II. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Fractional non-CDM Initial Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present $24$ cosmological dark matter (DM)-only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way analog with initial conditions appropriate for scenarios where non-cold dark matter (NCDM) is a fraction of the total DM abundance (f-NCDM models) as the second installment of the COZMIC suite. We initialize our simulations using transfer functions, $T_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)\equiv\sqrt{P_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)/P_{\mathrm{CDM}}(k)}$ (where $P(k)$ is the linear matter power spectrum), with an initial suppression similar to thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM) followed by a constant-amplitude plateau. We simulate suppression wavenumbers $[22.8,~ 32.1,~ 41.8,~ 52.0,~ 57.1,~ 95.3]~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to thermal-relic WDM masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,~ 4,~ 5,~ 6,~ 6.5,~ 10]~\mathrm{keV}$, and plateau amplitudes $\delta\in [0.2,~ 0.4,~ 0.6,~ 0.8]$. We model the subhalo mass function in terms of the suppression wavenumber and $\delta$. Integrating these models into a forward model of the MW satellite galaxy population yields new limits on f-NCDM scenarios, with suppression wavenumbers greater than $46$ and $ 40~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $\delta=0.2$, $0.4$, respectively, at $95\%$ confidence. The current data do not constrain $\delta&gt;0.4$. We map these limits to scenarios where a fraction $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ of DM behaves as a thermal relic, which yields the following bounds on cosmologies with a mixture of WDM and CDM: $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}&gt;3.6,~ 4.1,~ 4.6,~ 4.9,~ 5.4~\mathrm{keV}$ for $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}=0.5,~ 0.6,~ 0.7,~ 0.8,~ 0.9$, respectively, at $95\%$ confidence. The current data do not constrain WDM fractions $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}&lt;0.5$. Our results affirm that low-mass halo abundances are sensitive to partial suppression in $P(k)$, indicating the possibility of using galactic substructure to reconstruct $P(k)$ on small scales.</description>

      <title>Unexpected shape of the primordial black hole mass function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a Universe with nearly-Gaussian initial curvature perturbations, the abundance of primordial black holes can be derived from the curvature power spectrum. When the latter is enhanced within a narrow range around a characteristic scale, the resulting mass function has a single distinct peak, corresponding to Schwarzschild radii set by the horizon entry time of that scale. In contrast, we show (both numerically and by providing an analytic estimation) that a broad enhancement - such as a plateau bounded by infrared and ultraviolet scales - produces a bimodal mass function, with a primary peak close to the infrared scale. We find that the typical initial gravitational potential (compaction function), conditioned on meeting the threshold for critical collapse, is generated by a thin spherical shell with infrared radius and a thickness comparable to the ultraviolet scale. This suggests a higher-than-expected abundance of PBH originating from Type II initial fluctuations. Our results significantly impact overproduction bounds on the amplitude of the power spectrum, and tighten the viable mass range for primordial black holes as dark matter.</description>

      <title>COZMIC. III. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations of Self-interacting Dark Matter with Suppressed Initial Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present eight cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way--like system that include suppression of the linear matter power spectrum $P(k)$, and/or velocity-dependent DM self-interactions, as the third installment of the COZMIC suite. We consider a model featuring a massive dark photon that mediates DM self-interactions and decays into massless dark fermions. The dark photon and dark fermions suppress linear matter perturbations, resulting in dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$, which ultimately affect dwarf galaxy scales. The model also features a velocity-dependent elastic self-interaction between DM particles (SIDM), with a cross section that can alleviate small-scale structure anomalies. For the first time, our simulations test the impact of $P(k)$ suppression on gravothermal evolution in an SIDM scenario that leads to core collapse in (sub)halos with present-day virial masses below $\approx 10^9~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$. In simulations with $P(k)$ suppression and self-interactions, the lack of low-mass (sub)halos and the delayed growth of structure reduce the fraction of core-collapsed systems relative to SIDM simulations without $P(k)$ suppression. In particular, $P(k)$ suppression that saturates current warm DM constraints almost entirely erases core collapse in isolated halos. Models with less extreme $P(k)$ suppression produce core collapse in $\approx 20\%$ of subhalos and $\approx 5\%$ of isolated halos above $10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$, and also increase the abundance of extremely low-concentration isolated low-mass halos relative to SIDM. These results reveal a complex interplay between early and late-Universe DM physics, revealing new discovery scenarios in the context of upcoming small-scale structure measurements.</description>

      <title>Detecting rotation from lensing in the CMB</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An excellent estimate of the lensing signal is expected from the availability of deep and high-resolution polarization data in the near future. This is most important to allow for efficient delensing, needed to detect the primordial B-mode power and with it the famous tensor-to-scalar ratio. Here we discuss in a joint manner estimators of the rotation of polarization, of the second order lensing field rotation, and standard gradient lensing reconstruction. All are most efficient when able to probe the EB power created locally, have comparable reconstruction noise in this regime, and can benefit substantially from delensing. We discuss several ongoing and planned CMB experiments. We determine their noise for lensing field rotation and polarization rotation and discuss their prospects for measuring these effects. There is an on-going controversy on whether the lensing field rotation also rotates the polarization -- if so this will be observed at high significance soon with already on going observations of the South Pole Telescope, SPT-3G, in cross-correlation with tracers of large scale structure, as we show in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A distinctive feature of ultralight bosonic dark matter is its ability to form a Bose-Einstein condensate with a dense, stationary configuration at the center of galactic halos. In this work, we investigate the internal dynamics of such cores by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations within a fully self-consistent gravitational framework, accounting for both gravitational potential perturbations and local self-interactions. We demonstrate that the solitonic core supports a discrete spectrum of well-defined collective modes. These oscillations characterize the linear response of the core to perturbations and may influence various dynamical processes. We also discuss potential astrophysical implications of these excitations on galactic scales.</description>

Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Weak lensing mass-richness relation of redMaPPer clusters in the LSST DESC DC2 simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cluster scaling relations are key ingredients in cluster abundance-based cosmological studies. In optical cluster cosmology, where clusters are detected through their richness, cluster-weak gravitational lensing has proven to be a powerful tool to constrain the cluster mass-richness relation. This work is conducted as part of the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), which aims to analyze the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, starting in 2026. Weak lensing-inferred cluster properties, such as mass, suffer from several sources of bias. We constrain the mass-richness relation of 3,600 clusters detected by the redMaPPer algorithm in the cosmoDC2 extra-galactic mock catalog of the LSST DESC DC2 simulation, covering 440 square degrees, using number count measurements and either stacked weak lensing profiles or mean cluster masses in intervals of richness ($20 &lt; \lambda &lt; 200$) and redshift ($0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1$). We find that, for an LSST-like source galaxy density, our constraints are robust to changes in the concentration-mass relation and dark matter density profile modeling choices, when source redshifts and shapes are perfectly known. We find that photometric redshift uncertainties can introduce bias at the 1$\sigma$ level, which can be mitigated by an overall correction factor, fitted jointly with the scaling parameters. We find that including positive shear-richness covariance in the fit shifts the results by up to 0.5$\sigma$. Our constraints also compare fairly to a fiducial mass-richness relation, obtained from matching cosmoDC2 halo masses to redMaPPer-detected cluster richnesses.</description>

      <title>The TRGB-SBF Project. III. Refining the HST Surface Brightness Fluctuation Distance Scale Calibration with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TRGB-SBF Project team is developing an independent distance ladder using a geometrical calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method in elliptical galaxies that can in turn be used to set the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance scale independent of Cepheid variables and Type~Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The purpose of this project is to measure the local expansion rate of the universe independently of the methods that are most at odds with the theoretically-predicted value of the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$, and therefore isolate the influence of potential systematic observational errors. In this paper, we use JWST TRGB distances calibrated using the megamaser galaxy NGC 4258 to determine a new Cepheid-independent SBF zero point for HST. This new calibration, along with improved optical color measurements from PanSTARRS and DECam, gives an updated value of $H_0 = 73.8\pm 0.7$ (statistical) $\pm 2.3$~(systematic) km/s/Mpc that is virtually identical to the SBF Hubble constant measured by Blakeslee et al. 2021.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter searches from the standard halo over the tidal stream to the big flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of axion dark matter searches depends on the signal window that results from the velocity dispersion of axion dark matter. Since the ratio of signal windows is about 6500 between the standard halo and the big flow axion dark matter, each axion dark matter search usually uses a separate data acquisition (DAQ) channel with a different frequency resolution bandwidth (RBW). In this work, we demonstrate axion dark matter searches covering the standard halo, the tidal stream, and the big flow employing a DAQ channel starting with a single high resolution RBW, without sacrificing the DAQ efficiency, where the DAQ process includes online fast Fourier transforms and writing the outputs to disk. Assuming the total amount of data is sensitive to Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitskii (DFSZ) axion dark matter that follows the standard halo model and makes up 100\% of the local dark matter density, the same data can also be used for the tidal stream and the big flow axion dark matter searches that would be sensitive to DFSZ axion dark matter that constitute 19.2\% and 12.4\% of the local dark matter densities, respectively, at a 90\% confidence level. We also report that the filtering of the individual power spectra acquired with a relatively high resolution RBW e.g., for the big flow search can prevent a possible significant degradation in the signal to noise ratio from the searches in the lower resolution RBW's, i.e., the standard halo and tidal stream searches.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Physics of Dark Energy with the Discovery Simulations</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Discovery simulations: a new pair of high-resolution N-body simulations motivated by the DESI Y1 BAO cosmological constraints on dark energy. The Discovery simulations were run with identical initial conditions, and differ only in their cosmological parameters. The first simulation is based on a flat $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology, while the second is based on a $w_0 w_a\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology, with particular parameter values chosen based on the DESI analysis which includes constraints from BAO with CMB priors. Both simulations evolve $6720^3$ particles in a box with a side length of $L_\mathrm{box} = 1.5$ Gpc, leading to a mass resolution of $\sim4 \times 10^8$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in each simulation. In this work we demonstrate the impact of the $w_0 w_a\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology on the matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and halo mass accretion rate. We also populate halos with galaxies using a novel forward model for in-situ star formation, and examine the way in which changes to cosmology manifest as changes in star formation history. The Discovery simulations provide a testbed for alternative cosmological probes that may offer additional constraining power beyond BAO, such as higher-order summary statistics and observables in the nonlinear regime. Halo catalogs from the Discovery simulations are publicly available and can be downloaded from the HACC Simulation Data Portal.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the values of the fundamental constants at a look-back time of 7.3 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of redshifted spectral lines can provide a measure of the fundamental constants over large look-back times. Current grand unified theories predict an evolution in these constants and astronomical observations offer the only experimental measure of the values of the constants over large timescales. Of particular interest are the dimensionless constants: the fine structure constant ($\alpha$), the proton-electron mass ratio ($\mu$), and the proton g-factor ($g_p$), since these do not require a "standard meterstick". Here we present a re-analysis of the 18 cm hydroxyl (OH) lines at $z=0.89$, which were recently detected with the MeerKAT telescope, toward the radio source PKS\,1830-211. Utilizing the previous constraint of $\Delta\mu/\mu=(-1.8\pm1.2)\times10^{-7}$, we obtain $\Delta (\alpha g_p^{0.27})/(\alpha g_p^{0.27})\lesssim5.7\times10^{-5}$, $\Delta \alpha/\alpha\lesssim2.3\times10^{-3}$ , and $\Delta g_p/g_p\lesssim7.9\times10^{-3}$. These new constraints are consistent with no evolution over a look-back time of 7.3 Gyr and provide another valuable data point in the putative evolution of the constants.</description>

      <title>Learning Correlated Astrophysical Foregrounds with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extragalactic foregrounds -- most notably the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) and the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect -- exhibit complex, non-Gaussian structure and correlations that can bias analyses of small-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies. These foregrounds can introduce mode coupling at small-scales (multipoles $\ell \geq 3000$) that mimic true lensing signals, thereby complicating analyses such as CMB lensing reconstruction. We present a novel approach to learn their full joint distribution using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained on paired CIB-tSZ patches at 150 GHz, from the Agora suite of extragalactic sky simulations. While simulations like Agora, which are based on N-body calculations, can take thousands of CPU hours, DDPM can synthesize realistic CIB-tSZ patches that faithfully reproduce both auto- and cross-spectral statistics of the 2-point, 3-point, and 4-point correlation functions, in a matter of seconds. We further demonstrate matching pixel-value histograms and Minkowski functionals, confirming that conventional non-Gaussian benchmarks are also satisfied. This framework provides a powerful generative tool for forward-modeling correlated extragalactic foregrounds in current and future CMB analyses. Although we mainly demonstrate the joint modeling of tSZ and CIB at a single frequency, we also include examples of its extension to multiple frequencies, showing that the framework can learn the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) across different bands. While establishing DDPMs as a promising tool for addressing foreground contamination in next-generation CMB surveys, we also outline remaining challenges to their practical deployment in analysis pipelines, such as scaling to larger sky areas and reliance on the underlying cosmological and astrophysical assumptions in the simulations used for training.</description>

      <title>X-ray investigation of the remarkable galaxy group Nest200047</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy groups are more susceptible to feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their lower gravitational binding energy compared to clusters. This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on the overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy group Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of radio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we investigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any excess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of the central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used spectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across the whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to detect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due to the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background effects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN likely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5) \times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure profile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting in a baryon fraction of $\sim4\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we estimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. An upper limit of $2.1 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric luminosity, which is $\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is likely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and AWM 5. Such excessive heating may lead to high quenching of star formation. Moreover, the faint X-ray nuclear emission in Nest is likely due to the accretion energy being converted into jets rather than radiation.</description>

      <title>Collapsing domain walls with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating coupling to thermalized fermions and their impact on gravitational wave detections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects make the potential bias between the true and false vacua dependent on the temperature and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>

      <title>A New Measure of Assembly Bias using the Environment Dependence of the Luminosity Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assembly bias is the variation in the clustering of dark matter halos and galaxies that arises from correlations between the halo assembly history and the large-scale environment at fixed halo mass. In this work, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG300 to investigate how assembly bias affects the environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function. We measure the luminosity functions in bins of large-scale environment for the original simulated galaxy sample and for a shuffled sample, where the galaxies are randomly reassigned among halos of similar mass to remove assembly bias. By comparing them, we find distinct signatures, showing variations in the number of galaxies at the $\sim10\%$ level across all luminosities. Assembly bias increases the tendency of galaxies to reside in denser environments and further dilutes underdense regions, beyond the trends governed by halo mass. When separating by color, we see that assembly bias has a much bigger effect on red galaxies fainter than $\mathrm{M_r} - 5 \log{h} = -18.5$, which accounts for a $\sim20\%$ increase in the number of galaxies in the densest environment and a remarkable $50\%$ decrease in the least dense regions. The ratio of these measurements for the densest and least dense regions provides a significant assembly bias signal for the faint red galaxies, larger than a factor of two. Overall, our results provide a novel sensitive measure of assembly bias, offering valuable insight for modeling the effect and a potential new route to detect it in observations.</description>

      <title>Radiative Transfer Simulations of Ly$\alpha$ Intensity Mapping During Cosmic Reionization Including Sources from Galaxies and the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new simulations of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) intensity maps that include Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and all significant sources of Ly$\alpha$ photons. The sources considered include Ly$\alpha$ directly from galaxies, cooling at the edges of ionized bubbles, recombinations within these bubbles, and reprocessing of galaxy continuum emission in the IGM. We also vary astrophysical parameters including the average neutral fraction of the IGM, the dust absorption of Ly$\alpha$ in galaxies, and the ionizing escape fraction. Previous work has suggested that Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping can be used to constrain the neutral fraction of the IGM when accounting for radiative transfer in the IGM. When radiative transfer is ignored, direct Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies has the highest amplitude of power on all scales. When we include radiative transfer in our simulations, we find continuum emission reprocessed as Ly$\alpha$ is comparable to the Ly$\alpha$ emission directly from galaxies on large scales. For high neutral fraction in the IGM, emission from recombinations is comparable to galaxies on large scales. We find that the slope of the power spectrum is sensitive to the neutral fraction of the IGM when radiative transfer is included, suggesting that this may be useful for placing constraints on cosmic reionization. In addition, we find the power of galaxies is decreased across all scales due to dust absorption. We also find the escape fraction must be large for recombinations and bubble edges to contribute significantly to the power. We find the cross power is observable between SPHEREx Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps and a hypothetical galaxy survey is observable with a total signal-to-noise of 4 from $k = 0.035$ Mpc$^{-1}$ to $k = 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling faint X-ray AGN populations in the NewAthena era: Insights from cosmological simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z &gt; 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt; 6); notably, only AGN with LX &gt; 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z &gt; 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z &gt; 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.</description>

      <title>Testing Non-Coincident $f(Q)$-gravity with DESI DR2 BAO and GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the $f\left( Q\right) $-theory for the description of dark energy with a non-trivial connection defined in the non-coincident gauge. The resulting field equations form a two-scalar-field, quintom-like gravitational model. For the power-law model $f\left( Q\right) \simeq Q^{\frac{n}{n-1}}$, we construct an analytic expression for the dynamical evolution of dark energy, which depends on the parameter $n$. We constrain this dark energy model using the the baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI DR2, and gamma-ray bursts. The cosmological data provides $n\simeq0.33$. The $f\left( Q\right) $-model challenges the $\Lambda$CDM by providing a smaller value for $\chi_{\min}^{2}$. Although the Akaike Information Criterion indicates that the two cosmological models fit the data from the Pantheon+, the cosmic chronometers and the baryonic acoustic oscillators in a similar way, when the gamma-ray bursts are introduced there is weak evidence in favor of the $f\left( Q\right) $-theory.</description>
