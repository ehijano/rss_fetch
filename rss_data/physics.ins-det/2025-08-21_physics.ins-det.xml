      <title>Modeling of Light Production in Inorganic Scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent experiments, inorganic scintillators have been used to study the decays of exotic nuclei, providing an alternative to silicon detectors and enabling measurements that were previously impossible. However, proper use of these materials requires us to understand and quantify the scintillation process. In this work, we propose a framework based on that of Birks [Proc. Phys. Soc. A 64, 874] and Meyer and Murray [Phys. Rev. 128, 98] to model the light output of inorganic scintillators in response to beams of energetic heavy ions over a broad range of energies. Our model suggests that, for sufficiently heavy ions at high energies, the majority of the light output is associated with the creation of delta electrons, which are induced by the passage of the beam through the material. These delta electrons dramatically impact the response of detection systems when subject to ions with velocities typical of beams in modern fragmentation facilities. We test the accuracy of our model with data from Lutetium Yttrium Orthosilicate (LYSO:Ce), a common inorganic scintillator. We compare calculated light production and quenching factors with experimental data for heavy ions of varying mass and energy as well as make a quantitative estimate of the effects of delta rays on overall light output. The model presented herein will serve as a basic framework for further studies of scintillator response to heavy ions. Our results are crucial in planning future experiments where relativistic exotic nuclei are interacting with scintillator detectors.</description>

      <title>Scalable FPGA Framework for Real-Time Denoising in High-Throughput Imaging: A DRAM-Optimized Pipeline using High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data, minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.</description>

      <title>A study to suppress a sneaking cosmic muon background in the COMET experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COMET experiment, conducted at J-PARC, aims to search for muon-to-electron conversion with an unprecedentedly high sensitivity. One of the severest backgrounds in the Phase-I experiment originates from cosmic-ray muons. A cosmic muon sneaks into a detector solenoid magnet from a loophole, scattered and leaving a track in a cylindrical drift chamber. Among them, a positive muon track with reverse direction may mimic a signal electron of 105 MeV/$c$. In order to suppress the sneaking cosmic positive muon background, we developed a method to discriminate the track direction by using track-fitting quality. We demonstrated that the positive muon background can be reduced by an order of magnitude. In this paper, we will report the methodology, a Monte Carlo simulation and results with prospects.</description>

      <title>Direct Neutron Reactions in Storage Rings Utilizing a Supercompact Cyclotron Neutron Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for a high-density free-neutron target, primarily aimed at nuclear astrophysics reaction studies in inverse kinematics with radioactive ions circulating in a storage ring. The target concept integrates four key subsystems: a neutron production source driven by a supercompact cyclotron utilizing $^9$Be($p,xn$) reactions, an optimized moderator/reflector assembly using either heavy-water or beryllium oxide with a graphite reflector shell to thermalize fast neutrons, a cryogenic liquid hydrogen moderator to maximize thermal neutron density in the interaction region, and beam pipe geometries that enable neutron-ion interactions while maintaining vacuum conditions for ion circulation. This integrated approach focuses on feasibility by incorporating readily available technology. Using a commercial supercompact cyclotron delivering 130 $\mu$A, the design achieves thermal neutron areal densities of $\sim3.4\times10^{6}$ n/cm$^2$ for a proof-of-concept demonstrator at the CRYRING ion-storage ring at GSI. This autonomous accelerator-target assembly design enables deployment at both in-flight and ISOL facilities to exploit their complementary production yields.
  Potential upgrades based on higher-energy and/or higher-current isochronous cyclotrons should enable an increase in areal density to $\sim$10$^9$ n/cm$^2$. In combination with a customized low-energy storage ring and a radioactive ion-beam facility, the proposed solution could deliver luminosities above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, thereby enabling neutron capture measurements of $\sim$mb cross sections within a few days of experiment. The proposed system represents a significant milestone towards enabling large neutron-capture surveys on exotic nuclei, thereby opening a new avenue for understanding the synthesis of heavy elements in our universe.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised physics-informed generative networks for phase retrieval from a single X-ray hologram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando (tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach, as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and absorption information.</description>

      <title>Continuous coupling of electron beam to a thin dielectric slab waveguide yields monochromatic Cherenkov diffraction radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scheme for generation of monochromatic Cherenkov radiation in a thin dielectric layer is proposed. The electrons travel in vacuum parallel to a dielectric, exciting a single synchronous electromagnetic waveguide mode. The proposed scheme is studied quantitatively for near-infrared radiation in silicon induced by a 100-keV electron beam, using time-domain and frequency-domain numerical simulations, with material absorption and dispersion taken into account. This method of radiation generation can be scaled from ultraviolet to terahertz radiation by changing the thickness of the dielectric layer and choosing a material with low loss at the desired wavelength. Comparison with conventional Cherenkov Radiation and Cherenkov Diffraction Radiation is also presented.</description>

      <title>Impact of trace amounts of water on the stability of Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors measured in Ar-CO$_2$ (90-10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of humidity on the performance of various non-resistive Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors, such as GEM, Thick-GEM, and Micromegas, operated with \ArCOtwo gas mixture. The water content is introduced in a range of \SIrange[range-units=single]{0}{5000}{\ppmV}. It is observed that the presence of increased humidity does not significantly degrade any of the studied performance criteria. On the contrary, our measurements suggest an improvement in discharge stability with increasing humidity levels at the highest gains and fields. No significant difference is observed at the lower gains, indicating that humidity helps to reduce the rate of spurious discharges related to electrode defects or charging-up of the insulating layers. We conclude that adding a small amount of water to the gas mixture may be beneficial for the stable operation of an MPGD.</description>
