      <title>Operando monitoring of strain field distribution in lithium battery anode via ultra-high spatial resolution optical frequency domain reflectometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cycling performance of lithium-ion batteries is closely related to the expansion effect of anode materials during charge and discharge processes. Studying the mechanical field evolution of anode materials is crucial for evaluating battery per-formance. Here, we propose a phase-sensitive ultra-high spatial resolution optical frequency domain reflectometry tech-nique, in which the test fiber is embedded into the anode of a lithium-ion battery to monitor the mechanical evolution of the anode material during cycling. We investigated the strain evolution of the anode material under different loading levels and used this method to infer the morphological changes of the material. Furthermore, combining this with battery capacity in-formation provides a new approach for assessing the performance of lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Loss rate of ultracold neutrons due to the absorption by trap walls in large material traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most accurate neutron lifetime measurements now use the material or magnetic traps of ultracold neutrons (UCN). The precision of these experiments is determined by the accuracy of estimating the neutron loss rate. In material UCN traps the main source of neutron losses is the absorption by trap walls. In this paper we analyze the standard methods and their approximations for the calculation of UCN absorption rate by the walls of material traps. We emphasize the approximations used both in the standard analytical formulas and in the numerical Monte-Carlo simulations. For the two simplest trap geometries, rectangular and cylindrical, we obtain precise analytical formulas for this absorption rate and compare them with the standard estimation methods. The difference turned out to be considerable and especially important for the size extrapolation procedure, always used in the standard estimates of UCN losses. Our results may partially resolve the puzzling four-second discrepancy between the magnetic and material-trap measurements of neutron lifetime.</description>

      <title>Streaming Large-Scale Electron Microscopy Data to a Supercomputing Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data management is a critical component of modern experimental workflows. As data generation rates increase, transferring data from acquisition servers to processing servers via conventional file-based methods is becoming increasingly impractical. The 4D Camera at the National Center for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) generates data at a nominal rate of 480 Gbit/s (87,000 frames/s) producing a 700 GB dataset in fifteen seconds. To address the challenges associated with storing and processing such quantities of data, we developed a streaming workflow that utilizes a high-speed network to connect the 4D Camera's data acquisition (DAQ) system to supercomputing nodes at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), bypassing intermediate file storage entirely. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our streaming pipeline in a production setting through an hour-long experiment that generated over 10 TB of raw data, yielding high-quality datasets suitable for advanced analyses. Additionally, we compare the efficacy of this streaming workflow against the conventional file-transfer workflow by conducting a post-mortem analysis on historical data from experiments performed by real users. Our findings show that the streaming workflow significantly improves data turnaround time, enables real-time decision-making, and minimizes the potential for human error by eliminating manual user interactions.</description>

      <title>Simulations for direct dark matter searches using ALPS II's TES detection system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition Edge Sensors (TES) are superconducting microcalorimeters that can be used for single-photon detection with extremely low backgrounds. When they are within their superconducting transition region, small temperature fluctuations - like the energy deposited by single photons - lead to large resistance variations. These variations can be measured using Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). This technology is planned to be used as a single-photon detector for later runs of the ALPS II experiment, a light-shining-through-walls experiment at DESY Hamburg, searching for Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), which are possible Dark Matter (DM) candidates. Due to the very low dark count rates in our setup, our TES system might be viable for direct DM searches at sub-MeV masses through electron-scattering of DM in the superconducting chip, as well. Simulations concerning background rejection and calibration methods demonstrate the needed sub-eV sensitivity already.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Performance of Detectors for Athena's WFI: Measurements and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The depleted p-channel field effect transistor is the chosen sensor type for the Wide Field Imager of the Athena mission. It will be used in two types of cameras. One will enable observations of a field of view of 40' x 40' by using an array of four 512 x 512 pixel sensors in a 2 x 2 configuration. A second, small one is designed to investigate bright, point-like sources with a time resolution of up to 40 microseconds. Sensors of final size, layout, and technology were fabricated, assembled and characterised. Also, first results from the flight production are available and confirm the excellent performance. In order to be able to estimate the future performance of degraded detectors, a simulation was developed that takes into account the non-analytical threshold effects on the basis of measurement results. We present the measurement analysis and the comparison of simulated and measured values as well as first attempts to use the Monte Carlo simulation to predict performance results based on noise measurements.</description>

      <title>Metrology requirements for the integrated luminosity measurement at ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision measurement of the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}$ at future Higgs factories, including ILC, is of crucial importance for the cross-section measurements, and in particular for the line-shape measurements at the Z-pole. Since there is no up-to-date estimate of the integrated luminosity uncertainties arising from metrology effects at ILC, here we review a feasibility of the targeted precision of $\mathcal{L}$ at foreseen ILC center-of-mass energies: 91.2 GeV, 250 GeV, 500 GeV and 1 TeV.</description>

      <title>ML-based Calibration and Control of the GlueX Central Drift Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GlueX Central Drift Chamber (CDC) in Hall D at Jefferson Lab, used for detecting and tracking charged particles, is calibrated and controlled during data taking using a Gaussian process. The system dynamically adjusts the high voltage applied to the anode wires inside the chamber in response to changing environmental and experimental conditions such that the gain is stabilized. Control policies have been established to manage the CDC's behavior. These policies are activated when the model's uncertainty exceeds a configurable threshold or during human-initiated tests during normal production running. We demonstrate the system reduces the time detector experts dedicate to calibration of the data offline, leading to a marked decrease in computing resource usage without compromising detector performance.</description>

      <title>Search for Charged Excited States of Dark Matter with KamLAND-Zen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle dark matter could belong to a multiplet that includes an electrically charged state. WIMP dark matter ($\chi^{0}$) accompanied by a negatively charged excited state ($\chi^{-}$) with a small mass difference (e.g. $&lt;$ 20 MeV) can form a bound-state with a nucleus such as xenon. This bound-state formation is rare and the released energy is $\mathcal{O}(1-10$) MeV depending on the nucleus, making large liquid scintillator detectors suitable for detection. We searched for bound-state formation events with xenon in two experimental phases of the KamLAND-Zen experiment, a xenon-doped liquid scintillator detector. No statistically significant events were observed. For a benchmark parameter set of WIMP mass $m_{\chi^{0}} = 1$ TeV and mass difference $\Delta m = 17$ MeV, we set the most stringent upper limits on the recombination cross section times velocity $\langle\sigma v\rangle$ and the decay-width of $\chi^{-}$ to $9.2 \times 10^{-30}$ ${\rm cm^3/s}$ and $8.7 \times 10^{-14}$ GeV, respectively at 90% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties from metrology in the integrated luminosity measurement with the updated design of a detector at CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to measure integrated luminosity with a required precision of $10^{-4}$ at the $Z^0$ pole, proposed CEPC $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider requires a luminometer, a specially designed calorimeter placed in the very forward region to identify Bhabha scattering at low polar angles. Usually, such a device is placed at the outgoing beams, to keep the spatial symmetries of the head-on collisions at accelerators with a non-zero crossing angle. At CEPC it is currently proposed to place the luminometer on the z-axis. We review a feasibility of a measurement of the integrated luminosity at the $Z^{0}$ pole with the required precision, concerning the luminometer centered around the z-axis and the post-CDR beam properties.</description>

      <title>Performance of small-diameter muon drift tube chambers with new fast readout ASIC at high background rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments like ATLAS at the HL-LHC or detectors at future hadron colliders need muon detectors with excellent momentum resolution up to the TeV scale both at the trigger and offline reconstruction levels. This requires muon tracking chambers with high spatial resolution even at the highest background fluxes. Drift-tube chambers are the most cost-effective technology for large-area muon systems, providing the required high rate capability and three-dimensional spatial resolution. Thanks to advances in electronics, the new generation small-diameter Muon Drift Tube (sMDT) detectors with 15 mm tube diameter can be used in stand-alone mode up to the background rates expected at future hadron collider experiments, providing event times and second coordinates without additional trigger chambers. New developments in integrated front-end electronics include fast baseline restoration of the shaped signal and picosecond time-to-digital converters for second coordinate measurement with double-sided read-out. Self-triggered operation is now possible using modern high-performance FPGAs for real-time pattern recognition and track reconstruction. A new amplifier shaper discriminator chip in 65 nm TSMC CMOS technology with increased sensitivity and faster baseline recovery has been developed to cope with high background fluxes. Extensive test beam campaigns using sMDT chambers with new readout electronics have been performed at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++). Results show that the shorter peaking time of the new chip enhances the spatial resolution of the drift tubes by up to 100 $\mu$m at a background rate of 1 MHz, the maximum rate expected at the 100 TeV collider experiment.</description>
