      <title>European Options in Market Models with Multiple Defaults: the BSDE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-linear Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) driven by a Brownian motion and p default martingales. The driver of the BSDE with multiple default jumps can take a generalized form involving an optional finite variation process. We first show existence and uniqueness. We then establish comparison and strict comparison results for these BSDEs, under a suitable assumption on the driver. In the case of a linear driver, we derive an explicit formula for the first component of the BSDE using an adjoint exponential semimartingale. The representation depends on whether the finite variation process is predictable or only optional. We apply our results to the problem of pricing and hedging a European option in a linear complete market with two defaultable assets and in a non-linear complete market with p defaultable assets. Two examples of the latter market model are provided: an example where the seller of the option is a large investor influencing the probability of default of a single asset and an example where the large seller's strategy affects the default probabilities of all p assets.</description>

      <title>Critical volatility threshold for log-normal to power-law transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random walk models with log-normal outcomes fit local market observations remarkably well. Yet interconnected or recursive structures - layered derivatives, leveraged positions, iterative funding rounds - periodically produce power-law distributed events. We show that the transition from log-normal to power-law dynamics requires only three conditions: randomness in the underlying process, rectification of payouts, and iterative feed-forward of expected values. Using an infinite option-on-option chain as an illustrative model, we derive a critical volatility threshold at $\sigma^* = \sqrt{2\pi} \approx 250.66\%$ for the unconditional case. With selective survival - where participants require minimum returns to continue - the critical threshold drops discontinuously to $\sigma_{\text{th}}^{*} = \sqrt{\pi/2} \approx 125.3\%$, and can decrease further with higher survival thresholds. The resulting outcomes follow what we term the Critical Volatility ($V^*$) Distribution - a power-law whose exponent admits closed-form expression in terms of survival pressure and conditional expected growth. The result suggests that fat tails may be an emergent property of iterative log-normal processes with selection rather than an exogenous feature.</description>

      <title>Forward Performance Processes under Multiple Default Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article constructs a forward exponential utility in a market with multiple defaultable risks. Using the Jacod-Pham decomposition for random fields, we first characterize forward performance processes in a defaultable market under the default-free filtration. We then construct a forward utility via a system of recursively defined, indexed infinite-horizon backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with discounting, and establish the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of their solutions. To verify the required (super)martingale property of the performance process, we develop a rigorous characterization of this property with respect to the general filtration in terms of a set of (in)equalities relative to the default-free filtration. We further extend the analysis to a stochastic factor model with ergodic dynamics. In this setting, we derive uniform bounds for the Markovian solutions of the infinite-horizon BSDEs, overcoming technical challenges arising from the special structure of the system of BSDEs in the defaultable setting. Passing to the ergodic limit, we identify the limiting BSDE and relate its constant to the risk-sensitive long-run growth rate of the optimal wealth process.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for a partially observed interacting system of Hawkes processes I: subcritical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ Hawkes processes and observe the actions of a subpopulation of size $K \le N$ up to time $t$, where $K$ is large. The influence relationships between each pair of individuals are modeled by i.i.d.Bernoulli($p$) random variables, where $p \in [0,1]$ is an unknown parameter. Each individual acts at a {\it baseline} rate $\mu &gt; 0$ and, additionally, at an {\it excitation} rate of the form $N^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \theta_{ij} \int_{0}^{t} \phi(t-s)\,dZ_s^{j,N}$, which depends on the past actions of all individuals that influence it, scaled by $N^{-1}$ (i.e. the mean-field type), with the influence of older actions discounted through a memory kernel $\phi \colon \mathbb{R}{+} \to \mathbb{R}{+}$. Here, $\mu$ and $\phi$ are treated as nuisance parameters. The aim of this paper is to establish a central limit theorem for the estimator of $p$ proposed in \cite{D}, under the subcritical condition $\Lambda p &lt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Chaos and Synchronization in Financial Leverages Dynamics: Modeling Systemic Risk with Coupled Unimodal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systemic financial risk refers to the simultaneous failure or destabilization of multiple financial institutions, often triggered by contagion mechanisms or common exposures to shocks. In this paper, we present a dynamical model of bank leverage (the ratio of asset holdings to equity) a quantity that both reflects and drives risk dynamics. We model how banks, constrained by Value-at-Risk (VaR) regulations, adjust their leverage in response to changes in the price of a single asset, assumed to be held in fixed proportion across banks. This leverage-targeting behavior introduces a procyclical feedback loop between asset prices and leverage. In the dynamics, this can manifest as logistic-like behavior with a rich bifurcation structure across model parameters. By analyzing these coupled dynamics in both isolated and interconnected bank models, we outline a framework for understanding how systemic risk can emerge from seemingly rational micro-level behavior.</description>

      <title>Volatility Parametrizations with Random Coefficients: Analytic Flexibility for Implied Volatility Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a market practice to express market-implied volatilities in some parametric form. The most popular parametrizations are based on or inspired by an underlying stochastic model, like the Heston model (SVI method) or the SABR model (SABR parametrization). Their popularity is often driven by a closed-form representation enabling efficient calibration. However, these representations indirectly impose a model-specific volatility structure on observable market quotes. When the market's volatility does not follow the parametric model regime, the calibration procedure will fail or lead to extreme parameters, indicating inconsistency. This article addresses this critical limitation - we propose an arbitrage-free framework for letting the parameters from the parametric implied volatility formula be random. The method enhances the existing parametrizations and enables a significant widening of the spectrum of permissible shapes of implied volatilities while preserving analyticity and, therefore, computation efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel method on real data from short-term index and equity options, where the standard parametrizations fail to capture market dynamics. Our results show that the proposed method is particularly powerful in modeling the implied volatility curves of short expiry options preceding an earnings announcement, when the risk-neutral probability density function exhibits a bimodal form.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of L\'evy processes and financial models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the information geometry of L\'evy processes. As a starting point, we derive the $\alpha$-divergence between two L\'evy processes. Subsequently, the Fisher information matrix and the $\alpha$-connection associated with the geometry of L\'evy processes are computed from the $\alpha$-divergence. In addition, we discuss statistical applications of this information geometry. As illustrative examples, we investigate the differential-geometric structures of various L\'evy processes relevant to financial modeling, including tempered stable processes, the CGMY model, and variance gamma processes.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of American options with hybrid dividends via integral equations and the GIT method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a semi-analytical method for pricing American options on assets (stocks, ETFs) that pay discrete and/or continuous dividends. The problem is notoriously complex because discrete dividends create abrupt price drops and affect the optimal exercise timing, making traditional continuous-dividend models unsuitable. Our approach utilizes the Generalized Integral Transform (GIT) method introduced by the author and his co-authors in a number of papers, which transforms the pricing problem from a complex partial differential equation with a free boundary into an integral Volterra equation of the second or first kind. In this paper we illustrate this approach by considering a popular GBM model that accounts for discrete cash and proportional dividends using Dirac delta functions. By reframing the problem as an integral equation, we can sequentially solve for the option price and the early exercise boundary, effectively handling the discontinuities caused by the dividends. Our methodology provides a powerful alternative to standard numerical techniques like binomial trees or finite difference methods, which can struggle with the jump conditions of discrete dividends by losing accuracy or performance. Several examples demonstrate that the GIT method is highly accurate and computationally efficient, bypassing the need for extensive computational grids or complex backward induction steps.</description>
