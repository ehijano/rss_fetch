      <title>Few-electron highly charged muonic Ar atoms verified by electronic $K$ x rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic $K$ x rays emitted by muonic Ar atoms in the gas phase were observed using a superconducting transition-edge-sensor microcalorimeter. The high-precision energy spectra provided a clear signature of the presence of muonic atoms accompanied by a few electrons, which have never been observed before. One-, two-, and three-electron bound, i.e., H-like, He-like, and Li-like, muonic Ar atoms were identified from electronic $K$ x rays and hyper-satellite $K$ x rays. These $K$ x rays are emitted after the charge transfer process by the collisions with surrounding Ar atoms. With the aid of theoretical calculations, we confirmed that the peak positions are consistent with the x-ray energies from highly charged Cl ions, and the intensities reflecting deexcitation dynamics were successfully understood by taking into account the interaction between the muon and bound electrons.</description>

      <title>A definition of the SI second based on several optical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new definition of the SI second based on optical transitions is expected to be adopted within the next 10 years. Several options for this redefinition are currently under consideration. Among them, a definition based on several transitions would take advantage of the variety of high performance optical frequency standards. In this paper, we review practical aspects such a definition entails, and propose a detailed analysis of its strengths and weaknesses.</description>

      <title>Derivations of Bloch (Majorana--Bloch) equation, von Neumann equation, and Schr\"odinger--Pauli equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from classical physics to quantum mechanics has been mysterious. Here, we derive the space-independent von Neumann equation for electron spin mathematically from the classical Bloch or Majorana--Bloch equation, which is also derived. Subsequently, the space-independent Schr\"odinger--Pauli equation is derived in both the quantum mechanical and recently developed co-quantum dynamic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Production and stabilization of a spin mixture of ultracold dipolar Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</description>

      <title>An Equation of State for Turbulence in the Gross-Pitaevskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the numerical observation of a far-from-equilibrium equation of state (EoS) in the Gross-Pitaevskii model. This universal dimensionless EoS is constructed by relating the turbulent cascade's scale-free spectrum amplitude to the energy flux of the steady state that emerges from the large-length-scale driving of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Remarkably, this EoS defies the generic predictions of wave-turbulent kinetic theory, even though the cascade spectra are quantitatively well understood within that theory. Finally, we find that the concept of quasi-static thermodynamic processes between equilibrium states extends to far-from-equilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>A simple argument that small hydrogen may exist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.08243v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical argument, based on virial theorem and De Broglie idea from 1924, why the small hydrogen may exist. It may have been created during early stages of the Big Bang, near black holes or large explosions in Universe. In principle, it could be formed in high energy experiment. Being neutral and stable, it would play a significant role in a formation of early galaxies. It would not be observable using usual spectroscopic methods. This paper suggests methods to discover the small hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Prospects of nuclear-coupled-dark-matter detection via correlation spectroscopy of I$_2^+$ and Ca$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter (DM) and its interaction with the Standard Model (SM) is one of the biggest open questions in physics nowadays. The vast majority of theoretically-motivated Ultralight-DM (ULDM) models predict that ULDM couples dominantly to the SM strong/nuclear sector. This coupling leads to oscillations of nuclear parameters that are detectable by comparing clocks with different sensitivities to these nature's constants. Vibrational transitions of molecular clocks are more sensitive to a change in the nuclear parameters than the electronic transitions of atomic clocks. Here, we propose the iodine molecular ion, I$_2^+$, as a sensitive detector for such a class of ULDM models. The iodine's dense spectrum allows us to match its transition frequency to that of an optical atomic clock (Ca$^+$) and perform correlation spectroscopy between the two clock species. With this technique, we project a few-orders-of-magnitude improvement over the most sensitive clock comparisons performed to date. We also briefly consider the robustness of the corresponding "Earth-bound" under modifications of the $Z_N$-QCD axion model.</description>

      <title>Faraday laser pumped cesium beam clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We realize a high-performance compact optically pumped cesium beam clock using Faraday laser simultaneously as pumping and detection lasers. The Faraday laser, which is frequency stabilized by modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS) technique, has narrow linewidth and superior frequency stability. Measured by optical heterodyne method between two identical systems, the linewidth of the Faraday laser is 2.5 kHz after MTS locking, and the fractional frequency stability of the Faraday laser is optimized to $1.8\times{10}^{-12}/\sqrt{\tau}$. Based on this high-performance Faraday laser, the cesium beam clock realizes a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in 1 Hz bandwidth of $39600$ when the cesium oven temperature is 130{\deg}C. Frequency-compared with Hydrogen maser, the fractional frequency stability of the Faraday laser pumped cesium beam clock can reach $1.3\times{10}^{-12}/\sqrt{\tau}$ and drops to $1.4\times{10}^{-14}$ at 10000 s when the cesium oven temperature is 110{\deg}C. %, which is the best reported result compared with other cesium beam clocks. This Faraday laser pumped cesium beam clock demonstrates its excellent performance, and its great potential in the fields of timekeeping, navigation, and communication. Meanwhile, the Faraday laser, as a high-performance optical frequency standard, can also contribute to the development of other applications in quantum metrology, precision measurement and atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Constraining Ultralight Dark Matter through an Accelerated Resonant Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments aimed at detecting ultralight dark matter typically rely on resonant effects, which are sensitive to the dark matter mass that matches the resonance frequency. In this study, we investigate the nucleon couplings of ultralight axion dark matter using a magnetometer operating in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) mode. Our approach involves the use of a $^{21}$Ne spin-based sensor, which features the lowest nuclear magnetic moment among noble-gas spins. This configuration allows us to achieve an ultrahigh sensitivity of 0.73 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ at around 5 Hz, corresponding to energy resolution of approximately 1.5$\times
  10^{-23}\,\rm{eV/Hz^{1/2}}$. Our analysis reveals that under certain conditions it is beneficial to scan the frequency with steps significantly larger than the resonance width. The analytical results are in agreement with experimental data and the scan strategy is potentially applicable to other resonant searches. Further, our study establishes stringent constraints on axion-like particles (ALP) in the 4.5--15.5 Hz Compton-frequency range coupling to neutrons and protons, improving on prior work by several-fold. Within a band around 4.6--6.6 Hz and around 7.5 Hz, our laboratory findings surpass astrophysical limits derived from neutron-star cooling. Hence, we demonstrate an accelerated resonance search for ultralight dark matter, achieving an approximately 30-fold increase in scanning step while maintaining competitive sensitivity.</description>
