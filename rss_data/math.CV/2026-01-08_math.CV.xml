      <title>Duality between Bott-Chern and Aeppli Cohomology on Non-Compact Complex Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish duality theorems relating Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomology, both with and without compact support, on non-compact complex manifolds under suitable pseudoconvexity assumptions. In particular, on Stein manifolds we obtain a full Bott-Chern-Aeppli duality extending Serre duality for Dolbeault cohomology. We also show that these results fail in general without pseudoconvexity assumptions by constructing explicit counterexamples on non-compact complex surfaces.</description>

      <title>Normalized Milnor Fibrations for Real Analytic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Milnor's fibration theorem and its generalizations play a central role in the study of singularities of complex and real analytic maps. In the complex analytic case, the Milnor fibration on the sphere is always given by the normalized map $f/|f|$. In contrast, for real analytic maps the existence of such a normalized Milnor fibration generally fails, even when a Milnor--Le fibration exists on a tube.
  For locally surjective real analytic maps $f:(R^n,0)-&gt;(R^k,0)$ with isolated critical value, the existence of a Milnor--Le fibration on a tube is guaranteed under a transversality condition. However, the associated fibration on the sphere need not be given by the normalized map $f/||f||$, unless an additional regularity condition (d-regularity) is imposed.
  In this paper we show that this apparent obstruction is not intrinsic. More precisely, we prove that for any such map satisfying the transversality property, there exists a homeomorphism $h:(R^k,0)-&gt;(R^k,0)$ of the target space such that the composition $h^{-1}f$ becomes d-regular. As a consequence, the normalized map $(h^{-1}f)/||h^{-1}f||$ defines a smooth locally trivial fibration on the sphere, which is equivalent to both the Milnor--Le fibration on the tube and the Milnor fibration on the sphere. Our result reveals a closer topological parallel between real and complex analytic singularities than previously recognized, without changing the topological type of the singularity.</description>

      <title>Complex potentials and holomorphic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complex potential is a holomorphic function $\Omega:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ whose real and imaginary parts generate a pair of orthogonal foliations, representing the equipotential lines and the streamlines of $\dot{z} = \overline{\Omega'(z)}$. In this work, we generalize the concept of potential to the broader class of dynamical systems of the form $\dot{z} = f(z)$, with $f:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ holomorphic. The resulting potential induces a rectification mapping providing a natural framework for the topological classification of phase portraits of planar polynomial vector fields. The existence of complex potentials serves as a powerful tool in addressing fundamental problems, such as the establishment of bounds for the number of limit cycles in piecewise-smooth systems, and the local configuration of curvature lines around umbilic points, among others.</description>

      <title>Carath\'eodory distance-preserving maps between bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the rigidity of maps between bounded symmetric domains that preserve the Carath\'eodory/Kobayashi distance. We show that such maps are only possible when the rank of the co-domain is at least as great as that of the domain. When the ranks are equal, and the domain is irreducible, we prove that the map is either holomorphic or antiholomorphic. In the holomorphic case, we show that the map is in fact a triple homomorphism, under the additional assumption that the origin is mapped to the origin. We exploit the large-scale geometry of the Carath\'eodory distance and use the horocompactification and Gromov product to obtain these results without requiring any smoothness assumptions on the maps.</description>

      <title>On the Absolute-Value Integral of a Brownian Motion with Drift: Exact and Asymptotic Formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04172v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is concerned with the integral of the absolute value of a Brownian motion with drift. By establishing an asymptotic expansion of the space Laplace transform, we obtain series representations for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the integral, making use of Meijer's G-function. A functional recursive formula is derived for the moments, which is shown to yield only exponentials and Gauss' error function up to arbitrary orders, permitting exact computations. To obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for small- and large-deviation probabilities, we employ a marginal space-time Laplace transform and apply a newly developed generalization of Laplace's method to exponential Airy integrals. The impact of drift on the complete distribution of the integral is explored in depth. The resultant new formulae complement existing ones in the standard Brownian motion case to great extent in terms of both theoretical generality and modeling capacity and have been presented for easy implementation, which numerical experiments demonstrate.</description>

      <title>From Complex-Analytic Models to Sparse Domination: A Dyadic Approach of Hypersingular Operators via Bourgain's Interpolation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Cheng--Fang--Wang--Yu on the hypersingular Bergman projection, we develop a real-variable and dyadic framework for hypersingular operators in regimes where strong-type estimates fail at the critical line. The main new input is a hypersingular sparse domination principle combined with Bourgain's interpolation method, which provides a flexible mechanism to establish critical-line (and endpoint) estimates.
  In the unit disc setting with $1&lt;t&lt;3/2$, we obtain a full characterization of the $(p,q)$ mapping theory for the dyadic hypersingular maximal operator $\mathcal M_t^{\mathcal D}$, in particular including estimates on the critical line $1/q-1/p=2t-2$ and a weighted endpoint criterion in the radial setting. We also prove endpoint estimates for the hypersingular Bergman projection \[ K_{2t}f(z)=\int_{\mathbb D}\frac{f(w)}{(1-z\overline w)^{2t}}\,dA(w), \] including a restricted weak-type bound at $(p,q)=\bigl(\tfrac{1}{3-2t},1\bigr)$. Finally, we introduce a class of hypersingular cousin of sparse operators in $\mathbb R^n$ associated with \emph{graded} sparse families, quantified by the sparseness $\eta$ and a new structural parameter (the \emph{degree}) $K_{\mathcal S}$, and we characterize the corresponding strong/weak/restricted weak-type regimes in terms of $(n,t,\eta,K_{\mathcal S})$.
  Our real-variable perspective addresses to an inquiry raised by Cheng--Fang--Wang--Yu on developing effective real-analytic tools in the hypersingular regime for $K_{2t}$, and it also provides a new route toward the critical-line analysis of Forelli--Rudin type operators and related hypersingular operators in both real and complex settings.</description>
