      <title>On the Origin of Coronal Picoflare Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale jet-like eruptions, such as picoflare jets and jetlets, are recognized as potential contributors to coronal heating and solar wind acceleration, yet their physical origin is still not fully established. Using ultra-high-resolution extreme ultraviolet imaging datasets from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the Solar Orbiter mission, we investigate tiny coronal jets observed off-limb in the Sun's polar regions. Visual inspection reveals that the majority of these jets exhibit distinct morphological features, including a bright spire accompanied by a dark eruptive jet component. We analyzed eleven of these jets in detail and found that their spatial and temporal scales are comparable to previously reported jetlets, while their kinetic energies are two to three orders of magnitude lower, placing them in the picoflare regime. The bright and dark components show distinct dynamics, with the dark structures generally displaying lower speeds. A comparison with coordinated Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory data, together with 2.5D radiative-MHD simulations performed with the Bifrost code, reveals a one-to-one morphological correspondence between the dark counterparts and cool chromospheric surges accompanying the bright jet spire. This association suggests that flux emergence and magnetic reconnection at low atmospheric heights may produce coupled bright-dark structures, providing a plausible mechanism for the generation of picoflare jets. Our results demonstrate Solar Orbiter's ability to resolve the dynamics of small-scale jets and place new constraints on their origin.</description>

      <title>Long-term eclipse time variations in white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overwhelming majority of eclipsing white dwarf (WD) binary systems show quasi-periodic variations in eclipse timings on many year timescales. Currently, the mechanism behind these eclipse time variations (ETVs) is not known, with the main competing theories being the planetary hypothesis and the Applegate/Lanza mechanisms. Here, we present a comprehensive study of 43 WD binary systems, the vast majority of which have more than a decade of eclipse timing measurements, analysing their global properties to determine which driving force is the likely origin of the observed ETVs. Long-term, high-speed photometry data obtained with ULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC and HiPERCAM have allowed us to track the evolution of the ETVs in these systems, and analyse any previously unseen trends. From this analysis, we find a clear difference in the level of observed ETVs past the fully convective boundary, where systems with partially radiative companion stars consistently showing high levels of variation. While some systems may be affected by the presence of an unknown planet, the results from this study strongly indicates that an Applegate- or Lanza-like mechanism is the most likely driving force for the timing variations seen in the majority of systems in this sample. However, as found in previous studies, the Applegate/Lanza mechanisms are still not able to reproduce the large and rapid timing variations seen in the vast majority of systems, with the companion star to the WD unable to provide sufficient energy on these short timescales.</description>

      <title>The SB9 catalogue: status, comparison with non-single stars from Gaia DR3 and evolution to SBX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ninth Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits (SB9) is a comprehensive compilation of spectroscopic binaries (SBs) with orbital parameters sourced from literature, comprising approximately 4000 systems (2800 single-lined and 1200 double-lined). This work presents the latest status of SB9 after two decades of development, detailing the statistical properties of SBs through orbital period distributions and eccentricity-period diagrams categorized by spectral type and evolutionary stage. We performed a rigorous cross-match with Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) to update astrometric parameters and compare SB9 with the Gaia DR3 Non-Single Star (NSS) catalogue. Our methodology utilized positional separations, magnitudes, and proper-motion back-propagation for identification. The final SB9 version updated by D. Pourbaix includes 4003 systems, including higher-order multiples: 152 triples, 71 quadruples, and 14 higher-order systems. Of these, 3976 have Gaia DR3 identifiers; 21 are too bright and six too faint for detection. Ten SB9 systems with periods exceeding 1180 days were spatially resolved by Gaia DR3. We identified a common sample of 827 binaries cross-matched with Gaia NSS, with 655 considered highly reliable based on period and eccentricity differences under 10%. The limited overlap (20-30% of SB9) results from NSS selection cuts, brightness limits, and temporal baselines. This study highlights the complementary strengths of both catalogues and establishes a benchmark sample for binary star research. Finally, this work marks the transition of SB9 into SBX (The eXtended Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits), featuring a modern relational database, improved web interface, and Virtual Observatory access standards to enhance data quality and accessibility for the stellar community.</description>

      <title>Modeling brightness temperature of sunspots using ALMA single-dish observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model sunspot brightness temperature in the wavelength range 0.3-10mm using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) single-dish measurements together with other instruments. Our modeling idea starts from an existing model, the 1D semi-empirical Avrett-Tian-Landi-Curdt-W\"ulser (ATLCW) model for sunspots. The original model is then modified in density and temperature with a constant factor over all heights. A least-square fit in both density and temperature to the observed values yields an improved model for sunspot brightness temperature. Observations show that sunspots are darker than QS at wavelengths below 2 mm and brighter beyond, while fitting of the ATLCW sunspot model imply that sunspots should be darker than QS over the entireALMArange. The best-fitted sunspot brightness temperature profiles resulted in 3.6-4.0 times lower sunspot density compared to the original sunspot ATLCW model, or 1.4-1.8 times higher density compared to QS. The temperature came out around 1.2 times higher than the original ATLCW predictions for sunspots, or 1.2 times lower than QS temperature. Even with improved density and temperature parameters, the remaining discrepancy between the bestfitted models and observations indicated that additional improvements are needed in the ATLCW model and modeling assumptions.</description>

      <title>The attempted polarity reversal and evolving magnetic environment of AD Leo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past two decades, the observed large-scale magnetic field of the active M dwarf star AD Leo has evolved from strongly to mildly negative, raising a suspicion that it might switch polarity. Although magnetic field reversals are observed every 11 years for the Sun, such reversals are poorly understood for M dwarfs. Further, no reversals have been observed for fast-rotating M dwarfs. We examine the properties of AD Leo's large-scale magnetic field and investigate how its evolution affects the space weather environment. We analysed spectropolarimetric data collected by ESPaDOnS and SPIRou in late-2022 and early-2023. With the optical and near-infrared data we computed the longitudinal magnetic field, and with the near-infrared data reconstructed the large-scale magnetic field using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. Using five magnetograms, from 2019 to 2023, we simulated three-dimensional Alfven wave-driven stellar winds using the space weather code SWMF. Although we see an evolution of the large-scale magnetic field of AD Leo, we find no polarity reversal. Rather, we see a restoration of the field to a simpler configuration with consistently negative values for the longitudinal magnetic field strength. Our new large-scale field reconstruction for AD Leo is characterised by a highly axisymmetric, poloidal-dipolar field with an increased mean large-scale field strength. SWMF simulations find the stellar mass loss rates to be, on average, an order of magnitude greater than that of the Sun. Additionally, we find that the habitable zone resides beyond the Alfven surface. Hypothetical magnetised habitable zone planets (with planetary field strengths greater than 0.34 G) would likely be shielded from the incident wind and atmospheric erosion would be negligible. Further, we find variable conditions across each epoch due to the evolving axisymmetry of the stellar large-scale magnetic field.</description>

      <title>3D radiative transfer modeling of scattering polarization with partial frequency redistribution I. Verification and disk-center results for the solar Ca I 4227 {\AA} line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several strong solar resonance lines show observable linear scattering polarization signals, holding a great potential for investigating the magnetism of the outer solar atmosphere. Accurately modeling these signals requires solving the radiative transfer (RT) problem for polarized radiation in comprehensive 3D models of the solar atmosphere, in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium, accounting for partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects. This problem has so far been computationally inaccessible. We present the first scientific application of TRIP, a novel software for the massively parallel solution of the 3D non-LTE RT problem for polarized radiation, including scattering polarization and PRD. We aim to verify the code and explore the combined action of PRD and the 3D structure of the solar atmosphere on scattering polarization. We run TRIP to synthesize the Stokes profiles of the Ca I line at 4227 {\AA} in a 3D model of the solar atmosphere extracted from a radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulation. We efficiently solve the resulting large-scale problem, with up to $4 \times 10^{10}$ degrees of freedom, with a state-of-the-art preconditioned Krylov method, using up to 20 thousand parallel CPUs. After including verification tests, we find that the joint impact of PRD effects and the detailed 3D structure of the atmospheric model produce disk-center scattering polarization signals in the line wings. These signals are sensitive to the magnetic field, via magneto-optical effects, and to bulk velocity gradients. We also show that the CRD approximation underestimates the amplitude of disk-center line-core signals. This achievement represents a crucial step forward for diagnosing the magnetism of the solar chromosphere and transition region through the quantitative comparisons of synthetic and observational data.</description>

      <title>A Photometric and Spectroscopic investigation of 11 TESS eclipsing contact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By cross-matching the eclipsing binary catalog provided by Prsa et al. (2022) with LAMOST medium resolution spectra, we obtained 11 targets. Combining light and radial velocity curves analysis, we have derived accurate physical parameters for these 11 targets. The results indicate that there are 3 deep contact binaries, 3 moderate ones, and 5 shallow ones. Among them, 3 targets exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is attributed to the presence of star-spot on the component's surface. One target is a low-mass ratio deep contact binary and may be contact binary merging candidates. The evolutionary status of these 11 targets was studied using the mass-luminosity and mass-radius relation diagrams. Based on the O-C (Observed minus Calculated) analysis of 10 targets, we found that the orbital periods of 5 contact binaries show a long-term decreasing trend, likely due to the combined effects of mass transfer between the two components and loss of angular momentum. Meanwhile, the orbital periods of the other 4 stars are continuously increasing, which is attributed to mass transfer. Besides, the O-C curves of 3 targets show clear periodic changes, which might result from the Applegate mechanism or the light travel time effect.</description>

      <title>Power-law Indices of EUV Intensity Power Spectrum in Flaring Coronal Active Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar intensity power spectra are usually characterised by coloured noise, with the spectral energy following a segmented power-law function of frequency, $S(f)\propto f^{-\alpha}$, over different frequency ranges. Typically, the power-law index exceeds 1 in the low-frequency part ($\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$) and is around 0 at high frequencies ($\alpha_\mathrm{hf}$). This work investigates the spatial and temporal evolution of the power-law indices of coronal EUV intensity power spectra in flare-hosting active regions. The spatial distribution of the power-law index in the low-frequency domain ($\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$) closely mirrors EUV intensity images, indicating that $\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$ can reveal the dynamics of coronal plasma structures. Temporally, $\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$ remains stable in quiescent active regions, but it exhibits significant variability before the flare onset. Motivated by this behaviour, we analysed 14 flare events, quantifying the temporal variation of the indices $\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$ and $\alpha_\mathrm{hf}$ as potential flare precursors. In all flare events considered, notable deviations of $\alpha_\mathrm{lf}$ beyond a defined threshold consistently occurred at the flare site within a few minutes before the flare. In some cases, the change in the value of $\alpha_\mathrm{lf} - \alpha_\mathrm{hf}$ was detected within 30--90\, minutes before the flare. This proof-of-concept study suggests that the temporal variation of the power-law indices in coronal EUV intensity power spectra could potentially serve as short-term precursors of solar flares, which needs to be validated on a larger flare sample.</description>

      <title>A method to derive self-consistent NLTE astrophysical parameters for 4 million high-resolution 4MOST stellar spectra in half a day with invertible neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys obtain spectra for millions of stars. However, classical spectroscopic methods can often be computationally expensive, rendering them impractical for the analysis of large datasets. We introduce a novel simulation-based deep-learning approach for the efficient analysis of high-resolution stellar spectra to be obtained with the upcoming high-resolution 4MOST spectrograph. We used a suite of synthetic non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) spectra generated with Turbospectrum to mimic 4MOST observations and trained a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) for the purpose of predicting self-consistently stellar surface parameters and chemical abundances. The cINN is a neural network architecture that estimates full posterior distributions for the target stellar properties, providing an intrinsic uncertainty estimate. We evaluated the predictive performance of the trained cINN model on both synthetic data and observed spectra of stars. We found that our new cINN trained on NLTE synthetic spectra is capable of recovering stellar parameters with average errors ($\sigma$) of $33$ K for $T_\mathrm{eff}$, $0.16$ dex for $\log(g)$, and $0.12$ dex for [Fe/H], $0.1$ dex for [Ca/Fe], $0.11$ for [Mg/Fe], and $0.51$ dex for [Li/Fe], respectively, at a signal to noise ratio of 250 per Angstrom. From the analysis of the observed spectra of Gaia-ESO / 4MOST / PLATO benchmark stars, we verified that our NLTE estimates for stellar parameters and abundances are consistent with results obtained with the independent code TSFitPy. We conclude that the NLTE cINN is robust and can, theoretically, evaluate 4 million high-resolution 4MOST spectra in less than a day, using GPU acceleration.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Impact of Solar Modulation Systematic Uncertainties on Cosmic-Ray Propagation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of cosmic-ray propagation using the time-dependent AMS-02 flux measurements covering a full solar cycle, with particular emphasis on the role of solar modulation. We fit two representative Galactic propagation scenarios, convection- and re-acceleration-dominated models, in combination with three solar modulation prescriptions: the standard force-field approximation, an extended force-field model with a rigidity break, and the heliospheric propagation code $\texttt{HelMod}$. The inclusion of time-resolved antiproton data provides a unique probe of charge-sign-dependent modulation effects and low-energy systematics. We find that the force-field approximation can describe positively charged nuclei reasonably well outside the solar maximum in convection-dominated models, but fails during periods of high solar activity and for antiprotons at all times. In re-acceleration scenarios, strong degeneracies between solar modulation and low-energy propagation lead to unphysical results when simple modulation models are employed. Across all models, we identify systematic uncertainties of order 10-15% in the reconstructed local interstellar spectra and propagation parameters, driven by limitations in current solar modulation modelling. Compared to the percent level error of current measurements, these uncertainties significantly limit the precision of cosmic-ray studies. Future time-dependent measurements spanning a full 22-year solar cycle will be crucial to reduce these uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning VI. Enhancing neural network mitigation of stellar activity RV signals with additional metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of exoplanet masses using the radial velocity (RV) technique is currently limited by stellar activity, which introduces quasiperiodic variability signals that must be modeled and removed to enhance the sensitivity of the RV measurements to exoplanet signals. Neural networks have previously been demonstrated effective in modeling stellar activity signals in HARPS-N solar data using white light cross correlation functions (CCFs). Building on this work, we train a neural network on six years of HARPS-N solar data with additional parameters commonly associated to stellar activity, including chromatic CCFs, line shape metrics, spectral activity indicators, total solar irradiance (TSI) light curves from SORCE and TSIS-1, and TSI time derivatives. Our results show that parameters such as the bisector inverse slope and Na D equivalent widths do not significantly improve the neural network's ability to predict activity-induced RV variations compared to using the white light CCFs alone. However, parameters such as unsigned magnetic flux, the TSI and its time derivative, S-index, H-alpha equivalent width, chromatic CCFs, contrast, and full width at half maximum do improve the neural network's ability to predict RV scatter. Our new model reduces the RV scatter in a held-out test set from 147.1 cm/s to 93.3 cm/s, consistent with supergranulation noise levels reported in previous studies. These results suggest that finding effective tracers for (super)granulation will be critical to train models capable of further mitigating RV jitter, and necessary for characterizing Earth analogues.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at the TNG: LXX. TOI-5734b: A hot sub-Neptune orbiting a relatively young K dwarf with an Earth-like density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing interest in young exoplanets is leading to a growing effort to understand the formation and evolutionary processes responsible for their different architectures. One interesting target is TOI-5734, a relatively young K3-K4 dwarf star ($500_{-150}^{+300}$ Myr) showing a transiting candidate in photometric observations followed up with high-resolution spectroscopic data. Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry and High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) radial-velocity (RV) data, we aim to validate the presence of the companion TOI-5734b, measure its planetary mass, size, and its orbital parameters after having characterised its host star. We then aim to study its possible planetary composition and atmospheric evolution. By simultaneously modelling photometry and high-cadence RVs, we measured the radius, mass, and density of TOI-5734b precisely. In particular, we employed Gaussian processes (GPs) with a flexible kernel to discriminate between the stellar activity of the young host and planetary signals. We confirmed the planetary nature of TOI-5734b and measured its orbital period ($P_{\rm b}\sim6.18$ d), radius ($R_{\rm b} = 2.10^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$ $R_\oplus$), and mass ($M_{\rm b}=9.1^{+2.6}_{-2.6}$ $M_\oplus$). By measuring its density ($\rho_{\rm b}=0.98_{-0.30}^{+0.36}$ $\rho_\oplus$), we infer that TOI-5734b is close to having a rocky composition and an almost completely depleted primary envelope. Our results point toward the possibility of considering the target for atmospheric studies with present and future ground- and space-based facilities.</description>

Abstract: DMPP is a radial-velocity survey that aims to detect planets around stars exhibiting anomalous activity signatures, consistent with the presence of close-in evaporating planets. Here, we report the discovery of 7 new planetary signals in 5 different systems: DMPP-2c &amp; d, HD67200/DMPP-6b &amp; c, HD118006/DMPP-7b, HD191122/DMPP-8b, and HD200133/DMPP-9b. We update the orbital parameters of the DMPP-1, DMPP-2, and DMPP-3 systems, along with those of the planetary systems orbiting HD181433, HD39194, and HD89839. We derive detection limits for all 24 targets in our sample with adequate observational coverage, and test the DMPP hypothesis by calculating the occurrence rates for planets in this configuration. We find that the occurrence rates of planets in our sample with orbital periods shorter than $50~\mathrm{d}$ and masses in the range $3$-$10$ M$_\oplus$ are $83.0^{+27.1}_{-24.4}\%$, for $10$-$30$ M$_\oplus$ are $27.0^{+15.0}_{-11.2}\%$, and for $30$-$100$ M$_\oplus$ are $13.9^{+11.8}_{-7.5}\%$. This is significantly higher than the occurrence rates reported by other radial velocity surveys, providing strong support for the DMPP hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction with terrestrial and astronomical data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclear data and astronomical observations of neutron stars provide complementary constraints on the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction. In this work, we investigate the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction within a Skyrme energy density functional framework based on the KIDS (Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU) models. We employ a Skyrme-type $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction that includes the standard $s$- and $p$-wave terms, as well as a density-dependent term that effectively represents an $N\Lambda\Lambda$ three-body force. The $s$-wave terms are constrained using data on double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei supplemented by pseudodata obtained from core + $2\Lambda$ three-body model calculations including heavier hypernuclei. We show that the data on heavier systems are essential to simultaneously constrain the two $s$-wave parameters. We further explore the impact of the $p$-wave and $N\Lambda\Lambda$ components on the neutron-star properties and find that appropriate repulsive contributions of these terms yield consistency with current neutron-star mass-radius observations. These results indicate that the present framework provides phenomenologically acceptable equations of state for dense $(N,\Lambda)$ matter over a wide range of densities and highlight the importance of future experimental data on heavier double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects of solar $g$-modes with LISA</title>

Abstract: The possibility of detecting solar oscillation modes using space-based gravitational-wave detectors has been investigated in the context of gravitational-wave interferometry, with Polnarev \cite{Polnarev:2009xf} demonstrating that low-frequency solar modes could, in principle, produce detectable signals in a LISA-type interferometer. Motivated by this work, I revisit the problem using current solar models, updated detector sensitivities, and improved theoretical and observational constraints on mode amplitudes. In this study, I compute the gravitational response of solar oscillation modes using standard solar models generated with \texttt{MESA}, and mode eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions calculated with \texttt{GYRE}. I focus primarily on solar $g$ modes, evaluating their responses for degree $l=2$ and azimuthal orders $m=0$ and $m=2$. The analysis incorporates both the earlier proposed and the current updated LISA sensitivity curves, and I perform a comparative assessment with the TianQin mission in the relevant low-frequency band. To assess the robustness of the predicted signals, I estimate the gravitational responses using two different standard solar models based on the GS98 and AGSS09 abundance compilations. I find that the resulting signal responses are nearly identical for the two models, indicating that uncertainties in solar metallicity have a negligible impact on the detectability of solar $g$ modes by space-based interferometers.</description>

      <title>The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in their final evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the evolution and fate of the most luminous RSGs remain uncertain. Observational evidence for luminous warm, post-RSG objects and the apparent lack of luminous RSGs as supernova progenitors suggest a blueward evolution. Since the 1980s, WOH G64 has been considered the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud, given its large obscuration, outstanding size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Here we report a sudden, yet smooth change in its apparent nature. Time-series photometry and subsequent spectroscopy revealed the most extreme transition ever seen in the optical spectral features of a RSG. We discovered that WOH G64 is a rare, massive symbiotic binary system where the RSG transitioned to a Yellow Hypergiant. The dramatic transition can be explained either by the partial ejection of the pseudo-atmosphere during a common-envelope phase, or the return to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years. WOH G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time and assess the role of binarity on the final phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative model that uses physical quantities to generate and retrieve solar magnetic active regions</title>

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown immense potential in generating unseen data that has properties of real data. These models learn complex data-generating distributions starting from a smaller set of latent dimensions. However, generative models have encountered great skepticism in scientific domains due to the disconnection between generative latent vectors and scientifically relevant quantities. In this study, we integrate three types of machine learning models to generate solar magnetic patches in a physically interpretable manner and use those as a query to find matching patches in real observations. We use the magnetic field measurements from Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs) to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We connect the physical properties of GAN-generated images with their latent vectors to train Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that do mapping between physical and latent spaces. These produce directions in the GAN latent space along which known physical parameters of the SHARPs change. We train a self-supervised learner (SSL) to make queries with generated images and find matches from real data. We find that the GAN-SVM combination enables users to produce high-quality patches that change smoothly only with a prescribed physical quantity, making generative models physically interpretable. We also show that GAN outputs can be used to retrieve real data that shares the same physical properties as the generated query. This elevates Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a means-to-produce artificial data to a novel tool for scientific data interrogation, supporting its applicability beyond the domain of heliophysics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Effects of Parameters in Widespread SEP Events with EPREM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located $\geq 90^\circ$ from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.</description>

      <title>Rethinking mass transfer: a unified semianalytical framework for circular and eccentric binaries. II. Orbital evolution due to nonconservative mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although mass transfer (MT) has been studied primarily in circular binaries, observations show that it also occurs in eccentric systems. We investigate orbital evolution during nonconservative MT in eccentric orbits, a process especially relevant for binaries containing compact objects (COs). We examined four angular momentum loss (AML) modes: Jeans, isotropic reemission, orbital-AML, and $L_2$ mass loss, with the last mode being the most efficient AML mode. For a fixed AML mode and accretion efficiency, orbital evolution is correlated: orbits either widen while becoming more eccentric, or shrink while circularizing. Jeans mode generally yields orbital widening and eccentricity pumping, whereas $L_2$ mass loss typically leads to orbital shrinkage and eccentricity damping. Isotropic reemission and orbital-AML show an intermediate behavior. Adopting isotropic reemission, we demonstrate that eccentric MT produces compact binaries that merge via gravitational waves (GW) within a Hubble time, whereas the same systems would instead merge during MT under traditional modeling. We further show that, in eccentric orbits, the gravitational potential at $L_2$ becomes lower than at $L_1$ across a wide range of mass ratios and eccentricities, naturally linking eccentricity to $L_2$ mass loss. Eccentric MT may therefore lead to the formation of the circumbinary disks observed around eccentric post-red-giant-branch and post-asymptotic-giant-branch systems. Since interacting binaries containing COs are frequently eccentric, $L_2$ mass loss offers a new robust pathway to orbital tightening during eccentric MT, contributing to the formation rate of GW sources. This model can treat orbital evolution due to conservative and nonconservative MT in arbitrary eccentricities, with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to GW progenitors.</description>

      <title>Fast and Fewrious: Stochastic binary perturbations from fast compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive compact objects soften binaries. This process has been used for decades to constrain the population of such objects, particularly as a component of dark matter (DM). The effects of light compact objects, such as those in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected. In principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening them, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber velocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical for DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate induced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to zero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in the regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few fast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are measured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the constraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System. This opens a new class of dynamical probes with potential applications to asteroid-mass DM candidates.</description>
