      <title>Specifying and Verifying the Convergence Stairs of the Collatz Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithmic method that, given a positive integer $j$, generates the $j$-th convergence stair containing all natural numbers from where the Collatz conjecture holds by exactly $j$ applications of the Collatz function. To this end, we present a novel formulation of the Collatz conjecture as a concurrent program, and provide the general case specification of the $j$-th convergence stair for any $j &gt; 0$. The proposed specifications provide a layered and linearized orientation of Collatz numbers organized in an infinite set of infinite binary trees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a general specification is provided, which can have significant applications in analyzing and testing the behaviors of complex non-linear systems. We have implemented this method as a software tool that generates the Collatz numbers of individual stairs. We also show that starting from any value in any convergence stair the conjecture holds. However, to prove the conjecture, one has to show that every natural number will appear in some stair; i.e., the union of all stairs is equal to the set of natural numbers, which remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Extremal Chemical Graphs for the Arithmetic-Geometric Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The arithmetic-geometric index is a newly proposed degree-based graph invariant in mathematical chemistry. We give a sharp upper bound on the value of this invariant for connected chemical graphs of given order and size and characterize the connected chemical graphs that reach the bound. We also prove that the removal of the constraint that extremal chemical graphs must be connected does not allow to increase the upper bound.</description>

      <title>Maximal Non-Kochen-Specker Sets and a Lower Bound on the Size of Kochen-Specker Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Kochen-Specker (KS) set is a finite collection of vectors on the two-sphere containing no antipodal pairs for which it is impossible to assign 0s and 1s such that no two orthogonal vectors are assigned 1 and exactly one vector in every triplet of mutually orthogonal vectors is assigned 1. The existence of KS sets lies at the heart of Kochen and Specker's argument against non-contextual hidden variable theories and the Conway-Kochen free will theorem. Identifying small KS sets can simplify these arguments and may contribute to the understanding of the role played by contextuality in quantum protocols. In this paper we derive a weak lower bound of 10 vectors for the size of any KS set by studying the opposite notion of large non-KS sets and using a probability argument that is independent of the graph structure of KS sets. We also point out an interesting connection with a generalisation of the moving sofa problem around a right-angled hallway on the two-sphere.</description>

      <title>Path eccentricity of $k$-AT-free graphs and application on graphs with the consecutive ones property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central path problem is a variation on the single facility location problem. The aim is to find, in a given connected graph $G$, a path $P$ minimizing its eccentricity, which is the maximal distance from $P$ to any vertex of the graph $G$. The path eccentricity of $G$ is the minimal eccentricity achievable over all paths in $G$. In this article we consider the path eccentricity of the class of the $k$-AT-free graphs. They are graphs in which any set of three vertices contains a pair for which every path between them uses at least one vertex of the closed neighborhood at distance $k$ of the third. We prove that they have path eccentricity bounded by $k$.
  Moreover, we answer a question of G\'omez and Guti\'errez asking if there is a relation between path eccentricity and the consecutive ones property. The latter is the property for a binary matrix to admit a permutation of the rows placing the 1's consecutively on the columns. It was already known that graphs whose adjacency matrices have the consecutive ones property have path eccentricity at most 1, and that the same remains true when the augmented adjacency matrices (with ones on the diagonal) has the consecutive ones property. We generalize these results as follow. We study graphs whose adjacency matrices can be made to satisfy the consecutive ones property after changing some values on the diagonal, and show that those graphs have path eccentricity at most 2, by showing that they are 2-AT-free.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Critical Dispersion on Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time.
  In this work we study the case where $G$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices and the number of particles is $M=n/2+\alpha n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2})$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$. This choice of $M$ corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by $n^{-1/2}$, converges in $p$-th mean, as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and for any $p \in \mathbb{R}$, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable $T_\alpha$. We find that $T_\alpha$ is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that $\mathbb{E}[T_0] = \pi^{3/2}/\sqrt{7}$, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when $|\alpha|$ gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the random variable counting the total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached and prove that, if rescaled by $n\ln n$, it converges to $2/7$ in probability.</description>

      <title>On balanceable and simply balanceable regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of balanceable graphs, defined by Caro, Hansberg, and Montejano in 2021 as graphs $G$ such that any $2$-coloring of the edges of a sufficiently large complete graph containing sufficiently many edges of each color contains a balanced copy of $G$. While the problem of recognizing balanceable graphs was conjectured to be NP-complete by Dailly, Hansberg, and Ventura in 2021, balanceable graphs admit an elegant combinatorial characterization: a graph is balanceable if and only there exist two vertex subsets, one containing half of all the graph's edges and another one such that the corresponding cut contains half of all the graph's edges. We consider a special case of this property, namely when one of the two sets is a vertex cover, and call the corresponding graphs simply balanceable. We prove a number of results on balanceable and simply balanceable regular graphs. First, we characterize simply balanceable regular graphs via a condition involving the independence number of the graph. Second, we address a question of Dailly, Hansberg, and Ventura from 2021 and show that every cubic graph is balanceable. Third, using Brooks' theorem, we show that every $4$-regular graph with order divisible by $4$ is balanceable. Finally, we show that it is NP-complete to determine if a $9$-regular graph is simply balanceable.</description>

      <title>The average size of maximal matchings in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ratio $\avM(G)$ of the average size of a maximal matching to the size of a maximum matching in a graph $G$. If many maximal matchings have a size close to $\maxM(G)$, this graph invariant has a value close to 1. Conversely, if many maximal matchings have a small size, $\avM(G)$ approaches $\frac{1}{2}$.
  We propose a general technique to determine the asymptotic behavior of $\avM(G)$ for various classes of graphs. To illustrate the use of this technique, we first show how it makes it possible to find known asymptotic values of $\avM(G)$ which were typically obtained using generating functions, and we then determine the asymptotic value of $\avM(G)$ for other families of graphs, highlighting the spectrum of possible values of this graph invariant between $\frac{1}{2}$ and $1$.</description>
