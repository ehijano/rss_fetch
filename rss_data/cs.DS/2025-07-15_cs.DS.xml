      <title>A Fixed Parameter Tractable Approach for Solving the Vertex Cover Problem in Polynomial Time Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minimum Vertex Cover problem, a classical NP-complete problem, presents significant challenges for exact solution on large graphs. Fixed-Parameter Tractability (FPT) offers a powerful paradigm to address such problems by exploiting a parameter of the input, typically related to the size of the desired solution. This paper presents an implementation and empirical evaluation of an FPT algorithm for the Minimum Vertex Cover problem parameterized by the size of the vertex cover, $k$. The algorithm utilizes a branching strategy based on selecting adjacent vertices and recursively solving subproblems on a reduced graph. We describe the algorithmic approach, implementation details in Python, and present experimental results comparing its performance against the SageMath computational system. The results demonstrate that the FPT implementation achieves significant performance improvements for instances with large numbers of vertices ($n$) but relatively small values of the parameter ($k$), aligning with theoretical FPT complexity guarantees. We also discuss potential optimizations that could further improve the algorithm's performance, particularly concerning the branching factor.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Network Design with Restricted Link Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a digraph with two terminal vertices $s$ and $t$ as well as a conservative cost function and several not necessarily disjoint color classes on its arc set, our goal is to find a minimum-cost subset of the arcs such that its intersection with each color class contains an $s$-$t$ dipath. Problems of this type arise naturally in multi-commodity network design settings where each commodity is restricted to use links of its own color only.
  We study several variants of the problem, deriving strong hardness results even for restricted cases, but we also identify cases that can be solved in polynomial time. The latter ones include the cases where the color classes form a laminar family, or where the underlying digraph is acyclic and the number of color classes is constant. We also present an FPT algorithm for the general case parameterized by the number of multi-colored arcs.</description>

      <title>Nearly Tight Sample Complexity for Matroid Online Contention Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their numerous applications, in particular in Mechanism Design, Prophet Inequalities have experienced a surge of interest. They describe competitive ratios for basic stopping time problems where random variables get revealed sequentially. A key drawback in the classical setting is the assumption of full distributional knowledge of the involved random variables, which is often unrealistic. A natural way to address this is via sample-based approaches, where only a limited number of samples from the distribution of each random variable is available. Recently, Fu, Lu, Gavin Tang, Wu, Wu, and Zhang (2024) showed that sample-based Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS) are a powerful tool to obtain sample-based Prophet Inequalities. They presented the first sample-based OCRS for matroid constraints, which is a heavily studied constraint family in this context, as it captures many interesting settings. This allowed them to get the first sample-based Matroid Prophet Inequality, using $O(\log^4 n)$ many samples (per random variable), where $n$ is the number of random variables, while obtaining a constant competitiveness of $\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon$.
  We present a nearly optimal sample-based OCRS for matroid constraints, which uses only $O(\log \rho \cdot \log^2\log\rho)$ many samples, almost matching a known lower bound of $\Omega(\log \rho)$, where $\rho \leq n$ is the rank of the matroid. Through the above-mentioned connection to Prophet Inequalities, this yields a sample-based Matroid Prophet Inequality using only $O(\log n + \log\rho \cdot \log^2\log\rho)$ many samples, and matching the competitiveness of $\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon$, which is the best known competitiveness for the considered almighty adversary setting even when the distributions are fully known.</description>

      <title>Paths and Intersections: Exact Emulators for Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study vertex sparsification for preserving distances in planar graphs. Given an edge-weighted planar graph with $k$ terminals, the goal is to construct an emulator, which is a smaller edge-weighted planar graph that contains the terminals and exactly preserves the pairwise distances between them. We construct exact planar emulators of size $O(f^2k^2)$ in the setting where terminals lie on $f$ faces in the planar embedding of the input graph. Our result generalizes and interpolates between the previous results of Chang and Ophelders and Goranci, Henzinger, and Peng which is an $O(k^2)$ bound in the setting where all terminals lie on a single face (i.e., $f=1$), and the result of Krauthgamer, Nguyen, and Zondiner, which is an $O(k^4)$ bound for the general case (i.e., $f=k$).
  Our construction follows a recent new way of analyzing graph structures, by viewing graphs as paths and their intersections, which we believe is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Peak-Cost Flows Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When planning transportation whose operation requires non-consumable resources, the peak demand for allocated resources is often of higher interest than the duration of resource usage. For instance, it is more cost-effective to deliver parcels with a single truck over eight hours than to use two trucks for four hours, as long as the time suffices. To model such scenarios, we introduce the novel minimum peak cost flow over time problem, whose objective is to minimise the maximum cost at all points in time rather than minimising the integral of costs. We focus on minimising peak costs of temporally repeated flows. These are desirable for practical applications due to their simple structure. This yields the minimum-peak-cost Temporally Repeated flow problem (MPC-TRF).
  We show that the simple structure of temporally repeated flows comes with the drawback of arbitrarily bad approximation ratios compared to general flows over time. Furthermore, our complexity analysis shows the integral version of MPC-TRF is strongly NP-hard, even under strong restrictions. On the positive side, we identify two benign special cases: unit-cost series-parallel networks and networks with time horizon at least twice as long as the longest path in the network (with respect to the transit time). In both cases, we show that integral optimal flows if the desired flow value equals the maximum flow value and fractional optimal flows for arbitrary flow values can be found in polynomial time. For each of these cases, we provide an explicit algorithm that constructs an optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matrix scaling problem, particularly the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, has been studied for over 60 years. In practice, the algorithm often yields high-quality approximations within just a few iterations. Theoretically, however, the best-known upper bound places it in the class of pseudopolynomial-time approximation algorithms. Meanwhile, the lower-bound landscape remains largely unexplored. Two fundamental questions persist: what accounts for the algorithm's strong empirical performance, and can a tight bound on its iteration count be established?
  For an $n\times n$ matrix, its normalized version is obtained by dividing each entry by its largest entry. We say that a normalized matrix has a density $\gamma$ if there exists a constant $\rho &gt; 0$ such that one row or column has exactly $\lceil \gamma n \rceil$ entries with values at least $\rho$, and every other row and column has at least $\lceil \gamma n \rceil$ such entries.
  For the upper bound, we show that the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm produces a nearly doubly stochastic matrix in $O(\log n - \log \varepsilon)$ iterations and $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ time for all nonnegative square matrices whose normalized version has a density $\gamma &gt; 1/2$. Such matrices cover both the algorithm's principal practical inputs and its typical theoretical regime, and the $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ runtime is optimal.
  For the lower bound, we establish a tight bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(n^{1/2}/\varepsilon\right)$ iterations for positive matrices under the $\ell_2$-norm error measure. Moreover, for every $\gamma &lt; 1/2$, there exists a matrix with density $\gamma$ for which the algorithm requires $\Omega\left(n^{1/2}/\varepsilon\right)$ iterations.
  In summary, our results reveal a sharp phase transition in the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm at the density threshold $\gamma = 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Improved Directed Expander Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain faster expander decomposition algorithms for directed graphs, matching the guarantees of Saranurak and Wang (SODA 2019) for expander decomposition on undirected graphs. Our algorithms are faster than prior work and also generalize almost losslessly to capacitated graphs. In particular, we obtain the first directed expander decomposition algorithm for capacitated graphs in near-linear time with optimal dependence on $\phi$.
  To obtain our result, we provide the first implementation and analysis of the non-stop cut-matching game for directed, capacitated graphs. All existing directed expander decomposition algorithms instead temporarily add ''fake edges'' before pruning them away in a final cleanup step. Our result shows that the natural undirected approach applies even to directed graphs. The difficulty is in its analysis, which is technical and requires significant modifications from the original setting of undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>Covering a Few Submodular Constraints and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of covering multiple submodular constraints. Given a finite ground set $N$, a cost function $c: N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, $r$ monotone submodular functions $f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_r$ over $N$ and requirements $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_r$ the goal is to find a minimum cost subset $S \subseteq N$ such that $f_i(S) \ge b_i$ for $1 \le i \le r$. When $r=1$ this is the well-known Submodular Set Cover problem. Previous work \cite{chekuri2022covering} considered the setting when $r$ is large and developed bi-criteria approximation algorithms, and approximation algorithms for the important special case when each $f_i$ is a weighted coverage function. These are fairly general models and capture several concrete and interesting problems as special cases. The approximation ratios for these problem are at least $\Omega(\log r)$ which is unavoidable when $r$ is part of the input. In this paper, motivated by some recent applications, we consider the problem when $r$ is a \emph{fixed constant} and obtain two main results. For covering multiple submodular constraints we obtain a randomized bi-criteria approximation algorithm that for any given integer $\alpha \ge 1$ outputs a set $S$ such that $f_i(S) \ge$ $(1-1/e^\alpha -\epsilon)b_i$ for each $i \in [r]$ and $\mathbb{E}[c(S)] \le (1+\epsilon)\alpha \cdot \sf{OPT}$. Second, when the $f_i$ are weighted coverage functions from a deletion-closed set system we obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$ $(\frac{e}{e-1})$ $(1+\beta)$-approximation where $\beta$ is the approximation ratio for the underlying set cover instances via the natural LP. These results show that one can obtain nearly as good an approximation for any fixed $r$ as what one would achieve for $r=1$. We mention some applications that follow easily from these general results and anticipate more in the future.</description>

      <title>Improved bicriteria approximation for $k$-edge-connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $k$-Edge Connected Spanning Subgraph ($k$-ECSS) problem we are given a (multi-)graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge costs and an integer $k$, and seek a min-cost $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph of $G$. The problem admits a $2$-approximation algorithm and no better approximation ratio is known.Hershkowitz, Klein, and Zenklusen [STOC 24] gave a bicriteria $(1,k-10)$-approximation algorithm that computes a $(k-10)$-edge-connected spanning subgraph of cost at most the optimal value of a standard Cut-LP for $k$-ECSS. This LP bicriteria approximation was recently improved by Cohen and Nutov [ESA 25] to $(1,k-4)$, where also was given a bicriteria approximation $(3/2,k-2)$. In this paper we improve the bicriteria approximation to $(1,k-2)$ for $k$ even and to $\left(1-\frac{1}{k},k-3\right)$ for $k$ is odd, and also give another bicriteria approximation $(3/2,k-1)$.
  The $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Multi-subgraph ($k$-ECSM) problem is almost the same as $k$-ECSS, except that any edge can be selected multiple times at the same cost. The previous best approximation ratio for $k$-ECSM was $1+4/k$. Our result improves this to $1+\frac{2}{k}$ for $k$ even and to $1+\frac{3}{k}$ for $k$ odd, where for $k$ odd the computed subgraph is in fact $(k+1)$-edge-connected.</description>

      <title>Bicriteria Submodular Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submodular functions and their optimization have found applications in diverse settings ranging from machine learning and data mining to game theory and economics. In this work, we consider the constrained maximization of a submodular function, for which we conduct a principled study of bicriteria approximation algorithms -- algorithms which can violate the constraint, but only up to a bounded factor. Bicrteria optimization allows constrained submodular maximization to capture additional important settings, such as the well-studied submodular cover problem and optimization under soft constraints. We provide results that span both multiple types of constraints (cardinality, knapsack, matroid and convex set) and multiple classes of submodular functions (monotone, symmetric and general). For many of the cases considered, we provide optimal results. In other cases, our results improve over the state-of-the-art, sometimes even over the state-of-the-art for the special case of single-criterion (standard) optimization. Results of the last kind demonstrate that relaxing the feasibility constraint may give a perspective about the problem that is useful even if one only desires feasible solutions.</description>

      <title>Approximating Maximum Cut on Interval Graphs and Split Graphs beyond Goemans-Williamson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a polynomial-time $(\alpha_{GW} + \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the Maximum Cut problem on interval graphs and split graphs, where $\alpha_{GW} \approx 0.878$ is the approximation guarantee of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm and $\varepsilon &gt; 10^{-34}$ is a fixed constant. To attain this, we give an improved analysis of a slight modification of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm for graphs in which triangles can be packed into a constant fraction of their edges. We then pair this analysis with structural results showing that both interval graphs and split graphs either have such a triangle packing or have maximum cut close to their number of edges. We also show that, subject to the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, there exists a constant $c &gt; 0$ such that there is no polyomial-time $(1 - c)$-approximation for Maximum Cut on split graphs.</description>

      <title>Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although resource allocation is a well studied problem in computer science, until the prevalence of distributed systems, such as computing clouds and data centres, the question had been addressed predominantly for single resource type scenarios. At the beginning of the last decade, with the introuction of Dominant Resource Fairness, the studies of the resource allocation problem has finally extended to the multiple resource type scenarios. Dominant Resource Fairness is a solution, addressing the problem of fair allocation of multiple resource types, among users with heterogeneous demands. Based on Max-min Fairness, which is a well established algorithm in the literature for allocating resources in the single resource type scenarios, Dominant Resource Fairness generalises the scheme to the multiple resource case. It has a number of desirable properties that makes it preferable over alternatives, such as Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, Pareto Efficiency, and Strategy Proofness, and as such, it is widely adopted in distributed systems. In the present study, we revisit the original study, and analyse the structure of the algorithm in closer view, to come up with an alternative algorithm, which approximates the Dominant Resource Fairness allocation in fewer steps. We name the new algorithm Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness, after its main working principle.</description>

      <title>Explicit Bounds and Parallel Algorithms for Counting Multiply Gleeful Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k\ge 1$ be an integer. A positive integer $n$ is $k$-\textit{gleeful} if $n$ can be represented as the sum of $k$th powers of consecutive primes. For example, $35=2^3+3^3$ is a $3$-gleeful number, and $195=5^2+7^2+11^2$ is $2$-gleeful. In this paper, we present some new results on $k$-gleeful numbers for $k&gt;1$.
  First, we extend previous analytical work. For given values of $x$ and $k$, we give explicit upper and lower bounds on the number of $k$-gleeful representations of integers $n\le x$.
  Second, we describe and analyze two new, efficient parallel algorithms, one theoretical and one practical, to generate all $k$-gleeful representations up to a bound $x$.
  Third, we study integers that are multiply gleeful, that is, integers with more than one representation as a sum of powers of consecutive primes, including both the same or different values of $k$. We give a simple heuristic model for estimating the density of multiply-gleeful numbers, we present empirical data in support of our heuristics, and offer some new conjectures.</description>

Abstract: We study the m-Eternal Domination problem, which is the following two-player game between a defender and an attacker on a graph: initially, the defender positions k guards on vertices of the graph; the game then proceeds in turns between the defender and the attacker, with the attacker selecting a vertex and the defender responding to the attack by moving a guard to the attacked vertex. The defender may move more than one guard on their turn, but guards can only move to neighboring vertices. The defender wins a game on a graph G with k guards if the defender has a strategy such that at every point of the game the vertices occupied by guards form a dominating set of G and the attacker wins otherwise. The m-eternal domination number of a graph G is the smallest value of k for which (G,k) is a defender win.
  We show that m-Eternal Domination is NP-hard, as well as some of its variants, even on special classes of graphs. We also show structural results for the Domination and m-Eternal Domination problems in the context of four types of infinite regular grids: square, octagonal, hexagonal, and triangular, establishing tight bounds.</description>

      <title>Average Sensitivity of Hierarchical $k$-Median Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for unsupervised learning with numerous applications. However, in the application of modern algorithms, the datasets studied are usually large and dynamic. If the hierarchical clustering is sensitive to small perturbations of the dataset, the usability of the algorithm will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we focus on the hierarchical $k$ -median clustering problem, which bridges hierarchical and centroid-based clustering while offering theoretical appeal, practical utility, and improved interpretability. We analyze the average sensitivity of algorithms for this problem by measuring the expected change in the output when a random data point is deleted. We propose an efficient algorithm for hierarchical $k$-median clustering and theoretically prove its low average sensitivity and high clustering quality. Additionally, we show that single linkage clustering and a deterministic variant of the CLNSS algorithm exhibit high average sensitivity, making them less stable. Finally, we validate the robustness and effectiveness of our algorithm through experiments.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega_1, \ldots, \Omega_m$ be probability spaces, let $\Omega=\Omega_1 \times \cdots \times \Omega_m$ be their product and let $A_1, \ldots, A_n \subset \Omega$ be events. Suppose that each event $A_i$ depends on $r_i$ coordinates of a point $x \in \Omega$, $x=\left(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m\right)$, and that for each event $A_i$ there are $\Delta_i$ of other events $A_j$ that depend on some of the coordinates that $A_i$ depends on. Let $\Delta=\max\{5,\ \Delta_i: i=1, \ldots, n\}$ and let $\mu_i=\min\{r_i,\ \Delta_i+1\}$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. We prove that if $P(A_i) &lt; (3\Delta)^{-3\mu_i}$ for all $I$, then for any $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$, the probability $P\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A}_i\right)$ of the intersection of the complements of all $A_i$ can be computed within relative error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time from the probabilities $P\left(A_{i_1} \cap \ldots \cap A_{i_k}\right)$ of $k$-wise intersections of the events $A_i$ for $k = e^{O(\Delta)} \ln (n/\epsilon)$.</description>

      <title>Colorful Minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of colorful minors, which generalizes the classical concept of rooted minors in graphs. $q$-colorful graph is defined as a pair $(G, \chi),$ where $G$ is a graph and $\chi$ assigns to each vertex a (possibly empty) subset of at most $q$ colors. The colorful minor relation enhances the classical minor relation by merging color sets at contracted edges and allowing the removal of colors from vertices. This framework naturally models algorithmic problems involving graphs with (possibly overlapping) annotated vertex sets. We develop a structural theory for colorful minors by establishing several theorems characterizing $\mathcal{H}$-colorful minor-free graphs, where $\mathcal{H}$ consists either of a clique or a grid with all vertices assigned all colors, or of grids with colors segregated and ordered on the outer face. Leveraging our structural insights, we provide a complete classification - parameterized by the number $q$ of colors - of all colorful graphs that exhibit the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property with respect to colorful minors. On the algorithmic side, we provide a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for colorful minor testing and a variant of the $k$-disjoint paths problem. Together with the fact that the colorful minor relation forms a well-quasi-order, this implies that every colorful minor-monotone parameter on colorful graphs admits a fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, we derive two algorithmic meta-theorems (AMTs) whose structural conditions are linked to extensions of treewidth and Hadwiger number on colorful graphs. Our results suggest how known AMTs can be extended to incorporate not only the structure of the input graph but also the way the colored vertices are distributed in it.</description>

      <title>Correlation Clustering Beyond the Pivot Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classic correlation clustering in the dynamic setting. Given $n$ objects and a complete labeling of the object-pairs as either similar or dissimilar, the goal is to partition the objects into arbitrarily many clusters while minimizing disagreements with the labels. In the dynamic setting, an update consists of a flip of a label of an edge. In a breakthrough result, [BDHSS, FOCS'19] showed how to maintain a 3-approximation with polylogarithmic update time by providing a dynamic implementation of the Pivot algorithm of [ACN, STOC'05]. Since then, it has been a major open problem to determine whether the 3-approximation barrier can be broken in the fully dynamic setting. In this paper, we resolve this problem. Our algorithm, Modified Pivot, locally improves the output of Pivot by moving some vertices to other existing clusters or new singleton clusters. We present an analysis showing that this modification does indeed improve the approximation to below 3. We also show that its output can be maintained in polylogarithmic time per update.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Augmented Mechanism Design for Weighted Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Facility location is fundamental in operations research, mechanism design, and algorithmic game theory, with applications ranging from urban infrastructure planning to distributed systems. Recent research in this area has focused on augmenting classic strategyproof mechanisms with predictions to achieve an improved performance guarantee against the uncertainty under the strategic environment. Previous work has been devoted to address the trade-off obstacle of balancing the consistency (near-optimality under accurate predictions) and robustness (bounded inefficiency under poor predictions) primarily in the unweighted setting, assuming that all agents have the same importance. However, this assumption may not be true in some practical scenarios, leading to research of weighted facility location problems.
  The major contribution of the current work is to provide a prediction augmented algorithmic framework for balancing the consistency and robustness over strategic agents with non-uniform weights. In particular, through a reduction technique that identifies a subset of representative instances and maps the other given locations to the representative ones, we prove that there exists a strategyproof mechanism achieving a bounded consistency guarantee of $\frac{\sqrt{(1+c)^2W^2_{\min}+(1-c)^2W^2_{\max}}}{(1+c)W_{\min}}$ and a bounded robustness guarantee of $\frac{\sqrt{(1-c)^2W^2_{\min}+(1+c)^2W^2_{\max}}}{(1-c)W_{\min}}$ in weighted settings, where $c$ can be viewed as a parameter to make a trade-off between the consistency and robustness and $W_{\min}$ and $W_{\max}$ denote the minimum and maximum agents' weight. We also prove that there is no strategyproof deterministic mechanism that reach $1$-consistency and $O\left( n \cdot \frac{W_{\max}}{W_{\min}} \right)$-robustness in weighted FLP, even with fully predictions of all agents.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of eigencomputations for polynomial optimization on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a convergent hierarchy of lower bounds on the minimum value of a real form over the unit sphere. The main practical advantage of our hierarchy over the real sum-of-squares (RSOS) hierarchy is that the lower bound at each level of our hierarchy is obtained by a minimum eigenvalue computation, as opposed to the full semidefinite program (SDP) required at each level of RSOS. In practice, this allows us to compute bounds on much larger forms than are computationally feasible for RSOS. Our hierarchy outperforms previous alternatives to RSOS, both asymptotically and in numerical experiments. We obtain our hierarchy by proving a reduction from real optimization on the sphere to Hermitian optimization on the sphere, and invoking the Hermitian sum-of-squares (HSOS) hierarchy. This opens the door to using other Hermitian optimization techniques for real optimization, and gives a path towards developing spectral hierarchies for more general constrained real optimization problems. To this end, we use our techniques to develop a hierarchy of eigencomputations for computing the real tensor spectral norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a multiagent setting. To this goal, we introduce a multiagent version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no extra cost.
  We investigate the effect of using predictors for self and others' behavior in such a setting, as well as the new equilibria formed in this way.</description>

      <title>PREAMBLE: Private and Efficient Aggregation via Block Sparse Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of secure aggregation of high-dimensional vectors in a two-server system such as Prio. These systems are typically used to aggregate vectors such as gradients in private federated learning, where the aggregate itself is protected via noise addition to ensure differential privacy. Existing approaches require communication scaling with the dimensionality, and thus limit the dimensionality of vectors one can efficiently process in this setup.
  We propose PREAMBLE: {\bf Pr}ivate {\bf E}fficient {\bf A}ggregation {\bf M}echanism via {\bf BL}ock-sparse {\bf E}uclidean Vectors. PREAMBLE builds on an extension of distributed point functions that enables communication- and computation-efficient aggregation of {\em block-sparse vectors}, which are sparse vectors where the non-zero entries occur in a small number of clusters of consecutive coordinates. We show that these block-sparse DPFs can be combined with random sampling and privacy amplification by sampling results, to allow asymptotically optimal privacy-utility trade-offs for vector aggregation, at a fraction of the communication cost. When coupled with recent advances in numerical privacy accounting, our approach incurs a negligible overhead in noise variance, compared to the Gaussian mechanism used with Prio.</description>

      <title>New Statistical and Computational Results for Learning Junta Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning junta distributions on $\{0, 1\}^n$, where a distribution is a $k$-junta if its probability mass function depends on a subset of at most $k$ variables. We make two main contributions:
  - We show that learning $k$-junta distributions is \emph{computationally} equivalent to learning $k$-parity functions with noise (LPN), a landmark problem in computational learning theory.
  - We design an algorithm for learning junta distributions whose statistical complexity is optimal, up to polylogarithmic factors. Computationally, our algorithm matches the complexity of previous (non-sample-optimal) algorithms.
  Combined, our two contributions imply that our algorithm cannot be significantly improved, statistically or computationally, barring a breakthrough for LPN.</description>
