      <title>Transit Rider Heat Stress in Atlanta, GA under Current and Future Climate Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transit is a crucial mode of transportation, especially in urban areas and for urban and rural disadvantaged communities. Because extreme temperatures often pose threats to the elderly, members of the disability community, and other vulnerable populations, this study seeks to understand the level of influence that extreme temperatures may have on transit users across different demographic groups. In this case study for Atlanta, GA, heat stress is predicted for 2019 transit riders (using transit rider activity survey data) and for three future climate scenarios, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585, into the year 2100. The HeatPath Analyzer and TransitSim 4.0 models were applied to predict cumulative heat exposure and trip-level risk for 35,999 trip equivalents for an average Atlanta area weekday in the summer of 2019. The analyses show that under 2019 weather conditions, 8.33% of summer trips were estimated to be conducted under extreme heat. With the projected future climate conditions, the percentage of trips under extreme heat risk grows steadily. By 2100, 37.1%, 56.1%, and 76.4% are projected to be under extreme heat risk for scenarios SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585, respectively. Under current weather conditions, Atlanta transit riders that own no vehicles and transit riders that are African American are disproportionately influenced by extreme heat. The disparity between these two groups and other groups of transit riders becomes wider as climate change continues to exacerbate. The findings of the study highlight an urgent need to implement heat mitigation and adaptation strategies in urban transit networks.</description>

      <title>More than 'Left and Right': Revealing Multilevel Online Political Selective Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective exposure, individuals' inclination to seek out information that supports their beliefs while avoiding information that contradicts them, plays an important role in the emergence of polarization. In the political domain, selective exposure is usually measured on a left-right ideology scale, ignoring finer details. Here, we combine survey and Twitter data collected during the 2022 Brazilian Presidential Election and investigate selective exposure patterns between the survey respondents and political influencers. We analyze the followship network between survey respondents and political influencers and find a multilevel community structure that reveals a hierarchical organization more complex than a simple split between left and right. Moreover, depending on the level we consider, we find different associations between network indices of exposure patterns and 189 individual attributes of the survey respondents. For example, at finer levels, the number of influencer communities a survey respondent follows is associated with several factors, such as demographics, news consumption frequency, and incivility perception. In comparison, only their political ideology is a significant factor at coarser levels. Our work demonstrates that measuring selective exposure at a single level, such as left and right, misses important information necessary to capture this phenomenon correctly.</description>

      <title>The Wasserstein Bipolarization Index: A New Measure of Public Opinion Polarization, with an Application to Cross-Country Attitudes toward COVID-19 Vaccination Mandates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the topic of opinion polarization receives much attention from the media, public opinion researchers and political scientists, the phenomenon itself has not been adequately characterized in either the lay or academic literature. To study opinion polarization among the public, researchers compare the distributions of respondents to survey questions or track the distribution of responses to a question over time using ad-hoc methods and measures such as visual comparisons, variances, and bimodality coefficients. To remedy this situation, we build on the axiomatic approach in the economics literature on income bipolarization, specifying key properties a measure of bipolarization should satisfy: in particular, it should increase as the distribution spreads away from a center toward the poles and/or as clustering below or above this center increases. We then show that measures of bipolarization used in public opinion research fail to satisfy one or more of these axioms. Next, we propose a $p$-Wasserstein polarization index that satisfies the axioms we set forth. Our index measures the dissimilarity between an observed distribution and a distribution with all the mass clustered on the lower and upper endpoints of the scale. We use our index to examine bipolarization in attitudes toward governmental COVID-19 vaccine mandates across 11 countries, finding the U.S and U.K are most polarized, China, France and India the least polarized, while the others (Brazil, Australia, Colombia, Canada, Italy, Spain) occupy an intermediate position.</description>

      <title>When does the mean network capture the topology of a sample of networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of Fr\'echet mean (also known as "barycenter") network is the workhorse of most machine learning algorithms that require the estimation of a "location" parameter to analyse network-valued data. In this context, it is critical that the network barycenter inherits the topological structure of the networks in the training dataset. The metric - which measures the proximity between networks - controls the structural properties of the barycenter. This work is significant because it provides for the first time analytical estimates of the sample Fr\'echet mean for the stochastic blockmodel, which is at the cutting edge of rigorous probabilistic analysis of random networks. We show that the mean network computed with the Hamming distance is unable to capture the topology of the networks in the training sample, whereas the mean network computed using the effective resistance distance recovers the correct partitions and associated edge density. From a practical standpoint, our work informs the choice of metrics in the context where the sample Fr\'echet mean network is used to characterise the topology of networks for network-valued machine learning</description>

      <title>Role Identification based Method for Cyberbullying Analysis in Social Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, many efforts have been dedicated to studying cyberbullying in social edge computing devices, and most of them focus on three roles: victims, perpetrators, and bystanders. If we want to obtain a deep insight into the formation, evolution, and intervention of cyberbullying in devices at the edge of the Internet, it is necessary to explore more fine-grained roles. This paper presents a multi-level method for role feature modeling and proposes a differential evolution-assisted K-means (DEK) method to identify diverse roles. Our work aims to provide a role identification scheme for cyberbullying scenarios for social edge computing environments to alleviate the general safety issues that cyberbullying brings. The experiments on ten real-world datasets obtained from Weibo and five public datasets show that the proposed DEK outperforms the existing approaches on the method level. After clustering, we obtained nine roles and analyzed the characteristics of each role and their evolution trends under different cyberbullying scenarios. Our work in this paper can be placed in devices at the edge of the Internet, leading to better real-time identification performance and adapting to the broad geographic location and high mobility of mobile devices.</description>

      <title>Messengers: Breaking Echo Chambers in Collective Opinion Dynamics with Homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective estimation is a variant of collective decision-making, where agents need to achieve consensus on a continuous quantity in a self-organized fashion via social interactions. A particularly challenging scenario is a fully distributed collective estimation with strongly constrained, dynamical interaction networks, for example, encountered in real physical space. Collectives face several challenges in achieving precise estimation consensus, particularly due to complex behaviors emerging from the simultaneous evolution of the agents' opinions and the interaction network.While homophilic networks may facilitate collective estimation in well-connected networks, we show that disproportionate interactions with like-minded neighbors lead to the emergence of echo chambers, preventing collective consensus. Our agent-based simulation results confirm that, besides a lack of exposure to attitude-challenging opinions, seeking reaffirming information entraps agents in echo chambers. In a potential solution, agents can break free from the pull of echo chambers. We suggest an additional state where stubborn mobile agents (called Messengers) carry data and connect the disconnected clusters by physically transporting their opinions to other clusters to inform and direct the other agents. However, an agent requires a switching mechanism to determine which state to adopt. We propose a generic, novel approach based on a Dichotomous Markov Process (DMP). We show that a wide range of collective behaviors arise from the DMP. We study a continuum between task specialization with no switching (full-time Messengers), generalization with slow switching (part-time Messengers), and rapid task switching (short-time Messengers). Our results show that stubborn agents can, in various ways, help the collective escape local minima, break the echo chambers, and promote consensus in collective opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analyzing user archetypes in Singapore's Telegram groups on COVID-19 and climate change</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media platforms, particularly Telegram, play a pivotal role in shaping public perceptions and opinions on global and national issues. Unlike traditional news media, Telegram allows for the proliferation of user-generated content with minimal oversight, making it a significant venue for the spread of controversial and misinformative content. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Telegram's popularity surged in Singapore, a country with one of the highest rates of social media use globally. We leverage Singapore-based Telegram data to analyze information flows within groups focused on COVID-19 and climate change. Using k-means clustering, we identified distinct user archetypes, including Skeptic, Engaged Advocate, Observer, and Analyst, each contributing uniquely to the discourse. We developed a model to classify users into these clusters (Precision: Climate change: 0.99; COVID-19: 0.95). By identifying these user archetypes and examining their contributions to information dissemination, we sought to uncover patterns to inform effective strategies for combating misinformation and enhancing public discourse on pressing global issues.</description>

      <title>The Face of Populism: Examining Differences in Facial Emotional Expressions of Political Leaders Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09914v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Populist rhetoric employed on online media is characterized as deeply impassioned and often imbued with strong emotions. The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the differences in affective nonverbal communication of political leaders. We use a deep-learning approach to process a sample of 220 YouTube videos of political leaders from 15 different countries, analyze their facial expressions of emotion and then examine differences in average emotion scores representing the relative presence of 6 emotional states (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and a neutral expression for each frame of the YouTube video. Based on a sample of manually coded images, we find that this deep-learning approach has 53-60\% agreement with human labels. We observe statistically significant differences in the average score of negative emotions between groups of leaders with varying degrees of populist rhetoric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01185v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this technical note we suggest a novel approach to discover temporal (related and unrelated to language dilation) and personality (authorship attribution) in historical datasets. We exemplify our approach on the State of the Union speeches given by the past 42 US presidents: this dataset is known for its relatively small amount of data, and high variability of the amount and style of texts. Nevertheless we manage to achieve about 95\% accuracy on the authorship attribution task, and pin down the date of writing to a single presidential term.</description>

      <title>Rumour Spreading Depends on the Latent Geometry and Degree Distribution in Social Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study push-pull rumour spreading in small-world models for social networks where the degrees follow a power-law. In a non-geometric setting Fountoulakis, Panagiotou and Sauerwald have shown that rumours always spread fast (SODA 2012). On the other hand, Janssen and Mehrabian have found that rumours spread slowly in a spatial preferential attachment model (SIDMA 2017). We study the question systematically for the model of geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs), which has been found to be a good theoretical and empirical fit for social networks. Our result is two-fold: with classical Euclidean geometry both slow and fast rumour spreading may occur, depending on the exponent of the power law and the prevalence of weak ties in the networks, and we fully characterise the phase boundaries between those two regimes. Depending on the parameters, fast spreading may either mean polylogarithmic time or even doubly logarithmic time. Secondly, we show that rumour spreading is always fast in a non-metric geometry. The considered non-metric geometry allows to model social connections where resemblance of vertices in a single attribute, such as familial kinship, already strongly indicates the presence of an edge. Classical Euclidean Geometry fails to capture such ties.
  For some regimes in the Euclidean setting, the efficient pathways for spreading rumours differ from previously identified paths. A vertex of degree $d$ can transmit the rumour efficiently to a vertex of larger degree by a chain of length $3$, where one of the two intermediaries has constant degree, and the other has degree $d^{c}$ for some constant $c&lt;1$.</description>
