      <title>Symmetry of random propagation on a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of influence on social networks can be modeled by the activation of vertices in a random graph model. Each edge is associated with a probability of an activated vertex activating its neighbor in each update. When the probability associated with each edge does not depend on direction, a natural question is, does this local symmetry indicate a global symmetry, i.e. the influence of any pair of vertices on each other is symmetric. We define a simple criterion to capture this global symmetry, and prove that this criterion is met with a method based on random matrices.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and Law-of-large numbers for the Volterra Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Volterra Volterra Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process on $\mathbb{R}_+$ and its stationary version. Based on a fine asymptotic analysis of the corresponding Volterra Riccati equation combined with the affine transformation formula, we first show that the finite-dimensional distributions of this process are asymptotically independent. Afterwards, we prove a law-of-large numbers in $L^p$(\Omega)$ with $p \geq 2$ and show that the stationary process is ergodic. As an application, we prove the consistency of the method of moments and study the maximum-likelihood estimation for continuous and discrete high-frequency observations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Symmetric Polynomials: A Dynamical Point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the (skew) Macdonald and Jack symmetric polynomials as the number of variables grows to infinity. We characterize their limits in terms of certain variational problems. As an intermediate step, we establish a large deviation principle for the $\theta$ analogue of non-intersecting Bernoulli random walks. When $\theta=1$, these walks are equivalent to random Lozenges tilings of strip domains, where the variational principle (with general domains and boundary conditions) has been proven in the seminal work by Cohn, Kenyon, and Propp. Our result gives a new argument of this variational principle, and also extends it to non-intersecting $\theta$-Bernoulli random walks for any $\theta \in (0,\infty)$. Remarkably, the rate functions remain identical, differing only by a factor of $1/\theta$.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sub-fractional Brownian Motion Process: Properties and Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present several path properties, simulations, inferences, and generalizations of the weighted sub-fractional Brownian motion. A primary focus is on the derivation of the covariance function $R_{f,b}(s,t)$ for the weighted sub-fractional Brownian motion, defined as: \begin{equation*} R_{f,b}(s,t) = \frac{1}{1-b} \int_{0}^{s \wedge t} f(r) \left[(s-r)^{b} + (t-r)^{b} - (t+s-2r)^{b}\right] dr, \end{equation*} where $f:\mathbb{R}_{+} \to \mathbb{R}_{+}$ is a measurable function and $b\in [0,1)\cup(1,2]$. This covariance function $R_{f,b}(s,t)$ is used to define the centered Gaussian process $\zeta_{t,f,b}$, which is the weighted sub-fractional Brownian motion. Furthermore, if there is a positive constant $c$ and $a \in (-1,\infty)$ such that $0 \leq f(u) \leq c u^{a}$ on $[0,T]$ for some $T&gt;0$. Then, for $b \in (0,1)$, $\zeta_{t,f,b}$ exhibits infinite variation and zero quadratic variation, making it a non-semi-martingale. On the other hand, for $b \in (1,2]$, $\zeta_{t,f,b}$ is a continuous process of finite variation and thus a semi-martingale and for $b=0$ the process $\zeta_{t,f,0}$ is a square integrable continuous martingale. We also provide inferential studies using maximum likelihood estimation and perform simulations comparing various numerical methods for their efficiency in computing the finite-dimensional distributions of $\zeta_{t,f,b}$. Additionally, we extend the weighted sub-fractional Brownian motion to $\mathbb{R}^d$ by defining new covariance structures for measurable, bounded sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Finally, we define a stochastic integral with respect to $\zeta_{t,f,b}$ and introduce both the weighted sub-fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the geometric weighted sub-fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Moments of traces of random symplectic matrices and hyperelliptic $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study matrix integrals of the form
$$\int_{\mathrm{USp(2n)}}\prod_{j=1}^k\mathrm{tr}(U^j)^{a_j}\mathrm d U,$$ 
where $a_1,\ldots,a_r$ are natural numbers and integration is with respect to the Haar probability measure. We obtain a compact formula (the number of terms depends only on $\sum a_j$ and not on $n,k$) for the above integral in the non-Gaussian range $\sum_{j=1}^kja_j\le 4n+1$. This extends results of Diaconis-Shahshahani and Hughes-Rudnick who obtained a formula for the integral valid in the (Gaussian) range $\sum_{j=1}^kja_j\le n$ and $\sum_{j=1}^kja_j\le 2n+1$ respectively. We derive our formula using the connection between random symplectic matrices and hyperelliptic $L$-functions over finite fields, given by an equidistribution result of Katz and Sarnak, and an evaluation of a certain multiple character sum over the function field $\mathbb F_q(x)$.  We apply our formula to study the linear statistics of eigenvalues of random unitary symplectic matrices in a narrow bandwidth sampling regime.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric exclusion process with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider asymmetric simple exclusion processes with $N$ particles on the one-dimensional discrete torus with $L$ sites with following properties: (i) nearest-neighbor jumps on the torus, (ii) the jump rates depend only on the distance to the next particle in the direction of the jump, (iii) the jump rates are independent of $N$ and $L$. For measures with a long-range two-body interaction potential that depends only on the distance between neighboring particles we prove a relation between the interaction potential and particle jump rates that is necessary and sufficient for the measure to be invariant for the process. The normalization of the measure and the stationary current are computed both for finite $L$ and $N$ and in the thermodynamic limit. For a finitely many particles that evolve on $\mathbb{Z}$ with totally asymmetric jumps it is proved, using reverse duality, that a certain family of nonstationary measures with a microscopic shock and antishock evolves into a convex combination of such measures with weights given by random walk transition probabilities. On macroscopic scale this domain random walk is a travelling wave phenomenon tantamount to phase separation with a stable shock and stable antishock. Various potential applications of this result and open questions are outlined.</description>

      <title>Approximation of birth-death processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The birth-death process is a special type of continuous-time Markov chain with index set $\mathbb{N}$. Its resolvent matrix can be fully characterized by a set of parameters $(\gamma, \beta, \nu)$, where $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are non-negative constants, and $\nu$ is a positive measure on $\mathbb{N}$. By employing the Ray-Knight compactification, the birth-death process can be realized as a c\`adl\`ag process with strong Markov property on the one-point compactification space $\overline{\mathbb{N}}_{\partial}$, which includes an additional cemetery point $\partial$. In a certain sense, the three parameters that determine the birth-death process correspond to its killing, reflecting, and jumping behaviors at $\infty$ used for the one-point compactification, respectively.
  In general, providing a clear description of the trajectories of a birth-death process, especially in the pathological case where $|\nu|=\infty$, is challenging. This paper aims to address this issue by studying the birth-death process using approximation methods. Specifically, we will approximate the birth-death process with simpler birth-death processes that are easier to comprehend. For two typical approximation methods, our main results establish the weak convergence of a sequence of probability measures, which are induced by the approximating processes, on the space of all c\`adl\`ag functions. This type of convergence is significantly stronger than the convergence of transition matrices typically considered in the theory of continuous-time Markov chains.</description>

      <title>On the expected absorption times of sticky random walks and multiple players war games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper by Bhatia, Chin, Mani, and Mossel (2024) defined stochastic processes which aim to model the game of war for two players for $n$ cards. They showed that these models are equivalent to gambler's ruin and therefore have expected termination time of $\Theta(n^2)$. In this paper, we generalize these model to any number of players $m$. We prove for the game with $m$ players is equivalent to a sticky random walk on an $m$-simplex. We show that this implies that the expected termination time is $O(n^2)$. We further provide a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\frac{n^2}{m^2}\right)$. We conjecture that when $m$ divides $n$, and $n &gt; m$ the termination time or the war game and the absorption times of the sticky random walk are in fact $\Theta(n^2)$ uniformly in $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers limit theorems associated with subgraph counts in the age-dependent random connection model. First, we identify regimes where the count of sub-trees converges weakly to a stable random variable under suitable assumptions on the shape of trees. The proof relies on an intermediate result on weak convergence of associated point processes towards a Poisson point process. Additionally, we prove the same type of results for the clique counts. Here, a crucial ingredient includes the expectation asymptotics for clique counts, which itself is a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Fluctuations for a Spatial Logistic Branching Process with Weak Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial logistic branching process is a population dynamics model in which particles move on a lattice according to independent simple symmetric random walks, each particle splits into a random number of individuals at rate one, and pairs of particles at the same location compete at rate c. We consider the weak competition regime in which c tends to zero, corresponding to a local carrying capacity tending to infinity like 1/c. We show that the hydrodynamic limit of the spatial logistic branching process is given by the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equation. We then prove that its non-equilibrium fluctuations converge to a generalised Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with deterministic but heterogeneous coefficients. The proofs rely on an adaptation of the method of v-functions developed in Boldrighini et al. 1992. An intermediate result of independent interest shows how the tail of the offspring distribution and the precise regime in which c tends to zero affect the convergence rate of the expected population size of the spatial logistic branching process to the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of asymmetric switch processes with independent switching times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymmetric switch process is a binary stochastic process that alternates between the values one and minus one, where the distribution of the time in these states may differ. In this sense, the process is asymmetric, and this paper extends previous work on symmetric switch processes. Two versions of the process are considered: a non-stationary one that starts with either the one or minus one at time zero and a stationary version constructed from the non-stationary one. Characteristics of these two processes, such as the expected values and covariance, are investigated. The main results show an equivalence between the monotonicity of the expected value functions and the distribution of the intervals having a stochastic representation in the form of a sum of random variables, where the number of terms follows a geometric distribution. This representation has a natural interpretation as a model in which switching attempts may fail at random. From these results, conditions are derived when these characteristics lead to valid interval distributions, which is vital in applications.</description>

      <title>Trend to equilibrium and Newtonian limit for the relativistic Langevin equation with singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of interacting particles in the presence of the relativistic kinetic energy, external confining potentials, singular repulsive forces as well as a random perturbation through an additive white noise. In comparison with the classical Langevin equations that are known to be exponentially attractive toward the unique statistically steady states, we find that the relativistic systems satisfy algebraic mixing rates of any order. This relies on the construction of Lyapunov functions adapting to previous literature developed for irregular potentials. We then explore the Newtonian limit as the speed of light tends to infinity and establish the validity of the approximation of the solutions by the Langevin equations on any finite time window.</description>

      <title>Variance bounds for a class of biochemical birth/death like processes via a discrete expansion and spectral properties of the Master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of birth/death like process corresponding to coupled biochemical reactions and consider the problem of quantifying the variance of the molecular species in terms of the rates of the reactions. In particular, we address this problem in a configuration where a species is formed with a rate that depends nonlinearly on another spontaneously formed species. By making use of an appropriately formulated expansion based on the Newton series, in conjunction with spectral properties of the master equation, we derive an analytical expression that provides a hard bound for the variance. We show that this bound is exact when the propensities are linear, with numerical simulations demonstrating that this bound is also very close to the actual variance. An analytical expression for the covariance of the species is also derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence of a generic tamed Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme for the kinetic type stochastic differential equations (SDEs) (also known as second order SDEs) with singular coefficients in both weak and strong probabilistic senses. We show that when the drift exhibits a relatively low regularity compared to the state of the art, the singular system is well-defined both in the weak and strong probabilistic senses. Meanwhile, the corresponding tamed EM scheme is shown to converge at the rate of 1/2 in both the weak and the strong senses.</description>

      <title>Thermalization And Convergence To Equilibrium Of The Noisy Voter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence towards equilibrium of the noisy voter model, evolving in the complete graph with n vertices. The noisy voter model is a version of the voter model, on which individuals change their opinions randomly due to external noise. Specifically, we determine the profile of convergence, in Kantorovich distance (also known as 1-Wasserstein distance), which corresponds to the Kantorovich distance between the marginals of a Wright-Fisher diffusion and its stationary measure. In particular, we demonstrate that the model does not exhibit cut-off under natural noise intensity conditions. In addition, we study the time the model needs to forget the initial location of particles, which we interpret as the Kantorovich distance between the laws of the model with particles in fixed initial positions and in positions chosen uniformly at random. We call this process thermalization and we show that thermalization does exhibit a cut-off profile. Our approach relies on Stein's method and analytical tools from PDE theory, which may be of independent interest for the quantitative study of observables of Markov chains.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the multinomial distribution with application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A refinement of the multinomial distribution is presented where the number of inversions in the sequence of outcomes is tallied. This refinement of the multinomial distribution is its joint distribution with the number of inversions in the accompanying experiment. An application of this additional information is described in which the number of inversions acts as a proxy measure of homogeneity (or lack thereof) in the sequence of outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note studies the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue of symmetric random matrices with correlated Gaussian entries having positive mean. Under the assumption that the covariance kernel is absolutely summable, it is proved that the largest eigenvalue, after centering, converges in distribution to normal with an explicitly defined mean and variance. This result generalizes known findings for Wigner matrices with independent entries.</description>

      <title>2DSig-Detect: a semi-supervised framework for anomaly detection on image data using 2D-signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning technologies raises questions about the security of machine learning models, with respect to both training-time (poisoning) and test-time (evasion, impersonation, and inversion) attacks. Models performing image-related tasks, e.g. detection, and classification, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can degrade their performance and produce undesirable outcomes. This paper introduces a novel technique for anomaly detection in images called 2DSig-Detect, which uses a 2D-signature-embedded semi-supervised framework rooted in rough path theory. We demonstrate our method in adversarial settings for training-time and test-time attacks, and benchmark our framework against other state of the art methods. Using 2DSig-Detect for anomaly detection, we show both superior performance and a reduction in the computation time to detect the presence of adversarial perturbations in images.</description>

      <title>Risk measures on incomplete markets: a new non-solid paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abstract theory of risk measures is well-developed for certain classes of solid subspaces of $L^{0}$. We provide an example to illustrate that this framework is insufficient to deal with the subtleties of incomplete markets. To remedy this problem, we consider risk measures on the subspace generated by a closed, absolutely convex, and bounded subset $K\subset L^{0}$, which represents the attainable securities. In this context, we introduce the equicontinuous Fatou property. Under the existence of a certain topology $\tau$ on $\mathrm{span}(K)$, interpreted as a generalized weak-star topology, we obtain an equivalence between the equicontinuous Fatou property, and lower semicontinuity with respect to $\tau$. As a corollary, we obtain tractable dual representations for such risk measures, which subsumes essentially all known results on weak-star representations of risk measures. This dual representation allows one to prove that all risk measures of this form extend, in a maximal way, to the ideal generated by $\mathrm{span}(K)$ while preserving a Fatou-like property.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Gause predator-prey model: noise-induced extinctions and invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a stochastic Gause predator-prey model with bounded or sub-linear functional response. The model, described by a system of stochastic differential equations, captures the influence of stochastic fluctuations on predator-prey dynamics, with particular focus on the stability, extinction, and persistence of populations. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and boundedness of solutions, analyze noise-induced extinction events, and investigate the existence of unique stationary distributions for the case of Holing Type I functional response. Our analysis highlights the critical role of noise in determining long-term ecological outcomes, demonstrating that even in cases where deterministic models predict stable coexistence, stochastic noise can drive populations to extinction or alter the system's dynamics significantly.</description>

Abstract: We study the emptiness formation probability, along with various representations for nonlocal correlation functions, of the 20-vertex model. In doing so, we leverage previous arguments for representations of nonlocal correlation functions for the 6-vertex model, under domain-wall boundary conditions, due to Colomo, Di Giulio, and Pronko, in addition to the inhomogeneous, and homogeneous, determinantal representations for the 20-vertex partition function due to Di Francesco, also under domain-wall boundary conditions. By taking a product of row configuration probabilities, we obtain a desired contour integral representation for nonlocal correlations from a determinantal representation. Finally, a counterpart of the emptiness formation probability is introduced for the 20-vertex model.</description>

      <title>Non-explosivity of endotactic stochastic reaction systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction networks have been widely used as generic models in diverse areas of applied science, such as biology, chemistry, ecology, epidemiology, and computer science. Reaction networks incorporating noisy effect are modelled as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC), and are called stochastic reaction systems. Non-explosivity is a concept that characterizes regularity of CTMCs. In this paper, we study non-explosivity of stochastic reaction systems, in the sense of their underlying CTMCs. By constructing a simple linear Lyapunov function, we obtain non-explosivity for a class of endotactic stochastic reaction systems containing second-order endotactic stochastic mass-action systems as a subset. As a consequence, we prove that every bimolecular weakly reversible stochastic mass-action system is non-explosive. We apply our results to diverse models in biochemistry, epidemiology, ecology, and synthetic biology in the literature.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation for fractional stochastic heat equations : Berry-Ess\'een bounds in CLTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to estimate the drift coefficient of a fractional heat equation driven by an additive space-time noise using the Maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). In the first part of the paper, the first $N$ Fourier modes of the solution are observed continuously over a finite time interval $[0, T ]$. The explicit upper bounds for the Wasserstein distance for the central limit theorem of the MLE is provided when $N \rightarrow \infty$ and/or $T \rightarrow \infty$. While in the second part of the paper, the $N$ Fourier modes are observed at uniform time grid : $t_i = i \frac{T}{M}$, $i=0,..,M,$ where $M$ is the number of time grid points. The consistency and asymptotic normality are studied when $T,M,N \rightarrow + \infty$ in addition to the rate of convergence in law in the CLT.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain Variance Estimation: A Stochastic Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the asymptotic variance of a function defined on a Markov chain, an important step for statistical inference of the stationary mean. We design the first recursive estimator that requires $O(1)$ computation at each step, does not require storing any historical samples or any prior knowledge of run-length, and has optimal $O(\frac{1}{n})$ rate of convergence for the mean-squared error (MSE) with provable finite sample guarantees. Here, $n$ refers to the total number of samples generated. The previously best-known rate of convergence in MSE was $O(\frac{\log n}{n})$, achieved by jackknifed estimators, which also do not enjoy these other desirable properties. Our estimator is based on linear stochastic approximation of an equivalent formulation of the asymptotic variance in terms of the solution of the Poisson equation.
  We generalize our estimator in several directions, including estimating the covariance matrix for vector-valued functions, estimating the stationary variance of a Markov chain, and approximately estimating the asymptotic variance in settings where the state space of the underlying Markov chain is large. We also show applications of our estimator in average reward reinforcement learning (RL), where we work with asymptotic variance as a risk measure to model safety-critical applications. We design a temporal-difference type algorithm tailored for policy evaluation in this context. We consider both the tabular and linear function approximation settings. Our work paves the way for developing actor-critic style algorithms for variance-constrained RL.</description>

      <title>Universality of Approximate Message Passing algorithms and tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13037v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms provide a valuable tool for studying mean-field approximations and dynamics in a variety of applications. Although these algorithms are often first derived for matrices having independent Gaussian entries or satisfying rotational invariance in law, their state evolution characterizations are expected to hold over larger universality classes of random matrix ensembles.
  We develop several new results on AMP universality. For AMP algorithms tailored to independent Gaussian entries, we show that their state evolutions hold over broadly defined generalized Wigner and white noise ensembles, including matrices with heavy-tailed entries and heterogeneous entrywise variances that may arise in data applications. For AMP algorithms tailored to rotational invariance in law, we show that their state evolutions hold over delocalized sign-and-permutation-invariant matrix ensembles that have a limit distribution over the diagonal, including sensing matrices composed of subsampled Hadamard or Fourier transforms and diagonal operators.
  We establish these results via a simplified moment-method proof, reducing AMP universality to the study of products of random matrices and diagonal tensors along a tensor network. As a by-product of our analyses, we show that the aforementioned matrix ensembles satisfy a notion of asymptotic freeness with respect to such tensor networks, which parallels usual definitions of freeness for traces of matrix products.</description>

      <title>Edgeworth-type expansion for the one-point distribution of the KPZ fixed point with a large height at a prior location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04999v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) fixed point $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ with the narrow-wedge initial condition and investigate the distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ conditioned on a large height at an earlier space-time point $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$. As $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ tends to infinity, we prove that the conditional one-point distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ in the regime $\tau&gt;\tau'$ converges to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) Tracy-Widom distribution and that the next two lower-order error terms can be expressed as derivatives of the Tracy-Widom distribution. The lowe order expansion here is analogue to the Edgeworth expansion in the central limit theorem. These KPZ-type limiting behaviors are different from the Gaussian-type ones obtained in \cite{Liu-Wang22} where they study the finite-dimensional distribution of $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ conditioned on a large height at a later space-time point $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$. They show, with the narrow-wedge initial condition, that the conditional random field $\mathrm{H}(x,\tau)$ in the regime $\tau&lt;\tau'$ converges to the minimum of two independent Brownian bridges modified by linear drifts as $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ goes to infinity. The two results stated above provide the phase diagram of the asymptotic behaviors of a conditional law of KPZ fixed point in the regimes $\tau&gt;\tau'$ and $\tau&lt;\tau'$ when $\mathrm{H}(x',\tau')$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a stochastic individual-based description of an SIS epidemic spreading on a random network, we study the dynamics when the size $n$ of the network tends to infinity. We recover in the limit an infinite-dimensional integro-differential equation studied by Delmas, Dronnier and Zitt (2022) for an SIS epidemic propagating on a graphon. Our work covers the case of dense and sparse graphs, provided that the number of edges grows faster than $n$, but not the case of very sparse graphs with $O(n)$ edges. In order to establish our limit theorem, we have to deal with both the convergence of the random graphs to the graphon and the convergence of the stochastic process spreading on top of these random structures: in particular, we propose a coupling between the process of interest and an epidemic that spreads on the complete graph but with a modified infection rate.

      <title>Hairer-Quastel universality for KPZ -- polynomial smoothing mechanisms, general nonlinearities and Poisson noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of weakly asymmetric continuous microscopic growth models with polynomial smoothing mechanisms, general nonlinearities and a Poisson type noise. We show that they converge to the KPZ equation after proper rescaling and re-centering, where the coupling constant depends nontrivially on all details of the smoothing and growth mechanisms in the microscopic model. This confirms some of the predictions in [HQ18], and provides a first example of Hairer-Quastel type with both a generic nonlinearity (non-polynomial) and a non-Gaussian noise.
  The proof builds on the general discretisation framework of regularity structures ([EH19]), and employs the idea of using the spectral gap inequality to control stochastic objects as developed and systematised in [LOTT21,HS24], together with a new observation on the specific structure of the (discrete) Malliavin derivatives in our situation. This structure enables us to reduce the control of mixed $L^p$ spacetime norms (of arbitrarily large $p$) by certain $L^2$-norms in spacetime.</description>

      <title>Bicausal optimal transport for SDEs with irregular coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve constrained optimal transport problems in which the marginal laws are given by the laws of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We consider SDEs with irregular coefficients, making only minimal regularity assumptions. We show that the so-called synchronous coupling is optimal among bicausal couplings, that is couplings that respect the flow of information encoded in the stochastic processes. Our results provide a method to numerically compute the adapted Wasserstein distance between laws of SDEs with irregular coefficients. We show that this can be applied to quantifying model uncertainty in stochastic optimisation problems. Moreover, we introduce a transformation-based semi-implicit numerical scheme and establish the first strong convergence result for SDEs with exponentially growing and discontinuous drift.</description>

      <title>Randomisation in the Josephus Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18110v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Josephus problem is a well--studied elimination problem consisting in determining the position of the survivor after repeated applications of a deterministic rule removing one person at a time from a given group.
  A natural probabilistic variant of this process is introduced in this paper. More precisely, in this variant, the survivor is determined after performing a succession of Bernouilli trials with parameter $p$ designating each time the person to remove. When the number of participants tends to infinity, the main result characterises the limit distribution of the position of the survivor with an increasing degree of precision as the parameter approaches the unbiaised case $p=1/2$. Then, the convergence rate to the position of the survivor is obtained in the form of a Central-Limit Theorem.
  A number of other variants of the suggested probabilistic elimination process are also considered. They each admit a specific limit behavior which, in most cases, is stated in the form of an open problem.</description>

      <title>Absolute moments of the variance-gamma distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain exact formulas for the absolute raw and central moments of the variance-gamma distribution, as infinite series involving the modified Bessel function of the second kind and the modified Lommel function of the first kind. When the skewness parameter is equal to zero (the symmetric variance-gamma distribution), the infinite series reduces to a single term. Moreover, for the case that the shape parameter is a half-integer (in our parameterisation of the variance-gamma distribution), we obtain a closed-form expression for the absolute moments in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. As a consequence, we deduce new exact formulas for the absolute raw and central moments of the asymmetric Laplace distribution and the product of two correlated zero mean normal random variables, and more generally the sum of independent copies of such random variables.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to nonlinear stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection equations (SRDAEs) with spatially homogeneous colored noises and variable-order nonlocal operators in mixed norm $L_q(L_p)$-spaces. We introduce a new condition (strongly reinforced Dalang's condition) on colored noise, which facilitates a deeper understanding of the complicated relation between nonlinearities and stochastic forces.

      <title>The Phase Transition of the Voter Model on Evolving Scale-Free Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The voter model is a classical interacting particle system explaining consensus formation on a social network. Real social networks feature not only a heterogeneous degree distribution but also connections changing over time. We study the voter model on a rank one scale-free network evolving in time by each vertex \emph{updating} (refreshing its edge neighbourhood) at any rate $\kappa=\kappa(N)$.
  We find the dynamic giant component phase transition in the consensus time of the voter model: when $\kappa\ll \tfrac{1}{N}$, the subcritical graph parameters are slower by a factor of $\tfrac{N}{\log N}$. Conversely, when $\kappa \gg 1$ the effect of the giant is removed completely and so for either graph parameter case we see consensus time on the same order as in the static supercritical case (up to polylogarithmic corrections). The intermediate dynamic speeds produce consensus time for subcritical network parameters longer not by the previous factor $\tfrac{N}{\log N}$, but by the factor $\tfrac{1}{\kappa}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to develop a new weak formulation that ensures well-posedness for a broad range of stochastic partial differential equations with pseudo-differential operators whose symbols depend only on time and spatial frequencies. The main focus of this paper is to relax the conditions on the symbols of pseudo-differential operators and data while still ensuring that the stochastic partial differential equations remain well-posed in a weak sense. Specifically, we allow symbols to be random and remove all regularity and ellipticity conditions on them. As a result, our main operators include many interesting rough operators that cannot generate any regularity gain or integrability improvement from the equations. In addition, our data do not need to be regular or possess finite stochastic moments.</description>

Abstract: We study the distributions of the splitting primes in certain families of number fields. The first and main example is the family Pn,N of integer polynomials monic of degree n with height less or equal then N, and then let N go to infinity. We prove an average version of the Chebotarev Density Theorem for this family. In particular, this gives Central Limit Theorem for the number of primes with given splitting type in some ranges. As an application, we deduce some estimates for the torsion in the class groups and for the average of ramified primes.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional indefinite stochastic Riccati equations and zero-sum stochastic linear-quadratic differential games with non-Markovian regime switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with zero-sum stochastic linear-quadratic differential games in a regime switching model. The coefficients of the games depend on the underlying noises, so it is a non-Markovian regime switching model. Based on the solutions of a new kind of multidimensional indefinite stochastic Riccati equation (SRE) and a multidimensional linear backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with unbounded coefficients, we provide closed-loop optimal feedback control-strategy pairs for the two players. The main contribution of this paper, which is of great importance in its own right from the BSDE theory point of view, is to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the new kind of SRE. Notably, the first component of the solution (as a process) is capable of taking positive and negative values simultaneously. For homogeneous systems, we obtain the optimal feedback control-strategy pairs under general closed convex cone control constraints. Finally, these results are applied to portfolio selection games with full or partial no-shorting constraint in a regime switching market with random coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study statistical inference of the drift parameters for the Volterra Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on R in the ergodic regime. For continuous-time observations, we derive the corresponding maximum likelihood estimators and show that they are strongly consistent and asymptotically normal locally uniformly in the parameters. For the case of discrete high-frequency observations, we prove similar results by discretization of the continuous-time maximum likelihood estimator. Finally, for discrete low-frequency observations, we show that the method of moments is consistent. Our proofs are crucially based on the law of large numbers.</description>

      <title>Relative weak compactness in infinite-dimensional Fefferman-Meyer duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Banach space such that $E'$ has the Radon-Nikod\'ym property. The aim of this work is to connect relative weak compactness in the $E$-valued martingale Hardy space $H^{1}(\mu,E)$ to a convex compactness criterion in a weaker topology, such as the topology of uniform convergence on compacts in measure. These results represent a dynamic version of the deep result of Diestel, Ruess, and Schachermayer on relative weak compactness in $L^{1}(\mu,E)$. In the reflexive case, we obtain a Kadec-Pe{\l}czy\'nski dichotomy for $H^{1}(\mu,E)$-bounded sequences, which decomposes a subsequence into a relatively weakly compact part, a pointwise weakly convexly convergent part, and a null part converging to zero uniformly on compacts in measure. As a corollary, we investigate a parameterized version of the vector-valued Koml\'os theorem without the assumption of $H^{1}(\mu,E)$-boundedness.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom Permutations from Random Reversible Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study pseudorandomness properties of permutations on $\{0,1\}^n$ computed by random circuits made from reversible $3$-bit gates (permutations on $\{0,1\}^3$). Our main result is that a random circuit of depth $n \cdot \tilde{O}(k^2)$, with each layer consisting of $\approx n/3$ random gates in a fixed nearest-neighbor architecture, yields almost $k$-wise independent permutations. The main technical component is showing that the Markov chain on $k$-tuples of $n$-bit strings induced by a single random $3$-bit nearest-neighbor gate has spectral gap at least $1/n \cdot \tilde{O}(k)$. This improves on the original work of Gowers [Gowers96], who showed a gap of $1/\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$ for one random gate (with non-neighboring inputs); and, on subsequent work [HMMR05,BH08] improving the gap to $\Omega(1/n^2k)$ in the same setting.
  From the perspective of cryptography, our result can be seen as a particularly simple/practical block cipher construction that gives provable statistical security against attackers with access to $k$~input-output pairs within few rounds. We also show that the Luby--Rackoff construction of pseudorandom permutations from pseudorandom functions can be implemented with reversible circuits. From this, we make progress on the complexity of the Minimum Reversible Circuit Size Problem (MRCSP), showing that block ciphers of fixed polynomial size are computationally secure against arbitrary polynomial-time adversaries, assuming the existence of one-way functions (OWFs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al. 2020] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al. 2022] becomes more preferable.</description>

      <title>Errors-In-Variables Model Fitting for Partially Unpaired Data Utilizing Mixture Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for regression in the errors-in-variables regime, allowing for full flexibility about the dimensionality of the data, observational error probability density types, the (nonlinear) model type and the avoidance of ad-hoc definitions of loss functions. In this framework, we introduce model fitting for partially unpaired data, i.e. for given data groups the pairing information of input and output is lost (semi-supervised). This is achieved by constructing mixture model densities, which directly model the loss of pairing information allowing inference. In a numerical simulation study linear and nonlinear model fits are illustrated as well as a real data study is presented based on life expectancy data from the world bank utilizing a multiple linear regression model. These results show that high quality model fitting is possible with partially unpaired data, which opens the possibility for new applications with unfortunate or deliberate loss of pairing information in data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16673v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dynamical system may be defined by a simple transition law - such as a map or a vector field. The objective of most learning techniques is to reconstruct this dynamic transition law. This is a major shortcoming, as most dynamic properties of interest are asymptotic properties such as an attractor or invariant measure. Thus approximating the dynamical law may not be sufficient to approximate these asymptotic properties. This article presents a method of representing a discrete-time deterministic dynamical system as the zero-noise limit of a Markov process. The Markov process approximation is completely data-driven. Besides proving a low-noise approximation of the dynamics the process also approximates the invariant set, via the support of its stationary measures. Thus invariant sets of arbitrary dynamical systems, even with complicated non-smooth topology, can be approximated by this technique. Under further assumptions, we show that the technique performs a convergent statistical approximation as well as approximations of true orbits.</description>

      <title>Components, large and small, are as they should be I: supercritical percolation on regular graphs of growing degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for a regular graph $G$ of growing degree $d$, guaranteeing a phase transition in its random subgraph $G_p$ similar to that of $G(n,p)$ when $p\cdot d\approx 1$. These conditions capture several well-studied graphs, such as (percolation on) the complete graph $K_n$, the binary hypercube $Q^d$, $d$-regular expanders, and random $d$-regular graphs. In particular, this serves as a unified proof for these (and other) cases.
  Suppose that $G$ is a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, with $d=\omega(1)$. Let $\epsilon&gt;0$ be a small constant, and let $p=\frac{1+\epsilon}{d}$. Let $y(\epsilon)$ be the survival probability of a Galton-Watson tree with offspring distribution Po$(1+\epsilon)$. We show that if $G$ satisfies a (very) mild edge expansion requirement, and if one has fairly good control on the expansion of small sets in $G$, then typically the percolated random subgraph $G_p$ contains a unique giant component of asymptotic order $y(\epsilon)n$, and all the other components in $G_p$ are of order $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$.
  We also show that this result is tight, in the sense that if one asks for a slightly weaker control on the expansion of small sets in $G$, then there are $d$-regular graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices, where typically the second largest component is of order $\Omega(d\log (n/d))=\omega(\log n)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $d\ge 3$ be a fixed integer. Let $y:= y(p)$ be the probability that the root of an infinite $d$-regular tree belongs to an infinite cluster after $p$-bond-percolation. We show that for every constants $b,\alpha&gt;0$ and $1&lt;\lambda&lt; d-1$, there exist constants $c,C&gt;0$ such that the following holds. Let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, satisfying that for every $U\subseteq V(G)$ with $|U|\le \frac{n}{2}$, $e(U,U^c)\ge b|U|$ and for every $U\subseteq V(G)$ with $|U|\le \log^Cn$, $e(U)\le (1+c)|U|$. Let $p=\frac{\lambda}{d-1}$. Then, with probability tending to one as $n$ tends to infinity, the largest component $L_1$ in the random subgraph $G_p$ of $G$ satisfies $\left|1-\frac{|L_1|}{yn}\right|\le \alpha$, and all the other components in $G_p$ are of order $O\left(\frac{\lambda\log n}{(\lambda-1)^2}\right)$. This generalises (and improves upon) results for random $d$-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Approximate independence of permutation mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove bounds on statistical distances between high-dimensional exchangeable mixture distributions (which we call permutation mixtures) and their i.i.d. counterparts. Our results are based on a novel method for controlling $\chi^2$ divergences between exchangeable mixtures, which is tighter than the existing methods of moments or cumulants. At a technical level, a key innovation in our proofs is a new Maclaurin-type inequality for elementary symmetric polynomials of variables that sum to zero and an upper bound on permanents of doubly-stochastic positive semidefinite matrices. Our results imply a de Finetti-style theorem (in the language of Diaconis and Freedman, 1987) and general asymptotic results for compound decision problems, generalizing and strengthening a result of Hannan and Robbins (1955).</description>

      <title>Improved Catoni-Type Confidence Sequences for Estimating the Mean When the Variance Is Infinite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a discrete time stochastic model with infinite variance and study the mean estimation problem as in Wang and Ramdas (2023). We refine the Catoni-type confidence sequence (abbr. CS) and use an idea of Bhatt et al. (2022) to achieve notable improvements of some currently existing results for such model.
  Specifically, for given $\alpha \in (0, 1]$, we assume that there is a known upper bound $\nu_{\alpha} &gt; 0$ for the $(1 + \alpha)$-th central moment of the population distribution that the sample follows. Our findings replicate and `optimize' results in the above references for $\alpha = 1$ (i.e., in models with finite variance) and enhance the results for $\alpha &lt; 1$. Furthermore, by employing the stitching method, we derive an upper bound on the width of the CS as $\mathcal{O} \left(((\log \log t)/t)^{\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}}\right)$ for the shrinking rate as $t$ increases, and $\mathcal{O}(\left(\log (1/\delta)\right)^{\frac{\alpha }{1+\alpha}})$ for the growth rate as $\delta$ decreases. These bounds are improving upon the bounds found in Wang and Ramdas (2023). Our theoretical results are illustrated by results from a series of simulation experiments. Comparing the performance of our improved $\alpha$-Catoni-type CS with the bound in the above cited paper indicates that our CS achieves tighter width.</description>
