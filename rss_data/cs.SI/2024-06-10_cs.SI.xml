      <title>Adaptive Algorithmic Interventions for Escaping Pessimism Traps in Dynamic Sequential Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we relate the philosophical literature on pessimism traps to information cascades, a formal model derived from the economics and mathematics literature. A pessimism trap is a social pattern in which individuals in a community, in situations of uncertainty, begin to copy the sub-optimal actions of others, despite their individual beliefs. This maps nicely onto the concept of an information cascade, which involves a sequence of agents making a decision between two alternatives, with a private signal of the superior alternative and a public history of others' actions. Key results from the economics literature show that information cascades occur with probability one in many contexts, and depending on the strength of the signal, populations can fall into the incorrect cascade very easily and quickly. Once formed, in the absence of external perturbation, a cascade cannot be broken -- therefore, we derive an intervention that can be used to nudge a population from an incorrect to a correct cascade and, importantly, maintain the cascade once the subsidy is discontinued. We study this both theoretically and empirically.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Global Election Landscape on Social Media in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2024, half of the global population is expected to participate in elections, offering researchers a unique opportunity to study online information diffusion and user behavior. This study investigates the media landscape on social media by analyzing Facebook posts from national political parties and major news agencies across Europe, Mexico, and India. Our methodology identifies key topics and evaluates public interaction, reflecting broader trends in political engagement. Using Principal Component Analysis, we distil these topics to uncover patterns of correlation and differentiation. This approach reveals dominant themes that engage global audiences, providing critical insights into the interplay between public opinion and digital narratives during a major electoral cycle. Our findings highlight how different topics resonate across political spectrums, shaping political debate and offering a comprehensive view of the interaction between media content, political ideology, and audience engagement.</description>

      <title>From cryptomarkets to the surface web: Scouting eBay for counterfeits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting counterfeits on online marketplaces is challenging, and current methods struggle with the volume of sales on platforms like eBay, while cryptomarkets openly sell counterfeits. Leveraging information from 453 cryptomarket counterfeits, we automated a search for corresponding products on eBay, utilizing image and text similarity metrics. We collected data twice over 4-months to analyze changes with an average of 159 eBay products per cryptomarket item, totaling 134k products. We found identical products, which would warrant further investigation as to whether they are counterfeits. Results indicate increasing difficulty finding similar products over time, moderated by product type and origin. Future improved versions of the current system could be used to examine possible connections between cryptomarket and surface web listings more closely and could hold practical value in supporting the detection of counterfeits on the surface web.</description>

      <title>Determining the Number of Communities in Sparse and Imbalanced Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community structures represent a crucial aspect of network analysis, and various methods have been developed to identify these communities. However, a common hurdle lies in determining the number of communities K, a parameter that often requires estimation in practice. Existing approaches for estimating K face two notable challenges: the weak community signal present in sparse networks and the imbalance in community sizes or edge densities that result in unequal per-community expected degree. We propose a spectral method based on a novel network operator whose spectral properties effectively overcome both challenges. This operator is a refined version of the non-backtracking operator, adapted from a "centered" adjacency matrix. Its leading eigenvalues are more concentrated than those of the adjacency matrix for sparse networks, while they also demonstrate enhanced signal under imbalance scenarios, a benefit attributed to the centering step. This is justified, either theoretically or numerically, under the null model K = 1, in both dense and ultra-sparse settings. A goodness-of-fit test based on the leading eigenvalue can be applied to determine the number of communities K.</description>

      <title>GNNAnatomy: Systematic Generation and Evaluation of Multi-Level Explanations for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective in various machine learning (ML) tasks involving graphs, such as node/graph classification and link prediction. However, explaining the decisions made by GNNs poses challenges because of the aggregated relational information based on graph structure, leading to complex data transformations. Existing methods for explaining GNNs often face limitations in systematically exploring diverse substructures and evaluating results in the absence of ground truths. To address this gap, we introduce GNNAnatomy, a model- and dataset-agnostic visual analytics system designed to facilitate the generation and evaluation of multi-level explanations for GNNs. In GNNAnatomy, we employ graphlets to elucidate GNN behavior in graph-level classification tasks. By analyzing the associations between GNN classifications and graphlet frequencies, we formulate hypothesized factual and counterfactual explanations. To validate a hypothesized graphlet explanation, we introduce two metrics: (1) the correlation between its frequency and the classification confidence, and (2) the change in classification confidence after removing this substructure from the original graph. To demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNAnatomy, we conduct case studies on both real-world and synthetic graph datasets from various domains. Additionally, we qualitatively compare GNNAnatomy with a state-of-the-art GNN explainer, demonstrating the utility and versatility of our design.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Attention Weights as Interpretations of Message-Passing Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been adopted in several widely-used message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) (e.g., GATs), which adaptively controls the amount of information that flows along the edges of the underlying graph. This usage of attention has made such models a baseline for studies on explainable AI (XAI) since interpretations via attention have been popularized in various domains (e.g., natural language processing and computer vision). However, existing studies often use naive calculations to derive attribution scores from attention, and do not take the precise and careful calculation of edge attribution into consideration. In our study, we aim to fill the gap between the widespread usage of attention-enabled MPNNs and their potential in largely under-explored explainability, a topic that has been actively investigated in other areas. To this end, as the first attempt, we formalize the problem of edge attribution from attention weights in GNNs. Then, we propose GATT, an edge attribution calculation method built upon the computation tree. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method when evaluating attributions from GATs. Conversely, we empirically validate that simply averaging attention weights over graph attention layers is insufficient to interpret the GAT model's behavior.

      <title>Combinatorial Complex Score-based Diffusion Modelling through Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph structures offer a versatile framework for representing diverse patterns in nature and complex systems, applicable across domains like molecular chemistry, social networks, and transportation systems. While diffusion models have excelled in generating various objects, generating graphs remains challenging. This thesis explores the potential of score-based generative models in generating such objects through a modelization as combinatorial complexes, which are powerful topological structures that encompass higher-order relationships.
  In this thesis, we propose a unified framework by employing stochastic differential equations. We not only generalize the generation of complex objects such as graphs and hypergraphs, but we also unify existing generative modelling approaches such as Score Matching with Langevin dynamics and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. This innovation overcomes limitations in existing frameworks that focus solely on graph generation, opening up new possibilities in generative AI.
  The experiment results showed that our framework could generate these complex objects, and could also compete against state-of-the-art approaches for mere graph and molecule generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Higher-order modeling of face-to-face interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most fundamental social interactions among humans occur face to face. Their features have been extensively studied in recent years, owing to the availability of high-resolution data on individuals' proximity. Mathematical models based on mobile agents have been crucial to understand the spatio-temporal organization of face-to-face interactions. However, these models focus on dyadic relationships only, failing to characterize interactions in larger groups of individuals. Here, we propose a model in which agents interact with each other by forming groups of different sizes. Each group has a degree of social attractiveness, based on which neighboring agents decide whether to join. Our framework reproduces different properties of groups in face-to-face interactions, including their distribution, the correlation in their number, and their persistence in time, which cannot be replicated by dyadic models. Furthermore, it captures homophilic patterns at the level of higher-order interactions, going beyond standard pairwise approaches. Our work sheds light on the higher-order mechanisms at the heart of human face-to-face interactions, paving the way for further investigation of how group dynamics at a microscopic scale affects social phenomena at a macroscopic scale.</description>

      <title>Pre-train and Refine: Towards Higher Efficiency in K-Agnostic Community Detection without Quality Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection (CD) is a classic graph inference task that partitions nodes of a graph into densely connected groups. While many CD methods have been proposed with either impressive quality or efficiency, balancing the two aspects remains a challenge. This study explores the potential of deep graph learning to achieve a better trade-off between the quality and efficiency of K-agnostic CD, where the number of communities K is unknown. We propose PRoCD (Pre-training &amp; Refinement fOr Community Detection), a simple yet effective method that reformulates K-agnostic CD as the binary node pair classification. PRoCD follows a pre-training &amp; refinement paradigm inspired by recent advances in pre-training techniques. We first conduct the offline pre-training of PRoCD on small synthetic graphs covering various topology properties. Based on the inductive inference across graphs, we then generalize the pre-trained model (with frozen parameters) to large real graphs and use the derived CD results as the initialization of an existing efficient CD method (e.g., InfoMap) to further refine the quality of CD results. In addition to benefiting from the transfer ability regarding quality, the online generalization and refinement can also help achieve high inference efficiency, since there is no time-consuming model optimization. Experiments on public datasets with various scales demonstrate that PRoCD can ensure higher efficiency in K-agnostic CD without significant quality degradation.</description>

      <title>Graph Data Condensation via Self-expressive Graph Structure Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demands of training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs, graph data condensation has emerged as a critical technique to relieve the storage and time costs during the training phase. It aims to condense the original large-scale graph to a much smaller synthetic graph while preserving the essential information necessary for efficiently training a downstream GNN. However, existing methods concentrate either on optimizing node features exclusively or endeavor to independently learn node features and the graph structure generator. They could not explicitly leverage the information of the original graph structure and failed to construct an interpretable graph structure for the synthetic dataset. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework named \textbf{G}raph Data \textbf{C}ondensation via \textbf{S}elf-expressive Graph Structure \textbf{R}econstruction (\textbf{GCSR}). Our method stands out by (1) explicitly incorporating the original graph structure into the condensing process and (2) capturing the nuanced interdependencies between the condensed nodes by reconstructing an interpretable self-expressive graph structure. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis validate the efficacy of the proposed method across diverse GNN models and datasets. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/zclzcl0223/GCSR}.</description>

      <title>A Grassroots Architecture to Supplant Global Digital Platforms by a Global Digital Democracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedback in a network with two communities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments of eco-evolutionary models have shown that evolving feedbacks between behavioral strategies and the environment of game interactions, leading to changes in the underlying payoff matrix, can impact the underlying population dynamics in various manners. We propose and analyze an eco-evolutionary game dynamics model on a network with two communities such that players interact with other players in the same community and those in the opposite community at different rates. In our model, we consider two-person matrix games with pairwise interactions occurring on individual edges and assume that the environmental state depends on edges rather than on nodes or being globally shared in the population. We analytically determine the equilibria and their stability under a symmetric population structure assumption, and we also numerically study the replicator dynamics of the general model. The model shows rich dynamical behavior, such as multiple transcritical bifurcations, multistability, and anti-synchronous oscillations. Our work offers insights into understanding how the presence of community structure impacts the eco-evolutionary dynamics within and between niches.</description>

      <title>NoisyGL: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks under Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) exhibit strong potential in node classification task through a message-passing mechanism. However, their performance often hinges on high-quality node labels, which are challenging to obtain in real-world scenarios due to unreliable sources or adversarial attacks. Consequently, label noise is common in real-world graph data, negatively impacting GNNs by propagating incorrect information during training. To address this issue, the study of Graph Neural Networks under Label Noise (GLN) has recently gained traction. However, due to variations in dataset selection, data splitting, and preprocessing techniques, the community currently lacks a comprehensive benchmark, which impedes deeper understanding and further development of GLN. To fill this gap, we introduce NoisyGL in this paper, the first comprehensive benchmark for graph neural networks under label noise. NoisyGL enables fair comparisons and detailed analyses of GLN methods on noisy labeled graph data across various datasets, with unified experimental settings and interface. Our benchmark has uncovered several important insights that were missed in previous research, and we believe these findings will be highly beneficial for future studies. We hope our open-source benchmark library will foster further advancements in this field. The code of the benchmark can be found in https://github.com/eaglelab-zju/NoisyGL.</description>
