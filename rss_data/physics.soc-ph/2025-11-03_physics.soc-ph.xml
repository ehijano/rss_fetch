      <title>Analyzing Swing States in Presidential Elections: The Case of Wisconsin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper quantitatively analyzes county-level voting patterns in Wisconsin's presidential elections from 2000 to 2024. As a pivotal swing state, Wisconsin has alternated between Democratic and Republican candidates since 2012. Using data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission, we examine vote totals across 72 counties and seven election cycles. Pearson correlations measure similarity in county voting trajectories, while choropleth maps visualize spatial shifts. Results show strong clustering of vote changes: Democratic and Republican gains between 2016 and 2020 were concentrated in southeastern urban and suburban counties, with rural areas showing little change. Correlations reveal a north-south divide, as southern counties exhibit similar trends and northern ones diverge. These findings highlight spatial heterogeneity in electoral dynamics and the decisive role of urban mobilization in statewide outcomes.</description>

      <title>Information theory for hypergraph similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing networks is essential for a number of downstream tasks, from clustering to anomaly detection. Despite higher-order interactions being critical for understanding the dynamics of complex systems, traditional approaches for network comparison are limited to pairwise interactions only. Here we construct a general information theoretic framework for hypergraph similarity, capturing meaningful correspondence among higher-order interactions while correcting for spurious correlations. Our method operationalizes any notion of structural overlap among hypergraphs as a principled normalized mutual information measure, allowing us to derive a hierarchy of increasingly granular formulations of similarity among hypergraphs within and across orders of interactions, and at multiple scales. We validate these measures through extensive experiments on synthetic hypergraphs and apply the framework to reveal meaningful patterns in a variety of empirical higher-order networks. Our work provides foundational tools for the principled comparison of higher-order networks, shedding light on the structural organization of networked systems with non-dyadic interactions.</description>

      <title>Polarization and echo chambers in Reddit's political discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political debate nowadays takes place mainly on online social media, with election periods amplifying ideological engagement. Reddit is generally considered more resistant to polarization and echo chamber effects than platforms like Twitter or Facebook. Here, we challenge this assumption through a case study across the 2016 US presidential election. We use statistical validation techniques to extract ideologically distinct communities of subreddits, in terms of their contributing user base and news consumption, which we use to analyze the dynamics of political debate. We thus reveal clear polarization in both interaction-based and topic-based communities, with clusters of Democratic, Conservative, and Banned subreddits. Election periods intensify cross-group engagement, align Banned and Conservative content, and reduce linguistic diversity within groups. Overall we characterize Reddit as a polarized environment marked by the presence of echo chambers, highlighting network validation as a key method for identifying behavioral and interaction patterns on online social media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a systematic algorithm for generating directed networks with prescribed symmetries by constructing expansions from a given quotient network. The method enables researchers to synthesize realistic network models with controllable symmetry structure, facilitating studies of symmetry-driven dynamics such as cluster synchronization in biological, social, and technological systems.</description>

      <title>Mapping Regional Disparities in Discounted Grocery Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food waste represents a major challenge to global climate resilience, accounting for almost 10\% of annual greenhouse gas emissions. The retail sector is a critical player, mediating product flows between producers and consumers, where supply chain inefficiencies can shape which items are put on sale. Yet how these dynamics vary across geographic contexts remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze data from Denmark's largest retail group on near-expiry products put on sale. We uncover the geospatial variations using a dual-clustering approach. We identify multi-scale spatial relationships in retail organization by correlating store clustering -- measured using shortest-path distances along the street network -- with product clustering based on promotion co-occurrence patterns. Using a bipartite network approach, we identify three regional store clusters, and use percolation thresholds to corroborate the scale of their spatial separation. We find that stores in rural communities put meat and dairy products on sale up to 2.2 times more frequently than metropolitan areas. In contrast, we find that metropolitan and capital regions lean toward convenience products, which have more balanced nutritional profiles but less favorable environmental impacts. By linking geographic context to retail inventory, we provide evidence that reducing food waste requires interventions tailored to local retail dynamics, highlighting the importance of region-specific sustainability strategies.</description>

      <title>Social learning moderates the tradeoffs between efficiency, stability, and equity in group foraging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social learning shapes collective search by influencing how individuals use peer information. Empirical and computational studies show that optimal information sharing that is neither too localized nor too diffuse, can enhance resource detection and coordination. Building on these insights, we develop a randomized search model that integrates social learning with area-restricted search (ARS) to investigate how communication distance affects collective foraging. The model includes three behavioral modes: exploration, exploitation, and targeted walk, which are governed by a single parameter, $\rho$, that balances exploration and exploitation at the group level. We quantify how $\rho$ influences group efficiency ($\eta$), temporal variability/burstiness ($B$), and agent variability/equity in resource distribution ($\sigma$), revealing a clear trade-off among these outcomes. When $\rho \to 0$, agents explore independently, maximizing collective exploration. As $\rho$ increases, individuals preferentially exploit patches discovered by others: $\eta$ first rises and then declines, while $B$ shows the opposite trend. Group efficiency is optimized at interior $\rho$ values that balance exploration and exploitation. At the largest $\rho$, equality among agents is highest, but efficiency declines and burstiness is maximized too. Finally, by introducing negative rewards, we examine how social learning mitigates risk.</description>

      <title>Beyond Demographics: Behavioural Segmentation and Spatial Analytics to Enhance Visitor Experience at The British Museum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores visitor behaviour at The British Museum using data science methods applied to novel sources, including audio guide usage logs and TripAdvisor reviews. Analysing 42,000 visitor journeys and over 50,000 reviews, we identify key drivers of satisfaction, segment visitors by behavioural patterns, examine tour engagement, model spatial navigation, and investigate room popularity. Behavioural clustering uncovered four distinct visitor types: Committed Trekkers, Leisurely Explorers, Targeted Visitors, and Speedy Samplers, each characterised by different levels of engagement and movement. Tour usage analysis revealed high drop-off rates and variation in completion rates across different language groups. Spatial flow modelling revealed that accessibility and proximity, particularly aversion to stairs, shaped visitor paths more than thematic organisation. Room popularity was more strongly predicted by physical accessibility than curatorial content. We propose practical strategies for improving engagement and flow, offering a scalable framework for visitor-centred, data-informed museum planning.</description>

      <title>Reducibility of higher-order networks via information flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical complex systems can be characterized not only by pairwise interactions, but also by higher-order (group) interactions influencing collective phenomena, from metabolic reactions to epidemics. Nevertheless, higher-order networks' apparent superior descriptive power -- compared to classical pairwise networks -- comes with a much increased model complexity and computational cost, challenging their application. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to establish a quantitative method to determine when such a modeling framework is advantageous with respect to pairwise models, and to which extent it provides a valuable description of empirical systems. Here, we propose an information-theoretic framework, accounting for how structure affect diffusion behaviors, quantifying the entropic cost and distinguishability of higher-order interactions to assess their reducibility to lower-order structures while preserving relevant functional information. Empirical analyses indicate that some systems retain essential higher-order structure, whereas in some technological and biological networks it collapses to pairwise interactions. With controlled randomization procedures, we investigate the role of nestedness and degree heterogeneity in this reducibility process. Our findings contribute to ongoing efforts to minimize the dimensionality of models for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Dynamics of Network Vaccination and Hysteresis: A Double-Edged Sword for Addressing Vaccine Hesitancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass vaccination remains a long-lasting challenge for disease control and prevention with upticks in vaccine hesitancy worldwide. Here, we introduce an experience-based learning (Q-learning) dynamics model of vaccination behavior in social networks, where agents choose whether or not to vaccinate given environmental feedbacks from their local neighborhood. We focus on how bounded rationality of individuals impacts decision-making of irrational agents in networks. Additionally, we observe hysteresis behavior and bistability with respect to vaccination cost and the Q-learning hyperparameters such as discount rate. Our results offer insight into the complexities of Q-learning and particularly how foresightedness of individuals will help mitigate - or conversely deteriorate, therefore acting as a double-edged sword - collective action problems in important contexts like vaccination. We also find a diversification of uptake choices, with individuals evolving into complete opt-in vs. complete opt-out. Our results have real-world implications for targeting the persistence of vaccine hesitancy using an interdisciplinary computational social science approach integrating social networks, game theory, and learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Outcomes in Two-Actor Conflict Dynamics: Stability, Bifurcations, and Emergent Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present an analytical and numerical study of a generalized model
  of two-actor cooperative-competitive conflict of the Continuous Opinions and
  Discrete Actions (CODA) type. Theoretically, we note that the in troduction of a new parameter allows generalizing feedback as strong and weak.
  Furthermore, we show that for positive-positive and negative-negative feedback there
  exists a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, and that the model does not admit limit
  cycles in any case, and we study the effect of different parameter values and initial
  conditions by using a difference equation approximation of the model. Additionally,
  our model offers important insight on social phenomena such as false levels of support
  among cooperators, often observed in agreement negotiations; instances of ``non-strict
  consensus'' when two people support the same political position, albeit with different
  intensities; and competitive situations, such as in competitions with disproportionate
  profit and losses. Thus, this generalized model offers an enhanced descriptive power
  compared to previously proposed models.</description>
