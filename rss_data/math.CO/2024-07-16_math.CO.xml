      <title>Obstructions to Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa Dualities for Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09671v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\cal G}$ and ${\cal H}$ be minor-closed graph classes. The pair $({\cal H},{\cal G})$ is an Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa pair (EP-pair) if there is a function $f$ where, for every $k$ and every $G\in{\cal G},$ either $G$ has $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint subgraphs not belonging to ${\cal H},$ or there is a set $S\subseteq V(G)$ where $|S|\leq f(k)$ and $G-S\in{\cal H}.$ The classic result of Erd\H{o}s and P\'osa says that if $\mathcal{F}$ is the class of forests, then $({\cal F},{\cal G})$ is an EP-pair for every ${\cal G}$. The class ${\cal G}$ is an EP-counterexample for ${\cal H}$ if ${\cal G}$ is minimal with the property that $({\cal H},{\cal G})$ is not an EP-pair. We prove that for every ${\cal H}$ the set $\mathfrak{C}_{\cal H}$ of all EP-counterexamples for ${\cal H}$ is finite. In particular, we provide a complete characterization of $\mathfrak{C}_{\cal H}$ for every ${\cal H}$ and give a constructive upper bound on its size. Each class ${\cal G}\in \mathfrak{C}_{\cal H}$ can be described as all minors of a sequence of grid-like graphs $\langle \mathscr{W}_{k} \rangle_{k\in \mathbb{N}}.$ Moreover, each $\mathscr{W}_{k}$ admits a half-integral packing: $k$ copies of some $H\not\in{\cal H}$ where no vertex is used more than twice. This gives a complete delineation of the half-integrality threshold of the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for minors and yields a constructive proof of Thomas' conjecture on the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for minors (recently confirmed, non-constructively, by Liu). Let $h$ be the maximum size of a graph in ${\cal H}.$ For every class ${\cal H},$ we construct an algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a $k,$ either outputs a half-integral packing of $k$ copies of some $H \not\in {\cal H}$ or outputs a set of at most ${2^{k^{\cal O}_h(1)}}$ vertices whose deletion creates a graph in ${\cal H}$ in time $2^{2^{k^{{\cal O}_h(1)}}}\cdot |G|^4\log |G|.$</description>

      <title>Identifying open codes in trees and 4-cycle-free graphs of given maximum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An identifying open code of a graph $G$ is a set $S$ of vertices that is both a separating open code (that is, $N_G(u) \cap S \ne N_G(v) \cap S$ for all distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$) and a total dominating set (that is, $N(v) \cap S \ne \emptyset$ for all vertices~$v$ in $G$). Such a set exists if and only if the graph $G$ is open twin-free and isolate-free; and the minimum cardinality of an identifying open code in an open twin-free and isolate-free graph $G$ is denoted by $\gamma^{{\rm {\small IOC}}}(G)$.
  We study the smallest size of an identifying open code of a graph, in relation with its order and its maximum degree. For $\Delta$ a fixed integer at least $3$, if $G$ is a connected graph of order $n \ge 5$ that contains no $4$-cycle and is open twin-free with maximum degree bounded above by $\Delta$, then we show that $\gamma^{{\rm {\small IOC}}}(G) \le \left( \frac{2\Delta - 1}{\Delta} \right) n$, unless $G$ is obtained from a star $K_{1,\Delta}$ by subdividing every edge exactly once.
  Moreover, we show that the bound is best possible by constructing graphs that reach the bound.</description>

      <title>Information dissemination and confusion in signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of information dissemination in signed networks. It is a discrete-time process in which uninformed actors incrementally receive information from their informed neighbors or from the outside. Our goal is to minimize the number of confused actors - that is, the number of actors who receive contradictory information. We prove upper bounds for the number of confused actors in signed networks and in equivalence classes of signed networks. In particular, we show that there are signed networks where, for any information placement strategy, almost 60\% of the actors are confused. Furthermore, this is also the case when considering the minimum number of confused actors within an equivalence class of signed graphs.</description>

      <title>Group actions on codes in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a chapter in a forthcoming book on completely regular codes in distance regular graphs. The chapter provides an overview, and some original results, on codes in distance regular graphs which admit symmetries via a permutation group acting on the vertices of the graph. The strongest notion of completely transitive codes is developed, as well as the more general notion of neighbour-transitive codes. The graphs considered are the Hamming, Johnson, and Kneser graphs and their q-analogues, as well as some graphs related to incidence structures.</description>

      <title>A note on kernel-perfect orientations and DP-colorings from derangement assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the well-known Bondy-Bopanna-Siegel Lemma to DP-colorings from a class of correspondence assignments which we call derangement assignments. Since DP-colorings from derangement assignments generalize zero-free list colorings of signed graphs, this yields an orientation theorem for zero-free signed list colorings, as well.</description>

Abstract: We find exact and asymptotic formulas for the number of pairs $(p,q)$ of $N$-cycles such that the all cycles of the product $p\cdot q$ have lengths from a given integer set. We then apply these results to
  prove a surprisingly high lower bound for the number of permutations whose block transposition distance from the identity is at least $(n+1)/2$.</description>

      <title>On vertex peripherians and Wiener index of graphs with fixed number of cut vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distance of a vertex in a graph is the sum of distances from that vertex to all other vertices of the graph. The Wiener index of a graph is the sum of distances between all its unordered pairs of vertices. A graph has been obtained that contains a vertex achieving the maximum distance among all graphs on $n$ vertices with fixed number of cut vertices. Further the graphs having maximum Wiener index among all graphs on $n$ vertices with at most $3$ cut vertices have been characterised.</description>

      <title>Chromatic and achromatic numbers of unitary addition Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring. The unitary addition Cayley graph of $R$, denoted $\mathcal{U}(R)$, is the graph with vertex $R$, and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $x+y$ is a unit. We determine a formula for the clique number and chromatic number of such graphs when $R$ is a finite commutative ring. This includes the special case when $R$ is $\mathbb{Z}_n$, the integers modulo $n$, where these parameters had been found under the assumption that $n$ is even, or $n$ is a power of an odd prime. Additionally, we study the achromatic number of $\mathcal{U}( \mathbb{Z}_n )$ in the case that $n$ is the product of two primes. We prove that the achromatic number of $\mathcal{U} ( \mathbb{Z}_{3q})$ is equal to $\frac{3q+1}{2}$ when $q &gt; 3$ is a prime. We also prove a lower bound that applies when $n = pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are distinct odd primes.</description>

      <title>Proof of Lew's conjecture on the spectral gap of simplicial complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a simplicial complex on vertex set $V$ of size $n$. Let $X(k)$ denote the set of all $k$-dimensional simplices of $X$, and $\mathrm{deg}_X(\sigma)=|\{\eta\in X(k+1):\sigma\subseteq \eta\}|$ denote the degree of $\sigma \in X$. A missing face in $X$ is a subset $\sigma$ of $V$ such that $\sigma\notin X$ but $\tau\in X$ for any proper subset $\tau$ of $\sigma$. Let $d$ denote the maximal dimension of a missing face of $X$, and $\mu_k(X)$ denote the $k$-th spectral gap of $X$, i.e., the smallest eigenvalue of the reduced $k$-dimensional Laplacian of $X$. In [J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 169 (2020) 105127], Lew established a lower bound for $\mu_k(X)$: $$\mu_k(X)\geq (d+1)\left(\min_{\sigma\in X(k)}\mathrm{deg}_X(\sigma)+k+1\right)-dn\geq (d+1)(k+1)-dn,$$ and further conjectured that if $\mu_k(X)=(d+1)(k+1)-dn$ for some $k$, then $X\cong (\Delta_d^{(d-1)})^{*(n-k-1)}*\Delta_{(d+1)(k+1)-dn-1}$. In this paper, we confirm Lew's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Isometric Cycles and a Generalization of Moore Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equator of a graph is the length of a longest isometric cycle. We bound the order $n$ of a graph from below by its equator $q$, girth $g$ and minimum degree $\delta$ - and show that this bound is sharp when there exists a Moore graph with girth $g$ and minimum degree $\delta$. The extremal graphs that attain our bound give an analogue of Moore graphs. We prove that these extremal `Moore-like' graphs are regular, and that every one of their vertices is contained in some maximum length isometric cycle. We show that these extremal graphs have a highly structured partition that is unique, and easily derived from any of its maximum length isometric cycles. We characterize the extremal graphs with girth 3 and 4, and those with girth 5 and minimum degree 3. We also bound the order of $C_4$-free graphs with given equator and minimum degree, and show that this bound is nearly sharp. We conclude with some questions and conjectures further relating our extremal graphs to cages and Moore graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say a finite word $x$ is a palindromic periodicity if there exist two palindromes $p$ and $s$ such that $|x| \geq |ps|$ and $x$ is a prefix of the word $(ps)^\omega = pspsps\cdots$. In this paper we examine the palindromic periodicities occurring in some classical infinite words, such as Sturmian words, episturmian words, the Thue-Morse word, the period-doubling word, the Rudin-Shapiro word, the paperfolding word, and the Tribonacci word, and prove a number of results about them.</description>

      <title>Topological Minors in Typical Lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $\ell$-lift of a graph $G$ is any graph obtained by replacing every vertex of $G$ with an independent set of size $\ell$, and connecting every pair of two such independent sets that correspond to an edge in $G$ by a matching of size $\ell$. Graph lifts have found numerous interesting applications and connections to a variety of areas over the years. Of particular importance is the random graph model obtained by considering an $\ell$-lift of a graph sampled uniformly at random. This model was first introduced by Amit and Linial in 1999, and has been extensively investigated since. In this paper, we study the size of the largest topological clique in random lifts of complete graphs.
  In 2006, Drier and Linial raised the conjecture that almost all $\ell$-lifts of the complete graph on $n$ vertices contain a subdivision of a clique of order $\Omega(n)$ as a subgraph provided $\ell$ is at least linear in $n$. We confirm their conjecture in a strong form by showing that for $\ell \ge (1+o(1))n$, one can almost surely find a subdivision of a clique of order $n$. We prove that this is tight by showing that for $\ell \le (1-o(1))n$, almost all $\ell$-lifts do not contain subdivisions of cliques of order $n$.
  Finally, for $2 \le \ell \ll n$, we show that almost all $\ell$-lifts of $K_n$ contain a subdivision of a clique on $(1-o(1))\sqrt{\frac{2n \ell}{1-1/\ell}}$ vertices and that this is tight up to the lower order term.</description>

      <title>On full-separating sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several different types of identification problems have been already studied in the literature, where the objective is to distinguish any two vertices of a graph by their unique neighborhoods in a suitably chosen dominating or total-dominating set of the graph, often referred to as a \emph{code}. To study such problems under a unifying point of view, reformulations of the already studied problems in terms of covering problems in suitably constructed hypergraphs have been provided. Analyzing these hypergraph representations, we introduce a new separation property, called \emph{full-separation}, which has not yet been considered in the literature so far. We study it in combination with both domination and total-domination, and call the resulting codes \emph{full-separating-dominating codes} (or \emph{FD-codes} for short) and \emph{full-separating-total-dominating codes} (or \emph{FTD-codes} for short), respectively. We address the conditions for the existence of FD- and FTD-codes, bounds for their size and their relation to codes of the other types. We show that the problems of determining an FD- or an FTD-code of minimum cardinality in a graph is NP-hard. We also show that the cardinalities of minimum FD- and FTD-codes differ by at most one, but that it is NP-complete to decide if they are equal for a given graph in general. We find the exact values of minimum cardinalities of the FD- and FTD-codes on some familiar graph classes like paths, cycles, half-graphs and spiders. This helps us compare the two codes with other codes on these graph families thereby exhibiting extremal cases for several lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Tredoku Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Donald A. Preece gave two talks in 2013, in which he introduced the notion of tredoku patterns. These are certain configurations of diamond-shaped tiles, inspired by the sukodu-like puzzle that appears in newspapers. Very sadly, Prof. Preece died in January 2014, before he was able to complete his work on this problem. This paper reconstructs his work, and settles (in the affirmative) the conjectures he proposed.</description>

Abstract: We study pairs of matrices $A,B\in GL_n({\mathbb C})$ such that the eigenvalues of $A$, of $B$ and of the product $AB$ are specified in advance. We show that the space of such pairs $(A,B)$ under simultaneous conjugation has dimension $(n-1)(n-2)$, and give an explicit parameterization.
  More generally let $\Sigma$ be a surface of genus $g$ with $k$ punctures. We find a parameterization of the space $\Omega_{g,k,n}$ of flat $GL_n({\mathbb C})$-structures on $\Sigma$ whose holonomies around the punctures have prescribed eigenvalues.
  We show furthermore that, for $3\le k\le 2g+6$ (or $3\le k\le 9$ if $g=1$, or $3\le k$ if $g=0$), the space $\Omega_{g,k,n}$ has an explicit symplectic structure and an associated Liouville integrable system, equivalent to a leaf of a Goncharov-Kenyon dimer integrable system.</description>

      <title>Kohayakawa-Nagle-R{\"o}dl-Schacht conjecture for subdivisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-known Kohayakawa-Nagle-R{\"o}dl-Schacht (KNRS) conjecture, with a specific focus on graph subdivisions. The KNRS conjecture asserts that for any graph $H$, locally dense graphs contain asymptotically at least the number of copies of $H$ found in a random graph with the same edge density. We prove the following results about $k$-subdivisions of graphs (obtained by replacing edges with paths of length $k+1$): (1). If $H$ satisfies the KNRS conjecture, then its $(2k-1)$-subdivision satisfies Sidorenko's conjecture, extending a prior result of Conlon, Kim, Lee and Lee; (2). If $H$ satisfies the KNRS conjecture, then its $2k$-subdivision satisfies a constant-fraction version of the KNRS conjecture; (3). If $H$ is regular and satisfies the KNRS conjecture, then its $2k$-subdivision also satisfies the KNRS conjecture. These findings imply that all balanced subdivisions of cliques satisfy the KNRS conjecture, improving upon a recent result of Brada{\v c}, Sudakov and Wigerson. Our work provides new insights into this pivotal conjecture in extremal graph theory.</description>

      <title>Sum and integral sum graphs -- A survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frank Harary introduced the concepts of sum and integral sum graphs. A graph $G$ is a \textit{sum graph} if the vertices of $G$ can be labeled with distinct positive integers so that $e = uv$ is an edge of $G$ if and only if the sum of the labels on vertices $u$ and $v$ is also a label in $G.$ An \textit{integral sum graph} is also defined just as sum graph, the difference being that the labels may be any distinct integers. In this survey article, the authors bring out several properties of sum and integral sum graphs obtained by different authors.</description>

      <title>Puzzle Ideals for Grassmannians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Puzzles are a versatile combinatorial tool to interpret the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for Grassmannians. In this paper, we propose the concept of puzzle ideals whose varieties one-one correspond to the tilings of puzzles and present an algebraic framework to construct the puzzle ideals which works with the Knutson-Tao-Woodward puzzle and its $T$-equivariant and $K$-theoretic variants for Grassmannians. For puzzles for which one side is free, we propose the side-free puzzle ideals whose varieties one-one correspond to the tilings of side-free puzzles, and the elimination ideals of the side-free puzzle ideals contain all the information of the structure constants for Grassmannians with respect to the free side.
  Besides the underlying algebraic importance of the introduction of these puzzle ideals is the computational feasibility to find all the tilings of the puzzles for Grassmannians by solving the defining polynomial systems, demonstrated with illustrative puzzles via computation of Gr\"obner bases.</description>

Abstract: I establish several inequalities between cardinal characteristics of the continuum. In particular, it is shown that the partition splitting number is not larger than the uniformity of the meagre ideal; not all sets of reals having the cardinality of an (the?) $\varepsilon$-almost bisecting number are of strong measure zero; no fewer sets of strong measure zero than indicated by the statistically reaping number suffice to cover the reals; the pair-splitting number is not smaller than the evasion number; and the subseries number is neither smaller than the pair-splitting number nor than the minimum of the unbounding number and the unbisecting number. Moreover I provide a diagram putting these results into context and give a brief historical account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree of a map between orientable manifolds is a fundamental concept in topology that aids in understanding the structure and properties of the manifolds and the maps between them. Numerous studies have been conducted on the degree of maps between orientable topological spaces. For each $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, we construct a degree $ d$ simplicial map from a $(2(n+1) \max\{|d|,1\})$-facet colored triangulation of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{S}^1$ to the standard $ 2(n+1) $-facet colored triangulation of $ \mathbb{S}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{S}^1 $. We demonstrate that these are the minimal possible colored triangulations for a degree $d $ simplicial self-map of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{S}^1 $, where $n \geq 2 $. Additionally, we construct a minimal degree $d $ simplicial map from a closed orientable $ n$-manifold to $ \mathbb{S}^n $, where $n \geq 1 $.</description>

Abstract: A function is boundedly finite-to-one if there is a natural number $k$ such that each point has at most $k$ inverse images. In this paper, we prove in $\mathsf{ZF}$ (without the axiom of choice) several results concerning this notion, among which are the following:
  (1) For each infinite set $A$ and natural number $n$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{S}(A)$ to $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$, where $\mathcal{S}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ and $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ moving at most $n$ points.
  (2) For each infinite set $A$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{B}(A)$ to $\mathrm{fin}(A)$, where $\mathcal{B}(A)$ is the set of all partitions of $A$ whose blocks are finite and $\mathrm{fin}(A)$ is the set of all finite subsets of $A$.</description>

      <title>Parallel Ising Annealer via Gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising annealer is a promising quantum-inspired computing architecture for combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce an Ising annealer based on the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which updates the variables of all dimensions in parallel. The main innovation is the fusion of an approximate gradient-based approach into the Ising annealer which introduces significant acceleration and allows a portable and scalable implementation on the commercial FPGA. Comprehensive simulation and hardware experiments show that the proposed Ising annealer has promising performance and scalability on all types of benchmark problems when compared to other Ising annealers including the state-of-the-art hardware. In particular, we have built a prototype annealer which solves Ising problems of both integer and fraction coefficients with up to 200 spins on a single low-cost FPGA board, whose performance is demonstrated to be better than the state-of-the-art quantum hardware D-Wave 2000Q and similar to the expensive coherent Ising machine. The sub-linear scalability of the annealer signifies its potential in solving challenging combinatorial optimization problems and evaluating the advantage of quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>On the illumination of 1-symmetric convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ["Illumination of convex bodies with many symmetries", Mathematika 63 (2017)], Tikhomirov verified the Hadwiger-Boltyanski Illumination Conjecture for the class of 1-symmetric convex bodies of sufficiently large dimension. We propose an alternative approach which allows us to settle the conjecture for this class in all dimensions in a uniform way. We also demonstrate that an alternative approach was indeed needed for the low dimensions. Finally, with this alternative method it is possible to solely use illuminating sets which consist of pairs of opposite directions; we thus also answer a question by Lassak, who has suggested this may be possible for any origin-symmetric convex body. As a consequence of this, we can also confirm the X-ray conjecture by Bezdek and Zamfirescu for all 1-symmetric convex bodies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(G,\{\rho_0, \rho_1, \rho_2\})$ be a string C-group of order $4p^m$ with type $\{k_1, k_2\}$ for $m \geq 2$, $k_1, k_2\geq 3$ and $p$ be an odd prime. Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. We prove that $G \cong P \rtimes (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$, $d(P)=2$, and up to duality, $p \mid k_1, 2p \mid k_2$. Moreover, we show that if $P$ is abelian, then $(G,\{\rho_0, \rho_1, \rho_2\})$ is tight and hence known. In the case where $P$ is nonabelian, we construct an infinite family of string C-group with type $\{p, 2p\}$ of order $4p^m$ where $m \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>A simple algorithm for checking equivalence of counting functions on free monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we propose a new algorithm for checking whether two counting functions on a free monoid $M_r$ of rank $r$ are equivalent modulo a bounded function. The previously known algorithm has time complexity $O(n)$ for all ranks $r&gt;2$, however in case $r=2$ it was estimated only as $O(n^2)$. Here we apply a new approach, based on explicit basis expansion and weighted rectangles summation, which allows us to construct a much simpler algorithm with time complexity $O(n)$ for any $r\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>NPA Hierarchy for Quantum Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Man\v{c}inska and Roberson~[FOCS'20] showed that two graphs are quantum isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of planar graphs. Atserias et al.~[JCTB'19] proved that quantum isomorphism is undecidable in general. The NPA hierarchy gives a sequence of semidefinite programming relaxations of quantum isomorphism. Recently, Roberson and Seppelt~[ICALP'23] obtained a homomorphism indistinguishability characterization of the feasibility of each level of the Lasserre hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations of graph isomorphism. We prove a quantum analogue of this result by showing that each level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism of graphs is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over an appropriate class of planar graphs. By combining the convergence of the NPA hierarchy with the fact that the union of these graph classes is the set of all planar graphs, we are able to give a new proof of the result of Man\v{c}inska and Roberson~[FOCS'20] that avoids the use of the theory of quantum groups. This homomorphism indistinguishability characterization also allows us to give a randomized polynomial-time algorithm deciding exact feasibility of each fixed level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We improve upper bounds on sphere packing densities and sizes of spherical codes in high dimensions. In particular, we prove that the maximal sphere packing densities $\delta_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy \[\delta_n\leq \frac{1+o(1)}{e}\cdot \delta^{\text{KL}}_{n}\] for large $n$, where $\delta^{\text{KL}}_{n}$ is the best bound on $\delta_n$ obtained essentially by Kabatyanskii and Levenshtein from the 1970s with improvements over the years. We also obtain the same improvement factor for the maximal size $M(n,\theta)$ of $\theta$-spherical codes in $S^{n-1}$: for angles $0&lt;\theta&lt;\theta'\leq\frac{\pi}{2}$, \[M(n,\theta)\leq \frac{1+o(1)}{e}\cdot \frac{M_{\text{Lev}}(n-1,\theta')}{\mu_n(\theta,\theta')}\] for large $n$, where $\mu_n(\theta,\theta')$ is the mass of the spherical cap in the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$ of radius $\frac{\sin(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta'/2)}$, and $M_{\text{Lev}}(n-1,\theta')$ is Levenshtein's upper bound on $M(n-1,\theta')$ when applying the Delsarte linear programming method to Levenshtein's optimal polynomials. In fact, we prove that there are no analytic losses in our arguments and that the constant $\frac{1}{e}=0.367...$ is optimal for the class of functions considered. Our results also show that the improvement factor does not depend on the special angle $\theta^*=62.997...^{\circ}$, explaining the numerics in arXiv:2001.00185. In the spherical codes case, the above inequality improves the Kabatyanskii--Levenshtein bound by a factor of $0.2304...$ on geometric average. Along the way, we construct a general class of functions using Stiefel manifolds for which we prove general results and study the improvement factors obtained from them in various settings.and study the improvement factors obtained from them in various settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article considers the problem of 3-dimensional genome reconstruction for single-cell data, and the uniqueness of such reconstructions in the setting of haploid organisms. We consider multiple graph models as representations of this problem, and use techniques from graph rigidity theory to determine identifiability. Biologically, our models come from Hi-C data, microscopy data, and combinations thereof. Mathematically, we use unit ball and sphere packing models, as well as models consisting of distance and inequality constraints. In each setting, we describe and/or derive new results on realisability and uniqueness. We then propose a 3D reconstruction method based on semidefinite programming and apply it to synthetic and real data sets using our models.</description>

Abstract: We study the geometry and topology of $\Delta$-Springer varieties associated with two-row partitions. These varieties were introduced in recent work by Griffin-Levinson-Woo to give a geometric realization of a symmetric function appearing in the Delta conjecture by Haglund-Remmel-Wilson. We provide an explicit and combinatorial description of the irreducible components of the two-row $\Delta$-Springer variety and compare it to the ordinary two-row Springer fiber as well as Kato's exotic Springer fiber corresponding to a one-row bipartition. In addition to that, we extend the action of the symmetric group on the homology of the two-row $\Delta$-Springer variety to an action of a degenerate affine Hecke algebra and relate this action to a $\mathfrak{gl}_{2}$-tensor space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop formulas that define permutahedral commutation coherence relations of all orders. To illustrate the result geometrically, we begin by defining a rigid transformation of the $(n+1)$-permutahedron into a $n$-cube of dimensions $1 \times 2 \times \cdots \times n$. With a fictitious assumption, we 'define' the corresponding coherence relations 'up to associativity' as an instance of a semi-simplicial type in the language of Displayed Type Theory. This is not a formal result in type theory, but we expect this to translate into one as soon as the problem of defining associahedral coherences is solved in a type theory with semi-simplicial types. On the other hand, this not-strictly-well-typed definition may be used to produce well-typed formulas in a restricted setting.</description>

      <title>Sharp stability of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality via optimal mass transportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brunn-Minkowski inequality, applicable to bounded measurable sets $A$ and $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, states that $|A+B|^{1/d} \geq |A|^{1/d}+|B|^{1/d}$. Equality is achieved if and only if $A$ and $B$ are convex and homothetic sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The concept of stability in this context concerns how, when approaching equality, sets $A$ and $B$ are close to homothetic convex sets. In a recent breakthrough [FvHT23], the authors of this paper proved the following folklore conjectures on the sharp stability for the Brunn-Minkowski inequality:
  (1) A linear stability result concerning the distance from $A$ and $B$ to their respective convex hulls.

      <title>Regular $3$-polytopes of order $2^np$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.02945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Problems on polytopes, their groups, and realizations, Periodica Math. Hungarica 53 (2006) 231-255] Schulte and Weiss proposed the following problem: {\em Characterize regular polytopes of orders $2^np$ for $n$ a positive integer and $p$ an odd prime}. In this paper, we first prove that if a $3$-polytope of order $2^np$ has Schl\"afli type $\{k_1, k_2\}$, then $p \mid k_1$ or $p \mid k_2$. This leads to two classes, up to duality, for the Schl\"afli type, namely Type (1) where $k_1=2^sp$ and $k_2=2^t$ and Type (2) where $k_1=2^sp$ and $k_2=2^tp$. We then show that there exists a regular $3$-polytope of order $2^np$ with Type (1) when $s\geq 2$, $t\geq 2$ and $n\geq s+t+1$ coming from a general construction of regular $3$-polytopes of order $2^n\ell_1\ell_2$ with Schl\"afli type $\{2^s\ell_1,2^t\ell_2\}$ where both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ are odd. Furthermore, for $p=3$ and $n \geq 7$, we show that there exists a regular 3-polytope of order $3\cdot2^n$ with type $\{6,2^s\}$ if and only if $2\leq s \leq n-2$ and $s \neq n-3$. For Type (2), we prove that there exists a regular $3$-polytope of order $2^n\cdot 3$ with Schl\"afli type $\{6, 6\}$ when $n \ge 5$ coming from a general construction of regular $3$-polytopes of Schl\"afli type $\{6,6\}$ with orders $192m^3$, $384m^3$ or $768m^3$, for any positive integer $m$.</description>

      <title>The Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions for 3 prime factors: the even case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider finite sets $A\subset\mathbb{Z}$ tiles the integers by translations. By periodicity, any such tiling is equivalent to a factorization $A\oplus B=\mathbb{Z}_M$ of a finite cyclic group. Building on por previous work, we prove that a tentative characterization of finite tiles proposed by Coven and Meyerowitz holds for all integer tilings of period $M=(p_ip_jp_k)^2$, where $p_i,p_j,p_k$ are distinct primes. This extends the main result of [15] (Invent. Math. 2023), where we assumed that $M$ is odd. We also improve parts of the argument from [15].
  We have split the earlier (70-page) version into two papers. The current version (49 pages) is the first of the two. The main result is the same as in the previous version: we prove (T2) in the 3-prime even case. The second paper will be posted shortly as a new submission. It will have a new main result where we prove (T2) for a new class of tilings (proved very recently, not included in v1 of this paper). Splitting-related results from the earlier 70-page version of this paper have been moved there.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the power-partible reduction for holonomic (or, P-recursive) sequences and apply it to obtain a series of congruences for Ap\'ery numbers $A_k$. In particular, we prove that, for any $r\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists an integer $\tilde{c}_r$ such that \begin{equation*} \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}(2k+1)^{2r+1}A_k\equiv \tilde{c}_r p \pmod {p^3} \end{equation*} holds for any prime $p&gt;3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pair $(A,B)$ of hypergraphs is called orthogonal if $|a \cap b|=1$ for every pair of edges $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. An orthogonal pair of hypergraphs is called a loom if each of its two members is the set of minimum covers of the other. Looms appear naturally in the context of a conjecture of Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel on the covering number of cross-intersecting hypergraphs. We study their properties and ways of construction, and prove special cases of a conjecture that if true would imply the Gy\'arf\'as--Lehel conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06518v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study pattern avoidance in weak ascent sequences, giving some results for patterns of length 3. This is an analogous study to one given by Duncan and Steingr\'imsson (2011) for ascent sequences. More precisely, we provide systematically the generating functions for the number of weak ascent sequences avoiding the patterns $001, 011, 012, 021$, and $102$. Additionally, we establish bijective connections between pattern-avoiding weak ascent sequences and other combinatorial objects, such as compositions, upper triangular 01-matrices, and plane trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a construction for the kromatic symmetric function $\overline{X}_G$ of a graph introduced by Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl using combinatorial (linearly compact) Hopf algebras. As an application, we show that $\overline{X}_G$ has a positive expansion into multifundamental quasisymmetric functions. We also study two related quasisymmetric $q$-analogues of $\overline{X}_G$, which are $K$-theoretic generalizations of the quasisymmetric chromatic function of Shareshian and Wachs. We classify exactly when one of these analogues is symmetric. For the other, we derive a positive expansion into symmetric Grothendieck functions for graphs $G$ that are natural unit interval orders.</description>

Abstract: Define a queen on $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ with admissible moves parallel to $\mathbf{x}\in\{-1,0,1\}^d$ at arbitrary length. How many queens can be placed on $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ without any two in conflict? In two dimensions, this problem was initiated by P\'{o}lya in 1918 and resolved by Monsky in 1989. We give the first known results in $d$ dimensions, showing that the trivial upper bound $n^{d-1}$ cannot be attained if $n$ is a multiple of $5$, not $25$. We demonstrate, for every $d$, how $n^{d-1}-O(n^{d-2})$ queens can be placed independently.</description>

Abstract: We consider labelings of a finite regular tree by a finite alphabet subject to restrictions specified by a nonnegative transition matrix, propose an algorithm for determining whether the set of possible configurations on the last row of the tree is independent of the symbol at the root, and prove that the algorithm succeeds in a bounded number of steps, provided that the dimension of the tree is greater than or equal to the maximum row sum of the transition matrix. (The question was motivated by calculation of topological pressure on trees and is an extension of the idea of primitivity for nonnegative matrices.)</description>

      <title>Towards odd-sunflowers: temperate families and lightnings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by odd-sunflowers, introduced recently by Frankl, Pach, and P{\'a}lv{\"o}lgyi, we initiate the study of temperate families: a family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \mathcal{P}([n])$ is said to be \emph{temperate} if each $A \in \mathcal{F}$ contains at most $|A|$ elements of $\mathcal{F}$ as a proper subset.
  We show that the maximum size of a temperate family is attained by the middle two layers of the hypercube $\{0,1\}^n$. As a more general result, we obtain that the middle $t+1$ layers of the hypercube maximise the size of a family $\mathcal{F}$ such that each $A \in \mathcal{F}$ contains at most $\sum_{j=1}^t \binom{|A|}{j}$ elements of $\mathcal{F}$ as a proper subset. Moreover, we classify all such families consisting of the maximum number of sets.
  In the case of intersecting temperate families, we find the maximum size and classify all intersecting temperate families consisting of the maximum number of sets for odd $n$. We also conjecture the maximum size for even $n$.</description>

      <title>Optimal bounds for zero-sum cycles. I. Odd order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite (not necessarily Abelian) group $(\Gamma,\cdot)$, let $n(\Gamma) \in \mathbb{N}$ denote the smallest positive integer $n$ such that for every labelling of the arcs of the complete digraph of order $n$ using elements from $\Gamma$, there exists a directed cycle such that the arc-labels along the cycle multiply to the identity. Alon and Krivelevich initiated the study of the parameter $n(\cdot)$ on cyclic groups and proved $n(\mathbb{Z}_q)=O(q \log q)$. This was later improved to a linear bound of $n(\Gamma)\le 8|\Gamma|$ for every finite Abelian group by M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros and the last author, and then further to $n(\Gamma)\le 2|\Gamma|-1$ for every non-trivial finite group independently by Berendsohn, Boyadzhiyska and Kozma as well as by Akrami, Alon, Chaudhury, Garg, Mehlhorn and Mehta.
  In this series of two papers we conclude this line of research by proving that $n(\Gamma)\le |\Gamma|+1$ for every finite group $(\Gamma,\cdot)$, which is the best possible such bound in terms of the group order and precisely determines the value of $n(\Gamma)$ for all cyclic groups as $n(\mathbb{Z}_q)=q+1$.
  In the present paper we prove the above result for all groups of odd order. The proof for groups of even order needs to overcome substantial additional obstacles and will be presented in the second part of this series.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a distance-regular graph with diameter $D \geq 2$. Let $E$ denote a primitive idempotent of $\Gamma$ with respect to which $\Gamma$ is $Q$-polynomial. Assume that there exists a $3$-clique $x,y,z$ such that $E\hat{x},E\hat{y},E\hat{z}$ are linearly dependent. In this paper, we classify all the $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graphs $\Gamma$ with the above property. We describe these graphs from multiple points of view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zorn's Lemma is a well-known equivalent of the Axiom of Choice. It is usually regarded as a topic in axiomatic set theory, and its historically standard proof (from the Axiom of Choice) relies on transfinite recursion, a non-elementary set-theoretic machinery. However, the statement of Zorn's Lemma itself uses only elementary terminology for partially ordered sets. Therefore, it is worthy to establish a proof using only such elementary terminology. Following this line of study, we give a new simple proof of Zorn's Lemma, which does not even use the notion of a well-ordered set.</description>

      <title>Overview on the theory of double flag varieties for symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $ G $ be a connected reductive algebraic group and its symmetric subgroup $ K $. The variety $ \dblFV = K/Q \times G/P $ is called a double flag variety, where $ Q $ and $ P $ are parabolic subgroups of $ K $ and $ G $ respectively.
  In this article, we make a survey on the theory of double flag varieties for a symmetric pair $ (G, K) $ and report entirely new results and theorems on this theory.
  Most important topic is the finiteness of $ K $-orbits on $ \dblFV $. We summarize the classification of $ \dblFV $ of finite type, which are scattered in the literatures. In some respects such classifications are complete, and in some cases not. In particular, we get a classification of double flag varieties of finite type when a symmetric pair is of type AIII, using the theorems of Homma who describes ``indecomposable'' objects of such double flag varieties. Together with these classifications, newly developed embedding theory provides double flag varieties of finite type, which are new. Other ingredients in this article are Steinberg theory, generalization of Robinson-Schensted correspondence, and orbit classification via quiver representations.
  We hope this article is useful for those who want to study the theory of double flag varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dominating sets in graphs are often used to model some monitoring of the graph: guards are posted on the vertices of the dominating set, and they can thus react to attacks occurring on the unguarded vertices by moving there (yielding a new set of guards, which may not be dominating anymore). A dominating set is eternal if it can endlessly resist to attacks. From the attacker's perspective, if we are given a non-eternal dominating set, the question is to determine how fast can we provoke an attack that cannot be handled by a neighboring guard. We investigate this question from a computational complexity point of view, by showing that this question is PSPACE-hard, even for graph classes where finding a minimum eternal dominating set is in P. We then complement this result by giving polynomial time algorithms for cographs and trees, and showing a connection with tree-depth for the latter. We also investigate the problem from a parameterized complexity perspective, mainly considering two parameters: the number of guards and the number of steps.</description>

Abstract: We construct a version of Lagrangian Floer homology whose chain complex is generated by the inscriptions of a rectangle into a real analytic Jordan curve. By using its associated spectral invariants, we establish that a rectifiable Jordan curve admits inscriptions of a whole interval of rectangles. In particular, it inscribes a square if the area it encloses is more than half that of a circle of equal diameter.</description>

We show for any $i\leq k$ and $f:X(i)\to [0,1]$: \[\Pr_{s\in X(k)}\left[\left|\underset{{t\subseteq s}}{\mathbb{E}}[f(t)]-\mu\right|\geq\varepsilon\right]\leq exp\left(-\varepsilon^2\frac{k}{i}\right).\] Using this fact, we prove that high dimensional expanders are reverse hypercontractive, a powerful functional inequality from discrete analysis implying that for any sets $A,B \subset X(k)$, the probability a $\rho$-correlated pair passes between them is at least \[\Pr_{s,s' \sim T_\rho}[s \in A, s' \in B] \geq \Pr[A]^{O(1)} \Pr[B]^{O(1)}.\] Our results hold under weak spectral assumptions on $X$. Namely we prove exponential concentration of measure for any complex below the `Trickling-Down Threshold' (beyond which concentration may be arbitrarily poor), and optimal concentration for $\sqrt{k}$-skeletons of such complexes. We also show optimal bounds for the top dimension of stronger HDX among other settings. We leverage our inequalities to prove several new agreement testing theorems on high dimensional expanders, including a new 99%-regime test for subsets, and a variant of the `Z-test' achieving inverse exponential soundness under the stronger assumption of $\ell_\infty$-expansion. The latter gives rise to the first optimal testers beyond the complete complex and products, a stepping stone toward the use of HDX in strong soundness PCPs. We also give applications within expansion, analysis, combinatorics, and coding theory, including a proof that two-sided HDX have optimal geometric overlap (giving the first explicit bounded-degree construction), near-optimal double samplers, new super-exponential degree lower bounds for certain HDX, distance-amplified list-decodable and locally testable codes, a Frankl-R\"odl Theorem and more.</description>

      <title>Sparse High Dimensional Expanders via Local Lifts</title>

Abstract: High dimensional expanders (HDXs) are a hypergraph generalization of expander graphs. They are extensively studied in the math and TCS communities due to their many applications. Like expander graphs, HDXs are especially interesting for applications when they are bounded degree, namely, if the number of edges adjacent to every vertex is bounded. However, only a handful of constructions are known to have this property, all of which rely on algebraic techniques. In particular, no random or combinatorial construction of bounded degree HDXs is known. As a result, our understanding of these objects is limited. The degree of an $i$-face in an HDX is the number of $(i+1)$-faces containing it. In this work we construct HDXs whose higher dimensional faces have bounded degree. This is done by giving an elementary and deterministic algorithm that takes as input a regular $k$-dimensional HDX $X$ and outputs another $k$-dimensional HDX $\widehat{X}$ with twice as many vertices. While the degree of vertices in $\widehat{X}$ grows, the degree of the $(k-1)$-faces in $\widehat{X}$ stays the same. As a result, we obtain a new `algebra-free' construction of HDXs whose $(k-1)$-face degree is bounded. Our algorithm is based on a simple and natural generalization of the construction by Bilu and Linial (Combinatorica, 2006), which build expanders using lifts coming from edge signings. Our construction is based on local lifts of HDXs, where a local lift is a complex whose top-level links are lifts of links in the original complex. We demonstrate that a local lift of an HDX is an HDX in many cases. In addition, combining local lifts with existing bounded degree constructions creates new families of bounded degree HDXs with significantly different links than before. For every large enough $D$, we use this technique to construct families of bounded degree HDXs with links that have diameter $\geq D$.</description>

      <title>Hilbert series for contractads and modular compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contractads are operadic-type algebraic structures well-suited for describing configuration spaces indexed by a simple connected graph $\Gamma$. Specifically, these configuration spaces are defined as $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X):=X^{|V(\Gamma)|}\setminus \cup_{(ij)\in E(\Gamma)} \{x_i=x_j\}$. In this paper, we explore functional equations for the Hilbert series of Koszul dual contractads and provide explicit Hilbert series for fundamental contractads such as the commutative, Lie, associative and the little discs contractads.
  Additionally, we focus on a particular contractad derived from the wonderful compactifications of $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{k})$, for $\mathbb{k}=\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}$. First, we demonstrate that for complete multipartite graphs, the associated wonderful compactifications coincide with the modular compactifications introduced by Smyth. Second, we establish that the homology of the complex points and the homology of the real locus of the wonderful contractad are both quadratic and Koszul contractads. We offer a detailed description of generators and relations, extending the concepts of the Hypercommutative operad and cacti operads, respectively. Furthermore, using the functional equations for the Hilbert series, we describe the corresponding Hilbert series for the homology of modular compactifications.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of theta functions as Traces of Partition Eisenstein series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his "lost notebook'', Ramanujan used iterated derivatives of two theta functions to define sequences of $q$-series $\{U_{2t}(q)\}$ and $\{V_{2t}(q)\}$ that he claimed to be quasimodular. We give the first explicit proof of this claim by expressing them in terms of "partition Eisenstein series'', extensions of the classical Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(q)$ defined by $$\lambda=(1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2},\dots, n^{m_n}) \vdash n \ \ \ \ \ \longmapsto \ \ \ \ \ E_{\lambda}(q):= E_2(q)^{m_1} E_4(q)^{m_2}\cdots E_{2n}(q)^{m_n}. $$ For functions $\phi : \mathcal{P}\mapsto \mathbb{C}$ on partitions, the weight $2n$ partition Eisenstein trace is $$ \text{Tr}_n(\phi;q):=\sum_{\lambda \vdash n} \phi(\lambda)E_{\lambda}(q). $$ For all $t$, we prove that $U_{2t}(q)=\text{Tr}_t(\phi_u;q)$ and $V_{2t}(q)=\text{Tr}_t(\phi_v;q),$ where $\phi_u$ and $\phi_v$ are natural partition weights, giving the first explicit quasimodular formulas for these series.</description>
