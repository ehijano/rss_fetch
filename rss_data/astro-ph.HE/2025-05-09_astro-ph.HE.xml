      <title>Mapping Cassiopeia A's silicon/sulfur Doppler velocities with XRISM-Resolve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young supernova remnants (SNRs) provide crucial insights into explosive nucleosynthesis products and their velocity distribution soon after the explosion. However, these velocities are influenced by the dynamics of the circumstellar medium (CSM), which originates from the progenitor's late-phase mass loss. Cas A, the youngest known Galactic core-collapse SNR, was studied to analyze the spatial distribution of Si and S radial velocities using two high-spectral resolution observations from the XRISM-Resolve imaging spectrometer.Resolve's capabilities enabled the detailed characterization of Si XIII, Si XIV, S XV, and S XVI lines, whose line shapes can be resolved and modeled using Gaussian radial-velocity components. The radial velocities measured generally align with previous CCD-based results, confirming that they were not artifacts caused by blended lines or ionization variations. Modeling line profiles with two-component Gaussians improved fits in some regions, revealing distinct redshifted (backside) and blueshifted (frontside) components only in a few specific areas. In most regions, however, both components were either both redshifted (northwest) or both blueshifted (southeast), consistent with the patchy ejecta shell morphology seen in optically emitting fast-moving knots. The individual line components revealed a line broadening ranging from $\sigma_v \approx 200$ to $\sigma_v \approx 2000$ km/s. Components with $1000 \lesssim \sigma_v \lesssim 2000$km/s are consistent with previously determined reverse shock velocities, suggesting non-equilibrated or partially equilibrated ion temperatures. Narrow components with small radial velocities found near Cas A's projected center likely originate from shocked CSM plasma. But the low radial velocity and small $\sigma_v$ defies identifying these components with either the frontside or backside of the SNR, or both.</description>

      <title>Final Moments III: Explosion Properties and Progenitor Constraints of CSM-Interacting Type II Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analysis of the plateau and late-time phase properties of a sample of 39 Type II supernovae (SNe II) that show narrow, transient, high-ionization emission lines (i.e., "IIn-like") in their early-time spectra from interaction with confined, dense circumstellar material (CSM). Originally presented by Jacobson-Gal\'an et al 2024a, this sample also includes multicolor light curves and spectra extending to late-time phases of 35 SNe with no evidence for IIn-like features at &lt;2 days after first light. We measure photospheric phase light-curve properties for the distance-corrected sample and find that SNe II with IIn-like features have significantly higher luminosities and decline rates at +50 days than the comparison sample, which could be connected to inflated progenitor radii, lower ejecta mass, and/or persistent CSM interaction. However, we find no statistical evidence that the measured plateau durations and $^{56}$Ni masses of SNe II with and without IIn-like features arise from different distributions. We estimate progenitor zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses for all SNe with nebular spectroscopy through spectral model comparisons and find that most objects, both with and without IIn-like features, are consistent with progenitor masses &lt;12.5 M$_{\odot}$. Combining progenitor ZAMS masses with CSM densities inferred from early-time spectra suggests multiple channels for enhanced mass loss in the final years before core collapse such as a convection-driven chromosphere or binary interaction. Finally, we find spectroscopic evidence for ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction at radii $&gt;10^{16}$ cm, consistent with substantial progenitor mass-loss rates of $\sim 10^{-4}$--$10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w &lt; 50$ km/s) in the final centuries to millennia before explosion.</description>

      <title>Tidal effects on primordial black hole capture in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the capture of a primordial black hole (PBH) by a neutron star, accounting for the tidal perturbation from a nearby star or planet. For asteroid-mass PBHs, which could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe, a weakly bound post-capture orbit could be tidally disturbed to the point of preventing the PBH from settling in the neutron star and consuming it within a cosmologically short timescale. We show how this effect depends on environmental parameters and can weaken the proposed constraints based on observations of old neutron stars in high-density dark matter environments for PBH masses $\lesssim 10^{22}\,$g. We also provide approximate analytical formulae for the capture rates.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Formation Mechanisms of Double Neutron Star Systems: An Analytical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double Neutron Stars (DNSs) are unique probes to study various aspects of modern astrophysics. Recent discoveries have confirmed direct connections between DNSs and supernova explosions. This provides valuable information about the evolutionary history of these systems, especially regarding whether the second-born Neutron Star (NS) originated from either a Core-Collapse ($CC$) or Electron-Capture Supernovae ($ECSNe$) event. The provided scale diagram illustrates the distribution of different types of DNSs on the basis of their orbital parameters and other factors, including mass loss. As a result, the physical processes in DNSs vary depending on the formation mechanisms of the second-born NS and characteristics of the systems. $ECSNe$ processes are typically associated with merging systems ($e\times{P_{orb}}&lt; 0.05$), while $CC$ processes are more commonly linked to non-merging systems ($e\times{P_{orb}}&gt; 0.05$). Our results suggest a critical mass threshold of 1.30$M_\odot \pm 0.22M_\odot$ (critical value) for the $ECSNe$ process to form an NS, while $CC$ processes might occur at higher masses. Examining the orbital parameters of DNSs in a known gravitational potential can enhance our understanding of the theoretical predictions for DNS progenitor characteristics. It turns out that the $ECSNe$ process predominantly produces DNS systems with short orbital ($P_{orb} \leq 0.25 d$), nearly circular orbits ($e\simeq 0.2$), accompanied by minimal kick velocities imparted on the proto-NS and significant mass loss. In contrast, their orbital dynamics in a known gravitational potential plays a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the SNe geometry and the formation and evolution processes among different NS samples.</description>

      <title>SRG/ART-XC discovery of pulsations from RX J0535.0-6700: another X-ray pulsar in the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC onboard the SRG observatory we have detected, for the first time, X-ray pulsations with a period of ~106 s from the poorly-studied high-mass X-ray binary RX J0535.0-6700 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), thus proving that the accretor is a neutron star with strong magnetic field. Pulsations with similar period were also found in archival archival data from Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Using photometry from WISE we shown that the source demonstrate significant variability in IR during the last twenty years, which could be caused by a secular evolution of the decretion disk. This discovery makes RX J0535.0-6700 another member of the large family of X-ray pulsars with Be-type companions in the LMC.</description>

      <title>Constraining the environment of compact binary mergers with self-lensing signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) can come from different environments. GWs interact gravitationally with astrophysical objects, which makes it possible to use gravitational lensing by nearby objects (self-lensing) to learn about their environments. We quantify the probability of self-lensing through the optical depth $\tau$ for the main channels of detectable GWs at frequencies $f_{\rm GW}\sim (1-10^3)\,{\rm Hz}$. We then analyze the detectability of the lensing effect (imprint). In star clusters, the probability of self-lensing by stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is low ($\tau\simeq10^{-7}$), even when taking into account nearby BHs in resonant interactions ($\tau\simeq 10^{-5}$). Additionally, the lensing imprint of a stellar-mass lens (diffraction and interference) is too marginal to be detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and most Einstein Telescope signals. For a massive BH lens in the center of a cluster, the probability can reach $\tau\simeq 10^{-4}$ either via von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai induced mergers of BBHs orbiting a central massive BH or BBHs formed as GW captures in single-single interactions in the Bahcall-Wolf cusp of a nuclear cluster, likely eccentric. For self-lensing by a supermassive BH for BBHs in the migration trap of an AGN (active galactic nucleus) disk, $\tau \simeq 10^{-2}$. The imprint of these massive lenses are two images that are easily detectable already in current detectors. Moreover, AGN disk merger signals have a distinct linear $h_+$ polarization. The probability depends on the extent of the detectability through the threshold impact parameter $y_{\rm max}$, which can increase for future detectors. We conclude that constraining the environment of BBHs is possible by combining self-lensing imprints with other waveform signatures such as eccentricity and polarization.</description>

      <title>Variabilities of Gamma-ray Bursts from the Dynamics of Fallback Material after Tidal Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 211211A and GRB 060614, believed to originate from the merger of compact objects, exhibit similarities to the jetted tidal disruption event (TDE) Sw J1644+57, by showing violent variabilities in the light-curve during the decay phase. Previous studies suggest that such fluctuations in TDE may arise from the fallback of tidal disrupted debris. In this paper, we introduce the fluctuations of the mass distribution ${\rm d}M/{\rm d}E$ for the debris ejected during the tidal disruption (with energy $E$) and study their impact on jet power. Turbulence induced by tidal force and the self-gravity of the debris may imprint variabilities in ${\rm d}M/{\rm d}E$ during fallback. We model these fluctuations with a power density spectrum $\propto f_{\rm E}^{\beta}$, where $f_{\rm E} = 1/E$ and $\beta$ is the power-law index. We find that the resulting light curve can preserve the fluctuation characteristics from ${\rm d}M/{\rm d}E$. In addition, the observed fluctuations in the light-curves can be reproduced for a given suitable $\beta$. Based on the observations, we find that the value of $\beta$ should be around $-1$.</description>

      <title>On the polarimetric response of the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope and its impact on precision pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \citet{Guillemot2023} we presented a new method for calibrating pulsar observations conducted with the Nan\c{c}ay decimetric Radio Telescope (NRT), which significantly improved NRT polarimetric measurements and pulsar timing quality for data taken after this method was developed, in November 2019. Results hinted at a dependence of the polarimetric response of the NRT on the observed direction. We investigated this potential dependence, since unaccounted variations of the instrumental response could degrade polarimetric measurements. Additionally, we aimed to develop a method for properly calibrating NRT pulsar observations conducted before November 2019. We conducted three series of observations of bright pulsars over wide declination ranges, in a special observation mode in which the feed horn rotates by $\sim$ 180$^\circ$ degrees across the observation, enabling us to determine the full polarimetric response of the NRT while modeling potential variations of calibration parameters with hour angle and declination. In addition, we used the METM technique to improve the calibration of pre-November 2019 data. From the analysis of the series of observations of bright pulsars with horn rotation, we found that the polarimetric response of the NRT does not appear to vary with hour angle or declination. On the other hand, the new METM-based calibration method appears to significantly improve the calibration of pre-November 2019 data. By analyzing NRT data on a selection of millisecond pulsars we found that the new polarimetric profiles are more homogeneous, they generally have larger signal-to-noise ratios, and found that the TOA data for these MSPs are more accurate and contain lower levels of noise, especially when combining the new calibration method with the \textit{Matrix Template Matching} (MTM) method for extracting TOAs from pulsar observations.</description>

      <title>850 SRG/eROSITA X-ray sources associated with Pleiades stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky X-ray survey and the GAIA-based catalog of 2,209 members of the Pleiades open star cluster, we found 850 X-ray sources associated with the cluster stars. Over 650 of them were detected in X-rays for the first time. At the distance of the Pleiades, the nominal sensitivity of eROSITA corresponds to a luminosity of $L_X \sim 1.6 \cdot 10^{28}$ erg/s in the 0.3-2.3 keV band. The eROSITA sources associated with Pleiades stars have a total luminosity of $L_{X,tot} \sim 1.3 \cdot 10^{32}$ erg/s , a million times greater than the X-ray luminosity of the quiet Sun. Strong X-ray variability, more than 10 times, was recorded for 27 sources. Most of them are known as eruptive optical variables of the dM class. The value of $R_X=log(L_X/L_{bol})$ increases with decreasing effective temperature of the star from $R_X\approx -5$ to $R_X\approx -2$. The distribution of stars over $R_X$ is bimodal, with the left peak at $R_X\sim-4.3$ being formed by stars of FGK classes, and the right peak at $R_X\sim-3.1$ being mainly populated by M-stars. The relation between $R_X$ and the Rossby number $Ro$ depends on the spectral class. For K- and M- stars, at low Rossby numbers $R_X\sim -3$ and depends weakly on $Ro$. At $Ro \gt 0.25$, a rapid drop in $R_X$ is observed for K stars, while in our sample there are no M stars with large Rossby number. Most of F- and G- stars appear to have smaller $R_X\sim -4.5$, however, our sample size is insufficient for a more detailed characterization of their $R_X-Ro$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Searching for pulsars in Globular Clusters with the Fast Fold Algorithm and a new pulsar discovered in M13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employed the Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA) on L-Band Globular Cluster (GC) observations taken with Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for new pulsars, especially those with a long rotational period. We conducted a search across 16 GCs that collectively host 93 known pulsars, as well as 14 GCs that do not contain any known pulsars. The majority of these known pulsars were successfully re-detected in our survey. The few non-detections could be attributed to the high accelerations of these pulsars. Additionally, we have discovered a new binary millisecond pulsar, namely M13I (or PSR J1641+3627I) in GC M13 (or NGC 6205), and obtained its phase-coherent timing solution using observations spanning 6 years. M13I has a spin period of 6.37 ms, and an orbital period of 18.23 days. The eccentricity of the binary orbit is 0.064, with a companion mass range of approximately 0.45 to 1.37 M$_{\odot}$. The orbital properties of M13I are remarkably different from those of the other known pulsars in M13, indicating that this pulsar has undergone a different evolutionary path compared to the rest.</description>

Abstract: Swift J1727.8-1613 went into outburst in August 2023 and was one of the brightest black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in recent years, leading to extensive observing campaigns by NICER and Insight-HXMT. The source exhibited strong X-ray variability and showed type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) on a wide range of frequencies. The high data quality over a broad range of X-ray energies (0.5-150 keV) enables us to study the energy-dependence of the QPO waveform and the phase lags at the QPO fundamental and second harmonic frequencies. Using the biphase, we find that the QPO waveform is strongly energy-dependent, with energy bands below and above 15-20 keV showing opposite waveform evolution. We interpret the energy-dependence of the waveform as being due to a pivoting spectral component at the second harmonic frequency, with a pivot energy around 15-20 keV. Using the cross-spectrum, we find that the phase lags between energy bands above 7 keV at the QPO fundamental are small, while those at the harmonic frequency are dominated by a separate lag component that extends over a broader range of frequencies and relates to the broadband noise variability. Comparing the energy-dependent results obtained with the bispectrum and the cross-spectrum, we show that these two Fourier products extract different variability components, e.g. the QPO and the broadband noise, at the same frequencies. Finally, we compare Swift J1727.8-1613 to BHXRB MAXI J1535-571 and find that their spectral-timing properties are similar, indicating that these QPO properties may represent a subset of sources.</description>

      <title>Orbital phase shifts of Type-I outbursts in EXO 2030+375</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EXO 2030+375 is a peculiar high-mass X-ray binary that has been exhibiting Type-I outburst activities consistently over the past decades. The phases of outburst peaks are generally stable and occur near the orbital periastron.However, significant orbital phase shifts have occasionally been observed in 1995, 2006, and 2016. In this paper, we report another orbital phase shift triggered by a giant outburst in 2021. During this event, the orbital phase of Type-I outburst peaks changed dramatically, moving from near periastron to 20 days after periastron, followed by a gradual recovery. Additionally, for several cycles after the 2021 giant outburst, some Type-I outbursts were missing, with subsequent outbursts occurring every two orbits. We discuss our observations in the frame of the precession of an eccentric Be disk.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Little Red Dots from Binary Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a distinctive v-shape spectrum characterized by red optical and blue UV continuum emission. Their high abundance at redshifts of $z\sim6-8$ and decline at lower redshifts suggest a transient origin. We propose that the spectral shape of LRDs originates from compact binary black hole systems, where each black hole is surrounded by a mini-disk and embedded in a larger circum-binary disk. With a binary separation of $\lesssim 10^3$ Schwarzschild radii, the Wien tail of a $T\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$ blackbody spectrum at the inner edge of the circum-binary disk produces the red optical emission, while the mini-disks power the UV continuum. Binary torques carve out a gap between the circum-binary disk and mini-disks, setting the turnover wavelength of the v-shaped spectrum around the Balmer limit. This scenario naturally reproduces LRD spectra requiring only modest dust attenuation ($A_V\lesssim 1$ mag), resolving overestimated luminosities for LRDs in previous studies and alleviating a tension with the so-called Soltan argument. This model predicts a distinct spectral evolution as the binary orbit decays through binary-disk interactions and gravitational waves (GWs), linking early-stage "proto-LRD" binaries to the broader AGN population and late-stage "LRD-descendants" to coalescing binaries detectable in GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as ultra-long period objects after a dormant cooling epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-long period transients (ULPs) are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for isolated ULPs, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$~hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as Galactic ULPs may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</description>

      <title>Significant reflection and absorption effects in the X-ray emission of the Intermediate Polar IGR J17195-4100</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray emission is from shock-heated plasma in magnetic cataclysmic variables, and is processed by absorption and scattering before reaching the observer. We investigate these effects in the X-ray emission of the Intermediate Polar IGR J17195-4100 by carrying out the X-ray spectral analysis, spin modulation and hardness ratio. We present high-sensitivity broadband X-ray spectral analysis by combining NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations in the 0.3-78.0 keV energy range. The X-ray spectral analysis is performed using six composite models, including the angle-dependent reflection model (reflect), multi-temperature plasma emission models (CEVMKL, MKCFLOW), and photoionised and/or neutral partially covering absorption models (zxipcf, pcfabs) within XSPEC. We examine also the spin modulation in four energy ranges and the hardness ratio, to determine the absorption and scattering effects. We find that the spectrum is best modelled with a reflection amplitude ($\Omega$) of 0.58 $^{+0.38}_{-0.26}$, an ionisation parameter, log($\xi$), of 1.46$^{+0.44}_{-0.23}$ with an equivalent hydrogen column density of 3.09$^{+2.26}_{-0.68}$ $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, a neutral absorber, and a multi-temperature plasma temperature of 27.14$^{+2.0}_{-2.13}$ keV. In addition, we detect effects of electron scattering in the NuSTAR band, leading to modulation amplitude of about a steady 9$\%$ that increases up to 15$\%$ after 20 keV. We stress that these effects significantly affect the X-ray emission of intermediate polars and should be considered to obtain a good representation of the intrinsic spectrum.</description>

      <title>The soft X-ray transient EP241021a: a cosmic explosion with a complex off-axis jet and cocoon from a massive progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) are fast X-ray transients discovered by the BeppoSAX satellite, showing an isotropic sky distribution and a prompt emission duration between 10-1000 seconds. The observed prompt X-ray spectrum is similar to Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), but with a softer peak energy of the spectrum. Several pieces of evidence indicate that XRFs are connected to GRBs and likely represent their softer analogues, but their origin is still unclear. Several models have been proposed to explain the observed properties of XRF, mostly in the context of collapsar scenario, similar to GRBs but with different geometrical or physical conditions of the progenitor. These include off-axis GRBs and baryon-loaded explosions, that either produce a low Lorentz factor jet or a spherical mildly (or non-) relativistic ejecta, known as cocoons. In this paper, we present multi-wavelength observations of the afterglow of EP241021a, a soft X-ray transient detected by EP, consistent with being an XRF. We present the results of our multiwavelength campaign from radio (uGMRT, ATCA, e-MERLIN, ALMA), optical (LBT, GTC, CAHA) and X-rays (EP-FXT). EP241021a afterglow is characterized by multiple components. They represent the imprints of the interaction of a jet with the complex environment of the pre-existing progenitor, that is likely shaping its structure from a highly relativistic narrow cone to much broader and mildly relativistic cocoon components.</description>

      <title>Antinuclei from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light primordial black holes (PBHs) may have originated in the early Universe, and could contribute to the dark matter in the Universe. Their Hawking evaporation into particles could eventually lead to the production of antinuclei, which propagate and arrive at Earth as cosmic rays with a flux peaked at GeV energies. We revisit here the antiproton and antideuteron signatures from PBH evaporation, relying on a lognormal PBH mass distribution, state-of-the-art propagation models, and an improved coalescence model for fusion into antideuterons. Our predictions are then compared with AMS-02 data on the antiproton flux. We find that the AMS-02 antiproton data severely constrain the Galactic PBH density, setting bounds that depend significantly on the parameters of the lognormal mass distribution, and that are comparable to or slightly stronger than bounds set from diverse messengers. We also discuss prospects for future detection of antideuterons. Given the bounds from AMS-02 antiproton data, we predict that if antideuterons were to be measured by AMS-02 or GAPS, since the secondary contribution is subdominant, they would clearly be a signal of new physics, only part of which could, however, be explained by PBH evaporation.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in rotating dark matter spikes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) signals from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are a key observational target for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The waveforms may be affected by the astrophysical environment surrounding the central black hole (BH), and in particular by the surrounding dark matter (DM) distribution. In this work, we consider the effect of a rotating DM "spike" around a central Kerr BH, and assess its detectability with LISA. Using a fully relativistic model for the rotating spike, we investigate its effect on the inspiral and hence on the emitted GW signals. We compute dephasings and mismatches to quantify how the spin of the primary BH affects the binary dynamics and the gravitational waveform. We show that the modifications due to the spin of the primary BH improve the detection prospects of DM spikes with LISA, and must be taken into account for future parameter estimation studies. We also estimate within post-Newtonian theory how the environment affects the background metric, and show that this effect is mostly negligible for the systems we consider.</description>

      <title>Insights into Neutron Star Matter: EoS Models and Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars is a crucial topic in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), influencing their structure, stability, and observable properties. This review classifies EoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints. While hadronic models characterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from hyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter, and quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or entirely quark-composed stars. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical and observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their implications, and future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ionized interstellar medium disperses pulsar radio signals, resulting in a stochastic time-variable delay known as the dispersion measure (DM) noise. In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, we measure a DM together with a time of arrival from a pulsar observation to handle frequency-dependent profile evolution, interstellar scintillation, and radio frequency interference more robustly, and to reduce data volumes. In this paper, we derive a method to incorporate arbitrary models of DM variation, including Gaussian process models, in pulsar timing and noise analysis and pulsar timing array analysis. This generalizes the existing method for handling DM noise in wideband datasets.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic and Electromagnetic Discrepancies between Neutron Star and Black Hole Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exterior spacetime geometry surrounding an uncharged, spinning black hole in general relativity depends only upon its mass and spin. However, the exterior geometry surrounding any other rotating compact object, for example a neutron star, will generally depend upon higher moments in its multipole expansion, which will in turn be dependent upon the object's equation of state. Using general relativistic hydrodynamics and electrodynamics simulations, we illustrate that the presence or absence of these higher moments (assuming a physically realistic neutron star equation of state) has a significant qualitative effect near the surface of the compact object on the dynamics of unmagnetized accretion, and a smaller quantitative effect on the electromagnetic field configuration of its magnetosphere. In some places, the discrepancies in energy-momentum density are found to reach or exceed 50%, with electric field strength discrepancies in excess of 10%. We argue that many of these differences are likely to be amplified by the inclusion of more sophisticated plasma physics models, and are therefore likely to be relevant for the dynamics of gravitational collapse, and potentially also for particle acceleration and jet launching. These discrepancies suggest important limitations regarding the use of the Kerr metric when performing numerical simulations around neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-universal relations are known to exist among various neutron star observables that do not depend sensitively on the underlying nuclear matter equations of state. For example, some of these relations imply that the tidally induced multipole moments are approximately characterized by the electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability. Such relations can be used to reduce the number of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling, thereby allowing us to infer extreme nuclear matter properties more accurately and test General Relativity in an insensitive manner to uncertainties in nuclear physics. We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into approximate universality of neutron stars. Our approach employs a semi-analytic relativistic stellar interior model, which extends the Tolman VII solution, thereby enabling a refined exploration of the tidal properties of nonrotating stars within a semi-analytic framework. The derived power-law relations among various tidal deformabilities -- referred to as the universal Love relations -- agree well with expressions in previous work found empirically. We elucidate how the equation-of-state dependence is suppressed in a particular combination of macroscopic physical parameters induced by perturbations and demonstrate that the relation between the moment of inertia and electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability (I-Love relation) rests on the same underlying mechanism. Our findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be attributed to low compressibility, consistent with some of the previous studies on the possible origin of the universality.</description>

      <title>Exploring the range of impacts of helium in the spectra of double detonation models for Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonations for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) suggest a distinguishing property of this scenario is unburnt helium in the outer ejecta. However, modern explosion simulations suggest there may be significant variations in its mass and velocity distribution. We recently presented a NLTE (non local thermodynamic equilibrium) radiative transfer simulation for one realisation of the double detonation scenario with a modest He mass (0.018 M${\odot}$) present in the ejecta at relatively high velocities (${\sim}18000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). That simulation predicted a He I 10830$\,\r{A}$ feature blueward of Mg II 10927$\,\r{A}$ consistent with near-infrared observations of "transitional" SNe Ia. To demonstrate the expected diversity in the helium signature, here we present a calculation for a double detonation model with a higher He mass (${\sim}$0.04 M${\odot}$) ejected at lower velocities (${\sim}13000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Despite our simulation predicting no clear optical or 2 micron helium features, a strong and persistent He I 10830$\,\r{A}$ absorption is present. The feature appears at wavelengths consistent with the extended blue wing of the Mg II 10927$\,\r{A}$ feature sometimes present in observations, suggesting this is a helium spectral signature (although for this particular model it is too strong and persistent to be consistent with normal SNe Ia). The significant differences in He I 10830$\,\r{A}$ predicted by the two simulations suggests helium spectral signatures likely show significant variation throughout the SNe Ia population. This motivates further work to use this observable signature to test the parameter space for double detonation models.</description>

      <title>On the Double: Two Luminous Flares from the Nearby Tidal Disruption Event ASASSN-22ci (AT2022dbl) and Connections to Repeating TDE Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observations of ASASSN-22ci (AT2022dbl), a nearby tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) at a distance of d$_L \simeq 125$ Mpc. Roughly two years after the initial ASAS-SN discovery, a second flare was detected coincident with ASASSN-22ci. UV/optical photometry and optical spectroscopy indicate that both flares are likely powered by TDEs. The striking similarity in flare properties suggests that these flares result from subsequent disruptions of the same star. Each flare rises on a timescale of $\sim$30 days, has a temperature of $\approx$30,000 K, a peak bolometric luminosity of $L_{UV/Opt} = 10^{43.6 - 43.9} \textrm{ erg} \textrm{ s}^{-1}$, and exhibits a blue optical spectrum with broad H, He, and N lines. No X-ray emission is detected during either flare, but X-ray emission with an unabsorbed luminosity of $L_{X} = 3\times10^{41} \textrm{ erg} \textrm{ s}^{-1}$ and $kT = 0.042$ eV is observed between the flares. Pre-discovery survey observations rule out the existence of earlier flares within the past $\approx$6000 days, indicating that the discovery of ASASSN-22ci likely coincides with the first flare. If the observed flare separation of $720 \pm 4.7$ days is the orbital period, the next flare of ASASSN-22ci should occur near MJD 61075 (2026 February 04). Finally, we find that the existing sample of repeating TDE candidates is consistent with Hills capture of a star initially in a binary with a total mass between $\sim$$1 - 4$ M$_{\odot}$ and a separation of $\sim$$0.01 - 0.1$ AU.</description>

      <title>The Moon as a Cosmic-Ray Spectrometer: Prospects for MeV Gamma-Ray Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Moon is the closest celestial gamma-ray emitting object. Its gamma-ray emission arises from interactions between Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) and the lunar surface. While the lunar GeV gamma-ray spectrum is dominated by a continuum from hadronic decay processes, the MeV emission exhibits both continuum and distinctive spectral lines from nuclear de-excitation and radioactive decay processes. Using Geant4 Monte Carlo particle simulations, we model the lunar gamma-ray spectrum. Our results demonstrate its consistency with Fermi-LAT observations, and predict that next-generation MeV gamma-ray instruments will detect both the lunar MeV continuum and several key spectral line features, notably the $1.779~\mathrm{MeV}$ line from $\mathrm{^{28}Si}$ de-excitation enhanced by the lunar surface composition, the $e^+e^-$ annihilation line, and radioactive decay lines from $\mathrm{^{22}Na}$ ($\tau\approx3.75\,\mathrm{yr}$) and long-lived $\mathrm{^{26}Al}$ ($\tau\approx1\,\mathrm{Myr}$). These gamma-ray lines are sensitive to CRs with energies $\lesssim1\,\mathrm{GeV\,nuc^{-1}}$, offering unique temporal probes of CR activity over different timescales. Observations of the lunar MeV gamma-ray spectrum will therefore open a new window to study the current irradiation of the solar-terrestrial environment by low-energy CRs and its long-term temporal evolution.</description>

      <title>A Heavy-Metal Scenario of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is an open problem in astroparticle physics. It is usually inferred from the depth of the shower maximum (Xmax) of cosmic-ray showers, which is only ambiguously determined by modern hadronic interaction models. We examine a data-driven scenario, in which we consider the expectation value of Xmax as a free parameter. We test the novel hypothesis whether the cosmic-ray data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted in a consistent picture, under the assumption that the mass composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies is dominated by high metallicity, resulting in pure iron nuclei at energies above ~40 EeV. We investigate the implications on astrophysical observations and hadronic interactions, and we discuss the global consistency of the data assuming this heavy-metal scenario. We conclude that the data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted consistently if the expectation values for Xmax from modern hadronic interaction models are shifted to larger values.</description>

      <title>The eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS): SDSS spectroscopic observations of X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present one of the largest uniform optical spectroscopic surveys of X-ray selected sources to date that were observed as a pilot study for the Black Hole Mapper (BHM) survey. The BHM program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-V is designed to provide optical spectra for hundreds of thousands of X-ray selected sources from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. This significantly improves our ability to classify and characterise the physical properties of large statistical populations of X-ray emitting objects. Our sample consists of 13079 sources in the eROSITA eFEDS performance verification field, 12011 of which provide reliable redshifts from 0&lt;z&lt;5.8. The vast majority of these objects were detected as point-like sources (X-ray flux limit F(0.5-2 keV)&gt;6.5x10^-15 erg/s/cm^2) and were observed for about 20 years with fibre-fed SDSS spectrographs. After including all available redshift information for the eFEDS sources from the dedicated SDSS-V plate programme and archival data, we visually inspected the SDSS optical spectra to verify the reliability of these redshift measurements and the performance of the SDSS pipeline. The visual inspection allowed us to recover reliable redshifts (for 99% of the spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of &gt;2) and to assign classes to the sources, and we confirm that the vast majority of our sample consists of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Only ~3% of the eFEDS/SDSS sources are Galactic objects. We also show the diversity of the optical spectra of the X-ray selected AGNs and provide spectral stacks with a high signal-to-noise ratio in various sub-samples with different redshift and optical broad-band colours. Our AGN sample contains optical spectra of (broad-line) quasars, narrow-line galaxies, and optically passive galaxies. It is considerably diverse in its colours and in its levels of nuclear obscuration.</description>

      <title>Swift/XRT monitoring of the orbital and superorbital modulations in 4U 1909+07</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an observational campaign performed with Swift/XRT on the wind-fed supergiant X-ray binary 4U 1909+07 to investigate the nature of the orbital and superorbital modulation of its X-ray emission. A total of 137 XRT observations have been carried out, summing up to a total effective exposure time of 114 ks and covering a total of 66 orbital and 19 superorbital cycles of the source. The XRT data folded on the orbital period of the source confirmed and improved the previously reported variability in intensity and absorption column density, which can be ascribed to the neutron star accreting from the wind of its B supergiant companion across a fairly circular orbit. The XRT data folded on the superorbital period did not provide evidence of significant variations in either the absorption column density and/or the power-law photon index. This may be due to a significant weakening of the superorbital modulation during the times when the XRT observations were carried out, as confirmed by the BAT dynamic power spectrum. We discuss the implications of these findings within the corotating interaction region model proposed to interpret the superorbital variability in wind-fed supergiant X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Classification uncertainty for transient gravitational-wave noise artefacts with optimised conformal prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in scientific research comes the need for reliable uncertainty quantification. When taking a measurement it is not enough to provide the result, we also have to declare how confident we are in the measurement. This is also true when the results are obtained from a ML algorithm, and arguably more so since the internal workings of ML algorithms are often less transparent compared to traditional statistical methods. Additionally, many ML algorithms do not provide uncertainty estimates and auxiliary algorithms must be applied. Conformal Prediction (CP) is a framework to provide such uncertainty quantifications for ML point predictors. In this paper, we explore the use and properties of CP applied in the context of glitch classification in gravitational wave astronomy. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of CP to the Gravity Spy glitch classification algorithm. CP makes use of a score function, a nonconformity measure, to convert an algorithm's heuristic notion of uncertainty to a rigorous uncertainty. We use the application on Gravity Spy to explore the performance of different nonconformity measures and optimise them for our application. Our results show that the optimal nonconformity measure depends on the specific application, as well as the metric used to quantify the performance.</description>

      <title>Constraints on extended axion structures from the lensing of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that have been regarded as promising dark matter (DM) candidates. On the other hand, extended compact objects such as axion stars, which are supported by gravity and axion self interactions, may have also been formed in the early Universe and comprise part of DM. In this work, we consider the lensing of electromagnetic signals from distant sources by axion stars, as a way to constrain the properties of axion stars and fundamental axion parameters. Accounting for the effect of the finite size of the axion star, we study the lensing effect induced by gravity, and by axion-photon interactions. The latter effect is frequency dependent, and is relevant in the low frequency band, which motivates the use of fast radio burst (FRB) signals as a probe. We calculate the predicted number of lensed FRB events by specifying the fundamental axion parameters, axion star radial profile, fraction of DM residing in axion stars, and imposing lensing criteria based on the flux ratio and time delay between the brightest images from lensing. Assuming an optimistic case of $10^4$ observed FRB events, and a timing resolution of $1\,\mu{\rm s}$, the lack of observed FRB lensing events in CHIME allows us to probe axion stars with mass $ \gtrsim 10^{-2} M_\odot$, corresponding to axion masses $\lesssim 10^{-10}\,{\rm eV}$ and for negligible axion-photon couplings. Even lighter axion stars up to $\sim 10^{-3} M_\odot$ can be probed, assuming axion-photon couplings of at least $10^{-6}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Our results indicate that while FRB lensing by axion stars lead to sensitivities that are competitive with conventional microlensing searches operating in the optical band, it remains a challenge to probe axion-photon induced lensing effects.</description>

Abstract: Dwarf novae are astrophysical laboratories for probing the nature of accretion, binary mass transfer, and binary evolution -- yet their diverse observational characteristics continue to challenge our theoretical understanding. We here present the discovery of, and subsequent observing campaign on GOTO065054+593624 (hereafter GOTO0650), a dwarf nova of the WZ Sge type, discovered in real-time by citizen scientists via the Kilonova Seekers citizen science project, which has an outburst amplitude of 8.5 mag. An extensive dataset charts the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of this object, covering the 2024 superoutburst. GOTO0650 shows an absence of visible emission lines during the high state, strong H and barely-detected HeII emission, and high-amplitude echo outbursts with a rapidly decreasing timescale. The comprehensive dataset presented here marks GOTO0650 as a candidate period bouncer, and highlights the important contribution that citizen scientists can make to the study of Galactic transients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard formula, due to Spiegel, for the smoothing of temperature fluctuations by radiative transfer is unstable in relativity. This is due to the fact that Spiegel neglected the transit time of light, thereby allowing the transport coefficients to move outside the convex geometry compatible with causality (the "hydrohedron"). Here, we fix this pathology. First, we prove that the linearized radiative transfer equations are causal and covariantly stable by construction. Then, we repeat Spiegel's calculation accounting for the finite speed of photons. We find that the full transfer problem can be solved analytically. All the infinite (exact) transport coefficients arising from it fall inside the hydrohedron. Our analysis also accounts for isotropic scattering.</description>

      <title>Spectral diversity in collisional neutrino-flavor conversion: flavor equipartition or swap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum kinetics of neutrinos are known to potentially change the classical neutrino radiation field in high-energy astrophysical sources such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. However, the mixing phenomena still have open issues in the nonlinear dynamics and the asymptotic states, particularly for recently discovered collision-induced flavor conversion. In this paper, we investigate linear and nonlinear dynamics of collisional neutrino-flavor conversion (CFC) with multi-energy neutrino gases through numerical simulations, demonstrating that the asymptotic states dramatically change depending on unstable modes dominating the system. In one unstable mode, high-energy neutrinos reach a flavor equipartition, but low-energy neutrinos return back to almost their initial states. In contrast, in the other one, rather low-energy neutrinos achieve a full flavor swap, but high-energy neutrinos undergo less flavor conversion. We clarify the distinct spectral behaviors in two different ways based on stability analysis and flavor pendulum. Our result suggests that CFC with flavor swap can become crucial at deeper radii with low electron fraction and requires more detailed theoretical modeling of neutrino quantum kinetics.</description>

      <title>Delayed Thermal Relaxation of Rapidly Cooling Neutron Stars: Nucleon Superfluidity and Non-nucleon Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal relaxation time of neutron stars, typically defined by a sudden drop in surface temperature, is usually on the order of 10 to 100 years. In this study, we investigate neutron star thermal relaxation by incorporating nucleon superfluidity and non-nucleonic particles, specifically considering hyperons as a representative case. We find that rapidly cooling neutron stars driven by neutron superfluidity and direct Urca processes demonstrate delayed thermal relaxation under specific physical conditions. The former acquires that the neutron $^3P_2$ critical temperature is small enough, whereas the latter depends on the presence of a small core that permits direct Urca processes. To explore these scenarios, we propose simple theoretical frameworks to describe these delayed thermal relaxation behaviors and discuss how an recently-established enhanced modified Urca rate influences the relaxation time. By confronting the theoretical results with the observation of Cassiopeia A, we can effectively constrain the maximum neutron $^3P_2$ critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Questioning Cosmic Acceleration with DESI: The Big Stall of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most important discoveries in modern cosmology is cosmic acceleration. However, we find that today's universe could decelerate in the statistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the $\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Using various datasets, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we demonstrate that the universe experiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the state of the ``Big Stall", which predicts that: (i) the universe suddenly comes to a halt in the distant future; (ii) its eventual destiny is dominated by dark matter rather than dark energy ; (iii) it ultimately retains an extremely small fraction of dark energy but exerts an extremely large pressure. Our findings profoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and enrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Is the Symbiotic Recurrent Nova T CrB Late? Recent Photometric Evolution and Comparison with Past Pre-Outburst Behaviour</title>

Abstract: T CrB is a symbiotic recurrent nova that last erupted in 1946. Given its recurrence timescale of approximately 80 years, the next outburst is eagerly anticipated by the astronomical community. In this work, we analyse the optical light curves of T CrB, comparing recent photometric evolution with historical data to evaluate potential predictive indicators of nova eruptions. Although the "super-active" phases preceding both the 1946 and anticipated eruptions are strikingly similar, the subsequent photometric behaviour differs. We find that the decline in brightness observed in 2023, interpreted by some as a "pre-eruption dip", deviates from the deep minimum recorded prior to the 1946 event and does not reliably predict the eruption timing. Recent photometric and spectroscopic observations indicate that the system is returning to a high-accretion state. Given this, an eruption may be imminent, even without distinct precursors. While the next eruption of T CrB will be a major scientific event, its expected peak brightness of $V \sim 2$ mag highlights the importance of setting realistic public expectations for what will be a visually modest, yet astrophysically very significant, celestial event.</description>

Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark-gluon plasma around the critical point at $T=182$ MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.15. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I-Love-Q-C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark-hadron interface is not large. Besides, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential, and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>
