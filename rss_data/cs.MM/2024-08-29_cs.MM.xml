      <title>Human-Inspired Audio-Visual Speech Recognition: Spike Activity, Cueing Interaction and Causal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans naturally perform audiovisual speech recognition (AVSR), enhancing the accuracy and robustness by integrating auditory and visual information. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic the brain's information-processing mechanisms, are well-suited for emulating the human capability of AVSR. Despite their potential, research on SNNs for AVSR is scarce, with most existing audio-visual multimodal methods focused on object or digit recognition. These models simply integrate features from both modalities, neglecting their unique characteristics and interactions. Additionally, they often rely on future information for current processing, which increases recognition latency and limits real-time applicability. Inspired by human speech perception, this paper proposes a novel human-inspired SNN named HI-AVSNN for AVSR, incorporating three key characteristics: cueing interaction, causal processing and spike activity. For cueing interaction, we propose a visual-cued auditory attention module (VCA2M) that leverages visual cues to guide attention to auditory features. We achieve causal processing by aligning the SNN's temporal dimension with that of visual and auditory features and applying temporal masking to utilize only past and current information. To implement spike activity, in addition to using SNNs, we leverage the event camera to capture lip movement as spikes, mimicking the human retina and providing efficient visual data. We evaluate HI-AVSNN on an audiovisual speech recognition dataset combining the DVS-Lip dataset with its corresponding audio samples. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed fusion method, outperforming existing audio-visual SNN fusion methods and achieving a 2.27% improvement in accuracy over the only existing SNN-based AVSR method.</description>

      <title>MultiMediate'24: Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the momentary level of participant's engagement is an important prerequisite for assistive systems that support human interactions. Previous work has addressed this task in within-domain evaluation scenarios, i.e. training and testing on the same dataset. This is in contrast to real-life scenarios where domain shifts between training and testing data frequently occur. With MultiMediate'24, we present the first challenge addressing multi-domain engagement estimation. As training data, we utilise the NOXI database of dyadic novice-expert interactions. In addition to within-domain test data, we add two new test domains. First, we introduce recordings following the NOXI protocol but covering languages that are not present in the NOXI training data. Second, we collected novel engagement annotations on the MPIIGroupInteraction dataset which consists of group discussions between three to four people. In this way, MultiMediate'24 evaluates the ability of approaches to generalise across factors such as language and cultural background, group size, task, and screen-mediated vs. face-to-face interaction. This paper describes the MultiMediate'24 challenge and presents baseline results. In addition, we discuss selected challenge solutions.</description>

      <title>SVDD 2024: The Inaugural Singing Voice Deepfake Detection Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancements in singing voice generation and the growing presence of AI singers on media platforms, the inaugural Singing Voice Deepfake Detection (SVDD) Challenge aims to advance research in identifying AI-generated singing voices from authentic singers. This challenge features two tracks: a controlled setting track (CtrSVDD) and an in-the-wild scenario track (WildSVDD). The CtrSVDD track utilizes publicly available singing vocal data to generate deepfakes using state-of-the-art singing voice synthesis and conversion systems. Meanwhile, the WildSVDD track expands upon the existing SingFake dataset, which includes data sourced from popular user-generated content websites. For the CtrSVDD track, we received submissions from 47 teams, with 37 surpassing our baselines and the top team achieving a 1.65% equal error rate. For the WildSVDD track, we benchmarked the baselines. This paper reviews these results, discusses key findings, and outlines future directions for SVDD research.</description>

      <title>WavTokenizer: an Efficient Acoustic Discrete Codec Tokenizer for Audio Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models have been effectively applied to modeling natural signals, such as images, video, speech, and audio. A crucial component of these models is the codec tokenizer, which compresses high-dimensional natural signals into lower-dimensional discrete tokens. In this paper, we introduce WavTokenizer, which offers several advantages over previous SOTA acoustic codec models in the audio domain: 1)extreme compression. By compressing the layers of quantizers and the temporal dimension of the discrete codec, one-second audio of 24kHz sampling rate requires only a single quantizer with 40 or 75 tokens. 2)improved subjective quality. Despite the reduced number of tokens, WavTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with outstanding UTMOS scores and inherently contains richer semantic information. Specifically, we achieve these results by designing a broader VQ space, extended contextual windows, and improved attention networks, as well as introducing a powerful multi-scale discriminator and an inverse Fourier transform structure. We conducted extensive reconstruction experiments in the domains of speech, audio, and music. WavTokenizer exhibited strong performance across various objective and subjective metrics compared to state-of-the-art models. We also tested semantic information, VQ utilization, and adaptability to generative models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each module in WavTokenizer. The related code, demos, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavTokenizer.</description>
