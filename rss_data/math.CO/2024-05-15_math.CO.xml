      <title>Necklaces over a group with identity product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address two variants of the classical necklace counting problem from enumerative combinatorics. In both cases, we fix a finite group $\mathcal{G}$ and a positive integer $n$. In the first variant, we count the ``identity-product $n$-necklaces'' -- that is, the orbits of $n$-tuples $\left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) \in \mathcal{G}^n$ that satisfy $a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n = 1$ under cyclic rotation. In the second, we count the orbits of all $n$-tuples $\left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) \in \mathcal{G}^n$ under cyclic rotation and left multiplication (i.e., the operation of $\mathcal{G}$ on $\mathcal{G}^n$ given by $h \cdot \left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) = \left(ha_1, ha_2, \ldots, ha_n\right)$). We prove bijectively that both answers are the same, and express them as a sum over divisors of $n$.</description>

      <title>Between weak and Bruhat: the middle order on permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a partial order $\mathcal{P}_n$ on permutations of any given size $n$, which is the image of a natural partial order on inversion sequences. We call this the ``middle order''. We demonstrate that the poset $\mathcal{P}_n$ refines the weak order on permutations and admits the Bruhat order as a refinement, justifying the terminology. These middle orders are distributive lattices and we establish some of their combinatorial properties, including characterization and enumeration of intervals and boolean intervals (in general, or of any given rank), and a combinatorial interpretation of their Euler characteristic. We further study the (not so well-behaved) restriction of this poset to involutions, obtaining a simple formula for the M\"obius function of principal order ideals there. Finally, we offer further directions of research, initiating the study of the canonical Heyting algebra associated with $\mathcal{P}_n$, and defining a parking function analogue of $\mathcal{P}_n$.</description>

      <title>Csikv\'{a}ri's poset and Tutte polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Csikv\'{a}ri constructed a poset on trees to prove that several graph functions attain extreme values at the star and the path among the trees on a fixed number of vertices. Reiner and Smith proved that the Tutte polynomials $T(1,y)$ of cones over trees, which are the graphs obtained by attaching a cone vertex to a tree, have the described extreme behavior. They further conjectured that the result can be strengthened in terms of Csikv\'{a}ri's poset. We solve this conjecture affirmatively.</description>

      <title>A unifying construction of semifields of order $p^{2m}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present two new constructions for semifields of order $p^{2m}$. Together, the constructions unify and generalize around a dozen distinct semifield constructions, including both the oldest known construction by Dickson and the largest known construction in odd characteristic by Taniguchi. The constructions also provably yield many new semifields. We give precise conditions when the new semifields we find are equivalent and count precisely how many new inequivalent semifields we construct.</description>

      <title>Contracting a Single Element in a Transversal Matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the class of transversal matroids is not closed under contraction or duality. The complexity of deciding whether a minor or dual of a transversal matroid remains transversal is in $\Sigma_2$ and thus far there has been no improvement on this bound. We explore this issue, providing a polynomial time algorithm for determining whether a single element contraction of a transversal matroid remains transversal. If so, our algorithm also provides a transversal representation. We then develop the techniques used in search of a polynomial time algorithm for determining whether the dual of a transversal matroid remains transversal.</description>

      <title>Line graphs and Nordhaus-Gaddum-type bounds for self-loop graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_S$ be the graph obtained by attaching a self-loop at every vertex in $S \subseteq V(G)$ of a simple graph $G$ of order $n.$ In this paper, we explore several new results related to the line graph $L(G_S)$ of $G_S.$ Particularly, we show that every eigenvalue of $L(G_S)$ must be at least $-2,$ and relate the characteristic polynomial of the line graph $L(G)$ of $G$ with the characteristic polynomial of the line graph $L(\widehat{G})$ of a self-loop graph $\widehat{G}$, which is obtained by attaching a self-loop at each vertex of $G$. Then, we provide some new bounds for the eigenvalues and energy of $G_S.$ As one of the consequences, we obtain that the energy of a connected regular complete multipartite graph is not greater than the energy of the corresponding self-loop graph. Lastly, we establish a lower bound of the spectral radius in terms of the first Zagreb index $M_1(G)$ and the minimum degree $\delta(G),$ as well as proving two Nordhaus-Gaddum-type bounds for the spectral radius and the energy of $G_S,$ respectively.</description>

      <title>A new infinite family of maximum $h$-scattered $\mathbb{F}_q$-subspaces of $V(m(h+1),q^n)$ and associated MRD codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of linear subspaces, particularly scattered subspaces, has garnered considerable attention across diverse mathematical disciplines in recent years, notably within finite geometries and coding theory. Scattered subspaces play a pivotal role in analyzing various geometric structures such as blocking sets, two-intersection sets, complete arcs, caps in affine and projective spaces over finite fields and rank metric codes. This paper introduces a new infinite family of $h$-subspaces, along with their associated MRD codes. Additionally, it addresses the task of determining the generalized weights of these codes. Notably, we demonstrate that these MRD codes exhibit some larger generalized weights compared to those previously identified.</description>

      <title>First order distinguishability of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of distinguishing between two independent samples $\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2$ of a binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ by first order (FO) sentences. Shelah and Spencer proved that, for a constant $\alpha\in(0,1)$, $G(n,n^{-\alpha})$ obeys FO zero-one law if and only if $\alpha$ is irrational. Therefore, for irrational $\alpha\in(0,1)$, any fixed FO sentence does not distinguish between $\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2$ with asymptotical probability 1 (w.h.p.) as $n\to\infty$. We show that the minimum quantifier depth $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}$ of a FO sentence $\varphi=\varphi(\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2)$ distinguishing between $\mathbf{G}_n^1,\mathbf{G}_n^2$ depends on how closely $\alpha$ can be approximated by rationals: (1) for all non-Liouville $\alpha\in(0,1)$, $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}=\Omega(\ln\ln\ln n)$ w.h.p.; (2) there are irrational $\alpha\in(0,1)$ with $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}$ that grow arbitrarily slowly w.h.p.; (3) $\mathbf{k}_{\alpha}=O_p(\frac{\ln n}{\ln\ln n})$ for all $\alpha\in(0,1)$. The main ingredients in our proofs are a novel randomized algorithm that generates asymmetric strictly balanced graphs as well as a new method to study symmetry groups of randomly perturbed graphs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic enumeration of Haar graphical representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper represents a significant leap forward in the problem of enumerating vertex-transitive graphs. Recent breakthroughs on symmetry of Cayley (di)graphs show that almost all finite Cayley (di)graphs have the smallest possible automorphism group. Extending the scope of these results, we enumerate (di)graphs admitting a fixed semiregular group of automorphisms with m orbits. Moreover, we consider the more intricate inquiry of prohibiting arcs within each orbit, where the special case m = 2 is known as the problem of finding Haar graphical representations (HGRs). We significantly advance the understanding of HGRs by proving that the proportion of HGRs among Haar graphs of a finite nonabelian group approaches 1 as the group order grows. As a corollary, we obtain an improved bound on the proportion of DRRs among Cayley digraphs in the solution of Morris and the second author to the Babai-Godsil conjecture.</description>

      <title>The representation of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ on the cohomology of the permutohedral variety and gamma vectors of partitioned permutohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foata and Sch\"{u}tzenberger gave an expansion for the Eulerian polynomial $A_n(t)$ in terms of the basis $\{t^j(1+t)^{n-1-2j}\}$ for the space of polynomials $f(t)$ satisfying $f(t)=t^{n-1}f(1/t)$. We generalize this result in two ways. First, we provide an analogue for the graded representation of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ on the cohomology of the permutohedral variety. Then we give expansions $h$-polynomials of polytopes obtained by cutting permutohedra with hyperplanes orthogonal to simple roots in terms of the same basis.</description>

      <title>The DP-coloring of the square of subcubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2-distance coloring of a graph $G$ is equivalent to the proper coloring of its square graph $G^2$, it is a special distance labeling problem. DP-coloring (or "Correspondence coloring") was introduced by Dvo\v{r}\'ak and Postle in 2018, to answer a conjecture of list coloring proposed by Borodin. In recent years, many researches pay attention to the DP-coloring of planar graphs with some restriction in cycles. We study the DP-coloring of the square of subcubic graphs in terms of maximum average degree $\rm{mad}(G)$, and by the discharging method, we showed that: for a subcubic graph $G$, if $\rm{mad}(G)&lt;9/4$, then $G^2$ is DP-5-colorable; if $\rm{mad}(G)&lt;12/5$, then $G^2$ is DP-6-colorable. And the bound in the first result is sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we apply a spectral method to the graph of alternating bilinear forms. In this way, we obtain upper bounds on the size of an alternating rank-metric code for given values of the minimum rank distance. We computationally compare our results with Delsarte's linear programming bound, observing that they give the same value. For small values of the minimum rank distance, we are able to establish the equivalence of the two methods. The problem remains open for larger values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paley graphs and Paley sum graphs are classical examples of quasi-random graphs. In this paper, we provide new constructions of families of quasi-random graphs that behave like Paley graphs but are neither Cayley graphs nor Cayley sum graphs. These graphs give a unified perspective of studying various graphs arising from polynomials over finite fields such as Paley graphs, Paley sum graphs, and graphs coming from Diophantine tuples and their generalizations. We also provide new lower bounds on the clique number and independence number of general quasi-random graphs. In particular, we give a sufficient condition for the clique number of quasi-random graphs of $n$ vertices to be at least $(1-o(1)\log_{3.008}n$. Such a condition applies to many classical quasi-random graphs, including Paley graphs and Paley sum graphs, as well as some new Paley-like graphs we construct.</description>

Abstract: We disprove the conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu that a length space (or graph) with no $K$-fat $H$ minor is quasi-isometric to a graph with no $H$ minor. Our counterexample is furthermore not quasi-isometric to a graph with no 2-fat $H$ minor or a length space with no $H$ minor. On the other hand, we show that the following weakening holds: any graph with no $K$-fat $H$ minor is quasi-isometric to a graph with no $3$-fat $H$ minor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear equation $E$ is said to be sparse if there is $c&gt;0$ so that every subset of $[n]$ of size $n^{1-c}$ contains a solution of $E$ in distinct integers. The problem of characterizing the sparse equations, first raised by Ruzsa in the 90's, is one of the most important open problems in additive combinatorics. We say that $E$ in $k$ variables is abundant if every subset of $[n]$ of size $\varepsilon n$ contains at least poly$(\varepsilon)\cdot n^{k-1}$ solutions of $E$. It is clear that every abundant $E$ is sparse, and Gir\~{a}o, Hurley, Illingworth and Michel asked if the converse implication also holds. In this note we show that this is the case for every $E$ in $4$ variables. We further discuss a generalization of this problem which applies to all linear equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization is a construction of a class of polytopes such that the polytopes have some of their properties.The best known example is the class of neighbourly polytopes. Cyclic polytopes have explicit facet structures, important properties and applications in different branches of mathematics. In the past few decades, generalizations of their combinatorial properties have yielded new classes of polytopes that also have explicit facet structures and useful applications. We present an overview of these generalizations along with some applications of the resultant polytopes, and some possible approaches to other generalizations.</description>

      <title>Chiral extensions of regular toroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract polytopes are combinatorial objects that generalise geometric objects such as convex polytopes, maps on surfaces and tilings of the space. Chiral polytopes are those abstract polytopes that admit full combinatorial rotational symmetry but do not admit reflections. In this paper we build chiral polytopes whose facets (maximal faces) are isomorphic to a prescribed regular cubic tessellation of the $n$-dimensional torus ($n \geq 2$). As a consequence, we prove that for every $d \geq 3$ there exist infinitely many chiral $d$-polytopes.</description>

Abstract: For a graph $G$ and a hereditary property $\mathcal{P}$, let $\text{ex}(G,\mathcal{P})$ denote the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of $G$ that belongs to $\mathcal{P}$. We prove that for every non-trivial hereditary property $\mathcal{P}$ such that $L \notin \mathcal{P}$ for some bipartite graph $L$ and for every fixed $p \in (0,1)$ we have \[\text{ex}(G(n,p),\mathcal{P}) \le n^{2-\varepsilon}\] with high probability, for some constant $\varepsilon = \varepsilon(\mathcal{P})&gt;0$. This answers a question of Alon, Krivelevich and Samotij.</description>

      <title>Evolution of locally dependent random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study $d$-dependent random graphs -- introduced by Brody and Sanchez -- which are the family of random graph distributions where each edge is present with probability $p$, and each edge is independent of all but at most $d$ other edges. For this random graph model, we analyze degree sequences, jumbledness, connectivity, and subgraph containment. Our results mirror those of the classical Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph, which are recovered by specializing our problem to $d=0$, although we show that in many regards our setting is appreciably more nuanced. We survey what is known for this model and conclude with a variety of open questions.</description>

      <title>Wronskians form the inverse system of the arcs of a double point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ideal of the arc scheme of a double point or, equivalently, the differential ideal generated by the ideal of a double point is a primary ideal in an infinite-dimensional polynomial ring supported at the origin. This ideal has a rich combinatorial structure connecting it to singularity theory, partition identities, representation theory, and differential algebra. Macaulay inverse system is a powerful tool for studying the structure of primary ideals which describes an ideal in terms of certain linear differential operators. In the present paper, we show that the inverse system of the ideal of the arc scheme of a double point is precisely a vector space spanned by all the Wronskians of the variables and their formal derivatives. We then apply this characterization to extend our recent result on Poincar\'e-type series for such ideals.</description>

      <title>Ahead of the Count: An Algorithm for Probabilistic Prediction of Instant Runoff (IRV) Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we probabilistically predict the winner in a ranked-choice election without all ballots being counted? In this study, we introduce a novel algorithm designed to predict outcomes in Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. The algorithm takes as input a set of discrete probability distributions describing vote totals for each candidate ranking and calculates the probability that each candidate will win the election. In fact, we calculate all possible sequences of eliminations that might occur in the IRV rounds and assign a probability to each.
  The discrete probability distributions can be arbitrary and, in applications, could be measured empirically from pre-election polling data or from partial vote tallies of an in-progress election.
  The algorithm is effective for elections with a small number of candidates (five or fewer), with fast execution on typical consumer computers. The run-time is short enough for our method to be used for real-time election night modeling where new predictions are made continuously as more and more vote information becomes available. We demonstrate the algorithm in abstract examples, and also using real data from the 2022 Alaska state elections to simulate election-night predictions and also predictions of election recounts.</description>

      <title>Symmetric-Difference (Degeneracy) and Signed Tree Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dense counterpart of graph degeneracy, which extends the recently-proposed invariant symmetric difference. We say that a graph has sd-degeneracy (for symmetric-difference degeneracy) at most $d$ if it admits an elimination order of its vertices where a vertex $u$ can be removed whenever it has a $d$-twin, i.e., another vertex $v$ such that at most $d$ vertices outside $\{u,v\}$ are neighbors of exactly one of $u, v$. The family of graph classes of bounded sd-degeneracy is a superset of that of graph classes of bounded degeneracy or of bounded flip-width, and more generally, of bounded symmetric difference. Unlike most graph parameters, sd-degeneracy is not hereditary: it may be strictly smaller on a graph than on some of its induced subgraphs. In particular, every $n$-vertex graph is an induced subgraph of some $O(n^2)$-vertex graph of sd-degeneracy 1. In spite of this and the breadth of classes of bounded sd-degeneracy, we devise $\tilde{O}(\sqrt n)$-bit adjacency labeling schemes for them, which are optimal up to the hidden polylogarithmic factor. This is attained on some even more general classes, consisting of graphs $G$ whose vertices bijectively map to the leaves of a tree $T$, where transversal edges and anti-edges added to $T$ define the edge set of $G$. We call such graph representations signed tree models as they extend the so-called tree models (or twin-decompositions) developed in the context of twin-width, by adding transversal anti-edges. While computing the degeneracy of an input graph can be done in linear time, we show that deciding whether its symmetric difference is at most 8 is co-NP-complete, and whether its sd-degeneracy is at most 1 is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of the Rips complexes of Integer lattices via local domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each positive integer $n$, the Rips complexes of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice in the $d_1$ metric (i.e., the Manhattan metric, also called the natural word metric in the Cayley graph) are contractible at scales above $n^2(2n-1)^2$, with the bounds arising from the Jung's constants. We introduce a new concept of locally dominated vertices in a simplicial complex, upon which our proof strategy is based. This allows us to deduce the contractibility of the Rips complexes from a local geometric condition called local crushing. In the case of the integer lattices in dimension $n$ and a fixed scale $r$, this condition entails the comparison of finitely many distances to conclude that the corresponding Rips complex is contractible. In particular, we are able to verify that for $n=1,2,3$, the Rips complex of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice at scale greater or equal to $n$ is contractible. We conjecture that the same proof strategy can be used to extend this result to all dimensions $n$</description>

However, there are some applications where Kolmogorov complexity is used in a more subtle way. We provide one (somehow) surprising example where an existence of a winning strategy in a natural combinatorial game is proven (and no direct proof is known).</description>

Abstract: We investigate the random bipartite optimal matching problem on a flat torus in two-dimensions, considering general strictly convex power costs of the distance. We extend the successful ansatz first introduced by Caracciolo et al. for the quadratic case, involving a linear Poisson equation, to a non-linear equation of $q$-Poisson type, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the optimal transport cost. Our results establish new asymptotic connections between the energy of the solution to the PDE and the optimal transport cost, providing insights on their asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Recurrence solution of monomer-polymer models on two-dimensional rectangular lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of counting polymer coverings on the rectangular lattices is investigated. In this model, a linear rigid polymer covers $k$ adjacent lattice sites such that no two polymers occupy a common site. Those unoccupied lattice sites are considered as monomers. We prove that for a given number of polymers ($k$-mers), the number of arrangements for the polymers on two-dimensional rectangular lattices satisfies simple recurrence relations. These recurrence relations are quite general and apply for arbitrary polymer length ($k$) and the width of the lattices ($n$). The well-studied monomer-dimer problem is a special case of the monomer-polymer model when $k=2$. It is known the enumeration of monomer-dimer configurations in planar lattices is #P-complete. The recurrence relations shown here have the potential for hints for the solution of long-standing problems in this class of computational complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\left(u(n)\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be an arithmetic progression of natural integers in base $b\in\mathbb{N}\setminus \{0,1\}$. We consider the following sequences: $s(n)=\overline{u(0)u(1)\cdots u(n) }^b$ formed by concatenating the first $n+1$ terms of $\left(u(n)\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ in base $b$ from the right; $s_r(n) = \overline{u(n)u(n-1)\cdots u(0)}^b$; and $\left(s_*(n)\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, given by $s_*(0)=u(0)$, $s_*(n)=\overline{s_r(n-1)s(n)}^b, n\geq 1$. We construct explicit formulas for these sequences and use basic concepts of linear difference operators to prove they are not P-recursive (holonomic). We also present an alternative proof that follows directly from their definitions. We implemented $\left(s(n)\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $\left(s_r(n)\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ in the decimal base when $(u(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}=\mathbb{N}\setminus \{0\}$.</description>

Abstract: Steinerberger proposed a notion of curvature on graphs (J. Graph Theory, 2023). We show that nonnegative curvature is almost preserved under three graph operations. We characterize the distance matrix and its null space after adding an edge between two graphs. Let $D$ be the graph distance matrix and $\mathbf{1}$ be the all-one vector. We provide a way to construct graphs so that the linear system $Dx = \mathbf{1}$ does not have a solution. Let $\eta$ be the Perron eigenvector of $D.$ We provide a lower bound to $\langle\eta,\mathbf{1}\rangle$ when the graph is a tree.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the class of linearly shellable pure simplicial complexes. The characterizing property is the existence of a labeling of their vertices such that all linear extensions of the Bruhat order on the set of facets are shelling orders. Coxeter complexes of weak intervals and lower Bruhat intervals of parabolic right quotients, as type-selected Coxeter complexes of lower Bruhat intervals of parabolic left quotients, are proved to be linearly shellable. We also introduce the notion of linear strong shellability.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the saturation number and a strengthening for triangle-free graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The saturation number $\operatorname{sat}(n, H)$ of a graph $H$ and positive integer $n$ is the minimum size of an $n$-vertex graph which does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to $H$ but to which the addition of any edge creates such a subgraph. Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Moon first studied saturation numbers of complete graphs, and Cameron and Puleo introduced a general lower bound on $\operatorname{sat}(n,H)$. In this paper, we present another lower bound on $\operatorname{sat}(n, H)$ with a strengthening when $H$ is triangle-free. Demonstrating its effectiveness, we determine the saturation numbers of diameter-$3$ trees up to an additive constant; these are double stars $S_{s,t}$ on $s + t$ vertices whose centers have degrees $s$ and $t$. Faudree, Faudree, Gould, and Jacobson determined that $\operatorname{sat}(n, S_{t,t}) = (t-1)n/2 + O(1)$. We show that $\operatorname{sat}(n,S_{s,t}) = (st+s)n/(2t+4) + O(1)$ when $s &lt; t$. We also determine lower and upper bounds on the saturation numbers of certain diameter-$4$ caterpillars.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices, with complement $\overline{G}$. The spectral gap of the transition probability matrix of a random walk on $G$ is used to estimate how fast the random walk becomes stationary. We prove that the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $\Omega(1/n)$. Moreover, if all degrees are $\Omega(n)$ and $n-\Omega(n)$, then the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $\Theta(1)$. We also show that if the maximum degree is $n-O(1)$ or if $G$ is a join of two graphs, then the spectral gap of $G$ is $\Omega(1/n)$. Finally, we provide a family of connected graphs with connected complements such that the larger spectral gap of $G$ and $\overline{G}$ is $O(1/n^{3/4})$.</description>

Abstract: A three-path-configuration is a graph consisting of three pairwise internally-disjoint paths the union of every two of which is an induced cycle of length at least four. A graph is 3PC-free if no induced subgraph of it is a three-path-configuration. We prove that 3PC-free graphs have poly-logarithmic tree-independence number. More explicitly, we show that there exists a constant $c$ such that every $n$-vertex 3PC-free graph graph has a tree decomposition in which every bag has stability number at most $c (\log n)^2$. This implies that the Maximum Weight Independent Set problem, as well as several other natural algorithmic problems, that are known to be NP-hard in general, can be solved in quasi-polynomial time if the input graph is 3PC-free.</description>

      <title>On the Paley RIP and Paley graph extractor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructing explicit RIP matrices is an open problem in compressed sensing theory. In particular, it is quite challenging to construct explicit RIP matrices that break the square-root bottleneck. On the other hand, providing explicit $2$-source extractors is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science, cryptography and combinatorics. Nowadays, there are only a few known constructions for explicit $2$-source extractors (with negligible errors) that break the half barrier for min-entropy.
  In this paper, we establish a new connection between RIP matrices breaking the square-root bottleneck and $2$-source extractors breaking the half barrier for min-entropy. Here we focus on an RIP matrix (called the Paley ETF) and a $2$-source extractor (called the Paley graph extractor), where both are defined from quadratic residues over the finite field of odd prime order $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. As a main result, we prove that if the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, then the Paley graph extractor breaks the half barrier for min-entropy as well. Since it is widely believed that the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, our result accordingly provides a new affirmative intuition on the conjecture for the Paley graph extractor by Benny Chor and Oded Goldreich.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Unitarity and the Wavefunction of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitarity of time evolution is one of the basic principles constraining physical processes. Its consequences in the perturbative Bunch-Davies wavefunction in cosmology have been formulated in terms of the cosmological optical theorem. In this paper, we re-analyse perturbative unitarity for the Bunch-Davies wavefunction, focusing on: 1) the role of the $i\epsilon$-prescription and its compatibility with the requirement of unitarity; 2) the origin of the different "cutting rules"; 3) the emergence of the flat-space optical theorem from the cosmological one. We take the combinatorial point of view of the cosmological polytopes, which provide a first-principle description for a large class of scalar graphs contributing to the wavefunctional. The requirement of the positivity of the geometry together with the preservation of its orientation determine the $i\epsilon$-prescription. In kinematic space it translates into giving a small negative imaginary part to all the energies, making the wavefunction coefficients well-defined for any value of their real part along the real axis. Unitarity is instead encoded into a non-convex part of the cosmological polytope, which we name optical polytope. The cosmological optical theorem emerges as the equivalence between a specific polytope subdivision of the optical polytope and its triangulations, each of which provides different cutting rules. The flat-space optical theorem instead emerges from the non-convexity of the optical polytope. On the more mathematical side, we provide two definitions of this non-convex geometry, none of them based on the idea of the non-convex geometry as a union of convex ones.</description>

      <title>Algebraicity of hypergeometric functions with arbitrary parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the algebraicity of (generalized) hypergeometric functions with no restriction on the set of their parameters. Our characterization relies on the interlacing criteria of Christol (1987) and Beukers-Heckman (1989) for globally bounded and algebraic hypergeometric functions, however in a more general setting which allows arbitrary complex parameters with possibly integral differences. We also showcase the adapted criterion on a variety of different examples.</description>

      <title>Constrained Flows in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The support of a flow $x$ in a network is the subdigraph induced by the arcs $uv$ for which $x(uv)&gt;0$. We discuss a number of results on flows in networks where we put certain restrictions on structure of the support of the flow. Many of these problems are NP-hard because they generalize linkage problems for digraphs. For example deciding whether a network ${\cal N}=(D,s,t,c)$ has a maximum flow $x$ such that the maximum out-degree of the support $D_x$ of $x$ is at most 2 is NP-complete as it contains the 2-linkage problem as a very special case. Another problem which is NP-complete for the same reason is that of computing the maximum flow we can send from $s$ to $t$ along $p$ paths (called a maximum {\bf $p$-path-flow}) in ${\cal N}$. Baier et al. (2005) gave a polynomial time algorithm which finds a $p$-path-flow $x$ whose value is at least $\frac{2}{3}$ of the value of a optimum $p$-path-flow when $p\in \{2,3\}$, and at least $\frac{1}{2}$ when $p\geq 4$. When $p=2$, they show that this is best possible unless P=NP. We show for each $p\geq 2$ that the value of a maximum $p$-path-flow cannot be approximated by any ratio larger than $\frac{9}{11}$, unless P=NP. We also consider a variant of the problem where the $p$ paths must be disjoint. For this problem, we give an algorithm which gets within a factor $\frac{1}{H(p)}$ of the optimum solution, where $H(p)$ is the $p$'th harmonic number ($H(p) \sim \ln(p)$). We show that in the case where the network is acyclic, we can find such a maximum $p$-path-flow in polynomial time for every $p$. We determine the complexity of a number of related problems concerning the structure of flows. For the special case of acyclic digraphs, some of the results we obtain are in some sense best possible.</description>

      <title>Towards the classification of finite-dimensional diagonally graded commutative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any finite-dimensional commutative (associative) graded algebra with all nonzero homogeneous subspaces one-dimensional is defined by a symmetric coefficient matrix. This algebraic structure gives a basic kind of $A$-graded algebras originally studied by Arnold. In this paper, we call them diagonally graded commutative algebras (DGCAs) and verify that the isomorphism classes of DGCAs of dimension $\leq 7$ over an arbitrary field are in bijection with the equivalence classes consisting of coefficient matrices with the same distribution of nonzero entries, while dramatically there may be infinitely many isomorphism classes of dimension $n$ corresponding to one equivalence class of coefficient matrices when $n\geq 8$.
  Furthermore, we adopt the Skjelbred-Sund method of central extensions to study the isomorphism classes of DGCAs, and associate any DGCA with a undirected simple graph to explicitly describe its corresponding second (graded) commutative cohomology group as an affine variety.</description>
