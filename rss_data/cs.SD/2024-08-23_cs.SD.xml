      <title>Video-Foley: Two-Stage Video-To-Sound Generation via Temporal Event Condition For Foley Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foley sound synthesis is crucial for multimedia production, enhancing user experience by synchronizing audio and video both temporally and semantically. Recent studies on automating this labor-intensive process through video-to-sound generation face significant challenges. Systems lacking explicit temporal features suffer from poor controllability and alignment, while timestamp-based models require costly and subjective human annotation. We propose Video-Foley, a video-to-sound system using Root Mean Square (RMS) as a temporal event condition with semantic timbre prompts (audio or text). RMS, a frame-level intensity envelope feature closely related to audio semantics, ensures high controllability and synchronization. The annotation-free self-supervised learning framework consists of two stages, Video2RMS and RMS2Sound, incorporating novel ideas including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet with a pretrained text-to-audio model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Video-Foley achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment and controllability for sound timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance. Code, model weights, and demonstrations are available on the accompanying website. (https://jnwnlee.github.io/video-foley-demo)</description>

      <title>Developing vocal system impaired patient-aimed voice quality assessment approach using ASR representation-included multiple features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of deep learning in clinical speech processing is immense, yet the hurdles of limited and imbalanced clinical data samples loom large. This article addresses these challenges by showcasing the utilization of automatic speech recognition and self-supervised learning representations, pre-trained on extensive datasets of normal speech. This innovative approach aims to estimate voice quality of patients with impaired vocal systems. Experiments involve checks on PVQD dataset, covering various causes of vocal system damage in English, and a Japanese dataset focusing on patients with Parkinson's disease before and after undergoing subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) surgery. The results on PVQD reveal a notable correlation (&gt;0.8 on PCC) and an extraordinary accuracy (&lt;0.5 on MSE) in predicting Grade, Breathy, and Asthenic indicators. Meanwhile, progress has been achieved in predicting the voice quality of patients in the context of STN-DBS.</description>

      <title>Self-Learning for Personalized Keyword Spotting on Ultra-Low-Power Audio Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a self-learning framework to incrementally train (fine-tune) a personalized Keyword Spotting (KWS) model after the deployment on ultra-low power smart audio sensors. We address the fundamental problem of the absence of labeled training data by assigning pseudo-labels to the new recorded audio frames based on a similarity score with respect to few user recordings. By experimenting with multiple KWS models with a number of parameters up to 0.5M on two public datasets, we show an accuracy improvement of up to +19.2% and +16.0% vs. the initial models pretrained on a large set of generic keywords. The labeling task is demonstrated on a sensor system composed of a low-power microphone and an energy-efficient Microcontroller (MCU). By efficiently exploiting the heterogeneous processing engines of the MCU, the always-on labeling task runs in real-time with an average power cost of up to 8.2 mW. On the same platform, we estimate an energy cost for on-device training 10x lower than the labeling energy if sampling a new utterance every 5 s or 16.4 s with a DS-CNN-S or a DS-CNN-M model. Our empirical result paves the way to self-adaptive personalized KWS sensors at the extreme edge.</description>

      <title>Modeling Time-Variant Responses of Optical Compressors with Selective State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling optical dynamic range compressors using deep neural networks with Selective State Space models. The proposed approach surpasses previous methods based on recurrent layers by employing a Selective State Space block to encode the input audio. It features a refined technique integrating Feature-wise Linear Modulation and Gated Linear Units to adjust the network dynamically, conditioning the compression's attack and release phases according to external parameters. The proposed architecture is well-suited for low-latency and real-time applications, crucial in live audio processing. The method has been validated on the analog optical compressors TubeTech CL 1B and Teletronix LA-2A, which possess distinct characteristics. Evaluation is performed using quantitative metrics and subjective listening tests, comparing the proposed method with other state-of-the-art models. Results show that our black-box modeling methods outperform all others, achieving accurate emulation of the compression process for both seen and unseen settings during training. We further show a correlation between this accuracy and the sampling density of the control parameters in the dataset and identify settings with fast attack and slow release as the most challenging to emulate.</description>

      <title>Convexity-based Pruning of Speech Representation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech representation models based on the transformer architecture and trained by self-supervised learning have shown great promise for solving tasks such as speech and speaker recognition, keyword spotting, emotion detection, and more. Typically, it is found that larger models lead to better performance. However, the significant computational effort involved in such large transformer systems is a challenge for embedded and real-world applications. Recent work has shown that there is significant redundancy in the transformer models for NLP and massive layer pruning is feasible (Sajjad et al., 2023). Here, we investigate layer pruning in audio models. We base the pruning decision on a convexity criterion. Convexity of classification regions has recently been proposed as an indicator of subsequent fine-tuning performance in a range of application domains, including NLP and audio. In empirical investigations, we find a massive reduction in the computational effort with no loss of performance or even improvements in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Prosody of speech production in latent post-stroke aphasia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores prosodic production in latent aphasia, a mild form of aphasia associated with left-hemisphere brain damage (e.g. stroke). Unlike prior research on moderate to severe aphasia, we investigated latent aphasia, which can seem to have very similar speech production with neurotypical speech. We analysed the f0, intensity and duration of utterance-initial and utterance-final words of ten speakers with latent aphasia and ten matching controls. Regression models were fitted to improve our understanding of this understudied type of very mild aphasia. The results highlighted varying degrees of differences in all three prosodic measures between groups. We also investigated the diagnostic classification of latent aphasia versus neurotypical control using random forest, aiming to build a fast and reliable tool to assist with the identification of latent aphasia. The random forest analysis also reinforced the significance of prosodic features in distinguishing latent aphasia.</description>

      <title>Integrating Audio, Visual, and Semantic Information for Enhanced Multimodal Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker diarization, the process of segmenting an audio stream or transcribed speech content into homogenous partitions based on speaker identity, plays a crucial role in the interpretation and analysis of human speech. Most existing speaker diarization systems rely exclusively on unimodal acoustic information, making the task particularly challenging due to the innate ambiguities of audio signals. Recent studies have made tremendous efforts towards audio-visual or audio-semantic modeling to enhance performance. However, even the incorporation of up to two modalities often falls short in addressing the complexities of spontaneous and unstructured conversations. To exploit more meaningful dialogue patterns, we propose a novel multimodal approach that jointly utilizes audio, visual, and semantic cues to enhance speaker diarization. Our method elegantly formulates the multimodal modeling as a constrained optimization problem. First, we build insights into the visual connections among active speakers and the semantic interactions within spoken content, thereby establishing abundant pairwise constraints. Then we introduce a joint pairwise constraint propagation algorithm to cluster speakers based on these visual and semantic constraints. This integration effectively leverages the complementary strengths of different modalities, refining the affinity estimation between individual speaker embeddings. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple multimodal datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art speaker diarization methods.</description>

      <title>VoiceX: A Text-To-Speech Framework for Custom Voices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern TTS systems are capable of creating highly realistic and natural-sounding speech. Despite these developments, the process of customizing TTS voices remains a complex task, mostly requiring the expertise of specialists within the field. One reason for this is the utilization of deep learning models, which are characterized by their expansive, non-interpretable parameter spaces, restricting the feasibility of manual customization. In this paper, we present a novel human-in-the-loop paradigm based on an evolutionary algorithm for directly interacting with the parameter space of a neural TTS model. We integrated our approach into a user-friendly graphical user interface that allows users to efficiently create original voices. Those voices can then be used with the backbone TTS model, for which we provide a Python API. Further, we present the results of a user study exploring the capabilities of VoiceX. We show that VoiceX is an appropriate tool for creating individual, custom voices.</description>

      <title>LCM-SVC: Latent Diffusion Model Based Singing Voice Conversion with Inference Acceleration via Latent Consistency Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any-to-any singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to transfer a target singer's timbre to other songs using a short voice sample. However many diffusion model based any-to-any SVC methods, which have achieved impressive results, usually suffered from low efficiency caused by a mass of inference steps. In this paper, we propose LCM-SVC, a latent consistency distillation (LCD) based latent diffusion model (LDM) to accelerate inference speed. We achieved one-step or few-step inference while maintaining the high performance by distilling a pre-trained LDM based SVC model, which had the advantages of timbre decoupling and sound quality. Experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly reduce the inference time and largely preserve the sound quality and timbre similarity comparing with other state-of-the-art SVC models. Audio samples are available at https://sounddemos.github.io/lcm-svc.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Compute-efficient Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new Dynamic Gated Recurrent Neural Network (DG-RNN) for compute-efficient speech enhancement models running on resource-constrained hardware platforms. It leverages the slow evolution characteristic of RNN hidden states over steps, and updates only a selected set of neurons at each step by adding a newly proposed select gate to the RNN model. This select gate allows the computation cost of the conventional RNN to be reduced during network inference. As a realization of the DG-RNN, we further propose the Dynamic Gated Recurrent Unit (D-GRU) which does not require additional parameters. Test results obtained from several state-of-the-art compute-efficient RNN-based speech enhancement architectures using the DNS challenge dataset, show that the D-GRU based model variants maintain similar speech intelligibility and quality metrics comparable to the baseline GRU based models even with an average 50% reduction in GRU computes.</description>

      <title>WhisperMask: A Noise Suppressive Mask-Type Microphone for Whisper Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whispering is a common privacy-preserving technique in voice-based interactions, but its effectiveness is limited in noisy environments. In conventional hardware- and software-based noise reduction approaches, isolating whispered speech from ambient noise and other speech sounds remains a challenge. We thus propose WhisperMask, a mask-type microphone featuring a large diaphragm with low sensitivity, making the wearer's voice significantly louder than the background noise. We evaluated WhisperMask using three key metrics: signal-to-noise ratio, quality of recorded voices, and speech recognition rate. Across all metrics, WhisperMask consistently outperformed traditional noise-suppressing microphones and software-based solutions. Notably, WhisperMask showed a 30% higher recognition accuracy for whispered speech recorded in an environment with 80 dB background noise compared with the pin microphone and earbuds. Furthermore, while a denoiser decreased the whispered speech recognition rate of these two microphones by approximately 20% at 30-60 dB noise, WhisperMask maintained a high performance even without denoising, surpassing the other microphones' performances by a significant margin.WhisperMask's design renders the wearer's voice as the dominant input and effectively suppresses background noise without relying on signal processing. This device allows for reliable voice interactions, such as phone calls and voice commands, in a wide range of noisy real-world scenarios while preserving user privacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog electronic circuits are at the core of an important category of musical devices. The nonlinear features of their electronic components give analog musical devices a distinctive timbre and sound quality, making them highly desirable. Artificial neural networks have rapidly gained popularity for the emulation of analog audio effects circuits, particularly recurrent networks. While neural approaches have been successful in accurately modeling distortion circuits, they require architectural improvements that account for parameter conditioning and low latency response. In this article, we explore the application of recent machine learning advancements for virtual analog modeling. We compare State Space models and Linear Recurrent Units against the more common Long Short Term Memory networks. These have shown promising ability in sequence to sequence modeling tasks, showing a notable improvement in signal history encoding. Our comparative study uses these black box neural modeling techniques with a variety of audio effects. We evaluate the performance and limitations using multiple metrics aiming to assess the models' ability to accurately replicate energy envelopes, frequency contents, and transients in the audio signal. To incorporate control parameters we employ the Feature wise Linear Modulation method. Long Short Term Memory networks exhibit better accuracy in emulating distortions and equalizers, while the State Space model, followed by Long Short Term Memory networks when integrated in an encoder decoder structure, outperforms others in emulating saturation and compression. When considering long time variant characteristics, the State Space model demonstrates the greatest accuracy. The Long Short Term Memory and, in particular, Linear Recurrent Unit networks present more tendency to introduce audio artifacts.</description>

      <title>Imperceptible Rhythm Backdoor Attacks: Exploring Rhythm Transformation for Embedding Undetectable Vulnerabilities on Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech recognition is an essential start ring of human-computer interaction, and recently, deep learning models have achieved excellent success in this task. However, when the model training and private data provider are always separated, some security threats that make deep neural networks (DNNs) abnormal deserve to be researched. In recent years, the typical backdoor attacks have been researched in speech recognition systems. The existing backdoor methods are based on data poisoning. The attacker adds some incorporated changes to benign speech spectrograms or changes the speech components, such as pitch and timbre. As a result, the poisoned data can be detected by human hearing or automatic deep algorithms. To improve the stealthiness of data poisoning, we propose a non-neural and fast algorithm called Random Spectrogram Rhythm Transformation (RSRT) in this paper. The algorithm combines four steps to generate stealthy poisoned utterances. From the perspective of rhythm component transformation, our proposed trigger stretches or squeezes the mel spectrograms and recovers them back to signals. The operation keeps timbre and content unchanged for good stealthiness. Our experiments are conducted on two kinds of speech recognition tasks, including testing the stealthiness of poisoned samples by speaker verification and automatic speech recognition. The results show that our method has excellent effectiveness and stealthiness. The rhythm trigger needs a low poisoning rate and gets a very high attack success rate.</description>

      <title>Convert and Speak: Zero-shot Accent Conversion with Minimum Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low resource of parallel data is the key challenge of accent conversion(AC) problem in which both the pronunciation units and prosody pattern need to be converted. We propose a two-stage generative framework "convert-and-speak" in which the conversion is only operated on the semantic token level and the speech is synthesized conditioned on the converted semantic token with a speech generative model in target accent domain. The decoupling design enables the "speaking" module to use massive amount of target accent speech and relieves the parallel data required for the "conversion" module. Conversion with the bridge of semantic token also relieves the requirement for the data with text transcriptions and unlocks the usage of language pre-training technology to further efficiently reduce the need of parallel accent speech data. To reduce the complexity and latency of "speaking", a single-stage AR generative model is designed to achieve good quality as well as lower computation cost. Experiments on Indian-English to general American-English conversion show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in accent similarity, speech quality, and speaker maintenance with only 15 minutes of weakly parallel data which is not constrained to the same speaker. Extensive experimentation with diverse accent types suggests that this framework possesses a high degree of adaptability, making it readily scalable to accommodate other accents with low-resource data. Audio samples are available at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/convert-and-speak-zero-shot-accent-conversion-with-minimumsupervision/.</description>

Abstract: Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) suffers from performance degradation in noisy conditions. To address this issue, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework that incorporates noise-disentanglement to establish a noise-independent speaker invariant embedding space. Specifically, the disentanglement module includes two encoders for separating speaker related and irrelevant information, respectively. The reconstruction module serves as a regularization term to constrain the noise. A feature-robust loss is also used to supervise the speaker encoder to learn noise-independent speaker embeddings without losing speaker information. In addition, adversarial training is introduced to discourage the speaker encoder from encoding acoustic condition information for achieving a speaker-invariant embedding space. Experiments on VoxCeleb1 indicate that the proposed method improves the performance of the speaker verification system under both clean and noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Selective-Memory Meta-Learning with Environment Representations for Sound Event Localization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environment shifts and conflicts present significant challenges for learning-based sound event localization and detection (SELD) methods. SELD systems, when trained in particular acoustic settings, often show restricted generalization capabilities for diverse acoustic environments. Furthermore, obtaining annotated samples for spatial sound events is notably costly. Deploying a SELD system in a new environment requires extensive time for re-training and fine-tuning. To overcome these challenges, we propose environment-adaptive Meta-SELD, designed for efficient adaptation to new environments using minimal data. Our method specifically utilizes computationally synthesized spatial data and employs Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) on a pre-trained, environment-independent model. The method then utilizes fast adaptation to unseen real-world environments using limited samples from the respective environments. Inspired by the Learning-to-Forget approach, we introduce the concept of selective memory as a strategy for resolving conflicts across environments. This approach involves selectively memorizing target-environment-relevant information and adapting to the new environments through the selective attenuation of model parameters. In addition, we introduce environment representations to characterize different acoustic settings, enhancing the adaptability of our attenuation approach to various environments. We evaluate our proposed method on the development set of the Sony-TAu Realistic Spatial Soundscapes 2023 (STARSS23) dataset and computationally synthesized scenes. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to conventional supervised learning methods, particularly in localization.</description>

      <title>Full-frequency dynamic convolution: a physical frequency-dependent convolution for sound event detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, 2D convolution has been found unqualified in sound event detection (SED). It enforces translation equivariance on sound events along frequency axis, which is not a shift-invariant dimension. To address this issue, dynamic convolution is used to model the frequency dependency of sound events. In this paper, we proposed the first full-dynamic method named full-frequency dynamic convolution (FFDConv). FFDConv generates frequency kernels for every frequency band, which is designed directly in the structure for frequency-dependent modeling. It physically furnished 2D convolution with the capability of frequency-dependent modeling. FFDConv outperforms not only the baseline by 6.6% in DESED real validation dataset in terms of PSDS1, but outperforms the other full-dynamic methods. In addition, by visualizing features of sound events, we observed that FFDConv could effectively extract coherent features in specific frequency bands, consistent with the vocal continuity of sound events. This proves that FFDConv has great frequency-dependent perception ability.</description>

      <title>AdaProj: Adaptively Scaled Angular Margin Subspace Projections for Anomalous Sound Detection with Auxiliary Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art approach for semi-supervised anomalous sound detection is to first learn an embedding space by using auxiliary classification tasks based on meta information or self-supervised learning and then estimate the distribution of normal data. In this work, AdaProj a novel loss function for training the embedding model is presented. In contrast to commonly used angular margin losses, which project data of each class as close as possible to their corresponding class centers, AdaProj learns to project data onto class-specific subspaces while still ensuring an angular margin between classes. By doing so, the resulting distributions of the embeddings belonging to normal data are not required to be as restrictive as other loss functions allowing a more detailed view on the data. In experiments conducted on the DCASE2022 and DCASE2023 anomalous sound detection datasets, it is shown that using AdaProj to learn an embedding space significantly outperforms other commonly used loss functions.</description>

      <title>WildDESED: An LLM-Powered Dataset for Wild Domestic Environment Sound Event Detection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to advance sound event detection (SED) research by presenting a new large language model (LLM)-powered dataset namely wild domestic environment sound event detection (WildDESED). It is crafted as an extension to the original DESED dataset to reflect diverse acoustic variability and complex noises in home settings. We leveraged LLMs to generate eight different domestic scenarios based on target sound categories of the DESED dataset. Then we enriched the scenarios with a carefully tailored mixture of noises selected from AudioSet and ensured no overlap with target sound. We consider widely popular convolutional neural recurrent network to study WildDESED dataset, which depicts its challenging nature. We then apply curriculum learning by gradually increasing noise complexity to enhance the model's generalization capabilities across various noise levels. Our results with this approach show improvements within the noisy environment, validating the effectiveness on the WildDESED dataset promoting noise-robust SED advancements.</description>

      <title>SZTU-CMU at MER2024: Improving Emotion-LLaMA with Conv-Attention for Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents our winning approach for the MER-NOISE and MER-OV tracks of the MER2024 Challenge on multimodal emotion recognition. Our system leverages the advanced emotional understanding capabilities of Emotion-LLaMA to generate high-quality annotations for unlabeled samples, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data. To enhance multimodal fusion while mitigating modality-specific noise, we introduce Conv-Attention, a lightweight and efficient hybrid framework. Extensive experimentation vali-dates the effectiveness of our approach. In the MER-NOISE track, our system achieves a state-of-the-art weighted average F-score of 85.30%, surpassing the second and third-place teams by 1.47% and 1.65%, respectively. For the MER-OV track, our utilization of Emotion-LLaMA for open-vocabulary annotation yields an 8.52% improvement in average accuracy and recall compared to GPT-4V, securing the highest score among all participating large multimodal models. The code and model for Emotion-LLaMA are available at https://github.com/ZebangCheng/Emotion-LLaMA.</description>
