      <title>Token-Controlled Re-ranking for Sequential Recommendation via LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as re-rankers is shifting recommender systems towards a user-centric paradigm. However, a significant gap remains: current re-rankers often lack mechanisms for fine-grained user control. They struggle to balance inherent user preferences with multiple attribute-based constraints, often resorting to simplistic hard filtering that can excessively narrow the recommendation pool and yield suboptimal results. This limitation leaves users as passive recipients rather than active collaborators in the recommendation process. To bridge this gap, we propose COREC, a novel token-augmented re-ranking framework that incorporates specific user requirements in co-creating the recommendation outcome. COREC empowers users to steer re-ranking results with precise and flexible control via explicit, attribute-based signals. The framework learns to balance these commands against latent preferences, yielding rankings that adhere to user instructions without sacrificing personalization. Experiments show that COREC: (1) exceeds state-of-the-art baselines on standard recommendation effectiveness and (2) demonstrates superior adherence to specific attribute requirements, proving that COREC enables fine-grained and predictable manipulation of the rankings.</description>

      <title>Save, Revisit, Retain: A Scalable Framework for Enhancing User Retention in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User retention is a critical objective for online platforms like Pinterest, as it strengthens user loyalty and drives growth through repeated engagement. A key indicator of retention is revisitation, i.e., when users return to view previously saved content, a behavior often sparked by personalized recommendations and user satisfaction. However, modeling and optimizing revisitation poses significant challenges. One core difficulty is accurate attribution: it is often unclear which specific user actions or content exposures trigger a revisit, since many confounding factors (e.g., content quality, user interface, notifications, or even changing user intent) can influence return behavior. Additionally, the scale and timing of revisitations introduce further complexity; users may revisit content days or even weeks after their initial interaction, requiring the system to maintain and associate extensive historical records across millions of users and sessions. These complexities render existing methods insufficient for robustly capturing and optimizing long-term revisitation. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel, lightweight, and interpretable framework for modeling revisitation behavior and optimizing long-term user retention in Pinterest's search-based recommendation context. By defining a surrogate attribution process that links saves to subsequent revisitations, we reduce noise in the causal relationship between user actions and return visits. Our scalable event aggregation pipeline enables large-scale analysis of user revisitation patterns and enhances the ranking system's ability to surface items with high retention value. Deployed on Pinterest's Related Pins surface to serve 500+ million users, the framework led to a significant lift of 0.1% in active users without additional computational costs.</description>

      <title>Extracting Interaction-Aware Monosemantic Concepts in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for extracting \emph{monosemantic} neurons, defined as latent dimensions that align with coherent and interpretable concepts, from user and item embeddings in recommender systems. Our approach employs a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to reveal semantic structure within pretrained representations. In contrast to work on language models, monosemanticity in recommendation must preserve the interactions between separate user and item embeddings. To achieve this, we introduce a \emph{prediction aware} training objective that backpropagates through a frozen recommender and aligns the learned latent structure with the model's user-item affinity predictions. The resulting neurons capture properties such as genre, popularity, and temporal trends, and support post hoc control operations including targeted filtering and content promotion without modifying the base model. Our method generalizes across different recommendation models and datasets, providing a practical tool for interpretable and controllable personalization.

      <title>Fidelity-Aware Recommendation Explanations via Stochastic Path Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explanation fidelity, which measures how accurately an explanation reflects a model's true reasoning, remains critically underexplored in recommender systems. We introduce SPINRec (Stochastic Path Integration for Neural Recommender Explanations), a model-agnostic approach that adapts path-integration techniques to the sparse and implicit nature of recommendation data. To overcome the limitations of prior methods, SPINRec employs stochastic baseline sampling: instead of integrating from a fixed or unrealistic baseline, it samples multiple plausible user profiles from the empirical data distribution and selects the most faithful attribution path. This design captures the influence of both observed and unobserved interactions, yielding more stable and personalized explanations. We conduct the most comprehensive fidelity evaluation to date across three models (MF, VAE, NCF), three datasets (ML1M, Yahoo! Music, Pinterest), and a suite of counterfactual metrics, including AUC-based perturbation curves and fixed-length diagnostics. SPINRec consistently outperforms all baselines, establishing a new benchmark for faithful explainability in recommendation. Code and evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/DeltaLabTLV/SPINRec.</description>

      <title>ProHD: Projection-Based Hausdorff Distance Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hausdorff distance (HD) is a robust measure of set dissimilarity, but computing it exactly on large, high-dimensional datasets is prohibitively expensive. We propose \textbf{ProHD}, a projection-guided approximation algorithm that dramatically accelerates HD computation while maintaining high accuracy. ProHD identifies a small subset of candidate "extreme" points by projecting the data onto a few informative directions (such as the centroid axis and top principal components) and computing the HD on this subset. This approach guarantees an underestimate of the true HD with a bounded additive error and typically achieves results within a few percent of the exact value. In extensive experiments on image, physics, and synthetic datasets (up to two million points in $D=256$), ProHD runs 10--100$\times$ faster than exact algorithms while attaining 5--20$\times$ lower error than random sampling-based approximations. Our method enables practical HD calculations in scenarios like large vector databases and streaming data, where quick and reliable set distance estimation is needed.</description>

      <title>LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Democratic Recommendation with User and Item Representatives Produced by Graph Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenges associated with large-scale user-item interaction graphs have attracted increasing attention in graph-based recommendation systems, primarily due to computational inefficiencies and inadequate information propagation. Existing methods provide partial solutions but suffer from notable limitations: model-centric approaches, such as sampling and aggregation, often struggle with generalization, while data-centric techniques, including graph sparsification and coarsening, lead to information loss and ineffective handling of bipartite graph structures. Recent advances in graph condensation offer a promising direction by reducing graph size while preserving essential information, presenting a novel approach to mitigating these challenges. Inspired by the principles of democracy, we propose \textbf{DemoRec}, a framework that leverages graph condensation to generate user and item representatives for recommendation tasks. By constructing a compact interaction graph and clustering nodes with shared characteristics from the original graph, DemoRec significantly reduces graph size and computational complexity. Furthermore, it mitigates the over-reliance on high-order information, a critical challenge in large-scale bipartite graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DemoRec, showcasing substantial improvements in recommendation performance, computational efficiency, and robustness compared to SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Enhanced Graph Invariant Contrastive Learning for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a significant challenge in graph recommender systems. Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose {$\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs. Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction. These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links. Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations. Experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that InvGCLLM achieves significant improvements in out-of-distribution recommendation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>UFO: Unfair-to-Fair Evolving Mitigates Unfairness in LLM-based Recommender Systems via Self-Play Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model-based Recommender Systems (LRSs) have demonstrated superior recommendation performance by integrating pre-training with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, this approach introduces item-side unfairness. Existing studies primarily attribute this issue to the absence of fairness constraints during SFT and attempt to mitigate unfairness via re-weighting and re-ranking methods. In this paper, we find that unfairness arises not only from SFT but also from pre-training, where inherent biases are further amplified during SFT. This finding underscores the failure of current methods to address the root causes of unfairness. Moreover, current methods struggle to preserve satisfactory recommendation performance. To tackle these issues, we propose an Unfair-to-Fair evOlving (UFO) framework using a self-play mechanism, formulating unfairness mitigation as a two-player game. UFO alternates between two player roles: the \textit{judger}, which identifies unfairness from both pre-training and SFT, and the \textit{corrector}, which adjusts the LRS to address identified unfairness while preserving recommendation performance. Iterative optimization between these roles enables UFO to completely resolve unfairness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UFO effectively mitigates unfairness while improving recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Time Matters: Enhancing Sequential Recommendations with Time-Guided Graph Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) is widely deployed in e-commerce platforms, streaming services, etc., revealing significant potential to enhance user experience. However, existing methods often overlook two critical factors: irregular user interests between interactions and highly uneven item distributions over time. The former factor implies that actual user preferences are not always continuous, and long-term historical interactions may not be relevant to current purchasing behavior. Therefore, relying only on these historical interactions for recommendations may result in a lack of user interest at the target time. The latter factor, characterized by peaks and valleys in interaction frequency, may result from seasonal trends, special events, or promotions. These externally driven distributions may not align with individual user interests, leading to inaccurate recommendations. To address these deficiencies, we propose TGODE to both enhance and capture the long-term historical interactions. Specifically, we first construct a user time graph and item evolution graph, which utilize user personalized preferences and global item distribution information, respectively. To tackle the temporal sparsity caused by irregular user interactions, we design a time-guided diffusion generator to automatically obtain an augmented time-aware user graph. Additionally, we devise a user interest truncation factor to efficiently identify sparse time intervals and achieve balanced preference inference. After that, the augmented user graph and item graph are fed into a generalized graph neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to align with the evolution of user preferences and item distributions. This allows two patterns of information evolution to be matched over time. Experimental results demonstrate that TGODE outperforms baseline methods across five datasets, with improvements ranging from 10% to 46%.</description>

      <title>A Recommender System Based on Binary Matrix Representations for Cognitive Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosing cognitive (mental health) disorders is a delicate and complex task. Identifying the next most informative symptoms to assess, in order to distinguish between possible disorders, presents an additional challenge. This process requires comprehensive knowledge of diagnostic criteria and symptom overlap across disorders, making it difficult to navigate based on symptoms alone. This research aims to develop a recommender system for cognitive disorder diagnosis using binary matrix representations. The core algorithm utilizes a binary matrix of disorders and their symptom combinations. It filters through the rows and columns based on the patient's current symptoms to identify potential disorders and recommend the most informative next symptoms to examine. A prototype of the recommender system was implemented in Python. Using synthetic test and some real-life data, the system successfully identified plausible disorders from an initial symptom set and recommended further symptoms to refine the diagnosis. It also provided additional context on the symptom-disorder relationships. Although this is a prototype, the recommender system shows potential as a clinical support tool. A fully-developed application of this recommender system may assist mental health professionals in identifying relevant disorders more efficiently and guiding symptom-specific follow-up investigations to improve diagnostic accuracy.</description>

      <title>When and What to Recommend: Joint Modeling of Timing and Content for Active Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation models user preferences to predict the next target item. Most existing work is passive, where the system responds only when users open the application, missing chances after closure. We investigate active recommendation, which predicts the next interaction time and actively delivers items. Two challenges: accurately estimating the Time of Interest (ToI) and generating Item of Interest (IoI) conditioned on the predicted ToI. We propose PASRec, a diffusion-based framework that aligns ToI and IoI via a joint objective. Experiments on five benchmarks show superiority over eight state-of-the-art baselines under leave-one-out and temporal splits.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Large Language Models with Adaptive Preference Optimization for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for sequential recommendation by enabling natural language reasoning over user behavior sequences. A common approach formulates recommendation as a language modeling task, where interaction histories are transformed into prompts and user preferences are learned via supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods operate solely in the textual modality and often miss users' fine-grained interests, especially when shaped by rich visual signals such as product images or movie posters. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by aligning text and vision in a shared semantic space. A prevalent training paradigm applies Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to model user preferences. Yet, two core challenges remain: 1) Imbalanced sample hardness, where random negative sampling causes overfitting on easy examples and under-training on hard ones; 2) Cross-modal semantic bias, where the fixed reference model in DPO prevents the policy model from correcting modality misalignments--especially over long sequences. To address these issues, we propose a Multimodal LLM framework that integrates Hardness-aware and Noise-regularized preference optimization for Recommendation (HaNoRec). Specifically, HaNoRec dynamically adjusts optimization weights based on both the estimated hardness of each training sample and the policy model's real-time responsiveness, prioritizing harder examples. It further introduces Gaussian-perturbed distribution optimization on output logits to enhance cross-modal semantic consistency and reduce modality bias inherited from the reference model.</description>

      <title>STORE: Semantic Tokenization, Orthogonal Rotation and Efficient Attention for Scaling Up Ranking Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking models have become an important part of modern personalized recommendation systems. However, significant challenges persist in handling high-cardinality, heterogeneous, and sparse feature spaces, particularly regarding model scalability and efficiency. We identify two key bottlenecks: (i) Representation Bottleneck: Driven by the high cardinality and dynamic nature of features, model capacity is forced into sparse-activated embedding layers, leading to low-rank representations. This, in turn, triggers phenomena like "One-Epoch" and "Interaction-Collapse," ultimately hindering model scalability.(ii) Computational Bottleneck: Integrating all heterogeneous features into a unified model triggers an explosion in the number of feature tokens, rendering traditional attention mechanisms computationally demanding and susceptible to attention dispersion. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce STORE, a unified and scalable token-based ranking framework built upon three core innovations: (1) Semantic Tokenization fundamentally tackles feature heterogeneity and sparsity by decomposing high-cardinality sparse features into a compact set of stable semantic tokens; and (2) Orthogonal Rotation Transformation is employed to rotate the subspace spanned by low-cardinality static features, which facilitates more efficient and effective feature interactions; and (3) Efficient attention that filters low-contributing tokens to improve computional efficiency while preserving model accuracy. Across extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests, our framework consistently improves prediction accuracy(online CTR by 2.71%, AUC by 1.195%) and training effeciency (1.84 throughput).</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-treatment Uplift Modeling for Trade-off Optimization in Short-Video Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of short videos on social media platforms presents unique challenges and opportunities for recommendation systems. Users exhibit diverse preferences, and the responses resulting from different strategies often conflict with one another, potentially exhibiting inverse correlations between metrics such as watch time and video view counts. Existing uplift models face limitations in handling the heterogeneous multi-treatment scenarios of short-video recommendations, often failing to effectively capture both the synergistic and individual causal effects of different strategies. Furthermore, traditional fixed-weight approaches for balancing these responses lack personalization and can result in biased decision-making. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Multi-treatment Uplift Modeling (HMUM) framework for trade-off optimization in short-video recommendations. HMUM comprises an Offline Hybrid Uplift Modeling (HUM) module, which captures the synergistic and individual effects of multiple strategies, and an Online Dynamic Decision-Making (DDM) module, which estimates the value weights of different user responses in real-time for personalized decision-making. Evaluated on two public datasets, an industrial dataset, and through online A/B experiments on the Kuaishou platform, our model demonstrated superior offline performance and significant improvements in key metrics. It is now fully deployed on the platform, benefiting hundreds of millions of users.</description>

      <title>BioArtlas: Computational Clustering of Multi-Dimensional Complexity in Bioart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioart's hybrid nature spanning art, science, technology, ethics, and politics defies traditional single-axis categorization. I present BioArtlas, analyzing 81 bioart works across thirteen curated dimensions using novel axis-aware representations that preserve semantic distinctions while enabling cross-dimensional comparison. Our codebook-based approach groups related concepts into unified clusters, addressing polysemy in cultural terminology. Comprehensive evaluation of up to 800 representation-space-algorithm combinations identifies Agglomerative clustering at k=15 on 4D UMAP as optimal (silhouette 0.664 +/- 0.008, trustworthiness/continuity 0.805/0.812). The approach reveals four organizational patterns: artist-specific methodological cohesion, technique-based segmentation, temporal artistic evolution, and trans-temporal conceptual affinities. By separating analytical optimization from public communication, I provide rigorous analysis and accessible exploration through an interactive web interface (https://www.bioartlas.com) with the dataset publicly available (https://github.com/joonhyungbae/BioArtlas).</description>

      <title>What Drives Cross-lingual Ranking? Retrieval Approaches with Multilingual Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) enables access to multilingual knowledge but remains challenging due to disparities in resources, scripts, and weak cross-lingual semantic alignment in embedding models. Existing pipelines often rely on translation and monolingual retrieval heuristics, which add computational overhead and noise, degrading performance. This work systematically evaluates four intervention types, namely document translation, multilingual dense retrieval with pretrained encoders, contrastive learning at word, phrase, and query-document levels, and cross-encoder re-ranking, across three benchmark datasets. We find that dense retrieval models trained specifically for CLIR consistently outperform lexical matching methods and derive little benefit from document translation. Contrastive learning mitigates language biases and yields substantial improvements for encoders with weak initial alignment, and re-ranking can be effective, but depends on the quality of the cross-encoder training data. Although high-resource languages still dominate overall performance, gains over lexical and document-translated baselines are most pronounced for low-resource and cross-script pairs. These findings indicate that cross-lingual search systems should prioritise semantic multilingual embeddings and targeted learning-based alignment over translation-based pipelines, particularly for cross-script and under-resourced languages.</description>

      <title>Generative Query Expansion with Multilingual LLMs for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query expansion is the reformulation of a user query by adding semantically related information, and is an essential component of monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval used to ensure that relevant documents are not missed. Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts. Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format. These outcomes underline the need for more balanced multilingual and cross-lingual training and evaluation resources.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Feedback Models for HyDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent approaches that leverage large language models (LLMs) for pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) have generally not utilized well-established feedback models like Rocchio and RM3 when expanding queries for sparse retrievers like BM25. Instead, they often opt for a simple string concatenation of the query and LLM-generated expansion content. But is this optimal? To answer this question, we revisit and systematically evaluate traditional feedback models in the context of HyDE, a popular method that enriches query representations with LLM-generated hypothetical answer documents. Our experiments show that HyDE's effectiveness can be substantially improved when leveraging feedback algorithms such as Rocchio to extract and weight expansion terms, providing a simple way to further enhance the accuracy of LLM-based PRF methods.</description>

      <title>Principled Context Engineering for RAG: Statistical Guarantees via Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Evidence-Guided LLMs to Enhance Trustworthy Depression Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating clinical diagnosis, yet their non-transparent decision-making and limited alignment with diagnostic standards hinder trust and clinical adoption. We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77. Overall, EGDR yields up to +45% accuracy and +36% DCS gains over baseline methods, offering a clinically grounded, interpretable foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted diagnosis.</description>

      <title>HyM-UNet: Synergizing Local Texture and Global Context via Hybrid CNN-Mamba Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate organ and lesion segmentation is a critical prerequisite for computer-aided diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), constrained by their local receptive fields, often struggle to capture complex global anatomical structures. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hybrid architecture, HyM-UNet, designed to synergize the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the efficient global modeling capabilities of Mamba. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that utilizes convolutional modules in the shallow stages to preserve high-frequency texture details, while introducing Visual Mamba modules in the deep stages to capture long-range semantic dependencies with linear complexity. To bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and the decoder, we propose a Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection (MGF-Skip). This module leverages deep semantic features as gating signals to dynamically suppress background noise within shallow features, thereby enhancing the perception of ambiguous boundaries. We conduct extensive experiments on public benchmark dataset ISIC 2018. The results demonstrate that HyM-UNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice coefficient and IoU, while maintaining lower parameter counts and inference latency. This validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in handling medical segmentation tasks characterized by complex shapes and scale variations.</description>

      <title>Paper2SysArch: Structure-Constrained System Architecture Generation from Scientific Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manual creation of system architecture diagrams for scientific papers is a time-consuming and subjective process, while existing generative models lack the necessary structural control and semantic understanding for this task. A primary obstacle hindering research and development in this domain has been the profound lack of a standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate the automated generation of diagrams from text. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization. It consists of 3,000 research papers paired with their corresponding high-quality ground-truth diagrams and is accompanied by a three-tiered evaluation metric assessing semantic accuracy, layout coherence, and visual quality. Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0. This work's principal contribution is the establishment of a large-scale, foundational benchmark to enable reproducible research and fair comparison. Meanwhile, our proposed system serves as a viable proof-of-concept, demonstrating a promising path forward for this complex task.</description>

      <title>Path-Constrained Retrieval: A Structural Approach to Reliable LLM Agent Reasoning Through Graph-Scoped Semantic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model agents often retrieve context from knowledge bases that lack structural consistency with the agent's current reasoning state, leading to incoherent reasoning chains. We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information. These findings suggest that path-constrained retrieval is an effective approach for improving the reliability and coherence of LLM agent reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Toward an AI-Native Internet: Rethinking the Web Architecture for Semantic Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Generative AI Search is fundamentally transforming how users and intelligent systems interact with the Internet. LLMs increasingly act as intermediaries between humans and web information. Yet the web remains optimized for human browsing rather than AI-driven semantic retrieval, resulting in wasted network bandwidth, lower information quality, and unnecessary complexity for developers. We introduce the concept of an AI-Native Internet, a web architecture in which servers expose semantically relevant information chunks rather than full documents, supported by a Web-native semantic resolver that allows AI applications to discover relevant information sources before retrieving fine-grained chunks. Through motivational experiments, we quantify the inefficiencies of current HTML-based retrieval, and outline architectural directions and open challenges for evolving today's document-centric web into an AI-oriented substrate that better supports semantic access to web content.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Conversational Agent for Tabular Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can reshape information processing by handling data analysis, visualization, and interpretation in an interactive, context-aware dialogue with users, including voice interaction, while maintaining high performance. In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering: Orchestrating Users and Items for Agentic Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic recommendations cast recommenders as large language model (LLM) agents that can plan, reason, use tools, and interact with users of varying preferences in web applications. However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.</description>

      <title>General Agentic Memory Via Deep Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory is critical for AI agents, yet the widely-adopted static memory, aiming to create readily available memory in advance, is inevitably subject to severe information loss. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{general agentic memory (GAM)}. GAM follows the principle of "\textbf{just-in time (JIT) compilation}" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) \textbf{Memorizer}, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) \textbf{Researcher}, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning. In our experimental study, we demonstrate that GAM achieves substantial improvement on various memory-grounded task completion scenarios against existing memory systems.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Require Curated Context for Reliable Political Fact-Checking -- Even with Reasoning and Web Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have raised hopes for automated end-to-end fact-checking, but prior studies report mixed results. As mainstream chatbots increasingly ship with reasoning capabilities and web search tools -- and millions of users already rely on them for verification -- rigorous evaluation is urgent. We evaluate 15 recent LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek on more than 6,000 claims fact-checked by PolitiFact, comparing standard models with reasoning- and web-search variants. Standard models perform poorly, reasoning offers minimal benefits, and web search provides only moderate gains, despite fact-checks being available on the web. In contrast, a curated RAG system using PolitiFact summaries improved macro F1 by 233% on average across model variants. These findings suggest that giving models access to curated high-quality context is a promising path for automated fact-checking.</description>

      <title>From Raw Features to Effective Embeddings: A Three-Stage Approach for Multimodal Recipe Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recipe recommendation has become an essential task in web-based food platforms. A central challenge is effectively leveraging rich multimodal features beyond user-recipe interactions. Our analysis shows that even simple uses of multimodal signals yield competitive performance, suggesting that systematic enhancement of these signals is highly promising. We propose TESMR, a 3-stage framework for recipe recommendation that progressively refines raw multimodal features into effective embeddings through: (1) content-based enhancement using foundation models with multimodal comprehension, (2) relation-based enhancement via message propagation over user-recipe interactions, and (3) learning-based enhancement through contrastive learning with learnable embeddings. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that TESMR outperforms existing methods, achieving 7-15% higher Recall@10.</description>

      <title>Inductive Generative Recommendation via Retrieval-based Speculation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm that tokenizes items into discrete tokens and learns to autoregressively generate the next tokens as predictions. While this token-generation paradigm is expected to surpass traditional transductive methods, potentially generating new items directly based on semantics, we empirically show that GR models predominantly generate items seen during training and struggle to recommend unseen items. In this paper, we propose SpecGR, a plug-and-play framework that enables GR models to recommend new items in an inductive setting. SpecGR uses a drafter model with inductive capability to propose candidate items, which may include both existing items and new items. The GR model then acts as a verifier, accepting or rejecting candidates while retaining its strong ranking capabilities. We further introduce the guided re-drafting technique to make the proposed candidates more aligned with the outputs of generative recommendation models, improving the verification efficiency. We consider two variants for drafting: (1) using an auxiliary drafter model for better flexibility, or (2) leveraging the GR model's own encoder for parameter-efficient self-drafting. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SpecGR exhibits both strong inductive recommendation ability and the best overall performance among the compared methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Jamesding000/SpecGR.</description>

      <title>Pathway to Relevance: How Cross-Encoders Implement a Semantic Variant of BM25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretation has greatly contributed to a more detailed understanding of generative language models, enabling significant progress in identifying structures that implement key behaviors through interactions between internal components. In contrast, interpretability in information retrieval (IR) remains relatively coarse-grained, and much is still unknown as to how IR models determine whether a document is relevant to a query. In this work, we address this gap by mechanistically analyzing how one commonly used model, a cross-encoder, estimates relevance. We find that the model extracts traditional relevance signals, such as term frequency and inverse document frequency, in early-to-middle layers. These concepts are then combined in later layers, similar to the well-known probabilistic ranking function, BM25. Overall, our analysis offers a more nuanced understanding of how IR models compute relevance. Isolating these components lays the groundwork for future interventions that could enhance transparency, mitigate safety risks, and improve scalability.</description>

      <title>A Zero-shot Explainable Doctor Ranking Framework with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online medical service provides patients convenient access to doctors, but effectively ranking doctors based on specific medical needs remains challenging. Current ranking approaches typically lack the interpretability crucial for patient trust and informed decision-making. Additionally, the scarcity of standardized benchmarks and labeled data for supervised learning impedes progress in expertise-aware doctor ranking. To address these challenges, we propose an explainable ranking framework for doctor ranking powered by large language models in a zero-shot setting. Our framework dynamically generates disease-specific ranking criteria to guide the large language model in assessing doctor relevance with transparency and consistency. It further enhances interpretability by generating step-by-step rationales for its ranking decisions, improving the overall explainability of the information retrieval process. To support rigorous evaluation, we built and released DrRank, a novel expertise-driven dataset comprising 38 disease-treatment pairs and 4,325 doctor profiles. On this benchmark, our framework significantly outperforms the strongest baseline by +6.45 NDCG@10. Comprehensive analyses also show our framework is fair across disease types, patient gender, and geographic regions. Furthermore, verification by medical experts confirms the reliability and interpretability of our approach, reinforcing its potential for trustworthy, real-world doctor recommendation. To demonstrate its broader applicability, we validate our framework on two datasets from BEIR benchmark, where it again achieves superior performance. The code and associated data are available at: https://github.com/YangLab-BUPT/DrRank.</description>

      <title>VALUE: Value-Aware Large Language Model for Query Rewriting via Weighted Trie in Sponsored Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query-to-bidword(i.e., bidding keyword) rewriting is fundamental to sponsored search, transforming noisy user queries into semantically relevant and commercially valuable keywords. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) improve semantic relevance through generative retrieval frameworks, but they rarely encode the commercial value of keywords. As a result, rewrites are often semantically correct yet economically suboptimal, and a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stage is usually added after supervised fine-tuning(SFT) to mitigate this deficiency. However, conventional preference alignment frequently overemphasize the ordering of bidword values and is susceptible to overfitting, which degrades rewrite quality. In addition, bidword value changes rapidly, while existing generative methods do not respond to these fluctuations. To address this shortcoming, we introduce VALUE(Value-Aware Large language model for qUery rewriting via wEighted trie), a framework that integrates value awareness directly into generation and enhances value alignment during training. VALUE employs the Weighted Trie, a novel variant of the classical trie that stores real-time value signals for each token. During decoding, the framework adjusts the LLM's token probabilities with these signals, constraining the search space and steering generation toward high-value rewrites. The alignment stage uses a fine-grained preference learning strategy that emphasizes stable, high-value differences and down-weights noisy or transient fluctuations, thereby improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Offline experiments show that VALUE significantly outperforms baselines in both semantic matching and value-centric metrics. VALUE has been deployed on our advertising system since October 2024 and served the Double Eleven promotions, the biggest shopping carnival in China.</description>

      <title>QPAD: Quantile-Preserving Approximate Dimension Reduction for Nearest Neighbors Preservation in High-Dimensional Vector Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional vector embeddings are widely used in retrieval systems, but they often suffer from noise, the curse of dimensionality, and slow runtime. However, dimensionality reduction (DR) is rarely applied due to its tendency to distort the nearest-neighbor (NN) structure that is critical for search. Existing DR techniques such as PCA and UMAP optimize global or manifold-preserving criteria, rather than retrieval-specific objectives. We present QPAD -- Quantile-Preserving Approximate Dimension Reduction, an unsupervised DR method that explicitly preserves approximate NN relations by maximizing the margin between k-NNs and non-k-NNs under a soft orthogonality constraint. We analyze its complexity and favorable properties. This design enables QPAD to retain ANN-relevant geometry without supervision or changes to the original embedding model, while supporting scalability for large-scale vector search and being indexable for ANN search. Experiments across five domains show that QPAD consistently outperforms eleven standard DR methods in preserving neighborhood structure, enabling more accurate search in reduced dimensions.</description>

      <title>Capturing User Interests from Data Streams for Continual Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based sequential recommendation (SR) models excel at modeling long-range dependencies in user behavior via self-attention. However, updating them with continuously arriving behavior sequences incurs high computational costs or leads to catastrophic forgetting. Although continual learning, a standard approach for non-stationary data streams, has recently been applied to recommendation, existing methods gradually forget long-term user preferences and remain underexplored in SR. In this paper, we introduce Continual Sequential Transformer for Recommendation (CSTRec). CSTRec is designed to effectively adapt to current interests by leveraging well-preserved historical ones, thus capturing the trajectory of user interests over time. The core of CSTRec is Continual Sequential Attention (CSA), a linear attention tailored for continual SR, which enables CSTRec to partially retain historical knowledge without direct access to prior data. CSA has two key components: (1) Cauchy-Schwarz Normalization that stabilizes learning over time under uneven user interaction frequencies; (2) Collaborative Interest Enrichment that alleviates forgetting through shared, learnable interest pools. In addition, we introduce a new technique to facilitate the adaptation of new users by transferring historical knowledge from existing users with similar interests. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that CSTRec outperforms state-of-the-art models in both knowledge retention and acquisition.</description>

      <title>Forgetful by Design? A Critical Audit of YouTube's Search API for Academic Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper critically audits the search endpoint of YouTube's Data API (v3), a common tool for academic research. Through systematic weekly searches over six months using eleven queries, we identify major limitations regarding completeness, representativeness, consistency, and bias. Our findings reveal substantial differences between ranking parameters like relevance and date in terms of video recall and precision, with relevance often retrieving numerous off-topic videos. We also observe severe temporal decay in video discoverability: the number of retrievable videos for a given period drops dramatically within just 20-60 days of publication, even though these videos remain on the platform. This potentially undermines research designs that rely on systematic data collection. Furthermore, search results lack consistency, with identical queries yielding different video sets over time, compromising replicability. A case study on the European Parliament elections highlights how these issues impact research outcomes. While the paper offers several mitigation strategies, it concludes that the API's search function, potentially prioritizing 'freshness' over comprehensive retrieval, is not adequate for robust academic research, especially concerning Digital Services Act requirements.</description>

      <title>GFlowGR: Fine-tuning Generative Recommendation Frameworks with Generative Flow Networks</title>

Abstract: Generative recommendations (GR), which usually include item tokenizers and generative Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of scenarios. The majority of existing research efforts primarily concentrate on developing powerful item tokenizers or advancing LLM decoding strategies to attain superior performance. However, the critical fine-tuning step in GR frameworks, which is essential for adapting LLMs to recommendation data, remains largely unexplored. Current approaches predominantly rely on either the next-token prediction loss of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or recommendationspecific direct preference optimization (DPO) strategies. Both methods ignore the exploration of possible positive unobserved samples, which is commonly referred to as the exposure bias problem. To mitigate this problem, this paper treats the GR as a multi-step generation task and constructs a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework (GFlowGR). The proposed framework integrates collaborative knowledge from traditional recommender systems to create an adaptive trajectory sampler and a comprehensive reward model. Leveraging the diverse generation property of GFlowNets, along with sampling and heuristic weighting techniques, GFlowGR emerges as a promising approach to mitigate the exposure bias problem. Extensive empirical results on two real-world datasets and with two different GR backbones highlight the effectiveness and robustness of GFlowGR.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale clinical databases offer opportunities for medical research, but their complexity creates barriers to effective use. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), one of the world's largest open-source electronic health record databases, traditionally requires both SQL proficiency and clinical domain expertise. We introduce M3, a system that enables natural language querying of MIMIC-IV data through the Model Context Protocol. With a single command, M3 retrieves MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance or connects to hosted BigQuery, and allows researchers to pose clinical questions in plain English. We evaluated M3 using one hundred questions from the EHRSQL 2024 benchmark with two language models: the proprietary Claude Sonnet 4 achieved 94% accuracy, while the open-source gpt-oss-20B (deployable locally on consumer hardware) achieved 93% accuracy. Both models translate natural language into SQL, execute queries against MIMIC-IV, and return structured results alongside the underlying query for verification. Error analysis revealed that most failures stemmed from complex temporal reasoning or ambiguous question phrasing rather than fundamental architectural limitations. The comparable performance of a smaller open-source model demonstrates that privacy-preserving local deployment is viable for sensitive clinical data analysis. M3 lowers technical barriers to critical care data analysis while maintaining security through OAuth2 authentication, query validation, and comprehensive audit logging.</description>

      <title>Modeling Item-Level Dynamic Variability with Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing solutions for bundle recommendation (BR) have achieved remarkable effectiveness for predicting the user's preference for prebuilt bundles. However, bundle-item (B-I) affiliation will vary dynamically in real scenarios. For example, a bundle themed as 'casual outfit' may add 'hat' or remove 'watch' due to factors such as seasonal variations, changes in user preferences or inventory adjustments. Our empirical study demonstrates that the performance of mainstream BR models may fluctuate or decline under item-level variability. This paper makes the first attempt to address the above problem and proposes a novel Residual Diffusion for Bundle Recommendation(RDiffBR)asamodel-agnostic generative framework which can assist a BR model in adapting this scenario. During the initial training of the BR model, RDiffBR employs a residual diffusion model to process the item-level bundle embeddings which are generated by the BR model to represent bundle theme via a forward-reverse process. In the inference stage, RDiffBR reverses item-level bundle embeddings obtained by the well-trained bundle model under B-I variability scenarios to generate the effective item level bundle embeddings. In particular, the residual connection in our residual approximator significantly enhances BR models' ability to generate high-quality item-level bundle embeddings. Experiments on six BR models and four public datasets from different domains show that RDiffBR improves the performance of Recall and NDCG of backbone BR models by up to 23%, while only increased training time about 4%.</description>

      <title>G-UBS: Towards Robust Understanding of Implicit Feedback via Group-Aware User Behavior Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User feedback is critical for refining recommendation systems, yet explicit feedback (e.g., likes or dislikes) remains scarce in practice. As a more feasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback has shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video usually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often noisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons, rather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests, thereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which leverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and in-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users. Specifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager (UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a ``summarize-cluster-reflect" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback Modeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning approach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the reinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the reasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have constructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit feedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k videos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback. Extensive experiments on IF-VR demonstrate that G-UBS significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs and MLLMs, with a 4.0% higher proportion of videos achieving a play rate &gt; 30% and 14.9% higher reasoning accuracy on IF-VR.</description>

Abstract: Semantic IDs are discrete identifiers generated by quantizing the Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) embeddings, enabling efficient multi-modal content integration in recommendation systems. However, their lack of collaborative signals results in a misalignment with downstream discriminative and generative recommendation objectives. Recent studies have introduced various alignment mechanisms to address this problem, but their two-stage framework design still leads to two main limitations: (1) inevitable information loss during alignment, and (2) inflexibility in applying adaptive alignment strategies, consequently constraining the mutual information maximization during the alignment process. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and flexible one-stage Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs (DAS) method that simultaneously optimizes quantization and alignment, preserving semantic integrity and alignment quality while avoiding the information loss typically associated with two-stage methods. Meanwhile, DAS achieves more efficient alignment between the semantic IDs and collaborative signals, with the following two innovative and effective approaches: (1) Multi-view Constrative Alignment: To maximize mutual information between semantic IDs and collaborative signals, we first incorporate an ID-based CF debias module, and then design three effective contrastive alignment methods: dual user-to-item (u2i), dual item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u), and dual co-occurrence item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u). (2) Dual Learning: By aligning the dual quantizations of users and ads, the constructed semantic IDs for users and ads achieve stronger alignment. Finally, we conduct extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests to evaluate DAS's effectiveness, which is now successfully deployed across various advertising scenarios at Kuaishou App, serving over 400 million users daily.</description>

      <title>TBGRecall: A Generative Retrieval Model for E-commerce Recommendation Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommendation systems are essential tools in modern e-commerce, facilitating personalized user experiences by suggesting relevant products. Recent advancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing recommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in optimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive generation mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential dependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable for generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single request session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a framework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance generative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework reformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences, where each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens, and then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative task in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline integrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial incremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and emphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our extensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale industrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend. Ultimately, NSP represents a significant advancement in the effectiveness of generative recommendation systems for e-commerce applications.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Aligning Knowledge Bases with User Needs to Enhance Mental Health Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Access to reliable mental health information is vital for early help-seeking, yet expanding knowledge bases is resource-intensive and often misaligned with user needs. This results in poor performance of retrieval systems when presented concerns are not covered or expressed in informal or contextualized language. We present an AI-based gap-informed framework for corpus augmentation that authentically identifies underrepresented topics (gaps) by overlaying naturalistic user data such as forum posts in order to prioritize expansions based on coverage and usefulness. In a case study, we compare Directed (gap-informed augmentations) with Non-Directed augmentation (random additions), evaluating the relevance and usefulness of retrieved information across four retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. Directed augmentation achieved near-optimal performance with modest expansions--requiring only a 42% increase for Query Transformation, 74% for Reranking and Hierarchical, and 318% for Baseline--to reach ~95% of the performance of an exhaustive reference corpus. In contrast, Non-Directed augmentation required substantially larger and thus practically infeasible expansions to achieve comparable performance (232%, 318%, 403%, and 763%, respectively). These results show that strategically targeted corpus growth can reduce content creation demands while sustaining high retrieval and provision quality, offering a scalable approach for building trusted health information repositories and supporting generative AI applications in high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>MGFRec: Towards Reinforced Reasoning Recommendation with Multiple Groundings and Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have inspired researchers to apply them to reasoning-based recommendation tasks, which require in-depth reasoning about user interests and the generation of recommended items. However, previous reasoning-based recommendation methods have typically performed inference within the language space alone, without incorporating the actual item space. This has led to over-interpreting user interests and deviating from real items. Towards this research gap, we propose performing multiple rounds of grounding during inference to help the LLM better understand the actual item space, which could ensure that its reasoning remains aligned with real items. Furthermore, we introduce a user agent that provides feedback during each grounding step, enabling the LLM to better recognize and adapt to user interests. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three Amazon review datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating multiple groundings and feedback. These findings underscore the critical importance of reasoning within the actual item space, rather than being confined to the language space, for recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>DiffuGR: Generative Document Retrieval with Diffusion Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08150v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) re-frames document retrieval as a sequence-based document identifier (DocID) generation task, memorizing documents with model parameters and enabling end-to-end retrieval without explicit indexing. Existing GR methods are based on auto-regressive generative models, i.e., the token generation is performed from left to right. However, such auto-regressive methods suffer from: (1) mismatch between DocID generation and natural language generation, e.g., an incorrect DocID token generated in early left steps would lead to totally erroneous retrieval; and (2) failure to balance the trade-off between retrieval efficiency and accuracy dynamically, which is crucial for practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose generative document retrieval with diffusion language models, dubbed DiffuGR. It models DocID generation as a discrete diffusion process: during training, DocIDs are corrupted through a stochastic masking process, and a diffusion language model is learned to recover them under a retrieval-aware objective. For inference, DiffuGR attempts to generate DocID tokens in parallel and refines them through a controllable number of denoising steps. In contrast to conventional left-to-right auto-regressive decoding, DiffuGR provides a novel mechanism to first generate more confident DocID tokens and refine the generation through diffusion-based denoising. Moreover, DiffuGR also offers explicit runtime control over the qualitylatency tradeoff. Extensive experiments on benchmark retrieval datasets show that DiffuGR is competitive with strong auto-regressive generative retrievers, while offering flexible speed and accuracy tradeoffs through variable denoising budgets. Overall, our results indicate that non-autoregressive diffusion models are a practical and effective alternative for generative document retrieval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in leveraging structured world knowledge and multi-step reasoning capabilities. However, fundamental challenges arise when transforming LLMs into real-world recommender systems due to semantic and behavioral misalignment. To bridge this gap, we propose Align$^3$GR, a novel framework that unifies token-level, behavior modeling-level, and preference-level alignment. Our approach introduces: Dual tokenization fusing user-item semantic and collaborative signals. Enhanced behavior modeling with bidirectional semantic alignment. Progressive DPO strategy combining self-play (SP-DPO) and real-world feedback (RF-DPO) for dynamic preference adaptation. Experiments show Align$^3$GR outperforms the SOTA baseline by +17.8% in Recall@10 and +20.2% in NDCG@10 on the public dataset, with significant gains in online A/B tests and full-scale deployment on an industrial large-scale recommendation platform.</description>

      <title>ComLQ: Benchmarking Complex Logical Queries in Information Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) systems play a critical role in navigating information overload across various applications. Existing IR benchmarks primarily focus on simple queries that are semantically analogous to single- and multi-hop relations, overlooking \emph{complex logical queries} involving first-order logic operations such as conjunction ($\land$), disjunction ($\lor$), and negation ($\lnot$). Thus, these benchmarks can not be used to sufficiently evaluate the performance of IR models on complex queries in real-world scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel method leveraging large language models (LLMs) to construct a new IR dataset \textbf{ComLQ} for \textbf{Com}plex \textbf{L}ogical \textbf{Q}ueries, which comprises 2,909 queries and 11,251 candidate passages. A key challenge in constructing the dataset lies in capturing the underlying logical structures within unstructured text. Therefore, by designing the subgraph-guided prompt with the subgraph indicator, an LLM (such as GPT-4o) is guided to generate queries with specific logical structures based on selected passages. All query-passage pairs in ComLQ are ensured \emph{structure conformity} and \emph{evidence distribution} through expert annotation. To better evaluate whether retrievers can handle queries with negation, we further propose a new evaluation metric, \textbf{Log-Scaled Negation Consistency} (\textbf{LSNC@$K$}). As a supplement to standard relevance-based metrics (such as nDCG and mAP), LSNC@$K$ measures whether top-$K$ retrieved passages violate negation conditions in queries. Our experimental results under zero-shot settings demonstrate existing retrieval models' limited performance on complex logical queries, especially on queries with negation, exposing their inferior capabilities of modeling exclusion.</description>

      <title>Multi-Aspect Cross-modal Quantization for Generative Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in recommender systems. This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three well-known recommendation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The palindromic tree (a.k.a. eertree) is a data structure that provides access to all palindromic substrings of a string. In this paper, we propose a dynamic version of eertree, called double-ended eertree, which supports online operations on the stored string, including double-ended queue operations, counting distinct palindromic substrings, and finding the longest palindromic prefix/suffix. At the heart of our construction, we identify a new class of substring occurrences, called surfaces, that are palindromic substring occurrences that are neither prefixes nor suffixes of any other palindromic substring occurrences, which is of independent interest. Surfaces characterize the link structure of all palindromic substrings in the eertree, thereby allowing a linear-time implementation of double-ended eertrees through a linear-time maintenance of surfaces.</description>

      <title>The Challenge of Using LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior: A Causal Inference Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential to simulate human behavior. We identify a fundamental challenge in using them to simulate experiments: when LLM-simulated subjects are blind to the experimental design (as is standard practice with human subjects), variations in treatment systematically affect unspecified variables that should remain constant, violating the unconfoundedness assumption. Using demand estimation as a context and an actual experiment with 40 different products as a benchmark, we show this can lead to implausible results. While confounding may in principle be addressed by controlling for covariates, this can compromise ecological validity in the context of LLM simulations: controlled covariates become artificially salient in the simulated decision process. We show formally that confoundness stems from ambiguous prompting strategies. Therefore, it can be addressed by developing unambiguous prompting strategies through unblinding, i.e., revealing the experiment design in LLM simulations. Our empirical results show that this strategy consistently enhances model performance across all tested models, including both out-of-box reasoning and non-reasoning models. We also show that it is a technique that complements fine-tuning: while fine-tuning can improve simulation performance, an unambiguous prompting strategy makes the predictions robust to the inclusion of irrelevant data in the fine-tuning process.</description>

      <title>FunReason: Enhancing Large Language Models' Function Calling via Self-Refinement Multiscale Loss and Automated Data Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) with function calling has emerged as a crucial capability for enhancing their practical utility in real-world applications. However, effectively combining reasoning processes with accurate function execution remains a significant challenge. Traditional training approaches often struggle to balance the detailed reasoning steps with the precision of function calls, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we introduce FunReason, a novel framework that enhances LLMs' function calling capabilities through an automated data refinement strategy and a Self-Refinement Multiscale Loss (SRML) approach. FunReason leverages LLMs' natural reasoning abilities to generate high-quality training examples, focusing on query parseability, reasoning coherence, and function call precision. The SRML approach dynamically balances the contribution of reasoning processes and function call accuracy during training, addressing the inherent trade-off between these two critical aspects. FunReason achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. FunReason provides a comprehensive solution for enhancing LLMs' function calling capabilities by introducing a balanced training methodology and a data refinement pipeline.

      <title>ReCode: Updating Code API Knowledge with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20495v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ReCode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over ablated configurations and generalist biomedical agents. Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few lines of code.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Identity Management on Ripple: A Conceptual Framework for High-Speed, Low-Cost Identity Transactions in Attestation-Based Attribute-Based Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen many industrial implementations and much scholastic research, i.e., prototypes and theoretical frameworks, in Decentralized Identity Management Systems (DIDMS). It is safe to say that Attestation-Based Attribute-Based Decentralized IDM (ABABDIDM) has not received anywhere near the same level of attention in the literature as general Attribute-Based DIDMs (ABDIDM), i.e, decentralized Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). The use of decentralization, i.e., DIDM, is to improve upon the security and privacy-related issues of centralized Identity Management Systems (IDM) and Attribute-Based IDMs (ABIDM). And blockchain is the framework used for decentralization in all these schemes. Many DIDMs - even ABDIDMs - have been defined on popular blockchains such as Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. However, despite the characteristics of Ripple that makes it appealing for an ABIDM, there is a lack of research to develop an Identity Management System (IDMS) on Ripple in literature. We have attempted to conceptualize an ABABDIDM on Ripple.</description>

      <title>The Value of Personalized Recommendations: Evidence from Netflix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems shape much of user choice online, yet their targeted nature makes separating out the value of recommendation and the underlying goods challenging. We build a discrete choice model that embeds recommendation-induced utility, low-rank heterogeneity, and flexible state dependence and apply the model to viewership data at Netflix. We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity. Second, most of the consumption increase from recommendations comes from effective targeting, not mechanical exposure, with the largest gains for mid-popularity goods (as opposed to broadly appealing or very niche goods).</description>

      <title>Information Extraction From Fiscal Documents Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text comprehension, but their ability to process complex, hierarchical tabular data remains underexplored. We present a novel approach to extracting structured data from multi-page government fiscal documents using LLM-based techniques. Applied to annual fiscal documents from the State of Karnataka in India (200+ pages), our method achieves high accuracy through a multi-stage pipeline that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation. A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data. We use these hierarchical relationships to create multi-level validation checks. We demonstrate that LLMs can read tables and also process document-specific structural hierarchies, offering a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases. Our implementation shows promise for broader applications across developing country contexts.</description>
