      <title>A twenty-first century statistical physics of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular biology revolution of the last seventy five years has transformed our view of living systems. Scientific explanations of biological phenomena are now synonymous with the identification of the genes, proteins, and signaling molecules involved. The hegemony of the molecular paradigm has only become more pronounced as new technologies allow us to make measurements at scale. Combining this wealth of data with new ``artificial intelligence'' techniques is viewed as the future of biology. Here, we challenge this emerging ``common sense'', laying out a roadmap for developing a theoretical understanding of life. We argue that a twenty-first century theoretical biology must be founded on a new type of statistical physics suited to the living world. Rather than merely constructing statistical models, a statistical theory requires developing ``quantitative abstractions'' for understanding the gene-organism-environment triad. This necessitates overcoming four major challenges that distinguish living matter: (1) living systems are composed of a large number of heterogeneous parts rather than a large number of identical objects; (2) living systems control and manipulate the physical world in a manner that is extremely different from the ways considered in traditional statistical physics; (3) living systems necessarily operate out of equilibrium; (4) living systems are evolved objects with a function, resulting in new types of constraints that must be imposed on probabilistic ensembles. We conclude by discussing a few key themes that we view as promising directions for developing a statistical physics of life: typicality, localized biological control, a linear response of complex systems with non-reciprocal interactions, biological resource allocation, and learning and adaptation in overparameterized systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular sorting on a fluctuating membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular sorting in biological membranes is essential for proper cellular function. It also plays a crucial role in the budding of enveloped viruses from host cells. We recently proposed that this process is driven by phase separation, where the formation and growth of sorting domains depend primarily on short-range intermolecular interactions. In addition to these, Casimir-like forces -- arising from entropic effects in fluctuating membranes and acting on longer ranges -- may also play a significant role in the molecular distillation process. Here, using a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we explore how these forces contribute to sorting, particularly in the biologically relevant regime where short-range intermolecular interactions are weak. Our results show that Casimir-like forces enhance molecular distillation by reducing the critical radius for the formation of new sorting domains and facilitating the capture of molecules within these domains. We identify the relative rigidity of the membrane and supermolecular domains as a key parameter controlling molecular sorting efficiency, offering new insights into the physical principles underlying molecular sorting in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Dimensionality Reduction for Extracting Useful Representations of Large Empirical Multimodal Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest for simplification in physics drives the exploration of concise mathematical representations for complex systems. This Dissertation focuses on the concept of dimensionality reduction as a means to obtain low-dimensional descriptions from high-dimensional data, facilitating comprehension and analysis. We address the challenges posed by real-world data that defy conventional assumptions, such as complex interactions within neural systems or high-dimensional dynamical systems. Leveraging insights from both theoretical physics and machine learning, this work unifies diverse reduction methods under a comprehensive framework, the Deep Variational Multivariate Information Bottleneck. This framework enables the design of tailored reduction algorithms based on specific research questions. We explore and assert the efficacy of simultaneous reduction approaches over their independent reduction counterparts, demonstrating their superiority in capturing covariation between multiple modalities, while requiring less data. We also introduced novel techniques, such as the Deep Variational Symmetric Information Bottleneck, for general nonlinear simultaneous reduction. We show that the same principle of simultaneous reduction is the key to efficient estimation of mutual information. We show that our new method is able to discover the coordinates of high-dimensional observations of dynamical systems. Through analytical investigations and empirical validations, we shed light on the intricacies of dimensionality reduction methods, paving the way for enhanced data analysis across various domains. We underscore the potential of these methodologies to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, driving advancements in fundamental research and applied sciences. As these methods evolve, they promise to deepen our understanding of complex systems and inform more effective data analysis strategies.</description>

      <title>Revealing Molecular Mechanism of Nonmonotonic Relationship between Antifreeze Activity and Chain Length in Polyprolines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity of polymers generally increases with chain length. However, for polyproline (PPro), a highly potent cryoprotectant, the IRI activity varies nonmonotonically with the degree of polymerization (DP), i.e., DP=8 (P8) &gt; DP=15 (P15) &gt; DP=3 (P3). Herein, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the microscopic mechanism behind this nonmonotonic effect in PPro. Our findings indicate that the population of the PPII helix structure, which increases with DP, is not the primary reason for this effect. Instead, both single-molecule conformation and multi-molecule aggregation play critical roles. At the single-molecule level, PPro exhibits two types of thermodynamically stable conformations:linear (L) and coil (C), with the latter demonstrating enhanced IRI potency due to its stronger hydrophobicity and ice-binding capability. Notably, P8 has a higher content of the C conformation compared to P15, accounting for its superior IRI activity. Aligning with the conventional understandings, P3's lowest activity stems from its excessively small volume/coverage area on the ice surface. At the multi-molecule level, P15 shows a significantly higher tendency to aggregate than P8, which limits the ability of PPro molecules to fully spread at the ice-water interface and reduces their effective coverage of the ice surface, thereby diminishing its effectiveness. And P15's aggregation becomes significantly pronounced at high concentrations, amplifying the nonmonotonic effect. This work provides an atomistic insight into the nonmonotonic relationship between IRI activity and DP in PPro, offering valuable insights for the rational design of novel biocompatible antifreeze polymers.</description>

      <title>Murine AI excels at cats and cheese: Structural differences between human and mouse neurons and their implementation in generative AIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mouse and human brains have different functions that depend on their neuronal networks. In this study, we analyzed nanometer-scale three-dimensional structures of brain tissues of the mouse medial prefrontal cortex and compared them with structures of the human anterior cingulate cortex. The obtained results indicated that mouse neuronal somata are smaller and neurites are thinner than those of human neurons. These structural features allow mouse neurons to be integrated in the limited space of the brain, though thin neurites should suppress distal connections according to cable theory. We implemented this mouse-mimetic constraint in convolutional layers of a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which were then subjected to image generation tasks using photo datasets of cat faces, cheese, human faces, and birds. The mouse-mimetic GAN outperformed a standard GAN in the image generation task using the cat faces and cheese photo datasets, but underperformed for human faces and birds. The mouse-mimetic DDIM gave similar results, suggesting that the nature of the datasets affected the results. Analyses of the four datasets indicated differences in their image entropy, which should influence the number of parameters required for image generation. The preferences of the mouse-mimetic AIs coincided with the impressions commonly associated with mice. The relationship between the neuronal network and brain function should be investigated by implementing other biological findings in artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of carbohydrate stereochemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbohydrates, essential biological building blocks, exhibit functional mechanisms tied to their intricate stereochemistry. Subtle stereochemical differences, such as those between the anomers maltose and cellobiose, lead to distinct properties due to their differing glycosidic bonds; the former is digestible by humans, while the latter is not. This underscores the importance of precise structural determination of individual carbohydrate molecules for deeper functional insights. However, their structural complexity and conformational flexibility, combined with the high spatial resolution needed, have hindered direct imaging of carbohydrate stereochemistry. Here, we employ non-contact atomic force microscopy integrated with a data-efficient, multi-fidelity structure search approach accelerated by machine learning integration to determine the precise 3D atomic coordinates of two carbohydrate anomers. We observe that glycosidic bond stereochemistry regulates on-surface chiral selection in carbohydrate self-assemblies. The reconstructed models, validated against experimental data, provide reliable atomic-scale structural evidence, uncovering the origin of on-surface chirality from carbohydrate anomerism. Our study confirms that nc-AFM is a reliable technique for real-space discrimination of carbohydrate stereochemistry at the single-molecule level, providing a pathway for bottom-up investigations into the structure-property relationships of carbohydrates in biological research and materials science.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under XFEL illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) captures the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The ultrashort pulse produced by an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) 'outruns' much of the radiation damage that impairs conventional crystallography. However, the rapid onset of 'electronic damage' due to electron ionization limits this benefit. Here, we distinguish the influence of different atomic species on the electronic damage to protein crystals in SFX by employing a plasma code that tracks the unbound electrons as a continuous energy distribution. The simulations show that trace quantities of heavy atoms ($Z &gt; 10$) contribute a substantial proportion of global radiation damage by inducing electron ionization processes that are highly damaging on the XFEL pulse timescale. Native sulfur atoms have a considerable effect on damage-induced noise. Likewise, proteins suffer less damage when the crystal solvent contains lower concentrations of heavy elements. The proximity of the X-ray energy to a heavy-element absorption edge has a strong and non-trivial influence on the damage induced in these models. In one representative protein (lysozyme substituted with selenomethionine), adjusting the X-ray energy from 14 keV to 12 keV is as effective at reducing the ionization of light atoms as compressing the pulse width from 50 fs to 5 fs. These results indicate that relatively small quantities of heavy elements can substantially affect global radiation damage in the XFEL regime.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Monte Carlo methods for three-dimensional diffusive capture problems in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular scale decision making is modulated by the dynamics of signalling molecules and their diffusive trajectories from a source to small absorbing sites on the cellular surface. Diffusive capture problems are computationally challenging due to the complex geometry and the applied boundary conditions together with intrinsically long transients that occur before a particle is captured. This paper reports on a particle-based Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that provides rapid accurate simulation of arrival statistics for (i) a half-space bounded by a surface with a finite collection of absorbing traps and (ii) the domain exterior to a convex cell again with absorbing traps. We validate our method by replicating classical results and in addition, newly developed boundary homogenization theories and matched asymptotic expansions on capture rates. In the case of non-spherical domains, we describe a new shielding effect in which geometry can play a role in sharpening cellular estimates on the directionality of diffusive sources.</description>

      <title>Persistent pseudopod splitting is an effective chemotaxis strategy in shallow gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell organisms and various cell types use a range of motility modes when following a chemical gradient, but it is unclear which mode is best suited for different gradients. Here, we model directional decision-making in chemotactic amoeboid cells as a stimulus-dependent actin recruitment contest. Pseudopods extending from the cell body compete for a finite actin pool to push the cell in their direction until one pseudopod wins and determines the direction of movement. Our minimal model provides a quantitative understanding of the strategies cells use to reach the physical limit of accurate chemotaxis, aligning with data without explicit gradient sensing or cellular memory for persistence. To generalize our model, we employ reinforcement learning optimization to study the effect of pseudopod suppression, a simple but effective cellular algorithm by which cells can suppress possible directions of movement. Different pseudopod-based chemotaxis strategies emerge naturally depending on the environment and its dynamics. For instance, in static gradients, cells can react faster at the cost of pseudopod accuracy, which is particularly useful in noisy, shallow gradients where it paradoxically increases chemotactic accuracy. In contrast, in dynamics gradients, cells form de novo pseudopods. Overall, our work demonstrates mechanical intelligence for high chemotaxis performance with minimal cellular regulation.</description>
