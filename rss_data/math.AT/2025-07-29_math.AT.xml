      <title>One-dimensionality of certain cocycles for the detection of the Johnson cokernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Enomoto-Satoh (ES) trace detects the Johnson cokernel, and its 1-cocycle property is important for the proof that the Johnson image is annihilated by the ES trace. Via the natural map from the ribbon graph complex introduced by Merkulov and Willwacher to the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the Lie algebra of symplectic derivations, where the Johnson image lives, the ES trace is essentially obtained from the 1-cocycle given by the unique ribbon graph with one vertex and one edge. In this perspective, this ribbon graph is the "universal" version of the ES trace. The main result of this paper is that there are no other (linearly independent) 1-cocycles in the ribbon graph complex, showing that nothing can be found there for the detection of the Johnson cokernel. The proof is done by applying the result of Church-Farb-Putman and Morita-Sakasai-Suzuki, which states that the virtual top-dimensional cohomology of the moduli space of marked Riemann surfaces vanishes.</description>

      <title>Unstable \'etale motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a rigidity result for certain $p$-complete \'etale $\mathbf{A}^{1}$-invariant sheaves
  of anima over a qcqs finite-dimensional base scheme $S$ of bounded \'etale cohomological dimension with $p$ invertible on $S$.
  This generalizes results of
  Suslin--Voevodsky, Ayoub, Cisinski--D\'eglise, and Bachmann
  to the unstable setting. Over a perfect field we exhibit a large class of sheaves to which our main theorem applies,
  in particular the $p$-completion of the \'etale sheafification of any
  $2$-effective $2$-connective motivic space,
  as well as the $p$-completion of any $4$-connective $\mathbf{A}^{1}$-invariant \'etale sheaf.
  We use this rigidity result to prove (a weaker version of) an \'etale analog of Morel's
  theorem stating that for a Nisnevich sheaf of abelian groups, strong $\mathbf{A}^{1}$-invariance implies strict $\mathbf{A}^{1}$-invariance.
  Moreover, this allows us to construct an unstable \'etale realization functor on $2$-effective $2$-connective motivic spaces.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral joins and graph complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a decomposition of the suspension of a polyhedral join in terms of the polyhedral smash product of the suspension of the family of pairs, and study some cases in which the formula can be desuspended, particularly for polyhedral joins over independence complexes of graphs. We also give some lower bounds for the connectivity of polyhedral joins. We use these results to study the homotopy type of the forest filtration for some lexicographic products of graphs.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of the Rips complexes of Integer lattices via local domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each positive integer $n$, the Rips complexes of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice in the $d_1$ metric (i.e., the Manhattan metric, also called the natural word metric in the Cayley graph) are contractible at scales above $n^2(2n-1)$, with the bounds arising from the Jung's constants. We introduce a new concept of locally dominated vertices in a simplicial complex, upon which our proof strategy is based. This allows us to deduce the contractibility of the Rips complexes from a local geometric condition called local crushing. In the case of the integer lattices in dimension $n$ and a fixed scale $r$, this condition entails the comparison of finitely many distances to conclude that the corresponding Rips complex is contractible. In particular, we are able to verify that for $n=1,2,3$, the Rips complex of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice at scale greater or equal to $n$ is contractible. We conjecture that the same proof strategy can be used to extend this result to all dimensions $n$</description>

      <title>Filtering through a topological lens: homology for point processes on the time-frequency plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a very general approach to the analysis of signals from their noisy measurements from the perspective of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). While TDA has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for data with pronounced topological structures, here we demonstrate its applicability for general problems of signal processing, without any a-priori geometric feature. Our methods are well-suited to a wide array of time-dependent signals in different scientific domains, with acoustic signals being a particularly important application. We invoke time-frequency representations of such signals, focusing on their zeros which are gaining salience as a signal processing tool in view of their stability properties. Leveraging state-of-the-art topological concepts, such as stable and minimal volumes, we develop a complete suite of TDA-based methods to explore the delicate stochastic geometry of these zeros, capturing signals based on the disruption they cause to this rigid, hyperuniform spatial structure. Unlike classical spatial data tools, TDA is able to capture the full spectrum of the stochastic geometry of the zeros, thereby leading to powerful inferential outcomes that are underpinned by a principled statistical foundation. This is reflected in the power and versatility of our applications, which include competitive performance in processing. a wide variety of audio signals (esp. in low SNR regimes), effective detection and reconstruction of gravitational wave signals (a reputed signal processing challenge with non-Gaussian noise), and medical time series data from EEGs, indicating a wide horizon for the approach and methods introduced in this paper.</description>
