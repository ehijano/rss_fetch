      <title>A Basis-Free Phase Space Electronic Hamiltonian That Recovers Beyond Born-Oppenheimer Electronic Momentum and Current Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{PS}$ (parameterized by both nuclear position $\mathbf{X}$ and momentum $\mathbf{P}$) that boosts each electron into the moving frame of the nuclei that are closest in real space -- without presuming the existence of an atomic orbital basis. We show that $(i)$ quantum-classical dynamics along such a Hamiltonian maintains momentum conservation and $(ii)$ diagonalizing such a Hamiltonian can recover the electronic momentum and electronic current density reasonably well. In conjunction with other reports in the literature that such a phase-space approach can also recover vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra, we submit that the present phase-space approach offers a testable and powerful approach to post-Born-Oppenheimer electronic structure theory. Moreover, the approach is inexpensive and can be immediately applied to simulations of chiral induced spin selectivity experiments (where the transfer of angular momentum between nuclei and electrons is considered critical).</description>

      <title>Effective core potentials as a pathway to self-interaction error correction: a proof-of-concept study on one-electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In all applications of Density Functional Theory there is always a degree of one-electron self-interaction error (SIE). Here, we propose a simple self-interaction correction by applying an effective core potential (ECP) that replaces no electrons: we dub this the self-interaction potential (SIP). ECPs are already implemented in all major quantum chemistry codes and so there is minimal effort required by developers and users to access our correction. The goal of SIPs is to reduce the overly severe SIE - commonly manifesting as the unphysical delocalization of an electron over two or more nuclei, or even over an entire chemical system. We propose two first generation SIPs (optimized SIPs and subtraction SIPs) that can reduce the SIE in various one-electron test systems and a hydrogen transfer reaction. Our tests show improvements for systems that suffer from predominantly functional- or density-driven errors, pointing at the potential robustness of the approach. Herein, the viability of SIPs is demonstrated in a proof-of-concept study and several avenues for improvement are identified that will help with the construction of future generations of SIPs.</description>

      <title>Assessing Non-Nested Configurations of Multifidelity Machine Learning for Quantum-Chemical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multifidelity machine learning (MFML) for quantum chemical (QC) properties has seen strong development in the recent years. The method has been shown to reduce the cost of generating training data for high-accuracy low-cost ML models. In such a set-up, the ML models are trained on molecular geometries and some property of interest computed at various computational chemistry accuracies, or fidelities. These are then combined in training the MFML models. In some multifidelity models, the training data is required to be nested, that is the same molecular geometries are included to calculate the property across all the fidelities. In these multifidelity models, the requirement of a nested configuration restricts the kind of sampling that can be performed while selection training samples at different fidelities.
  This work assesses the use of non-nested training data for two of these multifidelity methods, namely MFML and optimized MFML (o-MFML). The assessment is carried out for the prediction of ground state energies and first vertical excitation energies of a diverse collection of molecules of the CheMFi dataset. Results indicate that the MFML method still requires a nested structure of training data across the fidelities. However, the o-MFML method shows promising results for non-nested multifidelity training data with model errors comparable to the nested configurations.</description>

      <title>Targeted energy transfer dynamics and chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast reaction processes take place when resonant features of nonlinear model systems are taken into account. In the targeted energy or electron transfer dimer model this is accomplished through the implementation of nonlinear oscillators with opposing types of nonlinearities, one attractive while the second repulsive. In the present work we show that this resonant behavior survives if we take into account the vibrational degrees of freedom as well. After giving a summary on the basic formalism of chemical reactions we show that resonant electron transfer can be assisted by vibrations. We find the condition for this efficient transfer and show that in the case of additional interaction with noise a distinct non-Arrhenius behavior develops that is markedly different from the usual Kramers-like activated transfer.</description>

      <title>Changing the paradigm in f-containing cold molecules: the impact of spin-orbit coupling and f-d transitions on quasi-bound vibrational states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Present-day state-of-the-art ab initio many-body calculations on f-block containing cold molecules heavily focus on perturbative approaches for spin-orbit coupling and exclude a substantial part of the atomic transitions in the $f$- and $d$-shell. Here, we demonstrate the cruciality of a proper relativistic treatment of the $f$- and $d$-shell in Yb-containing diatomics and the inclusion of $f\rightarrow d$ transitions to obtain physically sound elastic scatterings and pre-dissociation lifetimes. We focus on state-of-the-art relativistic many-body calculations for the Yb atom's ground- and excited-state and the YbLi$^+$ potential energy surface. For that purpose, we exploit various quantum many-body methods, namely a spin-free and four-component implementation of the coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) model and its equation of motion extensions, spin-free complete active space self-consistent field, and internally contracted multi-reference (MR) configuration interaction approaches, and spin-free MRCCSD with a perturbative and full triples correction. We oppose scalar relativistic calculations to four-component variants to support the reliability of our EOM-CCSD study and shed new light on the interplay between these systems' spin-orbit coupling and the proper treatment of relativistic effects. Most importantly, we observe a significant shift in the electronic spectra of the $f\rightarrow d$ excitation block. We also provide new reference potential energy surfaces for ground and excited states for which theoretically sound elastic scattering and pre-dissociation lifetimes are calculated.</description>

      <title>Stochastic density functional theory for ions in a polar solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the theoretical description of electrical noise and fluctuation-induced effects in electrolytes has gained a renewed interest, enabled by stochastic field theories like stochastic density functional theory (SDFT). Such models, however, treat solvents implicitly, ignoring their generally polar nature. In the present study, starting from microscopic principles, we derive a fully explicit SDFT theory that applies to ions in a polar solvent. These equations are solved to compute observables like dynamic charge structure factors and dielectric susceptibilities. We unveil the relative importance of the different contributions (solvent, ions, cross terms) to the dynamics of electrolytes, which are key to understand the couplings between ions and the fluctuations of their microscopic environment.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum Computing Pipeline for Real World Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing, with its superior computational capabilities compared to classical approaches, holds the potential to revolutionize numerous scientific domains, including pharmaceuticals. However, the application of quantum computing for drug discovery has primarily been limited to proof-of-concept studies, which often fail to capture the intricacies of real-world drug development challenges. In this study, we diverge from conventional investigations by developing \rev{a hybrid} quantum computing pipeline tailored to address genuine drug design problems. Our approach underscores the application of quantum computation in drug discovery and propels it towards more scalable system. We specifically construct our versatile quantum computing pipeline to address two critical tasks in drug discovery: the precise determination of Gibbs free energy profiles for prodrug activation involving covalent bond cleavage, and the accurate simulation of covalent bond interactions. This work serves as a pioneering effort in benchmarking quantum computing against veritable scenarios encountered in drug design, especially the covalent bonding issue present in both of the case studies, thereby transitioning from theoretical models to tangible applications. Our results demonstrate the potential of a quantum computing pipeline for integration into real world drug design workflows.</description>

      <title>Thawed Gaussian wave packet dynamics: a critical assessment of three propagation schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assessed three schemes for propagating a variable-width (thawed) Gaussian wave packet moving under the influence of Morse or double-well potentials with parameters that are chemically representative. The most rigorous scheme is based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP); it leads to realistic behaviour of the center and width of a wave packet in all investigated regimes. Two other approximate schemes, Heller's and the extended semiclassical ones, demonstrate various aberrations. Heller's scheme does not properly account for various zero-point energy-related effects, is unable to predict tunneling, and more importantly, exhibits completely nonphysical unbound width oscillations. The extended semiclassical scheme, which was developed to address some of the shortcomings of the Heller counterpart, demonstrates another unphysical behaviour: self-trapping of a trajectory in both Morse and double-well potentials. We conclude that only the TDVP-based scheme is suitable for problem-free dynamical simulations. This, however, raises the question of how to utilize it efficiently in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>A Pre-trained Deep Potential Model for Sulfide Solid Electrolytes with Broad Coverage and High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid electrolytes with fast ion transport are one of the key challenges for solid state lithium metal batteries. To improve ion conductivity, chemical doping has been the most effective strategy, and atomistic simulation with machine-learning potential helps find optimized doping by predicting ion conductivity for arbitrary composition. Yet most existing machine-learning models are trained on narrow chemistry, and new model has to be trained for each system, wasting transferable knowledge and incurring significant cost. Here, we propose a pre-trained deep potential model purpose-built for sulfide electrolytes with attention mechanism, known as DPA-SSE. The training set encompasses 15 elements and consists of both equilibrium and extensive out-of-equilibrium configurations. DPA-SSE achieves a high energy resolution of less than 2 meV/atom for dynamical trajectories up to 1150 K, and reproduces experimental ion conductivity of sulfide electrolytes with remarkable accuracy. DPA-SSE exhibits good transferability, covering a range of complex electrolytes with mixes of cation and anion atoms. Highly efficient dynamical simulation with DPA-SSE can be realized by model distillation which generates a faster model for given systems. DPA-SSE also serves as a platform for continuous learning, and the model fine-tune requires only a portion of downstream data. These results demonstrate the possibility of a new pathway for AI-driven development of solid electrolytes with exceptional performance.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions. Many studies have proven its accuracy in depicting atomic environments, although this comes with high computational needs. The computational burden of this challenge is hard to reduce due to the need for permutation equivariance, which limits the design space of the CG transform layer. We show that, implementing the CG transform layer on permutation-invariant inputs allows complete freedom in the design of this layer without affecting symmetry. Developing further on this premise, our idea is to create a CG transform layer that operates on permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We bring in group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and property prediction in QM9 datasets with notable enhancement. The extensibility to other models is also examined. Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out on MD17 and other periodic systems, including water and LiPS, showcasing the capacity for real-world applications of FreeCG. It introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs.</description>

      <title>Minimum tracking linear response Hubbard and Hund corrected Density Functional Theory in CP2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of the Hubbard ($U$) and Hund ($J$) corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT+$U$+$J$) functionality in the Quickstep program, which is part of the CP2K suite. The tensorial and L\"owdin subspace representations are implemented and compared. Full analytical DFT+$U$+$J$ forces are implemented and benchmarked for the tensorial and L\"owdin representations. We also present the implementation of the recently proposed minimum-tracking linear-response method that enables the $U$ and $J$ parameters to be calculated on first principles basis without reference to the Kohn-Sham eigensystem. These implementations are benchmarked against recent results for different materials properties including DFT+$U$ band gap opening in NiO, the relative stability of various polaron distributions in TiO$_2$, the dependence of the calculated TiO$_2$ band gap on +$J$ corrections, and, finally, the role of the +$U$ and +$J$ corrections for the computed properties of a series of the hexahydrated transition metals. Our implementation provides results consistent with those already reported in the literature from comparable methods. We conclude the contribution with tests on the influence of the L\"owdin orthonormalization on the occupancies, calculated parameters, and derived properties.</description>
