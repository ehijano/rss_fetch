      <title>The Mechanics of Nucleation and Growth and the Surface Tensions of Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneous nucleation, a textbook transition path for phase transitions, is typically understood on thermodynamic grounds through the prism of classical nucleation theory. However, recent studies have suggested the applicability of classical nucleation theory to systems far from equilibrium. In this Article, we formulate a purely mechanical perspective of homogeneous nucleation and growth, elucidating the criteria for the properties of a critical nucleus without appealing to equilibrium notions. Applying this theory to active fluids undergoing motility-induced phase separation, we find that nucleation proceeds in a qualitatively similar fashion to equilibrium systems, with concepts such as the Gibbs-Thomson effect and nucleation barriers remaining valid. We further demonstrate that the recovery of such concepts allows us to extend classical theories of nucleation rates and coarsening dynamics to active systems upon using the mechanically-derived definitions of the nucleation barrier and surface tensions.Three distinct surface tensions -- the mechanical, capillary, and Ostwald tensions -- play a central role in our theory. While these three surface tensions are identical in equilibrium, our work highlights the distinctive role of each tension in the stability of active interfaces and the nucleation and growth of motility-induced phases.</description>

      <title>Topologically controlled synthesis of active colloidal bipeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological growth control allows to produce a narrow distribution of outgrown colloidal rods with defined and adjustable length. We use an external magnetic field to assemble paramagnetic colloidal spheres into colloidal rods of a chosen length. The rods reside above ametamorphic hexagonalmagnetic pattern. The periodic repetition of specific loops of the orientation of an applied external field renders paramagnetic colloidal particles and their assemblies into active bipeds that walk on the pattern. The metamorphic patterns allow the robust and controlled polymerization of single colloids to bipeds of a desired length. The colloids are exposed to this fixed external control loop that causes multiple simultaneous responses: Small bipeds and single colloidal particles interpret the external magnetic loop as an order to walk toward the active zone, where they assemble and polymerize. Outgrown bipeds interpret the same loop as an order to walk away from the active zone. The topological transition occurs solely for the growing biped and nothing is changed in the environment nor in the magnetic control loop. As in many biological systems the decision of a biped that reached its outgrown length to walk away from the reaction site is made internally, not externally.</description>

      <title>Bubble phase induced by odd interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a repulsive thermal system governed by odd interactions. The interplay between oddness and inertia induces a non-equilibrium phase transition from a homogeneous to a non-homogeneous phase, characterized by bubbles induced by odd interactions. This phenomenon occurs in the absence of attractions and is generated by the competition between the standard pressure contribution due to particle repulsion and an effective surface tension generated by odd-induced centrifugal forces. As a signature of the phase transition, the system exhibits vortex structures and oscillating spatial velocity correlations, which emerge close to the analytically predicted transition point. Our findings can be verified in granular experiments governed by odd interactions, such as spinners and colloidal magnets, and could be key to characterizing the emerging properties of metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Cell theories for the chiral crystal phase of hard equilateral triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive several versions of the cell theory for a crystal phase of hard equilateral triangles. To that purpose we analytically calculated the free area of a frozen oriented or freely rotating particle inside the cavity formed by its neighbours in a chiral configuration of their orientations. From the most successful versions of the theory we predict an equation of state which, despite being derived from a crystal configuration of particles, describes very reasonably the equation of state of the 6-atic liquid-crystal phase at packing fractions not very close from the isotropic-6-atic bifurcation. Also, the same equation of state performs well when compared to that from MC simulations for the stable crystal phase. The agreement can even be improved by selecting adequate values for the angle of chirality.Despite the success of two of the versions of the theory for the pressure, we show that the free-energy is an increasing function of the angle of chirality, implying that the most stable phase is the achiral phase. Furthermore, we show that possible clustering effects, such as the formation of perfect chiral hexagonal clusters, which in turn crystallize into an hexagonal lattice, cannot explain the presence of the chirality observed in simulations.</description>

      <title>Multicell-Fold: geometric learning in folding multicellular life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During developmental processes such as embryogenesis, how a group of cells fold into specific structures, is a central question in biology that defines how living organisms form. Establishing tissue-level morphology critically relies on how every single cell decides to position itself relative to its neighboring cells. Despite its importance, it remains a major challenge to understand and predict the behavior of every cell within the living tissue over time during such intricate processes. To tackle this question, we propose a geometric deep learning model that can predict multicellular folding and embryogenesis, accurately capturing the highly convoluted spatial interactions among cells. We demonstrate that multicellular data can be represented with both granular and foam-like physical pictures through a unified graph data structure, considering both cellular interactions and cell junction networks. We successfully use our model to achieve two important tasks, interpretable 4-D morphological sequence alignment, and predicting local cell rearrangements before they occur at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, using an activation map and ablation studies, we demonstrate that cell geometries and cell junction networks together regulate local cell rearrangement which is critical for embryo morphogenesis. This approach provides a novel paradigm to study morphogenesis, highlighting a unified data structure and harnessing the power of geometric deep learning to accurately model the mechanisms and behaviors of cells during development. It offers a pathway toward creating a unified dynamic morphological atlas for a variety of developmental processes such as embryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Unveiling mussel plaque core ductility: the role of pore distribution and hierarchical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mussel thread-plaque system exhibits strong adhesion and high ductility, allowing it to adhere to various surfaces. While the microstructure of plaques has been thoroughly studied, the effect of their unique porous structure on ductility remains unclear. This study firstly investigated the porous structure of mussel plaque cores using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two-dimensional (2D) porous representative volume elements (RVEs) with scaled distribution parameters were generated, and the calibrated phase-field modelling method was applied to analyse the effect of the pore distribution and multi-scale porous structure on the failure mechanism of porous RVEs. The SEM analysis revealed that large-scale pores exhibited a lognormal size distribution and a uniform spatial distribution. Simulations showed that increasing the normalised mean radius value of the large-scale pore distribution can statistically lead to a decreasing trend in ductility, strength and strain energy, but cannot solely determine their values. The interaction between pores can lead to two different failure modes under the same pore distribution: progressive failure mode and sudden failure mode. Additionally, the hierarchical structure of multi-scale porous RVEs can further increase ductility by 40%-60% compared to single-scale porous RVEs by reducing stiffness, highlighting the hierarchical structure could be another key factor contributing to the high ductility. These findings deepen our understanding of how the pore distribution and multi-scale porous structure in mussel plaques contribute to their high ductility and affect other mechanical properties, providing valuable insights for the future design of highly ductile biomimetic materials.</description>

      <title>On the fractal dimension of non-Newtonian Hele-Shaw flow subject to Saffman-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete numerical method based on the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) approach to simulate two-fluid Hele-Shaw flow subject to the Saffman-Taylor interfacial instability, in the case where the displaced fluid is non-Newtonian. Focusing on fluids for which the most relevant non-Newtonian aspect of the thin-gap flow is shear-thinning, we introduce a history-dependent aspect into the algorithm, modeling shear-rate-dependent fluid viscosity. The main finding is that the morphology of the emerging patterns, characterized by the fractal dimension, is modified in a nontrivial manner by the shear-thinning nature of the displaced fluid. In particular, we consistently find that shear-thinning leads to the formation of patterns characterized by a smaller fractal dimension, compared to the corresponding Newtonian fluid.</description>

      <title>3D Imaging of directional multi-scale cellulose nanostructures through multi-directional dark-field neutron tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical biomaterials embody nature's intricate design principles, offering advanced functionalities through the complex, multi-level organization of their molecular and nanosized building blocks. However, the comprehensive characterization of their 3D structure remains a challenge, particularly due to radiation damage caused by conventional X-ray- and electron-based imaging techniques, as well as due to the length scale limitations of scattering-based investigation methods. Here, we present a study utilizing multi-directional dark-field neutron imaging in tomographic mode to visualize the 3D nanoarchitecture of nanocellulose solid foams, a class of sustainable materials possessing complex and highly tunable hierarchical structures. By exploiting the unique properties of neutrons as a probe, this non-destructive method circumvents the inherent limitations of damage-inducing ionizing radiation, preserving the structural and chemical integrity of the biomaterials, and allowing for truly multiscale characterization of the spatial orientation and distribution of cellulose nano fibrils within large-volume samples. In particular, the study showcases the 3-dimensional anisotropic orientation and degree of alignment of nanofibrils with different crystallinity, across various length scales, from nanometers to centimeters. This approach offers a valuable and generally applicable tool for multi-scale characterisation of biobased materials where complex nanoscale arrangements inform macroscopic properties.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of Multiferroic Nanoparticles in a Bent-Core Nematic Liquid Crystal: Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel nanocomposite system has been prepared by dispersing multiferroic bismuth ferrite nanoparticles (BiFeO$_3$) in a bent-core nematic liquid crystal (8-F-OH) that exhibits cybotactic clusters. Transition temperature, optical textures, order parameter $S_m$, and dielectric spectroscopy experiments are performed in the doped system, and the results are compared with the pure one. The main experimental outcome is that the doped system has increased orientational order parameters, even though the cybotactic cluster size is reduced due to the incorporation of multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ nanoparticles. The transition temperature, as observed under polarising optical microscopy, clearly indicates a reduction of $1 - 2~ ^\circ{\rm C}$ in the doped system compared to the pure one, and we conjecture this is due to the disordering of the cybotactic cluster in the doped system. Based on the experimental findings, a Landau-de Gennes-type free energy model is developed. The model qualitatively explains the increased mean order parameter and the disordering of cybotactic clusters with increasing polarization value of nanoparticles. This is corroborated by experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics of granular hopper flows: a configurational mode controls the stability of clogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Granular flows in small-outlet hoppers exhibit several characteristic but poorly understood behaviors: temporary clogs (pauses) that last for an extended period before flow spontaneously restarts, permanent clogs that last indefinitely, and non-Gaussian, non-monotonic flow-rate statistics. These aspects have been extensively studied independently, but a model of hopper flow that includes all three has not been formulated. Here, we introduce such a phenomenological model that provides a unifying dynamical explanation of all three behaviors: a coupling between the flow rate and a hidden configurational mode that controls the stability of clogs. In the theory, flow rate evolves according to Langevin dynamics with multiplicative noise and an absorbing state at zero flow, conditional on the hidden mode. The model fully reproduces the statistics of pause and clog events taken from a large ($&gt;40,000$ flows) experimental dataset, including non-exponentially distributed clogging times and non-Gaussian flow rate distribution, and explains the stretched-exponential growth of the average clogging time with outlet size. Further, we highlight several microscopic configurational features of this hidden mode, including size and smoothness of the static arch structure formed during pauses and clogs. Our work provides a unifying framework for several poorly understood granular phenomena, and suggests numerous new paths toward further understanding of this complex system.</description>

      <title>Evidence of ferroelectric features in low-density supercooled water from ab initio deep neural-network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08338v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, an increasing body of evidence has emerged, supporting the existence of a metastable liquid-liquid critical point in supercooled water, whereby two distinct liquid phases of different densities coexist. Analysing long molecular dynamics simulations performed using deep neural-network force fields trained to accurate quantum mechanical data, we demonstrate that the low-density liquid phase displays a strong propensity toward spontaneous polarization, as witnessed by large and long-lived collective dipole fluctuations. Our findings suggest that the dynamical stability of the low-density phase, and hence the transition from high-density to low-density liquid, is triggered by a collective process involving an accumulation of rotational angular jumps, which could ignite large dipole fluctuations. This dynamical transition involves subtle changes in the electronic polarizability of water molecules which affects their rotational mobility within the two phases. These findings hold the potential for catalyzing new activity in the search for dielectric-based probes of the putative second critical point.</description>

      <title>Robustness of travelling states in generic non-reciprocal mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergent non-reciprocal interactions violating Newton's third law are widespread in out-of-equilibrium systems. Phase separating mixtures with such interactions exhibit travelling states with no equilibrium counterpart. Using extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the existence and stability of such travelling states in a generic non-reciprocal particle system. By varying a broad range of parameters including aggregate state of mixture components, diffusivity, degree of non-reciprocity, effective spatial dimension and density, we determine that travelling states do exist below the predator-prey regime, but nonetheless are only found in a narrow region of the parameter space. Our work also sheds light on the physical mechanisms for the disappearance of travelling states when relevant parameters are being varied, and has implications for a range of non-equilibrium systems including non-reciprocal phase separating mixtures, non-equilibrium pattern formation and predator-prey models.</description>

      <title>Harmonic chain far from equilibrium: single-file diffusion, long-range order, and hyperuniformity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In one dimension, particles can not bypass each other. As a consequence, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) in equilibrium shows sub-diffusion ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t^{1/2}$, instead of normal diffusion ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t$. This phenomenon is the so-called single-file diffusion. Here, we investigate how the above equilibrium behaviors are modified far from equilibrium. In particular, we want to uncover what kind of non-equilibrium driving force can suppress diffusion and achieve the long-range crystalline order in one dimension, which is prohibited by the Mermin-Wagner theorem in equilibrium. For that purpose, we investigate the harmonic chain driven by the following four types of driving forces that do not satisfy the detailed balance: (i) temporally correlated noise with the noise spectrum $D(\omega)\sim \omega^{-2\theta}$, (ii) conserving noise, (iii) periodic driving force, and (iv) periodic deformations of particles. For the driving force (i) with $\theta&gt;-1/4$, we observe ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t^{1/2+2\theta}$ for large $t$. On the other hand, for the driving forces (i) with $\theta&lt;-1/4$ and (ii)-(iv), MSD remains finite. As a consequence, the harmonic chain exhibits the crystalline order even in one dimension. Furthermore, the density fluctuations of the model are highly suppressed in a large scale in the crystal phase. This phenomenon is known as hyperuniformity. We discuss that hyperuniformity of the noise fluctuations themselves is the relevant mechanism to stabilize the long-range crystalline order in one dimension and yield hyperuniformity of the density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Active gel model for one-dimensional cell migration coupling actin flow and adhesion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Migration of animal cells is based on the interplay between actin polymerization at the front, adhesion along the cell-substrate interface, and actomyosin contractility at the back. Active gel theory has been used before to demonstrate that actomyosin contractility is sufficient for polarization and self-sustained cell migration in the absence of external cues, but did not consider the dynamics of adhesion. Likewise, migration models based on the mechanosensitive dynamics of adhesion receptors usually do not include the global dynamics of intracellular flow. Here we show that both aspects can be combined in a minimal active gel model for one-dimensional cell migration with dynamic adhesion. This model demonstrates that load sharing between the adhesion receptors leads to symmetry breaking, with stronger adhesion at the front, and that bistability of migration arises for intermediate adhesiveness. Local variations in adhesiveness are sufficient to switch between sessile and motile states, in qualitative agreement with experiments.</description>
