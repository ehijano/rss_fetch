      <title>Rough estimates of solar system gravitomagnetic effects in post-Newtonian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to describe properly the gravity interactions including the mass currents, in the gravitomagnetism we construct four Maxwell type gravitational equations which are shown to be analogs of the Maxwell equations in the electromagnetism. Next, exploiting the Maxwell type gravitational equations, we explicitly predict the mass magnetic fields for both the isolated system of the spinning Moon orbiting the spinning Earth and that of the Sun and solar system planets orbiting the spinning Sun, whose phenomenological values have not been evaluated in the precedented Newtonian gravity formalisms. In the gravitomagnetism we also phenomenologically investigate the mass magnetic general relativity (GR) forces associated with the mass magnetic fields, to find that they are extremely small but non-vanishing compared to the corresponding mass electric Newtonian forces. Moreover, the directions of the mass magnetic GR forces for the solar system planets except Venus and Uranus are shown to be anti-parallel to those of their mass electric Newtonian forces. Next we investigate the mass magnetic dipole moment related with the B-ring of Saturn, to evaluate $\vec{m}_{M}(Ring)=-1.141\times 10^{4}~{\rm m^{3}~sec^{-1}}~\hat{\omega}$ with $\hat{\omega}$ being the unit vector along the axis direction of the spinning B-ring. The predicted value of $\vec{m}_{M}(Ring)$ is shown to be directly related with the Cassini data on the total mass of the rings of Saturn.</description>

      <title>Are dark matter and dark energy omnipresent?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of temporal singularities (transients) in the mass-energy density and pressure, bearing a specific mathematical structure which represents a new solution to the continuity equation (\ie~conservation of mass-energy) and satisfying the strong energy condition, is proposed to account for the expansion history of a homogeneous Universe, and the formation and binding of large scale structures as a continuum approximation of their cumulative effects. These singularities are unobservable because they occur rarely in time and are unresolvably fast, and that could be the reason why dark matter and dark energy have not been found. Implication on inflationary cosmology is discussed. The origin of these temporal singularities is unknown, safe to say that the same is true of the moment of the Big Bang itself. This work complements a recent paper, where a topological defect in the form of a spatial, spherical shell of density singularity giving rise to a 1/r attractive force (to test particles of positive mass) but zero integrated mass over a large volume of space, was proposed to solve the dark matter problem in bound structures but not cosmic expansion. The idea also involved a negative density, which is not present in the current model.</description>

      <title>Investigating shadow of a rotating charged black hole with a cosmological constant immersed in the perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly investigate the shadow of a rotating charged black hole with a cosmological constant immersed in perfect fluid dark matter. We first obtain the charged spherically symmetric black hole with a cosmological constant solution immersed in perfect fluid dark matter by using the gravitational decoupling method. Based on the mass function seed source of the spherically symmetric solution, we construct a rotating charged black hole with a cosmological constant immersed in perfect fluid dark matter, and study the effects of the perfect fluid dark matter parameter $\alpha$, cosmological constant $\Lambda$, electric charge $Q$, and rotating parameter $a$ on the event horizons of the rotating black hole. We then derive the geodesic equation of photon of the rotating charged black hole with a cosmological constant immersed in perfect fluid dark matter. In addition, we analyze the influences of the four black hole parameters on the effective potential functions of photon, the boundaries, and the deformations of the rotating black hole shadows. Particularly, we find that the effects of the $\alpha$ on the event horizons, the effective potential functions, the boundaries, and the deformations of the black hole shadows are more obvious than the other three parameters ($\Lambda, Q$, and $a$). We expect our results will be useful in the future to relate the theoretical models of perfect fluid dark matter and dark energy with observations of celestial bodies immersed in dark matter and dark energy.</description>

      <title>Dark matter distributions around Schwarzschild-like black holes in bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central black hole can attract a dark matter cluster and generate a spike in the density profile, as demonstrated by detailed analysis of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes in the past. Do different black holes attract dark matter differently? To get a fair answer to this question, we customize a relativistic framework to grow general static spherical black holes in dark matter halos and investigate how deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry modify the dark matter spike for the first time. The framework is applied to a class of Schwarzschild-like black hole solutions in Lorentz-violated gravity models -- one in the bumblebee model and two in the Kalb-Ramond model. For these black holes, the answer is no if initially the dark matter has a constant distribution, but the answer is yes if it has a Hernquist profile initially.</description>

      <title>Energy Conditions and Stability of Charged Wormholes in $f(R, \mathscr{L}_m)$ Gravity: A Comparative Analysis with Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the energy conditions of charged traversable wormholes in the framework of $f(R, \mathscr{L}_m)$
  modified gravity. In the first case, we derive the shape functions (SFs) for two different choices of the charge function $\mathcal{E}^2$ by considering the Exponential Spheroid (ES) model and analyze the null energy condition (NEC). In the second case, we consider a particular shape function and study its implications for the energy conditions. In both cases, we obtain expressions for energy density and pressure in radial and tangential directions. Our findings show that the radial NEC remains satisfied across a wide range of charge parameters $\mathcal{E}$ consistent with established physical laws. However, the tangential NEC is only sustained in the range $0.1 \leq \mathcal{E} \leq 0.6$; for higher charge values, violations occur, indicating the formation of a throat-like structure necessary for wormhole stability. Additionally, we compare the pressure-density profiles of these charged wormholes with those of compact objects such as neutron stars, revealing distinct variations in matter distribution. This analysis highlights the crucial role of charge and modified gravity in determining the stability and physical characteristics of wormhole structures.</description>

      <title>General Relativity and Geodesy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass redistribution on Earth due to dynamic processes such as ice melting and sea level rise leads to a changing gravitational field, observable by geodetic techniques. Monitoring this change over time allows us to learn more about our planet and its dynamic evolution. In this paper, we highlight the impact of General Relativity (GR) on geodesy: it provides corrections essential for the interpretation of high-precision measurements and enables a completely novel measurement approach using chronometry, i.e., clock-based observations. Focusing on the latter, we review the construction of the relativistic gravity potential and the corresponding geoid definition as an isochronometric surface to elucidate the comparison to the conventional Newtonian geoid. Furthermore, we comment on additional potentials due to the non-Newtonian degrees of freedom of the relativistic gravitational field, and assess the feasibility of clock-based measurements for Gravity Field Recovery (GFR) from space. Although clock observations in space demonstrate technical promise for GFR, achieving the necessary precision for practical applications remains challenging.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Quasi-Normal Modes of the Schwarzschild Black Hole from the Penrose Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Penrose limit connects a plane wave geometry to the photon ring of a black hole, where the quasi-normal modes are located in the eikonal limit. Utilizing this simplification, we analytically extract the quadratic-level non-linearities in the quasi-normal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole for the $(\ell\times\ell)\to 2\ell$ channel. We demonstrate that this result is independent of $\ell$ and further confirm it through symmetry arguments.</description>

      <title>Scalar Quasinormal Modes of Rotating Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes are characteristic signatures of compact objects. Here we consider rotating regular black holes, representing rotating generalizations of the Simpson and Visser metric. We present the spectrum of scalar quasinormal modes and compare it with the spectrum of Kerr black holes. The calculations are done using a spectral decomposition method. The scalar modes smoothly connect to the Kerr limit. Interestingly, for particularly low scaled Hawking temperatures, the dependence of the modes changes as rotation increases. A further investigation shows that the real part of the fundamental and first excited modes of the static and slowly rotating black holes (about $13\%$ of the extremal angular momentum) progresses in an opposite behavior in this low temperature region. Meanwhile the imaginary part of the modes crosses where the excited modes become longer lived than the fundamental modes. Rapid rotation however suppresses such tendency.</description>

      <title>Modeling the BMS transformation induced by a binary black hole merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the characteristics of the remnant black hole formed in a binary black hole merger is crucial for conducting gravitational wave astronomy. Typically, models of remnant black holes provide information about their mass, spin, and kick velocity. However, other information related to the supertranslation symmetries of the BMS group, such as the memory effect, is also important for characterizing the final state of the system. In this work, we build a model of the BMS transformation that maps a binary black hole's inspiral frame to the remnant black hole's canonical rest frame. Training data for this model are created using high-precision numerical relativity simulations of quasi-circular systems with mass ratios $q \le 8$ and spins parallel to the orbital angular momentum with magnitudes $\chi_{1}, \chi_{2} \le 0.8$. We use Gaussian Process Regression to model the BMS transformations over the three-dimensional parameter space $\left(q, \chi_{1}^{z}, \chi_{2}^{z}\right)$. The physics captured by this model is strictly non-perturbative and cannot be obtained from post-Newtonian approximations alone, as it requires knowledge of the strong nonlinear effects that are sourced during the merger. Apart from providing the first model of the supertranslation induced by a binary black hole merger, we also find that the kick velocities predicted using Cauchy-characteristic evolution waveforms are, on average, $\sim5\%$ larger than the ones obtained from extrapolated waveforms. Our work has broad implications for improving gravitational wave models and studying the large-scale impact of memory, such as on the cosmological background. The fits produced in this work are available through the Python package $\texttt{surfinBH}$ under the name $\texttt{NRSur3dq8BMSRemnant}$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills AdS Black Holes: From Quantum Tunneling to Aschenbach Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the thermodynamic and quantum properties of Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills (EPYM) black holes in an Anti-de Sitter background, focusing on the effects of the nonlinear Yang-Mills charge parameter $\gamma$. We derive the metric function, analyze Hawking radiation through boson tunneling, and calculate thermodynamic properties including temperature and phase transitions. The quantum tunneling of $W^+$ bosons is examined using the WKB approximation and Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, revealing how nonlinearity modifies the radiation spectrum. We compute the effective potential governing photon orbits and null geodesics, demonstrating significant alterations in light behavior in strong gravitational fields. Additionally, we explore the Aschenbach effect, showing that this phenomenon, which is typically associated with rotating black holes, can emerge in spherically symmetric EPYM spacetimes because of non-linear field interactions. Our results may yield observational markers that can be identified with instruments such as the Event Horizon Telescope and upcoming gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that special and general theories of relativity implicitly assume spacetime events correspond to quantum measurement outcomes. This leads to a change in how one should view the equivalence of spacetime and gravity. We describe a Bell test using time-like measurements that indicates a non classical causal structure that does not violate no-signaling. From this perspective, the violation of the Bell inequalities are already evidence for the non classical structure of flat spacetime as seen by an agent embedded in it. We argue that spacetime geometry can be learned by an embedded agent with internal actuators and sensors making internal measurements.</description>

      <title>Holographic R\'enyi $n\to 0$ entropy and Euclidean fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the holographic prescription for computing the refined R\'enyi entropies $\tilde S_n$ in the $n \to 0$ limit in the AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_{d}$ context. This can be interpreted as a high temperature limit with respect to the notion of energy provided by the modular Hamiltonian describing the state of the system reduced to a subregion. We find, to the leading order in $n$, that the system attains local equilibrium and admits a CFT description in terms of an Euclidean irrotational perfect fluid. The fluid has vortex like boundary conditions at the boundary of the region. These vortices extends into the bulk in the form of a conical singularity, in agreement with Dong's proposal for the holographic dual to the R\'enyi entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an exact correspondence between tree-level cosmological correlators with unparticle exchange (at integer scaling dimensions) and banana diagrams of conformally coupled scalars. This duality enables us to systematically solve the governing differential equations through the application of shift relations and de Sitter bootstrap techniques. Furthermore, we adapt a dimensional regularization scheme to cosmological correlators, demonstrating how renormalization conditions uniquely fix the regularization prescription. Our results provide new insights into the analytic structure of higher-order loop corrections to inflationary correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Freelance Holography, Part I: Setting Boundary Conditions Free in Gauge/Gravity Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore AdS/CFT duality in the large $N$ limit, where the duality reduces to gauge/gravity correspondence, from the viewpoint of covariant phase space formalism (CPSF). In particular, we elucidate the role of the $W, Y$, and $Z$ freedoms (also known as ambiguities) in the CPSF and their meaning in the gauge/gravity correspondence. We show that $W$-freedom is associated with the choice of boundary conditions and slicing of solution space in the gravity side, which has been related to deformations by multi-trace operators in the gauge theory side. The gauge/gravity correspondence implies the equivalence of on-shell symplectic potentials on both sides, thereby the $Y$-freedom of the gravity side specifies the on-shell symplectic form of the gauge theory side. The $Z$-freedom, which determines the corner Lagrangian on the gravity side, establishes the boundary conditions and choice of slicing in the boundary theory and its solution space. We utilize these results to systematically formulate freelance holography in which boundary conditions of the fields on the gravity side are chosen freely and are not limited to Dirichlet boundary conditions and discuss some examples with different boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue developing the freelance holography program, formulating gauge/gravity correspondence where the gravity side is formulated on a space bounded by a generic timelike codimension-one surface inside AdS and arbitrary boundary conditions are imposed on the gravity fields on the surface. Our analysis is performed within the Covariant Phase Space Formalism (CPSF). We discuss how a given boundary condition on the bulk fields on a generic boundary evolves as we move the boundary to another boundary inside AdS and work out how this evolution is encoded in deformations of the holographic boundary theory. Our analyses here extend the extensively studied T$\bar{\text{T}}$-deformation by relaxing the boundary conditions at asymptotic AdS or at the cutoff surface to be any arbitrary one (besides Dirichlet). We discuss some of the implications of our general freelance holography setting.</description>

Abstract: The accretion disk around a black hole and its emissions play an essential role in theoretical analysis of the black hole image. In the literature, two analytical toy models of accretions are widely adopted: the spherical model and the thin disk model. They are different geometrically but both thin optically. We polish them for free-falling accretions around static spherical black holes. As an application, we investigate the images of a class of nonsingular black holes conformally related to the Schwarzschild black hole. These black holes are vacuum solutions of a family of conformal gravity theories. Results are compared with the Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass. Our results indicate that the conformal factor does not affect the shadow radius seen by distant observers, but it leaves an imprint on the intensity image of black hole.</description>

      <title>Damping of gravitational waves in f(R) gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06402v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the damping of gravitational waves (GW) in $f(R)$ gravity by matter. By applying the kinetic theory, we examine the first-order approximation of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. In the flat spacetime, we derive the evolution equations for waves in $f(R)$ gravity and demonstrate that Landau damping is absent while collision damping is present. In the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology, we also examine the dynamical equations for the two modes. Furthermore, in the model $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$, we investigate the effect of the mass term on wave amplitude decay within the neutrino system. We observe that the tensor mode with $m = 1 \, \text{eV}$ exhibits faster decay compared to other cases, while the scalar mode with $m = 1 \, \text{eV}$ appears to suppress decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article aims at clarifying the situation about astrophysical sources that might be observed with haloscope experiments sensitive to gravitational waves in the 1-10 GHz band. The GrAHal setup is taken as a benchmark. We follow a very pedagogical path so that the full analysis can easily be used by the entire community who might not be familiar with the theoretical framework. Different relevant physical regimes are considered in details and some formulas encountered in the literature are revised. In particular, we carefully take into account the fast drift of the gravitational wave frequency and the relevant experimental timescales. We also relax the usual assumption that only the merging phase should be considered. The distances that can be probed and expected event rates are carefully evaluated, taking into account degeneracies between physical parameters. We show where experimental efforts should be focused to improve the sensitivity and we conclude that any detection in the near future is extremely unlikely.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields around a loop quantum gravity black hole in de Sitter spacetime: Quasinormal modes, late-time tails and strong cosmic censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop quantum gravity, as one branch of quantum gravity, holds the potential to explore the fundamental nature of black holes. Recently, according to the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder model in loop quantum cosmology, a novel loop quantum corrected black hole in de Sitter spacetime has been discovered. Here, we first investigate the corresponding quasinormal modes and late-time behavior of massless neutral scalar field perturbations based on such a quantum-modified black hole in de Sitter spacetime. The frequency and time domain analysis of the lowest-lying quasinormal modes is derived by Prony method, Matrix method as well as WKB approximation. The influences of loop quantum correction, the black hole mass ratio, and the cosmological constant on the quasinormal frequencies are studied in detail. The late-time behaviors of quantum-modified black holes possess an exponential decay, which is mainly determined not only by the multipole number but also by the cosmological constant. The impact of loop quantum correction on the late-time tail is negligible, but it has a significant impact on damping oscillation. To explore spacetime singularities, we examine the validity of strong cosmic censorship for a near-extremal quantum-modified black hole in de Sitter spacetime. As a result, it is found that the strong cosmic censorship is destroyed as the black hole approaches the near-extremal limit, but the violation becomes weaker as the cosmological constant and the loop quantum correction increase.</description>

      <title>Autonomous systems and attractor behaviors in non-metricity gravity: stability analysis and cosmic acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05455v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological dynamics are rigorously investigated through the systematic application of autonomous system analysis to the gravitational field equations in non-metricity gravity. The systematic procedure to analyze the late-time cosmic acceleration in higher-order non-metricity gravity is demonstrated by exploring non-hyperbolic critical points with the center manifold theory. The stability properties of these critical points are also evaluated based on the analysis of eigenvalues and phase portraits. It is explicitly shown that the stable node can be realized. The critical points of each model are individually analyzed, and their corresponding cosmological implications are derived. The stability properties of these critical points are evaluated based on the analysis of eigenvalues and phase portraits, revealing that each model includes at least one stable node. Furthermore, the evolution plots of the cosmological parameters confirm the models capacity to exhibit accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Rotating AdS black holes in Kaniadakis statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we advance the understanding of thermodynamic properties and phase transitions in rotating anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes by applying the Kaniadakis(KD) entropy framework. This framework represents a non-extensive generalization of classical statistical mechanics, inspired by the symmetries of relativity and offering a novel perspective on black hole thermodynamics. Our focus is on investigating how Kaniadakis entropy modifies the thermodynamic phase space of rotating AdS black holes. To achieve this, we analyze three prominent rotating AdS black hole systems: the Kerr AdS black hole, the Kerr-Sen AdS black hole, and the Kerr-Newman AdS black hole. We assess their thermodynamic quantities, phase transitions, thermodynamic topology and thermodynamic geometry within the Kaniadakis statistical framework. Our analysis reveals notable deviations from the behaviour predicted by traditional Gibbs-Boltzmann(GB) statistics.</description>

Abstract: A relativistic model of geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disks is worked out for a class of magnetically charged black holes, which are solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with a dilaton-coupled Euler-Heisenberg correction. Constraints on black hole parameters are derived from the subextremality condition and energy conditions. The Keplerian orbits, the time-averaged energy flux, the local temperature, the specific luminosity and the conversion efficiency of accreting mass into radiation are obtained and compared with Schwarzschild and Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black holes.</description>

      <title>The maximum radiated energy and final spin of high speed collision of two black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a series of 769 full numerical simulations of high energy collision of black holes to search for the maximum gravitational energy emitted $E_{rad}$, during their merger. We consider equal mass binaries with spins pointing along their orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$ and perform a search over impact parameters $b$ and initial linear momenta $p/m=\gamma v$ to find the maximum $E_{rad}$ for a given spin $\vec{S}$. The total radiated energy proves to have a weak dependence on the intrinsic spin $s$ of the holes, for the sequence $s=+0.8, 0.0, -0.8$ studied here. We thus estimate the maximum $E_{rad}^{max}/M_{ADM}\approx32\%\pm2\%$ for these direct merger encounters. We also explore the radiated angular momentum and the maximum spin of the merger remnant (within these configurations), finding $\alpha_f^{max}=0.987$. We then use the zero frequency limit expansion to analytically model the radiated energy in the small impact parameter and large initial linear momentum regime.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity Effects of Ultralight Boson Clouds Formed by Black Hole Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oscillating clouds of ultralight bosons can grow around spinning black holes through superradiance, extracting energy and angular momentum, and eventually dissipating through gravitational radiation. Gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LISA can thus probe the existence of ultralight bosons. In this study, we use fully general-relativistic solutions of the black hole-boson cloud systems to study the self-gravity effects of scalar and vector boson clouds, making only the simplifying assumption that the spacetime is axisymmetric (essentially corresponding to taking an oscillation average). We calculate the self-gravity shift in the cloud oscillation frequency, which determines the frequency evolution of the gravitational wave signal, finding that this effect can be up to twice as large in the relativistic regime compared to non-relativistic estimates. We use this to improve the superrad waveform model, and estimate that this reduces the theoretical phase error to a few cycles over the characteristic timescale of the gravitational wave emission timescale for the louder vector boson signals. We also perform an analysis of the spacetime geometry of these systems, calculating how the cloud changes the innermost stable circular orbit and light-ring around the black hole.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical black hole solutions in $f(\mathcal{R})$ and $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{A},A^{\mu\nu}A_{\mu\nu})$ modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a cylindrical black hole (BH) space-time introduced by Lemos, in the context of modified gravity theories. Specifically, we focus on $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity framework, where we choose two form functions, $f(\mathcal{R})=(\mathcal{R}+\alpha_1\,\mathcal{R}^2+\alpha_2\,\mathcal{R}^3+\alpha_3\,\mathcal{R}^4+\alpha_4\,\mathcal{R}^5)$ and $f(\mathcal{R})=\mathcal{R}+\alpha_k\,\mathcal{R}^{k+1},\quad (k=1,2,...n)$. We solve the modified field equations incorporating zero energy-momentum tensor, $\mathcal{T}^{\mu\nu}=0$ and obtain the result. Moreover, we study another well-known modified gravity theory called Ricci-Inverse ($\mathcal{RI}$) gravity and investigate this Lemos black hole (LBH) space-time. To achieve this, we consider different classes of models defined as follows: (i) Class-\textbf{I} model: $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A})=(\mathcal{R}+\beta\,\mathcal{A})$, (ii) Class-\textbf{II} model: $f(\mathcal{R}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})=(\mathcal{R}+\gamma\,A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$, and (iii) Class-\textbf{III} model: $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})=(\mathcal{R}+\alpha_1\,\mathcal{R}^2+\alpha_2\,\mathcal{R}^3+\beta_1\,\mathcal{A}+\beta_2\,\mathcal{A}^2+\gamma\,A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$, where $\mathcal{A}=g_{\mu\nu}\,A^{\mu\nu}$ is the anti-curvature scalar, $A^{\mu\nu}$ is the anti-curvature tensor, the reciprocal of the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$. We solve the modified field equations under the same aforementioned scenario of energy-momentum tensor, and obtain the result. Subsequently, we study the geodesic motions of test particles around this LBH within the Ricci-Inverse and $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity theories and analyze the outcomes. We demonstrate that different coupling constants chosen in these modified gravity theories influences the usual cosmological constant $\Lambda$, and thus, shifted the result in comparison to the general relativity case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the transition rate of a freely falling Unruh-DeWitt detector, coupled linearly to a massless scalar quantum field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, as a probe of the interior of a black hole. Specifically, we consider the transition rate of a detector in the spinless Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole as it freely falls toward and across the horizon and compare it to the corresponding situation for an $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}$ geon. Both the BTZ black hole and its geon counterpart are quotients of $\text{AdS}_3$ spacetime that are identical exterior to the horizon but have different interior topologies. We find outside the horizon that the rates are qualitatively similar, but with the amplitude in the geon spacetime larger than in the BTZ case. Once the detector crosses the horizon, there are notable distinctions characterized by different discontinuities in the temporal derivative of the response rate. These discontinuities can appear outside the horizon if the detector is switched on at a sufficiently early time, within the past white hole horizon. In general, the detector can act as an `early warning system' that both spots the black hole horizon and discerns its interior topology.</description>

      <title>Significant circular Unruh effect at small acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the transition rates of an atom rotating in a circular orbit, which is coupled with fluctuating electromagnetic fields in vacuum. We find that when the rotational angular velocity exceeds the transition frequency of the atom, the excitation rate can reach the same order of magnitude as the emission rate, even with an extremely low centripetal acceleration resulting from a very small orbital radius. For experimentally accessible centripetal accelerations, the excitation rate of centripetally accelerated atoms can be $10^{272,878}$ times greater than that of linearly accelerated atoms with the same magnitude of acceleration. Our result suggests that the circular version of the Unruh effect can be significant even at very small centripetal accelerations, contrary to the common belief that a large Unruh effect requires large acceleration. This finding sheds new light on the experimental detection of the circular Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>The pseudospectrum for the Kerr black hole with spin $s=0$ case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the pseudospectrum of the Kerr black hole, which indicates the instability of the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the Kerr black hole. Methodologically, we use the hyperboloidal framework to cast the QNM problem into a two-dimensional eigenvalue problem associated with a non-self-adjoint operator, and then the spectrum and pseudospectrum are solved by imposing the two-dimensional Chebyshev collocation method. The (energy) norm is constructed by using the conserved current method for the spin $s=0$ case. For the finite rank approximation of the operator, we discuss the convergence of pseudospectra using various norms, each involving different orders of derivatives. The convergence of the pseudospectrum improves as the order of the derivatives increases. We find that an increase in the imaginary part of complex frequency can deteriorate the convergence of the pseudospectrum under the condition of the same norms.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing and shadows in the toron solution of Einstein's equations using ray tracing methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical and analytical study of the so-called `toron' solution of the stationary axisymmetric Einstein equations in vacuum expressed in terms of elliptic functions. The asymptotic behavior of this solution coincides with the one of the NUT solution, i.e., it has a `gravimagnetic' mass known as the NUT parameter while the ordinary mass vanishes. The physical properties of this spacetime are studied via ray tracing. The results are compared to known geodesic flows in Schwarzschild, Kerr and NUT spacetimes to discuss similarities and differences, with a particular emphasis on the comparison of NUT and toron spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Unimodular JT gravity and de Sitter quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we show that a gauge-theoretic description of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity naturally yields a Henneaux-Teitelboim (HT) unimodular gravity via a central extension of its isometry group, valid for both flat and curved two-dimensional spacetimes. HT gravity introduces a unimodular time canonically conjugate to the cosmological constant, serving as a physical time in quantum cosmology. By studying the mini-superspace reduction of $\text{HT}_2$ gravity, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation becomes a Schr\"odinger-like equation, giving a consistent and unitary quantum theory. Analysis of the wavefunction's probability density reveals a quantum distribution for the scale factor $a$, offering a quantum perspective on the expansion and contraction of the universe. In this perspective, the possibility of reaching the singular point $a=0$ signals that topology change could occur. Finally, we give a consistent quantum description of unimodular time that aligns seamlessly with Page-Wootters formulation of quantum mechanics, where quantum correlations between unimodular time and JT gravity are studied in $\text{HT}_2$ quantum cosmology.</description>

      <title>Evolution of human cognition required Einstein's gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an unexpected anthropic fine-tuning of gravity: human cognition arose on Earth only because the laws of gravity included gravitational waves. Their link is the heat from decays of the radioactive isotopes U-238 and Th-232, which were synthesized mainly in rare explosive mergers of binary neutron stars, brought about by the loss of orbital energy to gravitational radiation. This heat, released in Earth's interior, has (1) maintained plate tectonics and (2) likely helped keep Earth's iron core molten. The core's magnetic field has protected all life from annihilation by the solar wind. More surprisingly, relative brain size, a proxy for cognition, has seen two sharp increases, first for mammals and then for humans, both attributed by evolutionary biologists to adaptations to major climatic changes caused by specific tectonic events. After the second event, the joining of North and South America, human brain size grew from chimpanzee levels to modern ones. If the laws of gravity had not included gravitational waves, humans would not be capable of studying the laws of gravity.</description>

      <title>Compactification of Anisotropies in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. Specifically, we examine the simplest scenario in which the scalar field lacks a kinetic term, and its kinetic contribution arises from an integration by parts of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. We consider four- and five-dimensional anisotropic spacetimes, focusing on Bianchi I and extended Bianchi I geometries. Our study reveals that the asymptotic solutions correspond to locally symmetric spacetimes where at least two scale factors exhibit analogous behavior or, alternatively, to isotropic configurations where all scale factors evolve identically. Additionally, we discuss the effects of a cosmological constant, finding that the presence of the cosmological constant does not lead to an isotropic universe.</description>

      <title>Testing Regular Black Holes with X-ray data of GX 339-4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regular black holes are singularity-free black hole spacetimes proposed to solve the problem of the presence of spacetime singularities that plagues the black holes of general relativity and most theories of gravity. In this work, we consider the regular black holes recently proposed by Mazza, Franzin &amp; Liberati and we extend previous studies to get a more stringent observational constraint on the regularization parameter $l$. We study simultaneous observations of NuSTAR and Swift of the Galactic black hole in GX 339-4 during its outburst in 2015. The quality of the NuSTAR data is exceptionally good and the spectrum of the source presents both a strong thermal component and prominent relativistically blurred reflection features. This permits us to measure the regularization parameter $l$ from the simultaneous analysis of the thermal spectrum and the reflection features. From our analysis, we find the constraint $l/M &lt; 0.44$ (90% CL), which is stronger than previous constraints inferred with X-ray and gravitational wave data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating bosonic dark matter halos are considered as potential candidates for modeling dark matter in galactic halos. These bosonic dark matter halos can be viewed as a dilute and very extended version of bosonic stars, and the methods used for the calculation and analysis of the latter objects can be directly applied. Bosonic stars, a hypothetical type of astrophysical objects, are categorized into two primary families, based on the nature of the particles composing them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon stars and Proca stars. We examine various models from both families and the rotation curves which their contribution induces in different galaxies, to identify the most plausible candidates that explain the flattening of orbital velocities observed in galactic halos. By exploring different combinations of our dark matter models with observable galactic features, we propose an interesting source to compensate for the apparent lack of matter in dwarf and spiral galaxies, providing a possible explanation for this longstanding astronomical puzzle.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Thermal Gravitinos Through Large-Scale Structure Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of non-thermally produced dark matter on large-scale structure formation, focusing on the gravitino dark matter. Our analysis shows that large-scale structure measurements from the SDSS LRG data offer a promising approach to probing non-thermally produced gravitinos. Specifically, if gravitinos resulting from neutralino decay constitute a fraction $F_\text{dec}=0.35~(0.1)$ of the dark matter component, the data exclude bino-like neutralino with a mass $m_{\chi_1^0}\lesssim 25~(11)\text{ GeV}$ at $95\%\text{ C.L.}$. Furthermore, this constraint appears to be largely independent of the gravitino mass.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In Phys. Lett. B 862, 139357 (2025) we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to the Low Frequency Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background: Constraints from Quasars and the Astrometric Hellings-Downs Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new astrometric constraints on the stochastic gravitational wave background and construct the first astrometric Hellings-Downs curve using quasar proper motions. From quadrupolar vector spherical harmonic fits to the Gaia proper motions of 1,108,858 quasars, we obtain a frequency-integrated upper limit on the gravitational wave energy density, $h_{70}^2\Omega_{GW} \leq 0.023$ (95% confidence limit), for frequencies between 11.2 nHz and $3.1\times10^{-9}$ nHz ($1.33/t_0$). However, from the astrometric Hellings-Downs curve that describes the correlated proper motions between 2,104,609,881 quasar pairs as a function of their angular separation, we find a stronger constraint: a characteristic strain of $h_{c} \leq 2.7 \times 10^{-12}$ for $f_{\rm ref} = 1$ yr$^{-1}$ and $h_{70}^2\Omega_{\rm GW} \leq 0.0096$ at 95% confidence. We probe down to $\pm$0.005 $\mu$as$^2$ yr$^{-2}$ in correlated power and obtain the lowest astrometric limit to date. This is also the first time that optical wavelength astrometry surpasses limits from radio-frequency interferometry. This astrometric analysis does not yet reach the sensitivity needed to detect the pulsar timing-based red gravitational wave spectrum extrapolated to the quasar gravitational wave sensitivity window, assuming that the turnover in the spectrum occurs at $\sim$1 nHz for massive black hole binaries. The limits presented here may exclude some exotic interpretations of the stochastic gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Ultra-cold atoms as quantum simulators for relativistic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to review developments regarding the use of ultra-cold atoms as quantum simulators. Special emphasis is placed on relativistic quantum phenomena, which are presumably most interesting for the audience of this journal. After a brief introduction into the main idea of quantum simulators and the basic physics of ultra-cold atoms, relativistic quantum phenomena of linear fields are discussed, including Hawking radiation, the Unruh effect, cosmological particle creation, the Gibbons-Hawking and Ginzburg effects, super-radiance, Sauter-Schwinger and Breit-Wheeler pair creation, as well as the dynamical Casimir effect. After that, the focus is shifted to phenomena of non-linear fields, such as the sine-Gordon model, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, false-vacuum decay, and quantum back-reaction. In order to place everything into proper context, the basic underlying mechanisms of these phenomena are briefly recapitulated before their simulators are discussed. Even though effort is made to provide a review as fair as possible, there can be co claim of completeness and the selection as well as the relative weights of the topics may well reflect the personal view and taste of the author.</description>

      <title>Holographic Correlators of Boundary/Crosscap CFTs in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores holographic correlators within the frameworks of two-dimensional Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT) and Crosscap Conformal Field Theory (XCFT). Utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute stress tensor correlators in BCFT, considering both tensionless and tensionful end-of-the-world (EOW) brane scenarios. We derive recurrence relations for two-point and three-point correlators and examine the impact of non-zero brane tension on correlators. Extending these results, we investigate the holographic duals of XCFTs, presenting explicit scalar and stress tensor correlator computations on projective geometries such as $\mathbb{RP}^2$. Additionally, we analyze stress tensor correlators at a finite cutoff, uncovering deformations to one-point and two-point functions induced by the cutoff. Our findings provide novel insights into the holographic structures of BCFT and XCFT while laying the groundwork for future research into higher-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <title>A New $\sim 5\sigma$ Tension at Characteristic Redshift from DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter distance ($D_{A}$) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed $D_A$ at two key redshifts, $z\sim 1.63$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} =0$) and at $z\sim 0.512$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} = D_{A}$), we derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$ at these redshifts. Our findings reveal that at $z\sim 1.63$, the $H(z)$ is fully consistent with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, confirming no new physics at that redshift. However, at $z \sim 0.512$, the derived $H(z)$ shows a more than $5\sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model as constrained by Planck-2018 at this lower redshift. This emerging $\sim 5\sigma$ tension at $z\sim 0.512$, distinct from the existing ``Hubble Tension'', may signal the first strong evidence for new physics at low redshifts.</description>
