      <title>End-to-end simulations of photonic phase correctors for adaptive optics systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical beams and starlight distorted by atmospheric turbulence can be corrected with adaptive optics systems to enable efficient coupling into single-mode fibers. Deformable mirrors, used to flatten the wavefront in astronomical telescopes, are costly, sensitive, and complex mechanical components that require careful calibration to enable high-quality imaging in astronomy, microscopy, and vision science. They are also impractical to deploy in large numbers for non-imaging applications like free-space optical communication. Here, we propose a photonic integrated c rcuit capable of spatially sampling the wavefront collected by the telescope and co-phasing the subapertures to maximize the flux delivered to an output single-mode fiber as the integrated photonic implementation of a deformable mirror. We present the results of end-to-end simulations to quantify the performance of the proposed photonic solution under varying atmospheric conditions toward realizing an adaptive optics system without a deformable mirror for free-space optical receivers.</description>

      <title>Meta-Optics Triplet for Zoom Imaging at Mid-Wave Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lenses with dynamic focal length, also called zoom functionality, enable a variety of applications related to imaging and sensing. The traditional approach of stacking refractive lenses to achieve this functionality results in an expensive, heavy optical system. Especially for applications in the mid-infrared, light weight and compact form factor are required. In this work, we use a meta-optic triplet to demonstrate zoom imaging at mid-wave infrared wavelengths. By varying the axial distances between the optics, the meta-optic triplet achieves high quality imaging over a zoom range of 5x, with 50$^\circ$ full field of view in the widest configuration and an aperture of 8 mm. This triplet system demonstrates the potential for meta-optics to reduce conventional components in complex and multi-functional imaging systems to dramatically thinner and lighter components.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Single-Photon Band Structure in a Coupled-Spinning-Resonator chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the single-photon band structure and the transport of a single photon in a one-dimensional coupled-spinning-resonator chain. The time-reversal symmetry of the resonators chain is broken by the spinning of the resonators, instead of external or synthetic magnetic field. Two nonreciprocal single-photon band gaps can be obtained in the coupled-spinning-resonator chain, whose width depends on the angular velocity of the spinning resonator. Based on the nonreciprocal band gaps, we can implement a single photon circulator at multiple frequency windows, and the direction of photon cycling is opposite for different band gaps. In addition, reciprocal single-photon band structures can also be realized in the coupled-spinning-resonator chain when all resonators rotate in the same direction with equal angular velocity. Our work open a new route to achieve, manipulate, and switch nonreciprocal or reciprocal single-photon band structures, and provides new opportunities to realize novel single-photon devices.</description>

      <title>Talbot interference of whispering gallery modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Talbot self-imaging phenomenon is a fundamental interference effect that is natural to all waves with a periodic structure. We theoretically and experimentally study the Talbot effect for optical waves in the transverse angular domain using whispering-gallery modes of step-index multimode fibers, which carry a high orbital angular momentum and fulfill the required quadratic dispersion relation. By using the complex interference along the core-cladding interface of these fibers, we experimentally demonstrate that the high-order fractional Talbot effect can be used to implement 9- and 30-port beamsplitters using only off-the-shelf components in a compact arrangement. In addition, we show that the beamsplitters can be efficiently interfaced with single-mode fibers, such that our work not only extends the recent developments on the angular Talbot effect to widely available step-index multimode fibers, but also demonstrates a powerful application as a signal multiplexer, which becomes more compact as the number of channels is increased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride is rapidly gaining interest as a platform for photonic quantum technologies, due to its two-dimensional nature and its ability to host defects deep within its large band gap that may act as room-temperature single-photon emitters. In this review paper we provide an overview of (1) the structure, properties, growth and transfer of hexagonal boron nitride; (2) the creation and assignment of colour centres in hexagonal boron nitride for applications in photonic quantum technologies; and (3) heterostructure devices for the electrical tuning and charge control of colour centres that form the basis for photonic quantum technology devices. The aim of this review is to provide readers a summary of progress in both defect engineering and device fabrication in hexagonal boron nitride based photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Speckle-based 3D sub-diffraction imaging through a multimode fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flexible multimode fiber is an exceptionally efficient tool for in vivo deep tissue imaging. Recent advances in compressive multimode fiber sensing allow for imaging with sub-diffraction spatial resolution and sub-Nyquist speed. At present, the technology is limited to imaging in a two-dimensional (2D) plane near the fiber distal facet while in real applications it is very important to visualize three-dimensional (3D) structures. Here we propose a new approach for fast sub-diffraction 3D imaging through a multimode fiber by using a single 2D scan, speckle illumination, and bucket detection. We experimentally demonstrate precise image plane location as well as 3D imaging of samples with various scattering coefficients. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the point spread function along the axial direction is 3 times smaller than the diffraction limit. Our study grants depth-resolving capacity to ultra-thin super-resolution fiber endoscopes for life science and medical applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Mode Control, Switching and Shaping In Few Mode Fiber Using a Fiber Piano</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of a fiber piano in controlling spatial modes in few mode fibers. It has been found that together with sub-optimal coupling into SMF-28 fibre and half and quarter waveplates, the fiber piano is capable of producing and reproducing desired spatial modes up to $LP_{11}$ when using 808 nm light and up to $LP_{21}$ when using 632.8 nm light. The control of spatial mode profile extends down to the single photon level. This is demonstrated with the help of correlated photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down conversion.</description>

      <title>Impact of coherent mode coupling on noise performance in elliptical aperture VCSELs for datacom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical behavior of medium-size multimode VCSELs with an elliptical oxide aperture, selected for the best trade-off between high output power and modulation speed for datacom applications, with a focus on their relative intensity noise (RIN) performance. Our experimental results, collected for various VCSELs, outline the presence of several peaks in the RIN spectra within the bandwidth of the transmission system, which can limit the eye opening under direct current modulation. Here, we present a rigorous model to explain for the first time the origin of these peaks. In particular, the frequencies of the spectral RIN peaks are analytically described as the result of the non-trivial interaction among transverse modes by addressing the laser dynamics and the related noise features through a time-domain mode expansion approach, accounting for coherent effects in multimode competition, spatial hole burning, and carrier diffusion. The laser modulation performance is addressed through dynamical simulations with PAM2 and PAM4 modulations, which clearly demonstrate the potential for high-bitrate optical interconnects. Finally, we address the effect of the oxide aperture aspect ratio via electromagnetic simulations, demonstrating how the ellipticity affects the modal frequency detuning and the RIN, thus providing design guidelines for VCSELs with low RIN performance and outlining a clear roadmap for a substantially improved bandwidth-power trade-off in these devices.</description>

      <title>Quaternions and rotations: applications to Minkowski's four-vectors, electromagnetic waves and polarization optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotations on the 3-dimensional Euclidean vector-space can be represented by real quaternions, as was shown by Hamilton. Introducing complex quaternions allows us to extend the result to elliptic and hyperbolic rotations on the Minkowski space, that is, to proper Lorentz rotations. Another generalization deals with complex rotations on the complex-quaternion algebra. Appropriate quaternionic expressions of differential operators lead to a quaternionic form of Maxwell equations; the quaternionic expressions of an electromagnetic-field in two Galilean frames in relative motion are linked by a complex rotation; some relativistic invariants of electromagnetic waves are deduced, including their polarization states and their degrees of polarization. Quaternionic forms of proper Lorentz rotations are applied to polarization optics along with illustrative examples. Equivalences between relativistic effects and crystal optics effects are mentioned. A derivation of the triangle inequality on the Minkowski space is given; the inequality is illustrated by some properties of partially polarized lightwaves.</description>

Abstract: Electron and lattice heat transport have been investigated in bilayer thin films of gold and CoSb$_3$ after photo-excitation of the nanometric top gold layer through picosecond x-ray scattering in a pump-probe setup. The unconventional observation of a larger portion of the deposited heat being detected first in the underlying CoSb$_3$ layer supports the picture of ballistic transport of the photo-excited electrons from gold to the underlying layer. The lattice expansion recorded by x-ray scattering allows accounting for the energy deposition and heat transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network for both forward and inverse continuous nonlinear Fourier transforms, NFT and INFT respectively. We demonstrate the network's capability to perform NFT and INFT for a random mix of NFDM-QAM signals. The network transformations (NFT and INFT) exhibit true characteristics of these transformations; they are significantly different for low and high-power input pulses. The network shows adequate accuracy with an RMSE of 5e-3 for forward and 3e-2 for inverse transforms. We further show that the trained network can be used to perform general nonlinear Fourier transforms on arbitrary pulses beyond the training pulse types.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Control of Excitons in Atomically Thin Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11252v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a promising platform for novel applications ranging from optoelectronic devices to quantum optics and solid state quantum simulators. While much progress has been made towards characterizing and controlling excitons in TMDs, manipulating their properties during the course of their lifetime - a key requirement for many optoelectronic device and information processing modalities - remains an outstanding challenge. Here we combine long-lived interlayer excitons in angle-aligned MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with fast electrical control to realize dynamical control schemes, in which exciton properties are not predetermined at the time of excitation but can be dynamically manipulated during their lifetime. Leveraging the out-of-plane exciton dipole moment, we use electric fields to demonstrate dynamical control over the exciton emission wavelength. Moreover, employing a patterned gate geometry, we demonstrate rapid local sample doping and toggling of the radiative decay rate through exciton-charge interactions during the exciton lifetime. Spatially mapping the exciton response reveals charge redistribution, offering a novel probe of electronic transport in twisted TMD heterostructures. Our results establish the feasibility of dynamical exciton control schemes, unlocking new directions for exciton-based information processing and optoelectronic devices, and the realization of excitonic phenomena in TMDs.</description>

      <title>Rydberg EIT based laser lock to Zeeman sublevels with 0.6 GHz scanning range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a technique for frequency locking a laser to the Zeeman sublevel transitions between the 5P$_{3/2}$ intermediate and 32D$_{5/2}$ Rydberg states in $^{87}$Rb. This method allows for continuous frequency tuning over 0.6 GHz by varying an applied external magnetic field. In the presence of the applied field, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum of an atomic vapor splits via the Zeeman effect according to the strength of the magnetic field and the polarization of the pump and probe lasers. We show that the 480 nm pump laser, responsible for transitions between the Zeeman sublevels of the intermediate state and the Rydberg state, can be locked to the Zeeman-split EIT peaks. The short-term frequency stability of the laser lock is 0.15 MHz and the long-term stability is within 0.5 MHz. In addition, we show that in the absence of an applied magnetic field and adequate shielding, the frequency shift of the lock point has a peak-to-peak variation of 1.6 MHz depending on the polarization of the pump field, while when locked to Zeeman sublevels this variation is reduced to 0.6 MHz. The proposed technique is useful for research involving Rydberg atoms, where large continuous tuning of the laser frequency with stable locking is required.</description>

      <title>Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission from InAs/GaAs quantum dots coupled to low-Q cylindrical nanocavities</title>

Abstract: Generation of single and entangled photons is crucial for photonic quantum information processing. Quantum dots (QDs) are promising sources capable of producing high-quality quantum light states on demand, although at a rate typically limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In this study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold enhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs. We achieve this by coupling individual QDs to metal-clad GaAs nanopillars characterized with mode volume of 4.5x10-4 ({\lambda}/n)3 and quality factor of 62, consequently enabling high Purcell enhancement across a bandwidth of 15 nm. We measure a multi-photon emission probability as low as 0.5 % from QDs within these cavities. In addition to providing a valuable platform for exploring light-matter interaction at the nanoscale, this work represents a significant stride towards developing QD-sources emitting at high repetition rates, underpinning their role in the future of quantum communication and computing.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional flat-band solitons in superhoneycomb lattices</title>

Abstract: Flat-band periodic materials are characterized by a linear spectrum containing at least one band where the propagation constant remains nearly constant irrespective of the Bloch momentum across the Brillouin zone. These materials provide a unique platform for investigating phenomena related to light localization. Meantime, the interaction between flat-band physics and nonlinearity in continuous systems remains largely unexplored, particularly in continuous systems where the band flatness deviates slightly from zero, in contrast to simplified discrete systems with exactly flat bands. Here, we use a continuous superhoneycomb lattice featuring a flat band in its spectrum to theoretically and numerically introduce a range of stable flatband solitons. These solutions encompass fundamental, dipole, multi-peak, and even vortex solitons. Numerical analysis demonstrates that these solitons are stable in a broad range of powers. They do not bifurcate from the flat band and can be analyzed using Wannier function expansion leading to their designation as Wannier solitons. These solitons showcase novel possibilities for light localization and transmission within nonlinear flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Coherently amplified ultrafast imaging using a free-electron interferometer</title>

Abstract: Accessing the low-energy non-equilibrium dynamics of materials and their polaritons with simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution has been a bold frontier of electron microscopy in recent years. One of the main challenges lies in the ability to retrieve extremely weak signals while simultaneously disentangling amplitude and phase information. Here, we present Free-Electron Ramsey Imaging (FERI), a microscopy approach based on light-induced electron modulation that enables coherent amplification of optical near-fields in electron imaging. We provide simultaneous time-, space-, and phase-resolved measurements of a micro-drum made from a hexagonal boron nitride membrane visualizing the sub-cycle dynamics of 2D polariton wavepackets therein. The phase-resolved measurements reveals vortex-anti-vortex singularities on the polariton wavefronts, together with an intriguing phenomenon of a traveling wave mimicking the amplitude profile of a standing wave. Our experiments show a 20-fold coherent amplification of the near-field signal compared to conventional electron near-field imaging, resolving peak field intensities in the order of ~W/cm2, corresponding to field amplitudes of a few kV/m. As a result, our work paves the way for spatio-temporal electron microscopy of biological specimens and quantum materials, exciting yet delicate samples that are currently difficult to investigate.</description>

      <title>Bound Bogoliubov quasiparticles in photon superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bogoliubov's description of Bose gases relies on the linear dynamics of noninteracting quasiparticles on top of a homogeneous condensate. Here, we theoretically explore the weakly-nonlinear regime of a one-dimensional photon superfluid in which phonon-like elementary excitations interact via their backreaction on the background flow. The generalized dispersion relation extracted from spatiotemporal intensity spectra reveals additional branches that correspond to bound Bogoliubov quasiparticles -- phase-locked collective excitations originating from nonresonant harmonic-generation and wave-mixing processes. These mechanisms are inherent to fluctuation dynamics and highlight non-trivial scattering channels other than resonant interactions that could be relevant in the emergence of dissipative and turbulent phenomena in superfluids.</description>

      <title>Dependence on laser intensity of the number-weighted angular distribution of Compton-scattered photon beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse Compton scattering of an ultra-relativistic electron in the field of a high-intensity laser produces photon beams with angular and spectral distributions that are strongly dependent on the laser intensity. Here, we show that the laser intensity at the interaction point can be accurately inferred from the measurement of the angular number-density distribution of Compton-scattered photon beams. The theory, corroborated by numerical simulations, is accurate to within 10\% in a wide range of laser intensities (dimensionless intensity $5 \leq a_0 \leq 50$) and electron energies (250 MeV $\leq E \leq $ 15 GeV), and accounts for experimental features such as the finite transverse size of the electron beam, low-energy cut-offs in the photon detector, and the possibility of a transverse misalignment between the electron beam and the laser focus.</description>
