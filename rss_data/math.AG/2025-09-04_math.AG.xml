      <title>Tropical geometry in torus bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and prove an analogue of the balancing condition for the tropicalization of a curve in a torus bundle $X$. We find that the usual balancing condition fails when the bundle is non-trivial and that the failure is captured by the first Chern classes of the line bundles associated to $X$. We discuss a geometric perspective of tropicalization where the weights arise naturally from intersection theory. The relations between divisors on a toric variety bundle put constraints on these weights which leads to the balancing condition.</description>

      <title>Sigma function associated with a hyperelliptic curve with two points at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baker constructed basic meromorphic functions on the Jacobian variety of a hyperelliptic curve with two points at infinity. We call them Baker functions. The construction is based on the Abel-Jacobi map, which allows us to identify the field of meromorphic functions on the Jacobian variety of the curve with the field of meromorphic functions on the symmetric product of the curve. In our previous paper, a solution to the KP equation was constructed in terms of the Baker function. This paper is devoted to the properties of the Baker functions. In this paper, we construct an entire function whose second logarithmic derivatives are the Baker functions. We prove that the power series expansion of the entire function around the origin is determined only by the coefficients of the defining equation of the curve and a branch point of the curve algebraically. We also describe the quasi-periodicity of the entire function and express the entire function in terms of the Riemann theta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a birational analog of the motivic zeta function of a reduced polynomial in terms of minimal models. It admits an intrinsic meaning in terms of contact loci of arcs, an analog of a result of Denef and Loeser in the motivic case. We show that for local plane curve singularities the poles of the birational zeta function essentially coincide with the poles of the motivic zeta function.</description>

      <title>Recognizing flag varieties and reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a flat and projective morphism $X\rightarrow\Sigma$ of schemes. We show, first, that any set of $\mathbb{P}^1$-fibrations on $X$ defines a set of simple roots, a set of simple coroots and a Cartan matrix $C$. Second, $X$ is an \'etale $F$-bundle over some projective $\Sigma$-scheme, where $F$ is the flag variety of the adjoint Chevalley group over the integers defined by $C$. In particular, if the simple roots generate the N\'eron--Severi group of $X$ relative to $\Sigma$ and $X$ is cohomologically flat in degree zero over $\Sigma$ then $X$ is a form of $F$. When $X$ is a smooth Fano variety over the complex numbers all of whose extremal rays are accounted for by these fibrations this is due to Occhetta, Sol\'a-Conde, Watanabe and Wi\'sniewski. Third, we recover, in a uniform way, the isomorphism and isogeny theorems of Chevalley and Demazure: over any base a pinned reductive group is determined by its pinned root datum, and a $p$-morphism of pinned root data determines a unique homomorphism of the corresponding groups.</description>

Abstract: We compute the ring of cooperations $\pi_{**}^{\mathbb{F}_q}(\text{kq} \otimes \text{kq})$ for the very effective Hermitian K-theory over all finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ where $\text{char}(\mathbb{F}_q) \neq 2.$ To do this, we use the motivic Adams spectral sequence and show that all differentials are determined by the integral motivic cohomology of $\mathbb{F}_q$. As an application, we compute the $E_1$-page of the kq-resolution.</description>

Abstract: Rational homology ellipsoids are certain Liouville domains diffeomorphic to rational homology balls and having Lagrangian pin-wheels as their skeleta. From the point of view of almost toric fibrations, they are a natural generalisation of usual symplectic ellipsoids. We study symplectic embeddings of rational homology ellipsoids into the complex projective plane and we show that for each Markov triple, this problem gives rise to an infinite staircase. A key ingredient in the proof is the result that any two such embeddings are Hamiltonian isotopic. We also prove constraints on sizes for pairs of disjoint embeddings.</description>

Abstract: We study perturbations of linear differential equations, deriving explicit series solutions, using Dyson-type expansions. We analyze the monodromy of deformed solutions in a number of examples, and relate this to cocycles in a cohomological framework. We also analyze the spectral properties of the hypergeometric equation under infinitesimal deformations, derive the first-order eigenvalue correction via orthogonality, and establish natural bounds for the perturbed problem.</description>

      <title>Differential Equations for Gaussian Statistical Models with Rational Maximum Likelihood Estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multivariate Gaussian statistical models whose maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is a rational function of the observed data. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between such models and the solutions to a nonlinear first-order partial differential equation (PDE). Using our correspondence, we reinterpret familiar classes of models with rational MLE, such as directed (and decomposable undirected) Gaussian graphical models. We also find new models with rational MLE. For linear concentration models with rational MLE, we show that homaloidal polynomials from birational geometry lead to solutions to the PDE. We thus shed light on the problem of classifying Gaussian models with rational MLE by relating it to the open problem in birational geometry of classifying homaloidal polynomials.</description>

      <title>A Conjecture of Bhatt--Lurie and weakly $p$-nilpotent Hodge--Tate stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p$, and let $X/k$ be a smooth variety. It is known that given a Frobenius lifting of $X$, we can identify prismatic crystals and nilpotent Higgs bundles, known as a positive characteristic version of the Simpson correspondence of $X$. However, Ogus--Vologodsky point out in their original paper of non-abelian Hodge theory in characteristic $p$ that, if we are just given a smooth lifting over $\W_2(k)$, there is a non-abelian Hodge theory on $p$-nilpotent Higgs bundles. Hence, it is natural to ask that whether there exists a subcategory of Hodge--Tate crystals on $X$, which can be described as $p$-nilpotent Higgs bundles. In this paper, we construct an analogue of the Hodge--Tate stack, so called the weakly $p$-nilpotent Hodge--Tate stack, on which the vector bundles are identified with certain Hodge--Tate crystals on $X$ that can be locally described by weakly $p$-nilpotent Higgs bundles. Furthermore, we prove that the weakly $p$-nilpotent Hodge--Tate stack is indeed a gerbe banded by $T_{X/k}\otimes{\alpha_p}$, and the obstruction class coincides with the obstruction of the existence of a Frobenius lifting of $X$, which is a conjecture of Bhatt and Lurie.</description>

      <title>Well-clipped cones behave themselves under all finite quotients, the cone conjecture under most</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a property of convex cones, being "well-clipped", that is inspired by the work of several complex algebraic geometers on the Morrison-Kawamata cone conjecture. That property is satisfied by movable cones of divisors on various complex projective varieties of Calabi-Yau type, such as abelian varieties and projective hyperk\"ahler manifolds. The property of being well-clipped has the advantage to descend under taking invariants by a finite group action, and to be stable by direct sums. In the class of well-clipped cones, we also provide a simple characterization of those cones that admit a rational polyhedral fundamental domain under some natural group action. We use this framework to prove the movable cone conjecture for finite quotients of various projective varieties of Calabi-Yau type, notably products of projective primitive symplectic varieties, abelian varieties, and smooth rational surfaces underlying klt Calabi-Yau pairs. This entails Enriques manifolds in the sense of Oguiso-Schr\"oer. We also provide Galois descent statements implying the movable Morrison-Kawamata cone conjecture for abelian varieties over arbitrary perfect fields.</description>

      <title>On The Geometry and Topology of Cayley Condition in Poncelet Porism for Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19349v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the differential-geometric and topological properties of the Cayley condition in Poncelet porism for triangles, defined as the locus of pairs of non-degenerate conics that admit a Poncelet triangle. While the algebraic condition for this porism, established by Cayley, is classical, the geometric nature of the set of solutions has remained largely unexplored. We demonstrate that this Cayley set is a smooth, connected, 9-dimensional complex manifold. This is proven by showing it is an open subset of a smooth algebraic variety endowed with a trivial fiber bundle structure over the space of non-degenerate conics.
  To further analyze its structure, we construct the moduli space of transversely intersecting conic pairs under the action of $\mathbb{P}GL_3(\mathbb{C})$ and identify it with an open subset of $\mathbb{CP}^2/S_3$. We compute the fundamental group of a generic orbit.
  The elliptic j-invariant is then introduced as a holomorphic map on this space of conics, which factors through this moduli space. We analyze the subset of the Cayley set where this map is a submersion - its regular part - which corresponds to excluding points whose j-invariant is one of the critical values $0$ or $1728$. We prove that this regular part is the total space of a fiber bundle over $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0,1728\}$. This structure allows for the computation of the fundamental group via the long exact sequence of homotopy.
  Finally, we provide a principal bundle formulation for the Poncelet correspondence itself over orbits of conic pairs.</description>

      <title>A Lemma on Leech-like Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Leech pair is defined as a pair $(G,S)$, where $S$ is a positive definite even lattice without roots, equipped with a faithful action of a finite group $G$, such that the invariant sublattice of $S$ under the action of $G$ is trivial, and the induced action of $G$ on the discriminant group of $S$ is also trivial. This structure appears naturally when investigating hyperk\"ahler manifolds and the symplectic automorphisms acting on them. An important lemma due to Gaberdiel--Hohenegger--Volpato asserts that a Leech pair $(G,S)$ admits a primitive embedding into the Leech lattice if $rank(S)+\ell(A_S)\le 24$. However, the original proof is incomplete, as demonstrated by a counterexample provided by Marquand and Muller. They also presented a computer-assisted proof of the lemma for cases where $rank(S) \le 21$. In this paper, we modify the original approach to provide a complete and conceptual proof of the lemma.</description>

      <title>Character Varieties of Generalized Torus Knot Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $\mathbf{n}=(n_{1},\ldots,n_{r})\in\mathbb{N}^r$, let $\Gamma_{\mathbf{n}}$ be a group presentable as $$\left\langle \gamma_{1},\ldots,\gamma_{r}\:|\:\gamma_{1}^{n_{1}}=\gamma_{2}^{n_{2}}=\cdots=\gamma_{r}^{n_{r}}\right\rangle. $$ If $\gcd(n_i,n_j)=1$ for all $i\not=j$, we say $\Gamma_{\mathbf{n}}$ is a {\it generalized torus knot group} and otherwise say it is a {\it generalized torus link group}. This definition includes torus knot and link groups ($r=2$), that is, fundamental groups of the complement of a torus knot or link in $S^{3}$. Let $G$ be a connected complex reductive affine algebraic group. We show that the $G$-character varieties of generalized torus knot groups are path-connected. We then count the number of irreducible components of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character varieties of $\Gamma_{\mathbf{n}}$ when $n_i$ is odd for all $i$.</description>

      <title>Quotients of M-convex sets and M-convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unify the study of quotients of matroids, polymatroids, valuated matroids and strong maps of submodular functions in the framework of Murota's discrete convex analysis. As a main result, we compile a list of ten equivalent characterizations of quotients for M-convex sets, generalizing existing formulations for (poly)matroids and submodular functions. We also initiate the study of quotients of M-convex functions, constructing a hierarchy of four separate characterizations. Our investigations yield new insights into the fundamental operation of induction, as well as the structure of linking sets and linking functions, which are generalizations of linking systems and bimatroids.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay representations of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras of dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of a tilting or silting object is an important feature for an algebraic triangulated category since it gives an equivalence with the derived category of a ring. By applying tilting theory, we study Cohen-Macaulay representations of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras $A$, where do not assume that $A_0$ is a field. This is a large class of noncommutative Gorenstein rings containing Gorenstein orders. In this paper, we concentrate on the case where $A$ has dimension one. We prove that the stable category $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a silting object if and only if $A_0$ has finite global dimension. In this case, we give a silting object explicitly. Moreover, under the additional assumption that $A$ is ring-indecomposable, we prove that it admits a tilting object if and only if either $A$ is Artin-Schelter regular or the average Gorenstein parameter of $A$ is non-positive. These results are far-reaching generalizations of the results of Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura. We give two different proofs of the second result; one is based on Orlov-type semiorthogonal decompositions, and the other is based on a more direct calculation. We apply our results to a Gorenstein tiled order $A$ to prove that $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ is equivalent to the derived category of the incidence algebra of an (explicitly constructed) poset. We also apply our results and Koszul duality to study smooth noncommutative quadric hypersurfaces $\operatorname{\mathsf{qgr}} B$ of arbitrary dimension. We prove that the derived category $\mathsf{D}^b(\operatorname{\mathsf{qgr}} B)$ admits an (explicitly constructed) tilting object. Through Orlov's semiorthogonal decomposition, our tilting object has the tilting object of $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}B$ due to Smith and Van den Bergh as a direct summand.</description>

      <title>Duality invariance of Faltings heights, Hodge line bundles and global periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that an abelian variety and its dual over a global field have the same Faltings height and, more precisely, have isomorphic Hodge line bundles, including their natural metrized bundle structures. More carefully treating real places, we also show that these abelian varieties have the same real and global periods that appear in the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.</description>

      <title>Splittings in a complete local ring and decomposition its group of units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(R,M,k)$ be a complete local ring (not necessarily Noetherian). Then we prove that the natural surjective ring map $R\rightarrow k$ admits a splitting if and only if $\Char(R)=\Char(k)$. In addition, if $\Char(R)\neq\Char(k)$, then we prove that the natural surjective map between the groups of units $R^{\ast}\rightarrow k^{\ast}$ admits a splitting. \\ We also show with an example that the above theorem is in its full generality. As an application of this theorem, we show that the following short exact sequence of Abelian groups: $$\xymatrix{1\ar[r]&amp;1+M\ar[r]&amp; R^{\ast}\ar[r]&amp;k^{\ast} \ar[r]&amp;1}$$ is always split. Next, we show with an example that the above exact sequence does not split for many incomplete local rings.</description>
