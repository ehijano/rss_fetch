      <title>The Impact of Time Delay on Mutant Fixation in Evolutionary Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory examines how strategies spread and persist in populations through reproduction and imitation based on their fitness. Traditionally, models assume instantaneous dynamics where fitness depends on the current population state. However, some real-world processes unfold over time, with outcomes emerging from history. This motivates incorporating time delays into evolutionary game models, where fitness relies on the past. We study the impact of time delays on mutant fixation in a Moran Birth-death process with two strategies in a well-mixed population. At each time step of the process, an individual reproduces proportionally to fitness coming from the past. We model this as an absorbing Markov chain, allowing computational calculation of the fixation probability and time. We focus on three important games: the Stag-Hunt, Snowdrift, and Prisoner's Dilemma. We will show time delays reduce the fixation probability in the Stag-Hunt and the Prisoner's Dilemma but increase it in the Snowdrift. For the Stag-Hunt and the Prisoner's Dilemma, time delays lengthen the fixation time until a critical point, then reduce it. The Snowdrift exhibits the opposite trend.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Spread of COVID-19 in University Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical and simulation models are often used to predict the spread of a disease and estimate the impact of public health interventions, and many such models have been developed and used during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper describes a study that systematically compared models for a university community, which has a much smaller but more connected population than a state or nation. We developed a stochastic agent-based model, a deterministic compartment model, and a model based on ordinary differential equations. All three models represented the disease progression with the same susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. We created a baseline scenario for a population of 14,000 students and faculty and eleven other scenarios for combinations of interventions such as regular testing, contact tracing, quarantine, isolation, moving courses online, mask wearing, improving ventilation, and vaccination. We used parameter values from other epidemiological studies and incorporated data about COVID-19 testing in College Park, Maryland, but the study was designed to compare modeling approaches to each other using a synthetic population. For each scenario we used the models to estimate the number of persons who become infected over a semester of 119 days. We evaluated the models by comparing their predictions and evaluating their parsimony and computational effort. The agent-based model (ABM) and the deterministic compartment model (DCM) had similar results with cyclic flow of persons to and from quarantine, but the model based on ordinary differential equations failed to capture these dynamics. The ABM's computation time was much greater than the other two models' computation time. The DCM captured some of the dynamics that were present in the ABM's predictions and, like those from the ABM, clearly showed the importance of testing and moving classes on-line.</description>

      <title>Nuclear compensatory evolution driven by mito-nuclear incompatibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitochondrial function relies on the coordinated expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, exhibiting remarkable resilience regardless the susceptibility of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to accumulate harmful mutations. A suggested mechanism for preserving this mito-nuclear compatibility is the nuclear compensation, where deleterious mitochondrial alleles drive compensatory changes in nuclear genes. However, prevalence and conditioning factors for this phenomenon remain debated, with empirical evidence supporting and refuting its existence. Here, we investigate how mito-nuclear incompatibilities impact nuclear and mitochondrial substitutions in a model for species radiation under selection for mito-nuclear compatibility, similar to the process of mtDNA introgression. Mating eligibility relies on genetic (nuclear DNA) and spatial proximity, with populations evolving from partially compatible mito-nuclear states. Mutations do not confer advantages nor disadvantages, with no optimal nuclear or mitochondrial types, but individual fitness decreases with increasing incompatibilities, driving the demand for mito-nuclear genetic coordination. We find that selection consistently promotes compensation on incompatible nuclear genes, resulting in more substitutions than compatible or non-interacting genes. Surprisingly, low mitochondrial mutation rates favor compensation, as do increased selective pressure or a higher number of mismatches. High mitochondrial mutation rates boost substitutions in initially compatible nuclear genes, relaxing the selection against mito-nuclear incompatibilities and mirroring the compensatory evolution. Moreover, the presence of incompatibilities accelerates species radiation, but richness at equilibrium is not directly correlated with substitutions' response, revealing the complex dynamics triggered by mitochondrial introgression and mito-nuclear co-evolution.</description>

      <title>Overcompensation of transient and permanent death rate increases in age-structured models with cannibalistic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been renewed interest in understanding the mathematical structure of ecological population models that lead to overcompensation, the process by which a population recovers to a higher level after suffering a permanent increase in predation or harvesting. Here, we apply a recently formulated kinetic population theory to formally construct an age-structured single-species population model that includes a cannibalistic interaction in which older individuals prey on younger ones. Depending on the age-dependent structure of this interaction, our model can exhibit transient or steady-state overcompensation of an increased death rate as well as oscillations of the total population, both phenomena that have been observed in ecological systems. Analytic and numerical analysis of our model reveals sufficient conditions for overcompensation and oscillations. We also show how our structured population partial integrodifferential equation (PIDE) model can be reduced to coupled ODE models representing piecewise constant parameter domains, providing additional mathematical insight into the emergence of overcompensation.</description>
