      <title>Towards Transparent and Accurate Plasma State Monitoring at JET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling and monitoring plasma within a tokamak device is complex and challenging. Plasma off-normal events, such as disruptions, are hindering steady-state operation. For large devices, they can even endanger the machine's integrity and it represents in general one of the most serious concerns for the exploitation of the tokamak concept for future power plants. Effective plasma state monitoring carries the potential to enable an understanding of such phenomena and their evolution which is crucial for the successful operation of tokamaks. This paper presents the application of a transparent and data-driven methodology to monitor the plasma state in a tokamak. Compared to previous studies in the field, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques are combined. The dataset consisted of 520 expert-validated discharges from JET. The goal was to provide an interpretable plasma state representation for the JET operational space by leveraging multi-task learning for the first time in the context of plasma state monitoring. When evaluated as disruption predictors, a sequence-based approach showed significant improvements compared to the state-based models. The best resulting network achieved a promising cross-validated success rate when combined with a physical indicator and accounting for nearby instabilities. Qualitative evaluations of the learned latent space uncovered operational and disruptive regions as well as patterns related to learned dynamics and global feature importance. The applied methodology provides novel possibilities for the definition of triggers to switch between different control scenarios, data analysis, and learning as well as exploring latent dynamics for plasma state monitoring. It also showed promising quantitative and qualitative results with warning times suitable for avoidance purposes and distributions that are consistent with known physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Stellarator Accessibility through Port Size Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to the plasma chamber in a stellarator reactor is essential for maintenance and diagnostics. However, the complex geometry of stellarator coils, often characterized by their strong twisting, can severely limit the space available for access ports. This study introduces a novel optimization approach in which access ports are represented as closed curves on the plasma boundary. By carefully selecting a set of objectives and penalties related to the access port, we demonstrate the first stellarator coil optimization explicitly targeting improved access port size. The trade-off between magnetic field quality and port size is analyzed through the Pareto front of their respective objectives. The optimal location of a port is explained using a current potential approach. Finally, we show that additional shaping coils, such as windowpane coils, can enable the crossing of the Pareto front to achieve superior configurations.</description>

      <title>Learning Plasma Dynamics and Robust Rampdown Trajectories with Predict-First Experiments at TCV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rampdown in tokamak operations is a difficult to simulate phase during which the plasma is often pushed towards multiple instability limits. To address this challenge, and reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to develop a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. By integrating simple physics structure and data-driven models, the NSSM efficiently learns plasma dynamics during the rampdown from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in the reactor relevant high performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid multiple instability limits with high probability. Experiments at TCV ramping down high performance plasmas show statistically significant improvements in current and energy at plasma termination, with improvements in speed through continuous re-training. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20\% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations with sufficient accuracy to design trajectories that successfully terminate the pulse. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty, and demonstrates the relevance of the SciML approach to learning plasma dynamics for rapidly developing robust trajectories and controls during the incremental campaigns of upcoming burning plasma tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Local pump depletion based angular momentum gain of plasma electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel mechanism in which plasma electrons optically acquire angular momentum through local pump depletion. This process is facilitated by an azimuthally polarized laser that lacks angular momentum, yet enables electron rotation through canonical momentum conservation. Through theoretical considerations and one- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that the electrons acquire substantial angular momentum when the ultra-intense ($I \gtrsim 10^{19}$ W/cm$^2$) and ultra-short (tens of femtoseconds) laser pulse excites a nonlinear wakefield in the bubble regime. During this process, the frequency at the laser's leading edge shifts down due to phase modulation. Following the conservation of the wave action, the laser's vector potential develops a long-wavelength offset that trails the main pulse and remains confined within the plasma bubble. This offset facilitates electron rotation of the bubble's sheath currents and the high-energy ($&gt;100$ MeV) self-injected electrons. As the laser pulse front erodes, the long-wavelength offset of the vector potential increases and oscillates, influencing both the magnitude and polarity of the electrons' angular momentum. By varying key laser parameters such as phase, frequency, and polarization, we show how to manipulate and control the transverse momentum space of high-energy electrons.</description>

      <title>Resonant axion-plasmon conversion in neutron star magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant axion-plasmon conversion in the magnetospheres of magnetars may substantially impact the landscape of dark-matter axion detection. This work explores how resonant axion-plasmon conversion, through a mechanism that is analogous to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (NSW) effect in neutrinos, modify the expected radio signals from axion-photon conversions observed on Earth. Critically, the resonant conversion radius lies within the region expected for axion-photon conversion, introducing a nonradiative power loss that diminishes the anticipated photon flux. Our analysis demonstrates that this effect can reduce radio telescope sensitivities, shifting them into regions excluded by previous experiments. These findings compel a reassessment of experimental constraints derived from radio signatures of axion-photon conversions and highlight the necessity of accounting for plasmon effects in astrophysical axion searches. The presented corrections provide critical insights for refining the detection strategies of future telescope-based dark matter axion experiments.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of bootstrap current to the Shaing-Callen limit in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bootstrap current in stellarators can be presented as a sum of a collisionless value given by the Shaing-Callen asymptotic formula and an off-set current, which non-trivially depends on plasma collisionality and radial electric field. Using NEO-2 modelling, analytical estimates and semi-analytical studies with help of a propagator method, it is shown that the off-set current in the $1/\nu$ regime does not converge with decreasing collisionality $\nu_\ast$ but rather shows oscillations over $\log\nu_\ast$ with an amplitude of the order of the bootstrap current in an equivalent tokamak. The convergence to the Shaing-Callen limit appears in regimes with significant orbit precession, in particular, due to a finite radial electric field, where the off-set current decreases as $\nu_\ast^{3/5}$. The off-set current strongly increases in case of nearly aligned magnetic field maxima on the field line where it diverges as $\nu_\ast^{-1/2}$ in the $1/\nu$ regime and saturates due to the precession at a level exceeding the equivalent tokamak value by ${v_E^\ast}^{-1/2}$ where $v_E^\ast$ is the perpendicular Mach number. The latter off-set, however, can be minimized by further aligning local magnetic field maxima and by fulfilling an extra integral condition of ``equivalent ripples'' for the magnetic field. A criterion for the accuracy of this alignment and of ripple equivalence is derived. In addition, the possibility of the bootstrap effect at the magnetic axis caused by the above off-set is also discussed.</description>
