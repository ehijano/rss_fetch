      <title>Black hole spectral states revealed in GRMHD simulations with texture memory accelerated cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray binaries (XRBs) display spectral state transitions that are accompanied by substantial changes in the hardness, luminosity, and structure of the accretion flow. We developed a GPU-accelerated cooling toolkit for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of accreting black holes that uses texture memory for fast retrieval of pre-computed values. The toolkit incorporates bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, inverse Compton radiation and Coulomb collision processes. We implemented our toolkit into a GRMHD code and used it to simulate a magnetically arrested disk in the context of the XRB low/hard state around a Kerr black hole. We explored the mass accretion rate in the $\sim (10^{-6}-0.3) \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ range, where $\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington accretion rate. Our simulations reveal that for low accretion rates ($\dot{M} \lesssim 0.01 \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the flow settles into a geometrically thick, low-density, two-temperature hot accretion flow. At higher accretion rates, the flow turns into a cold single-temperature thin disk at $r_{\rm in} \gtrsim 50 r_g$. Inside, the disk breaks up into single-temperature thin filaments embedded into a two-temperature hot thick flow. Our GPU texture memory accelerated cooling prescription is $3-5$ times faster than the standard radiation M1 closure methods, and $\sim5$ times faster than storing the lookup table in global memory.</description>

      <title>Evidence of polar and ultralow supernova kicks from the orbits of Be X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae, the explosive deaths of massive stars, create heavy elements and form black holes and neutron stars. These compact objects often receive a velocity at formation, a "kick" whose physical origin remains debated. We investigate kicks in Be X-ray binaries, containing a neutron star and a rapidly spinning companion. We identify two distinct populations: one with kicks below $10\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$, much lower than theoretical predictions, and another with kicks around $100\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$, that shows evidence for being aligned within 5 degrees of the progenitor's rotation axis. The distribution of progenitor masses for the two populations have medians around $2.3\,\rm{M}_\odot$ and $4.9\,\rm{M}_\odot$, corresponding to stars with birth masses of about $10\,\rm{M}_\odot$ and $15\,\rm{M}_\odot$. The second component matches the low-velocity mode observed in isolated pulsars. Combined with the known high-velocity component, which dominates isolated pulsars, this suggests three distinct kick modes. These results reveal previously unrecognized diversity in neutron-star formation.</description>

      <title>Long timescale numerical simulations of large, super-critical accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report on three of the largest (in terms of simulation domain size) and longest (in terms of duration) 3D general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of super-critical accretion onto black holes. The simulations are all set for a rapidly rotating ($a_* = 0.9$), stellar-mass ($M_\mathrm{BH} = 6.62 M_\odot$) black hole. The simulations vary in their initial target mass accretion rates (assumed measured at large radius), with values sampled in the range $\dot{m}=\dot{M}/\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd} = 1-10$. We find in practice, though, that all of our simulations settle close to a net accretion rate of $\dot{m}_\mathrm{net} = \dot{m}_\mathrm{in}-\dot{m}_\mathrm{out} \approx 1$ (over the radii where our simulations have reached equilibrium), even though the inward mass flux (measured at large radii) $\dot{m}_\mathrm{in}$ can exceed 1,000 in some cases. This is possible because the outflowing mass flux $\dot{m}_\mathrm{out}$ adjusts itself to very nearly cancel out $\dot{m}_\mathrm{in}$, so that at all radii $\dot{M}_\mathrm{net} \approx \dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$. In other words, these simulated discs obey the Eddington limit. We compare our results with the predictions of the slim disc (advection-dominated) and critical disc (wind/outflow-dominated) models, finding that they agree quite well with the critical disc model both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also speculate as to why our results appear to contradict most previous numerical studies of super-critical accretion.</description>

      <title>A fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer shapes the properties of binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass transfer in binary systems is the key process in the formation of various classes of objects, including merging binary black holes (BBHs) and neutron stars. Orbital evolution during mass transfer depends on how much mass is accreted and how much angular momentum is lost $-$ two of the main uncertainties in binary evolution. Here, we demonstrate that there is a fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer (SMT), that is robust against uncertainties in orbital evolution. Based on detailed evolutionary models of interacting systems with a BH accretor and a massive star companion, we show that the post-interaction orbit is always wider than $\sim10R_{\odot}$, even when extreme shrinkage due to L2 outflows is assumed. Systems evolving towards tighter orbits become dynamically unstable and result in stellar mergers. This separation limit has direct implications for the properties of BBH mergers: long delay times ($\gtrsim1 \rm Gyr$), and no high BH spins from the tidal spin-up of helium stars. At high metallicity, the SMT channel may be severely quenched due to Wolf-Rayet winds. The reason for the separation limit lies in the stellar structure, not in binary physics. If the orbit gets too narrow during mass transfer, a dynamical instability is triggered by a rapid expansion of the remaining donor envelope due to its near-flat entropy profile. The closest separations can be achieved from core-He burning ($\sim8-15R_{\odot}$) and Main Sequence donors ($\sim15-30R_{\odot}$), while Hertzsprung Gap donors lead to wider orbits ($\gtrsim30-50R_{\odot}$) and non-merging BBHs. These outcomes and mass transfer stability are determined by the entropy structures, which are governed by internal composition profiles. The formation of compact binaries is thus sensitive to chemical mixing in stars and may relate to the blue-supergiant problem.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Shock X-ray Emission in Novae from Turbulent Mixing with Cool Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock interaction in classical novae occurs when a fast outflow from the white dwarf &gt; 1000 km s/s collides with a slower, cooler shell of gas released earlier in the outburst. The shocks radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio synchrotron to GeV gamma-rays. The hot shocked gas also emits &gt;~ keV thermal X-rays, typically peaking weeks after the eruption, once the ejecta becomes transparent to photoelectric absorption. However, the observed hard X-ray luminosities are typically &gt;4 orders of magnitude smaller than would be naively expected given the powerful shocks implied by the gamma-rays. We argue that a key missing piece to this puzzle is turbulence behind the shock, driven, e.g., by thin-shell and/or thermal instabilities. Turbulence efficiently mixes the hot X-ray emitting gas with cooler gas, sapping the hot gas of energy faster than it can directly radiate. Using analytic arguments motivated by numerical simulations, we show that energy losses due to turbulent mixing can easily balance shock heating, greatly reducing the volume of the hot gas and suppressing the X-ray luminosity. Equating the characteristic thickness of the X-ray emitting region to the minimum outer length scale of the turbulence capable of cooling the hot gas through mixing, we obtain X-ray luminosities consistent with nova observations if only ~1% of the shock's kinetic power goes into turbulent motions. A similar process may act to suppress thermal X-rays from other shock powered transients, such as interacting supernovae.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in the Estimation of Air Shower Observables from Monte Carlo Simulation of Radio Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of extensive air showers (EAS) induced by cosmic rays via radio signals has undergone significant advancements in the last two decades. Numerous ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments routinely capture radio pulses in the MHz to GHz frequency range emitted by EAS. The Monte Carlo simulation of these radio pulses is crucial to enable an accurate reconstruction of the primary cosmic ray energy and to infer the composition of the primary particles. In this work, a comprehensive comparison of the predicted electric field in EAS simulated with CoREAS and ZHAireS was conducted to estimate the systematic uncertainties arising from the use of different simulation packages in the determination of two key shower observables namely, the electromagnetic energy of the EAS and the depth of maximum development ($X_{\rm max}$). For this comparison, input parameters and settings as similar as possible were used in both simulations, along with the same realistic atmospheric refractive index depending on altitude, which is crucial for the prediction of radio emission properties of EAS. In addition, simulated EAS with very similar values of depth of maximum development were selected. Good agreement was found between CoREAS and ZHAireS, with discrepancies in the dominant electric field components generally remaining below $10\%$ across the frequency range of a few MHz to hundreds of MHz, relevant for most radio detection experiments, translating into uncertainties in the determination of energy below $5\%$ and $\simeq 10\,\mathrm{g/cm^2}$ in $X_{\rm max}$.</description>

      <title>On the X-ray Emission From Supernovae, and Implications for the Mass-Loss Rates of their Progenitor Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize the X-ray emission from young SNe. Having accumulated data on most observed X-ray SNe, we display the X-ray lightcurves of young SNe. We also explore the X-ray spectra of various SN types. The X-ray emission from Type Ib/c SNe is non-thermal. It is also likely that the emission from Type IIP SNe with low mass-loss rates (around 10$^{-7} \, Msun \,$ yr$^{-1}$) is non-thermal. As the mass-loss rate increases, thermal emission begins to dominate. Type IIn SNe have the highest X-ray luminosities, and are clearly thermal. We do not find evidence of non-thermal emission from Type IIb SNe. The aggregated data are used to obtain approximate mass-loss rates of the progenitor stars of these SNe. Type IIP's have progenitors with mass-loss rates $&lt; 10^{-5}\, Msun \,$ yr$^{-1}$, while Type IIn progenitors generally have mass-loss rates $&gt; 10^{-3}\, Msun $ yr$^{-1}$. However, we emphasize that the density of the ambient medium is the important parameter, and if it is due to a non-steady outflow solution, it can not be translated into a mass-loss rate.</description>

      <title>Structured ionized winds shooting out from a quasar at relativistic speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence indicates that supermassive black holes exist at the centers of most galaxies. Their mass correlates with the galactic bulge mass, suggesting a co-evolution with their host galaxies, most likely through powerful winds. X-ray observations have detected highly ionized winds outflowing at sub-relativistic speeds from the accretion disks around supermassive black holes. However, the limited spectral resolution of current X-ray instruments has left the physical structure and location of the winds poorly understood, hindering accurate estimates of their kinetic power. Here, the first XRISM observation of the luminous quasar, PDS 456, is reported. The high-resolution spectrometer Resolve onboard XRISM enabled the discovery of five discrete velocity components outflowing at 20-30% of the speed of light. This demonstrates that the wind structure is highly inhomogeneous, which likely consists of up to a million clumps. The mass outflow rate is estimated to be 60-300 solar masses per year, with the wind kinetic power exceeding the Eddington luminosity limit. Compared to the galaxy-scale outflows, the kinetic power is more than 3 orders of magnitude larger, while the momentum flux is 10 times larger. These estimates disfavor both energy- and momentum-driven outflow models. It suggests that such wind activity occurs in less than 10% of the quasar phase and/or that its energy/momentum is not efficiently transferred to the galaxy-scale outflows due to the clumpiness of the wind and the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Neutron Decay Anomaly and Its Effects on Neutron Star Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark matter (DM) on neutron star (NS) properties using the neutron decay anomaly model within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) framework. Three nucleonic models (HCD0-HCD2) are developed, satisfying astrophysical constraints such as the maximum NS mass ($\geq 2 M_\odot$), the NICER mass-radius limits, and the tidal deformability constraint from the GW170817 event. The equation of states of the NS admixed with DM (DMANS) are calculated by incorporating the self-interactions between them. The macroscopic properties, such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability of the NSs, are obtained for HCD models along with five others by varying self-interaction strength. By combining NS observations with scattering cross-section constraints from galaxy clusters, we explore model-dependent trends in the DM self-interaction parameter space. While the quantitative bounds may vary with hadronic model choice, our analysis offers insights into the interplay between DM interactions and NS observables within the RMF framework.</description>

      <title>The X-ray variability of tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a star is torn apart by the tidal forces of a supermassive black hole (a so-called TDE) a transient accretion episode is initiated and a hot, often X-ray bright, accretion disk is formed. Like any accretion flow this disk is turbulent, and therefore the emission from its surface will vary stochastically. As the disk has a finite mass supply (i.e., at most the initial mass of the disrupted star) the disk will also undergo long-timescale evolution, as this material is lost into the black hole. In this paper we combine theoretical models for this long time evolution of the disk with models for the stochastic variability of turbulent accretion flows which are correlated on short (orbital) timescales. This new framework allows us to demonstrate that (i) dimming events should be more prevalent than brightening events in long term TDE X-ray light curves (i.e., their log-luminosity distribution should be asymmetric), (ii) TDE X-ray light curves should follow a near- (but formally sub-)linear correlation between their root mean square variability and the mean flux, (iii) the fractional variability observed on short timescales across an X-ray observing band should increase with observing energy, and (iv) TDEs offer a unique probe of the physics of disk turbulence, owing to their clean spectra and natural evolutionary timescales. We confirm predictions (i) and (ii) with an analysis of the long timescale variability of two observed TDEs, and show strong support for prediction (iii) using the intra-observation variability of the same two sources.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures in black hole accretion: Pair production in dynamical magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion disks around black holes host extreme conditions where general relativity and magnetohydrodynamics dominate. These disks exhibit two distinct dynamical regimes -- Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) and Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD). In the MAD regime, these systems exhibit magnetic fields up to $10^8$ G and variability on gravitational timescales $t_g \sim 10^{-4}$ s for stellar-mass black holes. While classical magnetohydrodynamics has been extensively applied, quantum effects in these high-energy environments remain unexplored. Here, we employ quantum field theory in background gauge fields (QFTBGF) to demonstrate that the dynamic magnetic fields of MADs drive significant pair production via the Schwinger mechanism. The resulting pairs emit non-thermal (synchrotron) radiation with a peak frequency tunable across $ \sim 1 - 3000$ MHz, depending on the magnetic field strength (peaking at higher frequencies for stronger fields). For $ B \sim 10^8 $ G, our model predicts a peak spectral flux density of $ \sim 1 - 100$ mJy, detectable with next-generation radio telescopes (e.g., SKA, ngVLA). This work provides a direct and observable signatures of quantum effects in black hole accretion disks.</description>

      <title>Simulating jet launching in binary neutron star mergers with no artificial atmosphere limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, exploring the conditions to launch relativistic outflows compatible with gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. Employing an unprecedentedly low numerical density floor decreasing as the sixth power of radial distance, we obtain for the first time an evolution where such a floor has no effect on any outflow produced during and after merger. In models forming an accreting black hole (BH) 25 ms after merger, incipient jets are launched with terminal Lorentz factors and Poynting-flux luminosities compatible with GRBs. The rather high jet velocities reached in a few tens of ms, when compared to previous simulations adopting a much higher and uniform density floor, show the importance of removing any influence of the latter as the jet evolves toward increasingly large time and spatial scales. In absence of collapse, we find the emergence of much heavier and slower polar outflows, incapable of producing a GRB. We thus favor a BH origin for GRB jets.</description>

      <title>Supernova in lost common envelope and SN 2006gy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism is proposed for synchronizing core-collapse supernova with a recent loss of a red supergiant (RSG) envelope in the common envelope regime. A perequisite for the synchronization is a moderate RSG expansion during final decade. This scenario is based on the phenomenon of preSN~II dense shell formed at the final stage of 10-20 yr as a result of powerfull mass loss. The energy deposition into the RSG envelope that powers the enormous mass loss rate is able to expand the RSG. The moderate expansion is sufficient for the close secondary component to plunge into the common envelope with a subsequent explosion of stripped helium core. Superluminous SN~2006gy is suggested to be the outcome of this scenario.</description>

      <title>The construction and use of dephasing prescriptions for environmental effects in gravitational wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this work, we provide a curated overview of the theoretical framework necessary for incorporating dephasing due to environmental effects (EE) in gravitational wave (GW) templates. We focus in particular on the relationship between orbital perturbations in the time-domain and the resulting dephasing in both time and frequency domain, elucidating and resolving some inconsistencies present in the literature. We discuss how commonly studied binary environments often result in several sources of dephasing that affect the GW signal at the same time. This work synthesizes insights from two decades of literature, offering a unified conceptual narrative alongside a curated reference of key formulas, illustrative examples and methodological prescriptions. It can serve both as a reference for researchers in the field as well as a modern introduction for those who wish to enter it. In the second part, we derive novel aspects of dephasing for eccentric GW sources and lay the foundations for consistently treating the full problem. Our results highlight the unique potential of modelling and searching for EE in eccentric binary sources of GWs.</description>

      <title>Long-term Timing Results of Ecliptic Pulsars Observed with I-LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing at low frequencies offers a powerful tool for studying the interstellar medium. Additionally, pulsar observations in the ecliptic enables us to study the effects of the solar wind which becomes much more prominent at low radio frequencies. The Irish station of the LOw Frequency ARray (I-LOFAR) is a sensitive low-frequency radio telescope, capable of delivering high-precision data for pulsar studies. We present a comprehensive dataset of times-of-arrival, timing solutions and dispersion measure (DM) time series for seven ecliptic pulsars observed over two-to-three years with I-LOFAR. The primary objectives are to investigate time-dependent dispersion effects and provide high-precision timing data for pulsar timing experiments. We measure DM variations through pulsar timing and analysed these across different ecliptic latitudes to assess the impact of the solar wind on each pulsar. We model the intrinsic pulse-profile variability as a function of frequency. The high-precision DM time series for all seven pulsars exhibit clear variations dependent on their ecliptic latitudes, revealing the impact of the solar wind. Some pulsars show significant changes in their pulse widths across the frequency band, while others remain stable. We examine and quantify the pulse-nulling present in PSR J0826+2637, we report evidence for DM chromaticity in PSR J1645-0317, and we describe how PSR J2145-0750's DM precision is such that it could resolve the ionospheric DM contribution. This makes it a target of interest for telescopes in areas of the globe where the ionospheric electron density is higher, e.g. the Murchison Radio Observatory in Australia. This data release underscores the potential of I-LOFAR, or any standalone international LOFAR station, for advancing low-frequency pulsar studies, particularly in analyses of dispersion in the interstellar medium, the solar wind and the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Expanding Ejecta Method: II. Framework for Cosmological Distance Measurements via Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of the expanding ejecta method (EEM) as a cosmological probe, leveraging its ability to measure angular diameter distances to supernovae (SNe) with intensity interferometry. We propose three distinct applications of the EEM: (1) using Type IIP SNe as moderate-distance geometric anchors to calibrate Cepheids, replacing other local distance indicators; (2) directly calibrating Type Ia SNe, bypassing conventional calibration methods; (3) constructing a fully independent Hubble diagram with Type IIP (Type Ia) SNe, entirely decoupled from the traditional distance ladder. Incorporating realistic SN populations, we forecast a Hubble constant precision with next-generation intensity interferometers of $1.6\%$, $1.1\%$, and $9.3\% \,(3.6\%)$, respectively, for the three different proposed applications. Future intensity interferometry could yield improvements to $1.2\%$, $0.6\%$, and $1.5\%\,(0.4\%)$. The EEM thus offers a powerful geometric alternative for cosmic distance determination.</description>

      <title>On the universality of late-time ringdown tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The late time response of vacuum black holes in General Relativity is notoriously governed by power law tails arising from the wave scattering off the curved spacetime geometry far from the black hole. While it is known that such tails are universal to a certain extent, a precise characterization of their key ingredients is missing. Here we provide an analytical proof that the tail fall-off is universal for any effective potential asymptotically decaying as $1/r^2$, while the power law decay is different if the potential decays as $1/r^\alpha$ with $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. This result extends and revises some previous work and is in agreement with numerical analyses. Our proof is based on an analytical evaluation of the branch cut contribution to the Green function, and includes charged black holes, different kinds of perturbations, Teukolsky equation for the Kerr metric, exotic compact objects, extensions of General Relativity, and environmental effects. In the latter case, our results indicate that tails are largely insensitive to a wide range of physically motivated matter distributions around black holes, including the Navarro Frenk White profile commonly used to model dark matter.</description>

      <title>Properties of general stationary axisymmetric spacetimes: circularity and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse properties of general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, with a particular focus on circularity -- an accidental symmetry enjoyed by the Kerr metric, and therefore widely assumed when searching for rotating black hole solutions in alternative theories of gravity as well as when constructing models of Kerr mimickers. Within a gauge specified by seven (or six) free functions, the local existence of which we prove, we solve the differential circularity conditions and translate them into algebraic relations among the metric components. This result opens the way to investigating the consequences of circularity breaking in a controlled manner. In particular, we construct two simple analytical examples of non-circular deformations of the Kerr spacetime. The first one is "minimal", since the horizon and the ergosphere are identical to their Kerr counterparts, except for the fact that the horizon is not Killing and its surface gravity is therefore not constant. The second is "not so minimal", as the horizon's profile can be chosen arbitrarily and the difference between the horizon and the so-called rotosurface can be appreciated. Our findings thus pave the way for further research into the phenomenology of non-circular stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton Conclusively Identifies an Active Galactic Nucleus in a Green Pea Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Green Pea galaxies are a class of compact, low-mass, low-metallicity star-forming galaxies in the relatively local universe. They are believed to be analogues of high-redshift galaxies that re-ionised the universe and, indeed, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now uncovering such populations at record redshifts. Intriguingly, JWST finds evidence suggestive of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in many of these distant galaxies, including the elusive Little Red Dots, that broadly lack any detectable X-ray counterparts. Intuitively, one would expect to detect an AGN in their low-redshift analogues with X-rays, yet no study to date has conclusively identified an X-ray AGN within a Green Pea galaxy. Here we present the deepest X-ray campaign of a Green Pea galaxy performed to date, obtained with the goal of discerning the presence of a (potentially low-luminosity) AGN. The target $-$ SDSS J082247.66 +224144.0 (J0822+2241 hereafter) $-$ was previously found to display a comparable X-ray spectral shape to more local AGN ($\Gamma$ $\sim$ 2) and a high luminosity ($L_{2-10\,{\rm keV}}$ $\sim$ 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$). We show that over 6.2 years (rest-frame), the 2$-$10 keV luminosity of J0822+2241 is constant, whereas the soft 0.5$-$2 keV flux has decreased significantly by $\sim$60%. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the X-ray properties of J0822+2241, finding transient low-column density obscuration surrounding an AGN to be the only plausible scenario. J0822+2241 thus provides further evidence that low-luminosity AGN activity could have contributed to the epoch of reionisation, and that local analogues are useful to derive a complete multi-wavelength picture of black hole growth in high redshift low luminosity AGN.</description>

      <title>Black hole mimickers: from theory to observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole paradigm, while remarkably successful, raises fundamental questions-both classical and quantum-about the nature of spacetime, horizons, and singularities. Black hole mimickers, horizonless ultra-compact objects, have emerged as potential alternatives that seek to resolve some of these puzzles while remaining consistent with current observational constraints. Recent breakthroughs in gravitational-wave astronomy and horizon-scale electromagnetic imaging have opened new avenues to test this paradigm-making this an opportune moment to systematically investigate such alternatives.
  This vision document presents a snapshot of the field as discussed at the Black Hole Mimickers: From Theory to Observation workshop, where experts from gravitational wave astronomy, very long baseline interferometry, numerical and mathematical relativity, and high-energy physics converged to assess the current frontiers. By highlighting key open questions and proposing concrete pathways forward, this document aims to guide future efforts to probe the nature of compact objects. As the field stands at the crossroads of theoretical innovation and observational breakthroughs, we outline strategies to harness upcoming observational capabilities to fundamentally test the black hole paradigm.</description>

      <title>The Mirya-m1 Cosmic Ray Detector: Features and First Year Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Mirya-m1 Cosmic Ray Detector, the largest and only cosmic ray detector in Turkiye designed for space weather research. Mirya-m1, modeled and built after the Muon Impact Tracer and Observer (MITO) (Ayuso et al. 2021), is located at the Eastern Anatolia Observatory (DAG) site of the Turkiye National Observatories in Erzurum, Turkiye, at an altitude of 3099 meters. This elevation positions Mirya-m1 among the highest-altitude cosmic ray detectors globally. The detector consists of two stacked scintillator counters, each measuring 1x1 meters, separated by a vertical distance of 1.36 meters. Each scintillator is monitored by four H1411 Hamamatsu photomultiplier tubes, enabling precise detection and measurement of light by incident cosmic rays. In this study, we present the data collected throughout 2024, which includes the detection of two Forbush decrease events in March and May 2024. These significant detections demonstrate the capability of Mirya-m1 to contribute valuable data for space weather research, establishing its potential as a critical instrument for cosmic ray studies in the region.</description>

      <title>Formation and Early Evolution of Protoplanetary Disks under Nonuniform Cosmic-Ray Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is important for formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks. The effects of magnetic fields are suppressed due to non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation, which depend on the degree of ionization. Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary source of ionization in star-forming clouds, and their distribution is nonuniform as it is affected by gas density and magnetic fields. Therefore, CRs, magnetic fields, and gas interact with each other. In this work, we develop a new fully implicit cosmic ray transport module in Athena++ and perform three-dimensional simulations of disk formation from collapse of molecular cloud cores. Since CRs are strongly attenuated in the dense gas at the disk scale, distribution of magnetic fields is considerably altered compared to conventional models assuming a uniform ionization rate. While the total magnetic fluxes accreted onto the disks remain similar as the gas outside the disks remain sufficiently ionized and well coupled, the magnetic fields in the disks are less twisted due to the stronger non-ideal MHD effects. As a consequence, magnetic angular momentum transport is strongly suppressed at the disk scale, resulting in more gravitationally unstable disks with more prominent spiral arms. Our simulations demonstrate influence of non-uniform ionization resulting from CR transport and attenuation on the disk formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>The asymmetry of white dwarf double detonations and the observed scatter around the Phillips relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) simulations featuring a double detonation scenario have managed to reproduce the overall trend of the Phillips relation reasonably well. However, most, if not all, multidimensional simulations struggle to reproduce the scatter of observed SNe around this relation, exceeding it substantially. In this study, we investigate whether the excessive scatter around the Phillips relation can be caused by an off-center ignition of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core in the double detonation scenario and if this can help constrain possible SN Ia explosion channels. We simulated the detonation of three different initial CO white dwarfs of $0.9$, $1.0$, and $1.1\,M_\odot$, artificially ignited at systematically offset locations using the Arepo code. After nucleosynthetic postprocessing, we generated synthetic observables using the Artis code and compared these results against observational data and models of other works. We find that our simulations produce synthetic observables well within the range of the observed data in terms of viewing angle scatter. The majority of the viewing angle variability seems to be caused by line blanketing in the blue wavelengths of intermediate-mass elements and lighter iron-group elements, which are asymmetrically distributed in the outer layers of the ashes. Our results suggest that although the off-center ignition of the CO introduces substantial line of sight effects, it is not responsible for the excessive viewing angle scatter observed in other models. Instead, this effect seems to be caused by the detonation ashes from the rather massive helium (He) shells in current state-of-the-art models. Further reducing the He-shell masses of double detonation progenitors may be able to alleviate this issue and yield observables that reproduce the Phillips relation.</description>

      <title>A 70 pc-Diameter Nova Super-remnant Surrounding the Recurrent Nova RS Ophiuchi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent novae undergo thermonuclear-powered eruptions separated by less than 100 years, enabled by subgiant or red giant donors transferring hydrogen-rich matter at very high rates onto their massive white dwarf companions. The most-rapidly moving parts of envelopes ejected in successive recurrent nova events are predicted to overtake and collide with the slowest ejecta of the previous eruption, leading to the buildup of vast (~ 10 - 100 parsec) super-remnants surrounding all recurrent novae; but only three examples are currently known. We report deep narrowband imaging and spectroscopy which has revealed a ~ 70-parsec-diameter shell surrounding the frequently recurring nova RS Ophiuchi. We estimate the super-remnant mass to be ~ 20 - 200 solar masses, expanding at a few tens of km/s, with an age of order 50-100 kyr. Its extremely low surface brightness and large angular size help explain the hitherto surprising absence of nova super-remnants. Our results support the prediction that ALL recurrent novae are surrounded by similar extended structures.</description>

      <title>A weak Ly$\alpha$ halo for an extremely bright Little Red Dot. Indications of enshrouded SMBH growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas ($N_{\rm H}\sim10^{24}\,\rm cm^{-2}$). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date ($L_{\rm H\alpha}\approx10^{44}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at $z=4.464$ ($\mu=1.8$). We detect a moderately extended Ly$\alpha$ nebula ($h\approx5.7$ pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like H$\alpha$ seen by JWST. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is narrow ($\rm FWHM=270\pm 15~km\,s^{-1}$), spatially offset to H$\alpha$, and faint ($\rm Ly\alpha=0.07H\alpha$) compared to Ly$\alpha$ nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N$\,$IV]$\lambda$1486 emission, spatially aligned with H$\alpha$, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Ly$\alpha$ offset. We discuss that H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$ have distinct physical origins: H$\alpha$ originates from the AGN, while Ly$\alpha$ is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly$\alpha$ halos ($\Delta z&lt;0.02$, $\Delta r&lt;100$ pkpc). Their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities match expectations based on H$\alpha$ emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly$\alpha$ and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.</description>

      <title>Red giant - jet collisions in galactic nuclei I: 3D hydrodynamical model of a few stellar orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several models have been proposed to explain missing red giants (RGs) near the Galactic centre. Recently, a scenario has been suggested that predicts, among other processes, a long-term ablation of the surface layers of RGs during their repetitive passages through the Galactic jet (Zaja\v{c}ek et al., 2020). In this study, we perform detailed three-dimensional numerical modelling of this phenomenon. We calculate the ablation rate of the surface layers of a RG orbiting the supermassive black hole (SMBH) as it passes through the nuclear jet. In particular, we model the jet-star interaction for approximately 10 passages for the closer orbital distance of $10^{-3}\,\text{pc}$ and 2 passages for $10^{-2}\,\text{pc}$. We find that the mass loss due to ablation by the jet behaves with time as $\Delta M_{\star}\propto \sqrt{t}$ and the total ablated mass during a single active galactic nucleus (AGN) phase ($10^5$ years) is $\sim 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$. We arrive at similar rates of the stellar ablation for the relatively smaller jet luminosity $10^{42}\,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ as in the previous analytical calculations. For larger jet luminosities of $10^{44}$ and $10^{48}\,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$, the ablation rates inferred from $\sim 10$ interactions as well as extrapolated power-law fits are significantly lower than analytical values. Overall, the mass ablation rate per interaction and the extrapolated cumulative mass loss during the jet activity are comparable to the stellar-wind mass loss. For the smallest orbital distance of $10^{-3}\,\text{pc}$, we also track the thermal behaviour of the stellar surface layer, whose temperature appears to grow rapidly during the first 10 passages from $\sim 3600\,{\rm K}$ (spectral type M) to $\sim 8500\,{\rm K}$ (spectral type A). RG-jet interactions can thus lead to observable changes in the nuclear stellar population during the jet existence.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the dense matter equation of states in the light of the compact object HESS J1731-347</title>

Abstract: The recent mass ($0.77 \pm ^{0.20}_{0.17}M_{\odot}$) and radius ($10.4\pm^{0.86}_{0.78} \text{km}$) measurement of HESS J1731-347 made it one of the most fascinating object if it is indeed a neutron star. In this work, we examine the current status of the dense matter equation of states in the context of this compact object being a neutron star. We use three sets of equation of states corresponding to the three classes - neutron stars, strange stars, and hybrid stars and perform Bayesian model selection on them. Our results show that for hadronic models, the EoS is preferred to be stiff at the intermediate densities. This makes the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approximation and models based on effective interactions deviate from current astrophysical observations on the inclusion of HESS J1731-347. Furthermore, for the strange star family, the equation of states composed of three flavor quarks prefers relatively smaller bag parameters. Analyzing the hybrid family of equation of states consisting of a first-order phase transition revealed preferences for early first-order phase transition. Comparing all the preferred equations of state among each family, it was found that the current astrophysical constraints prefer the hybrid equation of states the most.</description>

      <title>Weakness of X-rays and Variability in High-redshift AGNs with Super-Eddington Accretion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations enable the exploration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad-line emission in the early universe. Despite their clear radiative and morphological signatures of AGNs in rest-frame optical bands, complementary evidence of AGN activity - such as X-ray emission and UV/optical variability - remains rarely detected. The weakness of X-rays and variability in these broad-line emitters challenges the conventional AGN paradigm, indicating that the accretion processes or environments around the central black holes (BHs) differ from those of low-redshift counterparts. In this work, we study the radiation spectra of super-Eddington accretion disks enveloped by high-density coronae. Radiation-driven outflows from the disk transport mass to the poles, resulting in moderately optically-thick, warm coronae formed through effective inverse Comptonization. This mechanism leads to softer X-ray spectra and larger bolometric correction factors for X-rays compared to typical AGNs, while being consistent with those of JWST AGNs and low-redshift super-Eddington accreting AGNs. In this scenario, UV/optical variability is suppressed due to photon trapping within super-Eddington disks, while X-ray emissions remain weak yet exhibit significant relative variability. These characteristics are particularly evident in high-redshift AGNs powered by lower-mass BHs with $\lesssim 10^{7-8}~M_\odot$, which undergo rapid mass accretion following overmassive evolutionary tracks relative to the BH-to-stellar mass correlation in the local universe.</description>

      <title>Role of injection parameters in jet propagation through realistic binary neutron star merger environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After the first multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger powering a short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), GW170817-GRB 170817A, remarkable effort is ongoing to unravel the evolution of the collimated, relativistic outflow (or jet) that was launched during the merger and fed the GRB event, imprinting its angular structure onto the follow-up afterglow signal. Current theoretical models, based on relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations, offer detailed insights into the launch and propagation processes that govern jet evolution. Notably, these simulations point out that jet injection parameters, such as luminosity, magnetization, power decay time scale, and launch time relative to merger, play a crucial role. However, the impact of these parameters is typically investigated within simplified jet propagation environments, lacking a direct connection with a realistic BNS merger aftermath. In this work, we present the first suite of 3D RMHD simulations exploring the influence of such parameters on the propagation of magnetized incipient GRB jets injected into magnetized environments directly imported from the outcome of a general-relativistic MHD BNS merger simulation. Our results demonstrate that, alongside the injection parameters, the BNS merger environment has a central role in shaping the overall jet evolution. Specifically, under identical jet parameters, the fate of an incipient jet (whether it successfully breaks out or becomes choked) depends strongly on the properties of such an environment. Further quantitative comparison between realistic and simplified environments reveals major differences, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the former for accurate modeling.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Gas Accretion onto Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from Inspiral through Merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black hole binaries are powerful multimessenger sources emitting both gravitational and EM radiation. Understanding the accretion dynamics of these systems and predicting their distinctive EM signals is crucial to informing and guiding upcoming efforts aimed at detecting gravitational waves produced by these binaries. To this end, accurate numerical modeling is required to describe both the spacetime and the magnetized gas around the black holes. In this paper, we present two key advances in this field of research. First, we have developed a novel 3D GRMHD framework that combines multiple numerical codes to simulate the inspiral and merger of supermassive black hole binaries starting from realistic initial data and running all the way through merger. Throughout the evolution, we adopt a simple but functional prescription to account for gas cooling through photon emission. Next, we have applied our new computational method to follow the time evolution of a circular, equal-mass, non-spinning black hole binary for ~200 orbits, starting from a separation of 20r_g and reaching the post-merger evolutionary stage of the system. We have shown how mass continues to flow toward the binary even after the binary "decouples" from its surrounding disk, but the accretion rate onto the black holes diminishes. We have identified how the minidisks orbiting each black hole are slowly drained and eventually dissolve as the binary compresses. We confirm previous findings that the system's luminosity decreases by only a factor of a few during inspiral; however, we observe an abrupt increase by ~50% in this quantity at the time of merger, likely accompanied by an equally abrupt change in spectrum. Finally, we have demonstrated that during the inspiral, fluid ram pressure regulates the fraction of the magnetic flux transported to the binary that attaches to the black holes' horizons.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetry of A Nuclear Transient AT2023clx: Revealing The Geometrical Alignment between The Transient Outflow and The Nuclear Dusty Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AT2023clx, which occurred in NGC3799 with a Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-Line Region (LINER), is one of the most nearby nuclear transients classified as a tidal disruption event (TDE). We present three-epoch spectropolarimetric follow-up observations of AT2023clx. We detected two polarization components; one is a constant polarization of $\sim 1\%$ originated from an aspherical outflow associated with the transient, while the other is a blue-excess polarization toward $\sim 2\%$ originated from a nuclear dusty environment via light echoes. The polarization angle flipped by 90 degrees between the two epochs, indicating that the outflow direction was perpendicular to the dust plane. Furthermore, the polarized flux might suggest that the nuclear dust favors relatively large grains, potentially offering constraints on its physical properties. Such polarization features -- the blue excess and the 90-degree flip -- have never been observed in previous TDE polarization samples, highlighting unique mechanisms behind AT2023clx. We propose possible scenarios: the disruption of a star formed within or captured by a nuclear dusty cloud. Given the LINER nature of NGC3799, the dusty region may possibly be linked to a torus or disk associated with a weak Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Furthermore, as a more speculative scenario, the event might have been triggered by AGN-like activity, potentially linked to changing-look AGNs or ambiguous nuclear transients. These findings highlight the power of time-series spectropolarimetry of TDEs, not only in probing the origins of nuclear transients, but also in investigating the physical properties of nuclear dust.</description>

      <title>Periodic variation of magnetoionic environment of a fast radio burst source</title>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous, dispersed millisecond-duration radio bursts whose origin is poorly known. Recent observations suggest that some FRBs may reside in binary systems, even though conclusive evidence remains elusive. Here we report the detection of a 26.24$\pm$0.02 day periodicity in Faraday rotation measure (RM) of an actively repeating source named FRB 20201124A. The detection was made from 3,106 bursts collected with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) over ~365 days. The RM periodicity is coherently phase-connected across ~14 cycles over a 1-year duration. Our detection of RM periodicity corresponds to a natural logarithmic Bayesian factor of 1,168. The detection significances vary between 5.9-34 {\sigma} under different assumptions. Such a periodicity provides evidence for the binary nature of FRB 20201124A, where the periodic RM variations arise from the orbital motion of the FRB source within the magnetoionic environment of the system. Together with previous observations, our result suggests that being in binary systems may be a common feature for actively repeating FRB sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05207v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of dark matter on hybrid stars. Using a two-fluid approach, where normal and dark matter components interact only gravitationally, we explore how dark matter can trigger the appearance of quark matter in neutron stars for unprecedented low masses. Our findings reveal that dark matter increases the central pressure of neutron stars, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid stars with quark cores even at very low compact star masses. The critical mass for the appearance of quark matter decreases with increasing dark matter content. We introduce the concept of "masquerading hybrid stars", where dark matter admixed stars exhibit similar mass-radius relations to purely hadronic stars, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on these parameters. Additionally, we identify a unique class of objects termed "dark oysters", characterized by a large dark matter halo and a small normal matter core, highlighting the diverse structural possibilities for compact stars influenced by dark matter.</description>

Abstract: The recent breakthroughs regarding the detection of compact binary mergers via gravitational waves opened up a new window to the Universe. Gravitational-wave models have been essential to this success since they are necessary to infer the properties of the compact binary system from the observational data. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, will allow for more observations of binary neutron star mergers with higher precision, making accurate waveform models crucial in describing these systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach for constructing phenomenological waveform models informed by observational data. Using mock data representing a one-year operation of the Einstein Telescope as our baseline, we demonstrate how the results improve as more events are included in the calibration. This method offers a new and complementary approach for developing sophisticated gravitational-wave models compared to classical techniques that employ analytical computations and numerical-relativity simulations. Improved waveform models will then yield more accurate parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Scalable data-analysis framework for long-duration gravitational waves from compact binaries using short Fourier transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework based on short Fourier transforms (SFTs) to analyze long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binaries. Targeted systems include binary neutron stars observed by third-generation ground-based detectors and massive black hole binaries observed by the LISA space mission. In short, ours is an extremely fast, scalable, and parallelizable implementation of the gravitational wave inner product, a core operation of gravitational wave matched filtering. By operating on disjoint data segments, SFTs allow for efficient handling of noise nonstationarities, data gaps, and detector-induced signal modulations. We present a pilot application to early warning problems in both ground- and space-based next-generation detectors. Overall, SFTs reduce the computing cost of evaluating an inner product by three to five orders of magnitude, depending on the specific application, with respect to a nonoptimized approach. We release public tools to operate using the SFT framework, including a vectorized and hardware-accelerated reimplementation of a time-domain waveform. The inner product is the key building block of all gravitational wave data treatments; by speeding up this low-level element so massively, SFTs provide an extremely promising solution for current and future gravitational wave data-analysis problems.</description>

      <title>Cluster-lensed supernova yields from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters can magnify supernovae (SNe) and create multiple images of the same SN. This enables measurements of cosmological parameters, which will be increasingly important in light of upcoming telescopic surveys. We study the prospects of detecting strongly lensed SNe in cluster fields with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)'s High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We employed two approaches: one focusing on known multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters, along with the SN rates specific to those galaxies, and another based on the expected number of lensed SNe exploding in a given volume behind a galaxy cluster. We collected all the clusters in the literature that feature a well-constrained lens model and multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters with high-quality data for the lensed galaxies. This allowed us to determine the SN rate for each galaxy. We provide predictions for 46 clusters visible to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, as well as for 9 observable by Roman's HLTDS, depending on whether the clusters fall within the survey's observing field. We predict that the number of multiply imaged SNe discovered by LSST in its first three years is $3.95 \pm 0.89$ from the first approach or $4.94 \pm 1.02$ from the second. For the HLTDS, the expected number of multiply imaged SNe ranges from $0.38 \pm 0.15$ to $5.2 \pm 2.2$, depending on the specific cluster observed, however, the fields to be targeted remain a matter of discussion. We conclude that LSST offers great prospects for detecting multiply imaged SNe. Our predictions are effectively lower limits, as we only considered the most massive and well-studied clusters. We provide a recommendation for HLTDS observing field selection, namely: either MACS J0553.4-3342 or Abell 1758a should be observed by the survey.</description>

Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed by accreting the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by Theia colliding with the proto-Earth. The giant impact theory can explain most of the properties of the Earth-Moon system, however, simulations of giant impact between a planetary embryo and the growing proto-Earth indicate that the materials in the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by the impact originate mainly from the impactor. Thus, the giant impact theory has difficulty explaining the Moon's Earth-like isotopic compositions. More materials from the proto-Earth could be delivered to the circum-terrestrial debris disk when a slightly sub-Mars-sized body collides with a fast rotating planet of rigid rotation but the resulting angular momentum is too large compared with that of the current Earth-Moon system. Since planetesimals accreted by the proto-Earth hit the surface of the proto-Earth, enhancing the rotation rate of the surface of the proto-Earth. The surface's fast rotation rate relative to the slow rotation rate of the inner region of the proto-Earth leads to transfer of angular momentum from surface to inner, resulting in the differential rotation. Here, we show that the giant impact of a sub-Mars-sized body on a differential rotating proto-Earth with a fast rotating outer region and a relative slow rotating inner region could result in a circum-terrestrial debris disk with materials predominately from the proto-Earth without violating the angular momentum constraint. The theory proposed here may provide a viable way of explaining the similarity in the isotopic compositions of the Earth and Moon.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbit of arbitrary-mass compact binaries at fourth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute by means of post-Newtonian (PN) methods the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of arbitrary-mass (in particular, comparable-mass) compact binaries. Two methods are used with equivalent results: dynamical perturbation of the conservative equations of motion in harmonic coordinates, and dynamical perturbation of the conservative Hamiltonian in ADM coordinates. The perturbation of the non-local tail term at 4PN order in both approaches is carefully investigated. Our final gauge invariant result for the location of the ISCO at 4PN order is close to the numerical value of the ISCO shift computed by the gravitational self-force (GSF) approach in the small mass-ratio limit, and is also in good agreement with the full numerical-relativity calculation in the case of equal masses. The PN method followed here is considered in standard Taylor-expanded form, without any resummation techniques applied. As a complement, we also compute explicitly the gauge transformation from harmonic coordinates to ADM coordinates up to 4PN order, including the tail contribution therein.</description>

      <title>Screening Mechanisms on White Dwarfs: Symmetron &amp; Dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides the first comparison of the symmetron and dilaton fields in white dwarfs. We show how these screening mechanisms behave inside {such stars} and their impact on stellar properties. Employing a custom-developed shooting method, we solve the scalar-tensor equilibrium equations in the Newtonian approximation. We consider a Chandrasekhar equation of state and examine a range of potential mass scales and coupling strengths for both fields. Both fields enhance the pressure drop in low-density white dwarfs, leading to smaller stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. Unlike chameleon models, their effects are suppressed in more massive stars, with symmetron fields fully decoupling and dilaton fields weakening but not vanishing. Consequently, no mass-radius curve for screened white dwarfs exceeds the Newtonian prediction in any of these three mechanisms. The mass-radius deviations are generally more pronounced at lower densities, depending on model parameters. Due to their common runaway potential, we confirm that dilaton and chameleon fields display similar field and gradient profiles. In contrast, due to their environment-dependent coupling, the dilaton and symmetron mechanisms exhibit stronger density-dependent screening effects. These findings highlight both phenomenological differences and theoretical similarities among these mechanisms, motivating asteroseismology studies to constrain the symmetron and dilaton parameter spaces.</description>
