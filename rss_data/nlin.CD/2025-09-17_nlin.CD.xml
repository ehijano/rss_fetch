      <title>On the model attractor in a high-dimensional neural network dynamics of reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of embedding and generalized synchronization in reservoir computing has recently been developed. Under ideal conditions, reservoir computing exhibits generalized synchronization during the learning process. These insights form a rigorous basis for understanding reservoir computing ability to reconstruct and predict complex dynamics. In this study, we clarified the dynamical system structures of generalized synchronization and embedding by comparing the Lyapunov exponents of a high dimensional neural network within the reservoir computing model with those in actual systems. Furthermore, we numerically calculated the Lyapunov exponents restricted to the tangent space of the inertial manifold in a high dimensional neural network. Our results demonstrate that all Lyapunov exponents of the actual dynamics, including negative ones, are successfully identified.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Analyzing Chaotic Dynamics in Biological Time Series: Insights from Frog Heart Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of experimental data is a relevant task in several physical, chemical and biological applications. In particular, the analysis of chaotic dynamics in cardiac systems is crucial as it can be related to some pathological arrhythmias. When working with short and noisy experimental time series, some standard techniques for chaos detection cannot provide reliable results because of such data characteristics. Moreover, when small datasets are available, Deep Learning techniques cannot be applied directly (that is, using part of the data to train the network, and using the trained network to analyze the remaining dataset). To avoid all these limitations, we propose an automatic algorithm that combines Deep Learning and some selection strategies based on a mathematical model of the same nature of the experimental data. To show its performance, we test it with experimental data obtained from ex-vivo frog heart experiments, obtaining highly accurate results.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetry breaking described by cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical symmetry breaking associated with the existence and non-existence of breather solutions is studied. Here, nonlinear hyperbolic evolution equations are calculated using a high-precision numerical scheme. %%% First, for clarifying the dynamical symmetry breaking, it is necessary to use a sufficiently high-precision scheme in the time-dependent framework. Second, the error of numerical calculations is generally more easily accumulated for calculating hyperbolic equations rather than parabolic equations. Third, numerical calculations become easily unstable for nonlinear cases. Our strategy for the high-precision and stable scheme is to implement the implicit Runge-Kutta method for time, and the Fourier spectral decomposition for space. %%% In this paper, focusing on the breather solutions, the relationship between the velocity, mass, and the amplitude of the perturbation is clarified. As a result, the conditions for transitioning from one state to another are clarified.</description>

      <title>Cislunar Resonant Transport and Heteroclinic Pathways: From 3:1 to 2:1 to L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical structure of cislunar space beyond geosynchronous orbit is critical for both lunar exploration and for high-Earth-orbiting trajectories. In this study, we investigate the role of mean-motion resonances and their associated heteroclinic connections in enabling natural semi-major axis transport in the Earth-Moon system. Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincar\'e map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs high Earth orbits.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of the acoustic frequency-up conversion effect by nonlinear thin plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical methods of sound absorption present fundamental limits that can be overcome by using nonlinear effects. Thin clamped plates have been identified as strongly nonlinear elements, capable of transferring the acoustic power of an incident air-borne wave towards higher frequencies. Here, we experimentally show that these plates exhibit different vibrational nonlinear behaviors depending on the amplitude and frequency of the excitation signal. The lowest excitation levels achieved lead to harmonic generation in a weakly nonlinear regime, while higher levels produce quasi-periodic and chaotic regimes. Since these nonlinear vibration regimes govern the acoustic frequency-up conversion process, we investigate the influence of relevant physical and geometrical parameters on the emergence of these nonlinear regimes. A parametric study on plates of different thicknesses reveals that the frequency-up conversion effect is mostly guided by the resonance of the plate at its first eigenfrequency, which depends not only on its thickness but also on a static tension introduced by the clamping. Finally, a design proposition involving multiple plates with different properties is presented in order to reach a broadband frequency-up conversion.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Quantum Analogs of Classical Impact Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of quantum analogs of classical impact oscillators to explore how complex nonlinear behaviors manifest in quantum systems. While classical impact oscillators exhibit chaos and bifurcations, quantum systems, governed by linear equations, appear to forbid such dynamics. Through simulations of unforced, forced, and dissipative quantum oscillators, we uncover quasiperiodicity, strange nonchaotic dynamics, and even chaos in the presence of dissipation. Using entropy time series, Fourier spectra, OTOCs, Lyapunov analysis, and the 0-1 test, we demonstrate that quantum systems can exhibit rich dynamical signatures analogous to classical nonlinear systems, bridging quantum mechanics and chaos theory.</description>

      <title>Photonic decision making using optical frequency difference detection in mutually-coupled semiconductor lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As electronic computing approaches its performance limits, photonic accelerators have emerged as promising alternatives. Photonic accelerators exploiting semiconductor-laser synchronization have been studied for decision-making. While conventional cross-correlation methods are computationally intensive and memory demanding, we propose a frequency-based approach using optical frequency differences. Simulations and experiments confirm that this method achieves decision making with reduced cost and memory requirements.</description>
