      <title>Higher-Dimensional Information Lattice: Quantum State Characterization through Inclusion-Exclusion Local Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the information lattice, originally defined for one-dimensional open-boundary chains, to characterize quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries. In one dimension, the information lattice provides a position- and scale-resolved decomposition of von Neumann information. Its generalization is nontrivial because overlapping subsystems can form loops, allowing multiple regions to encode the same information. This prevents information from being assigned uniquely to any one of them. We address this by introducing a higher-dimensional information lattice in which local information is defined through an inclusion-exclusion principle. The inclusion-exclusion local information is assigned to the lattice vertices, each labeled by subsystem position and scale. We implement this construction explicitly in two dimensions and apply it to a range of many-body ground states with distinct entanglement structures. Within this position- and scale-resolved framework, we extract information-based localization lengths, direction-dependent critical exponents, characteristic edge mode information, long-range information patterns due to topological order, and signatures of non-Abelian fusion channels. Our work establishes a general information-theoretic framework for isolating the universal scale-resolved features of quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries.</description>

      <title>Spin Splitter and Inverse Effects in Altermagnetic Hybrid Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07779v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical description of diffusive charge and spin transport in hybrid devices containing altermagnets. Based on recently derived drift--diffusion equations for coupled charge and spin dynamics and general boundary conditions, our approach provides a unified description of the spin-splitter effect, i.e., the conversion of charge currents into spin currents, and its inverse in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. We analyze, analytically and numerically, the spin-splitter effect, demonstrating that an injected spin accumulation generates a measurable voltage difference across the transverse direction in the altermagnet. Motivated by a recent experiment, we also analyze a nonlocal spin-valve geometry in which an altermagnetic strip injects spin into a diffusive normal metal. We derive the resulting nonlocal voltage detected by a ferromagnetic electrode as a function of the relative orientation of the N'eel vector and the ferromagnetic polarization, accounting for the main experimental findings. For this setup, we further address spin precession during diffusive transport by analyzing the spin Hanle effect. Our results provide theoretical explanations and predictions for several altermagnet hybrid structures.</description>

      <title>Topological Boundary Time Crystal Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary time crystals (BTCs) break time-translation symmetry and exhibit long-lived, robust oscillations insensitive to initial conditions. We show that collective spin BTCs can admit emergent topological winding numbers in operator space. Expanding the density operator in a spherical tensor basis, we map the Lindblad dynamics onto an effective local hopping problem, where collective degrees of freedom label sites of an emergent two-dimensional operator space lattice and identify topological obstructions that enforce the delocalization of operator modes on the lattice. The resulting spectral delocalization provides a natural explanation for the robust oscillatory dynamics observed in BTCs. When combined with non-reciprocal transport of operator weight across operator space, this mechanism moreover also leads to the universality of long-time dynamics across a broad class of initial states. Our results frame BTC dynamics as a form of topologically constrained operator space transport and suggest a close connection to non-Hermitian skin-effects.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to Adiabaticity via Adaptive Quantum Zeno Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum Zeno dynamics arising from monitoring a time-dependent projector. Starting from a stroboscopic measurement protocol, it is shown that the effective Hamiltonian for Zeno dynamics involves a nonadiabatic geometric connection that takes the form of the Kato-Avron Hamiltonian for parallel transport, stirring the evolution within the time-dependent Zeno subspace. The latter reduces to counterdiabatic driving when projective measurements are performed in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis of the quantum system. The effective Zeno Hamiltonian can also be derived in the context of continuous quantum measurements of a time-dependent observable and the non-Hermitian evolution with a complex absorbing potential varying in time. Our results thus provide a unified framework for realizing shortcuts to adiabaticity via adaptive quantum Zeno measurements.</description>

      <title>Efficient photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products with Pt1-xPdxSn4 Dirac Nodal Arc Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photochemical CO2 reduction reaction represents a zero-carbon pathway for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals, yet its industrial implementation has been constrained by low selectivity and product diversity. Dirac nodal arc semimetals characterized by ultrahigh carrier mobility with over 25000 cm2 V-1 s-1 offer a promising platform to search for efficient catalysts for CO2 conversion. Herein, we demonstrate that strategic Pt incorporation into PdSn4 optimizes the electronic structure and carrier dynamics of this Dirac semimetal. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the resulting Pd-Sn-Pt local electronic structure redistributes charge density around Pd and Pt atoms, which facilitates C-C coupling via *OC-COH and *OC-CHOH intermediates and enhances carrier mobility by 40% versus the pristine PdSn4 single crystal. The optimized Pd0.4Pt0.6Sn4 single crystal achieves C2H4 with formation rate of 0.000328 mol g-1 h-1, product selectivity of 73.1% and electron-based selectivity of 89%. This work establishes electronic-structure-tunable Dirac semimetals as a new paradigm for multi-carbon photochemical CO2 reduction, providing a design strategy for next-generation photocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Band-Gap Renormalization in Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, by femtosecond time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that photoinduced interlayer charge transfer in a heterostructure consisting of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene and a single atomic layer of silver on 6H-SiC(0001) transiently modulates the intrinsic potential landscape across the silver-graphene interface. This acts as an ultrafast optoelectronic gate that drives momentum-dependent band renormalizations, resulting in a transient band-gap opening on femtosecond timescales. Simultaneously, the photogenerated hot-carrier population enhances electronic screening, leading to subsequent closing of the band-gap beyond the thermal equilibrium value. These findings reveal two different mechanisms for photoinduced, reversible control of the electronic band structure in bilayer graphene -- interlayer charge transfer and hot-carrier-enhanced screening -- providing a general framework for the ultrafast control of electronic properties in graphene-based heterostructures. This opens up novel pathways for the realization of ultrafast optoelectronic devices and the exploration of correlated quantum phases in bilayer graphene under non-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Correlated phases of moat-band excitons in two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems of interacting excitons with a moat dispersion, for which the ground-state energy manifold presents a ring of discrete or continuously degenerate minima around a single point in momentum space. At low densities and for an idealized, perfectly degenerate moat, we show that the excitons undergo statistical transmutation and stabilize a chiral spin liquid. At higher densities, the moat dispersion favors Bose-Einstein condensation into states occupying multiple momenta, leading to inhomogeneous condensate phases and potentially supersolidity. We discuss the impact of band-structure warping present in realistic systems and argue that it generically stabilizes Bose-condensed phases over the chiral spin liquid, and analyze the superfluid response of the former which is unconventional due to the moat band. We also demonstrate that a proper renormalization of the exciton-exciton interaction is essential for describing these phases, and show that even purely repulsive interactions can favor inhomogeneous condensates. To further explore inhomogeneous condensate phases, we employ a Gross-Pitaevskii framework with a pseudopotential approximation and map out the resulting phase diagram. We show that the presence of degenerate dispersion minima can drive supersolidity already at weak coupling, in contrast to systems with a standard parabolic dispersion. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of real excitonic systems and argue that moat-band-induced supersolidity can be within experimental reach for realistic values of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of AC sensors based on Floquet time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of general Floquet time crystals (FTCs), including prethermal ones, in closed systems acting as AC sensors. We provide an analytical treatment of their quantum Fisher information (QFI) dynamics, which characterizes the ultimate sensor accuracy. By tuning the direction and frequency of the AC field, we show how to induce transitions resonantly between macroscopic paired cat states in the FTC sensor. This allows for robust Heisenberg scaling precision (QFI $\sim N^2 t^2$) for exponentially long times in the system size. The QFI dynamics exhibit, moreover, a characteristic step-like structure in time due to the eventual dephasing along the cat subspaces. The behavior is discussed for various initial sensor preparations, including ground states and low- and high-correlated states. Furthermore, we examine the performance of the sensor along the FTC phase transition, with the QFI capturing its critical exponents. Our findings are presented for both linear and nonlinear response regimes and illustrated for a specific FTC based on the long-range interacting LMG model.</description>
