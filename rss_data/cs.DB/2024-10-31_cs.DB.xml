      <title>Efficient Learned Query Execution over Text and Tables [Technical Report]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present ELEET, a novel execution engine that allows one to seamlessly query and process text as a first-class citizen along with tables. To enable such a seamless integration of text and tables, ELEET leverages learned multi-modal operators (MMOps) such as joins and unions that seamlessly combine structured with unstructured textual data. While large language models (LLM) such as GPT-4 are interesting candidates to enable such learned multimodal operations, we deliberately do not follow this trend to enable MMOps, since it would result in high overhead at query runtime. Instead, to enable MMOps, ELEET comes with a more efficient small language model (SLM) that is targeted to extract structured data from text. Thanks to our novel architecture and pre-training procedure, the ELEET-model enables high-accuracy extraction with low overheads. In our evaluation, we compare query execution based on ELEET to baselines leveraging LLMs such as GPT-4 and show that ELEET can speed up multi-modal queries over tables and text by up to 575x without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graph Based Visual Search Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FAIR data principles advocate for making scientific and research datasets 'Findable' and 'Accessible'. Yet, the sheer volume and diversity of these datasets present significant challenges. Despite advancements in data search technologies, techniques for representing search results are still traditional and inadequate, often returning extraneous results. To address these issues, we developed a knowledge graph based visual search application designed to enhance data search for Earth System Scientists. This application utilizes various chart widgets and a knowledge graph at the backend, connecting two disparate data repositories.</description>

      <title>Scalable Sampling for High Utility Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering valuable insights from data through meaningful associations is a crucial task. However, it becomes challenging when trying to identify representative patterns in quantitative databases, especially with large datasets, as enumeration-based strategies struggle due to the vast search space involved. To tackle this challenge, output space sampling methods have emerged as a promising solution thanks to its ability to discover valuable patterns with reduced computational overhead. However, existing sampling methods often encounter limitations when dealing with large quantitative database, resulting in scalability-related challenges. In this work, we propose a novel high utility pattern sampling algorithm and its on-disk version both designed for large quantitative databases based on two original theorems. Our approach ensures both the interactivity required for user-centered methods and strong statistical guarantees through random sampling. Thanks to our method, users can instantly discover relevant and representative utility pattern, facilitating efficient exploration of the database within seconds. To demonstrate the interest of our approach, we present a compelling use case involving archaeological knowledge graph sub-profiles discovery. Experiments on semantic and none-semantic quantitative databases show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the art methods.</description>
