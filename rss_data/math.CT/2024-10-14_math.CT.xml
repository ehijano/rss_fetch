      <title>The characterization for the sobriety of $L$-convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a commutative integral quantale $L$ as the truth value table, this study focuses on the characterizations of the sobriety of stratified $L$-convex spaces, as introduced by Liu and Yue in 2024. It is shown that a stratified sober $L$-convex space $Y$ is a sobrification of a stratified $L$-convex space $X$ if and only if there exists a quasihomeomorphism from $X$ to $Y$; a stratified $L$-convex space is sober if and only if it is a strictly injective object in the category of stratified $S_0$ $L$-convex spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Monoidal Algebra: Axiomatising Distance with String Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Symmetric) monoidal theories encapsulate presentations by generators and equations for (symmetric) monoidal categories. Terms of a monoidal theory are typically represented pictorially using string diagrams. In this work we introduce and study a quantitative version of monoidal theories, where instead of equality one may reason more abstractly about distance between string diagrams. This is in analogy with quantitative algebraic theories by Mardare et al., but developed in a monoidal rather than cartesian setting. Our framework paves the way for a quantitative analysis of string diagrammatic calculi for resource-sensitive processes, as found e.g. in quantum theory, machine learning, cryptography, and digital circuit theory.</description>

      <title>Effectful Mealy Machines: Bisimulation and Trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce effectful Mealy machines - a general notion of Mealy machine with global effects - and give them semantics in terms of both effectful bisimilarity and traces. Bisimilarity of effectful Mealy machines is characterised syntactically in terms of uniform feedback. Traces of effectful Mealy machines are given a novel semantic coinductive universe, in terms of effectful streams. We prove that effectful streams generalise a standard notion of causal process, capturing existing flavours of Mealy machine, bisimilarity, and trace.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model of Package Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper brings mathematical tools to bear on the study of package dependencies in software systems. We introduce structures known as Dependency Structures with Choice (DSC) that provide a mathematical account of such dependencies, inspired by the definition of general event structures in the study of concurrency. We equip DSCs with a particular notion of morphism and show that the category of DSCs is isomorphic to the category of antimatroids. We study the exactness properties of these equivalent categories, and show that they are finitely complete, have finite coproducts but not all coequalizers. Further, we construct a functor from a category of DSCs equipped with a certain subclass of morphisms to the opposite of the category of finite distributive lattices, making use of a simple finite characterization of the Bruns-Lakser completion, and finally, we introduce a formal account of versions of packages and introduce a mathematical account of package version-bound policies.</description>

      <title>How to Represent Non-Representable Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arrows of a category are elements of particular sets, the hom-sets. These sets are functorial, and their functoriality specifies how to compose the arrows with other arrows of the same category. In particular, it allows to form diagrams, making many abstract concepts graphically visible.
  Presheaves and set-valued functors, in general, are not representable, and so their elements are not arrows in the usual sense. They can however still be seen as "arrow-like structures", which can be post-composed but not pre-composed (for the case of set functors), or pre-composed but not post-composed (for the case of presheaves). Therefore, we can still represent their structure graphically.
  In this exposition we show how to draw and interpret these generalized diagrams, and how to use them to prove theorems. We will then study in detail, and represent graphically, a few concepts of category theory which are often considered hard to visualize: representability, weighted limits and colimits, and Cauchy completion (for unenriched categories).
  We also sketch how to interpret the more general case of profunctors, and the Day convolution of presheaves.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Auslander-Reiten duality and Morita theorem for singularity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Morita theorem to construct triangle equivalences between the singularity categories of (commutative and non-commutative) Gorenstein rings and the cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras over fields, and more strongly, quasi-equivalences between their canonical dg enhancements. More precisely, we prove that such an equivalence exists as soon as we find a quasi-equivalence between the graded dg singularity category of a Gorenstein ring and the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which can be done by finding a single tilting object.
  Our result is based on two key theorems on dg enhancements of cluster categories and of singularity categories, which are of independent interest. First we give a Morita-type theorem which realizes certain $\mathbb{Z}$-graded dg categories as dg orbit categories. Secondly, we show that the canonical dg enhancements of the singularity categories of symmetric orders have the bimodule Calabi-Yau property, which lifts the classical Auslander-Reiten duality on singularity categories.
  We apply our results to such classes of rings as Gorenstein rings of dimension at most $1$, quotient singularities, and Geigle-Lenzing complete intersections, including finite or infinite Grassmannian cluster categories, to realize their singularity categories as cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras.</description>
