      <title>Properties of plactic monoid centralizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let u be a word over the positive integers P. Motivated by a question involving crystal graphs, Sagan and Wilson initiated the study of the centralizer of u in the plactic monoid which is the set
  C(u) = {w | uw is Knuth equivalent to wu}.
  In particular, they conjectured the following stability phenomenon: for any u there is a positive integer K depending only on u such that C(u^k) = C(u^K) for k &gt;= K. We prove that this property holds for various u including words consisting of only ones and twos, as well as permutations. Sagan and Wilson also considered c_{n,m}(u) which is the number of w in C(u) of length n and maximum at most m. They showed that c_{n,m}(1) is a polynomial in m of degree n-1 and conjectured properties of the coefficients when it is expanded in a binomial coefficient basis. We prove some of these conjectures, for example, that the coefficients are always nonnegative integers.</description>

      <title>Localized Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa Property for Subdivisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $H$, we say that $H$ has the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for subdivisions with function $f$, if for every graph $G$, either $G$ contains (as a subgraph) $k+1$ pairwise disjoint subdivisions of $H$ or there exists a set $X\subseteq G$ such that $G\setminus X$ contains no $H$-subdivision and $|X|\leq f(k)$. We show that every $H$ that has the \EP property for subdivision also satisfies a localized version of the \EP property, as follows. Let $H$ be an $n$-vertex graph with $m\geq 1$ edges that has the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for subdivisions with function $f$, and let $G$ be a graph that does not contain $k+1$ disjoint subdivisions of $H$. We demonstrate the existence of a set of at most $k$ vertex disjoint subdivisions of $H$ in $G$ such that in their union, we can find a set $X$ with the property that $G \setminus X$ contains no $H$-subdivision and $|X| \leq 2^{f(k)}mk +k(m-n)$.</description>

Abstract: We study the $g$-fan associated with a skew-symmetrizable matrix in the sense of cluster algebras. We show that a skew-symmetrizable matrix is of finite type if and only if its $g$-fan is complete; equivalently (as we show), its support contains all lattice points.</description>

      <title>On the size edge-ordered Ramsey numbers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For edge-ordered graphs $G^{\prec}$ and $H^{\prec}$, the size edge-ordered Ramsey number $\hat{r}_{\text{edge}}(G^{\prec}, H^{\prec})$ is defined as the smallest integer $m$ for which there exists an edge-ordered graph $F^{\prec}$ (with underlying graph $F$) having $m$ edges, such that every $2$-coloring of the edges of $F^{\prec}$ contains a monochromatic edge-ordered subgraph isomorphic to $G^{\prec}$ or a monochromatic edge-ordered subgraph isomorphic to $H^{\prec}$. Fox and Li posed a foundational question: which families of edge-ordered graphs have linear or near-linear size edge-ordered Ramsey numbers? In this paper, we apply Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma to prove that, even for sparse graph families, specifically the well-defined class of edge-ordered book graphs, the size edge-ordered Ramsey numbers of this family exhibit non-linear growth. Furthermore, we show that three families of edge-ordered graphs exhibit linear or near-linear size edge-ordered Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of these notes is to introduce some of the problems the enumeration of lattice walks is dedicated to and familiarize with some of the arguments they can be addressed with. We will discuss the enumeration of lattice walks, their generating functions, and the functional equations they satisfy. We will focus on algebraic methods for manipulating and solving these equations. Elementary power series algebra will play a prominent role, computer algebra too, but we will repeatedly digress and present ideas and methods of different kind whenever it seems appropriate. The exposition is organized around the most simple yet non-trivial problem in the enumeration of lattice walks. The intention is to illustrate different techniques without getting technical.</description>

      <title>On Shellability of 3-Cut Complexes of Hexagonal Grid Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-cut complex was recently introduced by Bayer et al. as a generalization of earlier work of Fr{\"o}berg (1990) and Eagon and Reiner (1998), and was shown to be shellable for several classes of graphs. In this article, we prove that the $3$-cut complexes of the hexagonal grid graphs $H_{1 \times m \times n}$ are shellable for all $m,n \geq 1$, by constructing an explicit shelling order using reverse lexicographic ordering. From this shelling, we determine the number of spanning facets, denoted by $\psi_{m,n}$, and deduce that the complex is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of $\psi_{m,n}$ spheres of dimension $\left( 2m + 2n + 2mn - 4 \right)$, where $$\psi_{m,n} = \binom{2m+2n+2mn-1}{2} - \left[ \left( 6m+2 \right) n + (2m-4) \right].$$
  While these topological properties can be obtained from general results of Bayer et al., we provide an explicit combinatorial construction of a shelling order, yielding a direct counting formula for the number of spheres in the wedge sum decomposition.</description>

      <title>Littlewood-Offord bounds on the symmetric groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anti-concentration phenomenon in probability theory has been intensively studied in recent years, with applications across many areas of mathematics. In most existing works, the ambient probability space is a product space generated by independent random variables. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of anti-concentration when the ambient space is the symmetric group, equipped with the uniform measure. Concretely, we focus on the random sum $S_{\pi} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i\, v_{\pi(i)}$, where $w=(w_1,\dots,w_n)$ and $v=(v_1,\dots,v_n)$ are fixed vectors and $\pi$ is a uniformly random permutation.
  The paper contains several new results, addressing both discrete and continuous anti-concentration phenomena. On the discrete side, we establish a near-optimal structural characterization of the vectors $w$ and $v$ under the assumption that the concentration probability $\sup_x P(S_{\pi}=x)$ is polynomially large. As applications, we derive and strengthen a number of previous results. In particular, we show that if both $w$ and $v$ have distinct entries, then $\sup_x P(S_{\pi}=x) \le n^{-5/2+o(1)}$. This bound serves as a permutation-space analogue of the classical Erd\H{o}s--Moser bound in the product-space setting and answers a question posed by Alon--Pohoata--Zhu.
  From the continuous perspective, we study the small-ball event $|S_{\pi}-L|\le \delta$. We establish sharp bounds in various settings, including results exhibiting sub-gaussian decay in $L$. With additional effort, we are also able to treat the joint distribution of these events. Moreover, we provide a characterization of the vectors $w$ and $v$ for which these small-ball probabilities are large. As an application, we prove that the number of extremal points of random permutation polynomials is bounded by $O(\log n)$, extending results of S{\"o}ze on the number of real roots.</description>

      <title>Computing the 4D Geode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The closed form for the hyper-Catalan number C[m2,m3,m4,...], which counts the number of subdivisions of a roofed polygon into m2 triangles, m3 quadrilaterals, m4 pentagons, etc., has been known since 1940. In 2025, Wildberger and Rubine showed its generating series S[t2,t3,t4,...] is a zero of the general geometric univariate polynomial. They note the factorization S=(t2 + t3 + t4 + ...)G, where the factor G is called the Geode. Later in 2025, Amderberhan, Kauers and Zeilberger issued a challenge to compute G[1000,1000,1000,1000], the coefficient of $t_2^{1000}t_3^{1000}t_4^{1000}t_5^{1000}$ in G. The reward is a donation to OEIS. We describe the computation, give the value and claim the reward.</description>

      <title>Chromatic numbers from edge ideals: Graph classes with vanishing syzygies are polynomially $\chi$-bounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic number $\chi$ of a graph is bounded from below by its clique number $\omega,$ but it can be arbitrary large. Perfect graphs are defined by $\chi=\omega$ for all induced subgraphs. An interesting relaxation are $\chi$-bounded graph classes, where $\chi\leq f(\omega).$ It is not always possible to achieve this with a polynomial $f.$
  The edge ideal $I_G$ of a graph $G$ is generated by monomials $x_ux_v$ for each edge $uv$ of $G.$ The bi-graded betti numbers $\beta_{i,j}(I)$ are central algebraic geometric invariants. We study the graph classes where for some fixed $i,j$ that syzygy vanishes, that is, $\beta_{i,j}(I_G)=0.$
  We prove that $\chi\leq f(\omega),$ where $f$ is a polynomial of degree $2j-2i-4.$ For the elementary special case $\beta_{i,2i+2}(I_G)=0,$ this amounts to that $(i+1)K_2$-free graphs are ${\omega-1+2i \choose 2i}$-colorable, improving on an old combinatorial result by Wagon. We also show that triangle-free graphs with $\beta_{i,j}(I_G)=0$ are $(j-1)$-colorable.
  Complexity wise, we show that these colorings can be derived in time $O(n^3)$ for graphs on $n$ vertices. Moreover, we show that for almost all graphs with parabolic $i,j,$ there are better bounds on $\chi.$</description>

      <title>The trinacria graphs $T_{(b+2)b2}$ are $e$-positive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify a new family of $e$-positive graphs, called the trinacria graphs $T_{(b+2)b2}$, thereby providing a partial answer to Stanley's question on which graphs are $e$-positive. The trinacria graph $T_{abc}$ is the graph on $a+b+c+3$ vertices obtained by attaching paths $P_a$, $P_b$ and~$P_c$ to the vertices of a triangle, respectively. Our proof relies on several ad hoc combinatorial ideas, and employs divide-and-conquer techniques, charging arguments, and progressive repair methods.</description>

      <title>Benign Nonconvexity of Synchronization Landscape Induced by Graph Skeletons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous Kuramoto model on a graph and study the geometry of its associated nonconvex energy landscape. This problem admits a dual interpretation. On the one hand, it can be viewed as a geometric optimization problem, seeking configurations of phases that minimize the energy function $E(\boldsymbol{\theta}):=-\sum_{1\leq i,j\neq n}A_{ij}\cos(\theta_i-\theta_j)$. On the other hand, the same function serves as the potential governing the dynamics of the classical homogeneous Kuramoto model. A central question is to identify which graphs induce a benign energy landscape, in the sense that every second-order stationary point is a global minimizer, corresponding to the fully synchronized state. In this case, the graph is said to be globally synchronizing. Most existing results establish global synchronization by relating a given graph to the complete graph, which is known to be globally synchronizing, and by showing that graphs sufficiently close to it inherit this property. In contrast, we uncover a fundamentally different mechanism: global synchronization, despite being a collective phenomenon, unfolds on these graphs through a sequential process of local synchronization that propagates along their structural skeletons. Our approach is based on a detailed analysis of the phasor geometry at second-order stationary points of the nonconvex energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Completing the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding triples of relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inversion sequence of length $n$ is an integer sequence $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ such that $0 \le a_i &lt; i$ for all $i$. The study of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences was initiated in 2015 by Mansour and Shattuck and in 2016 by Corteel, Martinez, Savage and Weselcouch. Martinez and Savage later defined a new type of pattern, a triple of binary relations, of which there are currently 14 uncounted avoidance classes. We complete the enumeration for all of these classes using generating tree methods "growing on the left" and "growing on the right". For many of these classes we are able to find algebraic generating functions. We also discuss the asymptotic behaviour of the counting sequences.</description>

      <title>An alternative characterisation of graphs quasi-isometric to graphs of bounded treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-isometry is a measure of how similar two graphs are at `large-scale'. Nguyen, Scott, and Seymour [arXiv:2501.09839] and Hickingbotham [arXiv:2501.10840] independently gave a characterisation of graphs quasi-isometric to graphs of treewidth $k$. In this paper, we give a new characterisation of such graphs. Specifically, we show that such graphs $G$ are characterised by the existence of a partition whose quotient has treewidth at most $k$ and such that each part has bounded weak diameter in $G$. The primary contribution of our characterisation is a structural description of graphs that admit such a quasi-isometry. This differs from the characterisation mentioned above, which primarily shows the existence of such a quasi-isometry. The characterisations are complementary, and neither immediately implies the other.</description>

      <title>Acyclic subgraphs of digraphs with high chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a digraph $G$, let $f(G)$ be the maximum chromatic number of an acyclic subgraph of $G$. For an $n$-vertex digraph $G$ it is proved that $f(G) \ge n^{5/9-o(1)}s^{-14/9}$ where $s$ is the bipartite independence number of $G$, i.e., the largest $s$ for which there are two disjoint $s$-sets of vertices with no edge between them. This generalizes a result of Fox, Kwan and Sudakov, who proved this for the case $s=0$ (i.e., tournaments and semicomplete digraphs). Consequently, if $s=n^{o(1)}$, then $f(G) \ge n^{5/9-o(1)}$ which polynomially improves the folklore bound $f(G) \ge n^{1/2-o(1)}$. As a corollary, with high probability, all orientations of the random $n$-vertex graph with edge probability $p=n^{-o(1)}$ (in particular, constant $p$, hence almost all $n$-vertex graphs) satisfy $f(G) \ge n^{5/9-o(1)}$. Our proof uses a theorem of Gallai and Milgram that together with several additional ideas, essentially reduces to the proof of Fox, Kwan and Sudakov.</description>

      <title>On distance transitive graphs and $4$-geodesic transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an integer $s\geq1$ and a graph $\Gamma$, a path $(u_0, u_1, \ldots, u_{s})$ composed of vertices of $\Gamma$ is called an {\em $s$-geodesic} if it is a shortest path between $u_0$ and $u_s$. We say that $\Gamma$ is {\em $s$-geodesic transitive} if for each $i\leq s$, $\Gamma$ contains at least one $i$-geodesic, and its automorphism group acts transitively on the set of all $i$-geodesics. In this paper, by using the classification of almost simple primitive groups of rank $4$, we first classify all distance transitive graphs of diameter $3$. The resulting classification encompasses $73$ classes of graphs. As an application of this result, we have extended the main result of Jin and Tan [J. Algebra Combin. 60 (2024) 949--963]. More precisely, for a connected $(G,4)$-geodesic transitive graph with a nontrivial intransitive normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ that has at least $3$ orbits, where $G$ is an automorphism group of $\Gamma$, it is shown that either both $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_N$ are known, or $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_N$ have the same girth and $\Gamma_N$ is $(G/N,4)$-geodesic transitive.</description>

      <title>On the Density of Self-identifying Codes in $K_m \times P_n$ and $K_m \times C_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic density of self-identifying codes in the direct product graphs $K_m \times P_n$ and $K_m \times C_n$ (the direct product of complete graphs with paths and cycles). A self-identifying code is a dominating set $S$ where each vertex $u$ (in $G$) is uniquely determined by the intersection $\bigcap_{c \in N[u] \cap S} N[c]$. Let $\gamma^{\rm SID}(G)$ denote its minimum size. For these product graphs, we establish new lower and upper bounds on $\gamma^{\rm SID}$. Crucially, from these bounds we prove that the asymptotic density $\gamma^{\rm SID}(G) / |V(G)|$ of a smallest self-identifying code converges to 1/3 for both families of graphs. This value matches the known asymptotic density of standard identifying codes in the same graphs, as established by Shinde and Waphare. Our result therefore shows that the stronger self-identifying constraint does not necessitate a higher density of vertices in this product setting.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial characterzations of $T$-designs in the nonbinary Johnson scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $T$-designs in the nonbinary Johnson scheme. This scheme generalizes both the Johnson and Hamming schemes and admits a bivariate $Q$-polynomial structure. Zhu (2021) provided a combinatorial characterization of $T$-designs in this scheme for certain index sets $T$, using a relationship between $T$-designs in the nonbinary Johnson scheme and relative designs in the nonbinary Hamming scheme. In this paper, we obtain a characterization that applies to a strictly larger class of index sets $T$, based on a methodological extension of Delsarte's original framework (1973). This new characterization naturally recovers classical block designs and orthogonal arrays as special cases. To describe these designs uniformly, we introduce $(r,s)$-designs, a new family of combinatorial objects that arise naturally from our characterization. We also derive absolute lower bounds on the cardinality of $(r,s)$-designs from the multiplicities of the primitive idempotents of the nonbinary Johnson scheme, and construct examples with index $\lambda=1$ that attain certain natural lower bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a complete description of the minimal primes of ideals generated by adjacent $2$-minors, in terms of the so-called admissible sets and associated lattice ideals. We prove that for these ideals, the properties of being unmixed, Cohen-Macaulay, level, Gorenstein, and complete intersection are equivalent. Moreover, we give a combinatorial characterization of all convex collections of cells satisfying any of these equivalent properties. Finally, we study the radicality of these ideals and derive necessary combinatorial conditions based on minimal non-radical configurations.</description>

Abstract: We characterize connected tetravalent graphs $\Gamma$ which admit groups $M&lt;H$ of automorphisms such that $\Gamma$ is $M$-half-arc-transitive and $H$-arc-transitive. Examples for each case are constructed, including a counter-example to a question asked by A. R.

      <title>Fano compactifications of mutation algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the notion of mutation semigroup algebras. This concept simultaneously generalizes cluster algebras and semigroup algebras. We show that, under some mild conditions on the singularities, the spectrum $U={\rm Spec}(R)$ of a mutation semigroup algebra $R$ admits a log Fano compactification $U\hookrightarrow X$. The compactification $X$ can be chosen to be a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial log Fano variety whenever $U$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial. Furthermore, we prove that a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt Fano variety $X$ is of cluster type if and only if its Cox ring ${\rm Cox}(X)$ is a ${\rm Cl}(X)$-graded mutation semigroup algebra. In order to enlighten the previous theorems, we provide several explicit examples motivated by birational geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics.</description>

      <title>First-Order Logic and Twin-Width for Some Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For some geometric graph classes, tractability of testing first-order formulas is precisely characterised by the graph parameter twin-width. This was first proved for interval graphs among others in [BCKKLT, IPEC '22], where the equivalence is called delineation, and more generally holds for circle graphs, rooted directed path graphs, and $H$-graphs when $H$ is a forest. Delineation is based on the key idea that geometric graphs often admit natural vertex orderings, allowing to use the very rich theory of twin-width for ordered graphs.
  Answering two questions raised in their work, we prove that delineation holds for intersection graphs of non-degenerate axis-parallel unit segment graphs, but fails for visibility graphs of 1.5D terrains. We also prove delineation for intersection graphs of circular arcs.</description>

Abstract: The generalized Markoff mod $p$ graph is defined via the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=xyz+\kappa$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ of prime order $p$. In this paper, we investigate the topological properties of the graph such as non-planarity, surface embeddability, and the existence of short cycles. Our approach is based on a systematic construction of $K_{3,3}$-subdivisions, integrating techniques from graph theory, computer algebra, and number theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of post-Hopf algebroids, generalizing the pre-Hopf algebroids introduced in [Bronasco, Laurent, 2025] in the study of exotic aromatic S-series. We construct action post-Hopf algebroids through actions of post-Hopf algebras. We show that the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie-Rinehart algebra (post-Lie algebroid) is naturally a post-Hopf algebroid. As a byproduct, we construct the free post-Lie-Rinehart algebra using a magma algebra with a linear map to the derivation Lie algebra of a commutative associative algebra. Applications in geometric numerical integration on manifolds are given.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Random Walks in the Quarter Plane and Periodic $4$-bar Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve two long standing open problems, one from probability theory formulated by Malyshev in 1970 and another one from a crossroad of geometry and dynamics, going back to Darboux in 1879. The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with a finite group of the random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\ge 2$, in the generic case where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$ and were obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. We also consider situations with singular biquadratics. Further, we establish a new two-way relationship between \emph{diagonal} random walks in the quarter plane and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar link problems for all $n\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem, that he solved for $n=2$. We introduce \emph{$k$ semi-periodicity} as a novel and natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing new objects, \emph{the secondary $(2-2)$-correspondence} and the related \emph{secondary cubic} of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form.</description>

Abstract: We study a model of random weighted uniform spanning trees on the complete graph with $n$ vertices, where each edge is assigned a weight of $n^{1+\gamma}$ with probability $1/n$ and $1$ otherwise. Whenever $\gamma$ is large enough, we prove that the diameter of the resulting tree is typically of order $n^{1/3} \log n$, up to a $\log \log n$ correction. Our approach uses estimates on repeat times for selecting components in a critical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph, as well as concentration bounds on the sums of diameters of these components.</description>

      <title>Generalized binomial edge ideals are Cartwright-Sturmfels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binomial edge ideals associated to a simple graph G were introduced by Herzog and collaborators and, independently, by Ohtani. They became an ``instant classic" in combinatorial commutative algebra with more than 100 papers devoted to their investigation over the past 15 years. They exhibit many striking properties, including being radical and, moreover, Cartwright-Sturmfels. Using the fact that binomial edge ideals can be seen as ideals of 2-minors of a matrix of variables with two rows, generalized binomial edge ideals of 2-minors of matrices of m rows were introduced by Rauh and proved to be radical. The goal of this paper is to prove that generalized binomial edge ideals are Cartwright-Sturmfels. On the way we provide results on ideal constructions preserving the Cartwright-Sturmfels property. We also give examples and counterexamples to the Cartwright-Sturmfels property for higher minors.</description>

Abstract: Let $v(k)$ be the smallest integer larger than $1$ that does not occur among the denominators in any identity of the form $$ 1=\frac1{n_1}+\cdots+\frac1{n_k}, $$ where $1 \le n_1&lt;\cdots&lt;n_k$ are pairwise distinct integers. In their 1980 monograph, Erd\H{o}s and Graham asked for quantitative estimates on the growth of $v(k)$ and suggested the lower bound $v(k)\gg k!$. In this paper we give the first known improvement and show that there exists an absolute constant $c&gt;0$ such that the inequality $$ v(k)\ge e^{c k^2} $$ holds for all positive integers $k$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new family of higher-rank graphs, whose construction was inspired by the graphical techniques of Lambek \cite{Lambek} and Johnstone \cite{Johnstone} used for monoid and category emedding results. We show that they are planar $k$-trees for $2 \le k \le 4$. We also show that higher-rank trees differ from $1$-trees by giving examples of higher-rank trees having properties which are impossible for $1$-trees. Finally, we collect more examples of higher-rank planar trees which are not in our family.</description>

      <title>Topology of independence complexes and cycle structure of hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Zhang and Wu proved a conjecture of Kalai and Meshulam, showing that for every graph $G$ without induced cycles of length divisible by $3$, the sum of all reduced Betti numbers of its independence complex $I(G)$ is at most $1$. We extend this result to the hypergraph setting. Namely, we show that the same conclusion holds for any hypergraph $H$ that does not contain a Berge cycle of length divisible by $3$. This establishes a broader connection between forbidden cycle structures and the topological simplicity of independence complexes. As a key tool, we introduce a hypergraph analogue of Barmak's star cluster theorem for graphs. This new theorem implies, in particular, that if a hypergraph $H$ has a vertex $v$ that is not isolated and is not contained in an induced Berge cycle of length $3$, then there exists a hypergraph $H'$ with fewer vertices than $H$ such that the independence complex of $H$ is homotopy equivalent to the suspension of the independence complex of $H'$.</description>

Abstract: Using graphs with clusters, we provide a unified approach for constructing graphs with pair state transfer-relative to the adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian matrix-between the same pair of states at the same time, despite being non-regular. We show that for each $k\geq 5$, there are infinitely many connected graphs with maximum valency $k$ admitting this property. This framework also aids in establishing sufficient conditions for pair state transfer in edge-perturbed graphs, including complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we utilize graph products to generate new infinite families of graphs with the above property.</description>

      <title>Pushing Cops and Robber on Graphs of Maximum Degree 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \textsc{Cops and Robber} is a game played on graphs where a set of \textit{cops} aim to \textit{capture} the position of a single \textit{robber}. The main parameter of interest in this game is the \textit{cop number}, which is the minimum number of cops that are sufficient to guarantee the capture of the robber.
  In a directed graph $\overrightarrow{G}$, the \textit{push} operation on a vertex $v$ reverses the orientation of all arcs incident on $v$. We consider a variation of classical \textsc{Cops and Robber} on oriented graphs, where in its turn, each cop can either move to an out-neighbor of its current vertex or push some vertex of the graph, whereas, the robber can move to an adjacent vertex in its turn. [Das et al., CALDAM, 2023] introduced this variant and established that if $\overrightarrow{G}$ is an orientation of a subcubic graph, then one cop with push ability has a winning strategy. We extend these results to establish that if $\overrightarrow{G}$ is an orientation of a $3$-degenerate graph, or of a graph with maximum degree $4$, then one cop with push ability has a winning strategy.</description>

      <title>Congruences Modulo Powers of 7 for the Reciprocal Crank Parity Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amdeberhan and Merca recently studied arithmetic properties of the sequence $a(n)$, the reciprocal of the crank parity function, which counts the number of integer partitions of weight $n$ whose even parts are monochromatic and whose odd parts may appear in one of three colors (OEIS A298311). A key result of their work was the congruence $a(7n + 2) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ for all $n \geq 0$. We prove new congruences for the reciprocal crank parity function modulo powers of $7$.</description>

      <title>A Short Note on Disjointness Conditions for Triples of Group Subsets Satisfying the Triple Product Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3671</link>
      <description>arXiv:0908.3671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract:   We deduce some elementary pairwise disjointness and semi-disjointness conditions on triples of subsets in arbitrary groups satisfying the so-called triple product property (TPP) as originally defined by H. Cohn and C. Umans in 2003. This property TPP for a triple of group subsets, called a TPP triple, allows the group to "realize" matrix multiplication of dimensions the sizes of the subsets, with the subsets acting as indexing sets for input matrices which are embedded into the regular algebra of the group. We derive nine different disjointness casetypes for an arbitrary TPP triple, and classify these into four different disjointness classes based on an integer measure of the degree of pairwise disjointness among the subsets. Finally, we derive lower and upper bounds for the sum of sizes of the subsets forming a TPP triple, which is the additive equivalent of the multiplicative bounds originally derived by Cohn and Umans for the product of sizes of subsets forming a TPP triple.</description>

      <title>The dual approach to the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual presentations of Coxeter groups have recently led to breakthroughs in our understanding of affine Artin groups. In particular, they led to the proof of the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture and to the solution of the word problem. Will the "dual approach" extend to more general classes of Coxeter and Artin groups? In this paper, we describe the techniques used to prove the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for affine Artin groups and we ask a series of questions that are mostly open beyond the spherical and affine cases.</description>

      <title>Matroid Intersection under Minimum Rank Oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the tractability of the matroid intersection problem under the minimum rank oracle. In this model, we are given an oracle that takes as its input a set of elements and returns as its output the minimum of the ranks of the given set in the two matroids. For the unweighted matroid intersection problem, we show how to construct a necessary part of the exchangeability graph, which enables us to emulate the standard augmenting path algorithm. For the weighted problem, the tractability is open in general. Nevertheless, we describe several special cases where tractability can be achieved, and we discuss potential approaches and the challenges encountered.
  On the positive side, we present a solution for the case where no circuit of one matroid is contained within a circuit of the other. Additionally, we propose a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the maximum size of a circuit of one matroid. We also show that a lexicographically maximal common independent set can be found by the same approach, which leads to a nontrivial approximation ratio for finding a maximum-weight common independent set. On the negative side, we prove that the approach employed for the tractable cases above involves an NP-hard problem in the general case. We also show that if we consider the generalization to polymatroid intersection, even the unweighted problem is hard under the minimum rank oracle.</description>

      <title>Spectral selections, commutativity preservation and Coxeter-Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system whose graph is connected, with no infinite edges. A self-map $\tau$ of $W$ such that $\tau_{\sigma\theta}\in \{\tau_{\theta},\ \sigma\tau_{\theta}\}$ for all $\theta\in W$ and all reflections $\sigma$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $\sigma$ range over smaller, $\theta$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$.</description>
