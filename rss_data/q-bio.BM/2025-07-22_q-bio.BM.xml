      <title>All-atom inverse protein folding through discrete flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent breakthrough of AlphaFold3 in modeling complex biomolecular interactions, including those between proteins and ligands, nucleotides, or metal ions, creates new opportunities for protein design. In so-called inverse protein folding, the objective is to find a sequence of amino acids that adopts a target protein structure. Many inverse folding methods struggle to predict sequences for complexes that contain non-protein components, and perform poorly with complexes that adopt multiple structural states. To address these challenges, we present ADFLIP (All-atom Discrete FLow matching Inverse Protein folding), a generative model based on discrete flow-matching for designing protein sequences conditioned on all-atom structural contexts. ADFLIP progressively incorporates predicted amino acid side chains as structural context during sequence generation and enables the design of dynamic protein complexes through ensemble sampling across multiple structural states. Furthermore, ADFLIP implements training-free classifier guidance sampling, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary pre-trained models to optimise the designed sequence for desired protein properties. We evaluated the performance of ADFLIP on protein complexes with small-molecule ligands, nucleotides, or metal ions, including dynamic complexes for which structure ensembles were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-structure and multi-structure inverse folding tasks, demonstrating excellent potential for all-atom protein design. The code is available at https://github.com/ykiiiiii/ADFLIP.</description>

      <title>Computations Meet Experiments to Advance the Enzymatic Depolymerization of Plastics One Atom at a Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastics are essential to modern life, yet poor disposal practices contribute to low recycling rates and environmental accumulation-biological degradation and by-product reuse offer a path to mitigate this global threat. This report highlights key insights, future challenges, and research priorities identified during the CECAM workshop "Computations Meet Experiments to Advance the Enzymatic Depolymerization of Plastics One Atom at a Time", held in Trieste from May 6-8, 2025. The workshop brought together an interdisciplinary community of scientists focused on advancing the sustainable use of plastics through enzyme-based degradation. A key point from the discussions is that many bottlenecks in enzymatic recycling arise not only from process engineering challenges, but also from a limited understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. We argue that constraints on economic viability and sustainability (e.g., harsh solvents, high temperatures, substrate crystallinity, pretreatments) can-and should-be addressed directly through enzyme design, provided these factors are understood at the molecular level, in synergy with process optimization. For this, it is essential to rely on the integration of experimental and computational approaches to uncover the molecular and mechanistic basis of enzymatic plastic degradation. We highlight how the small-format structure of the workshop, in line with the usual CECAM format, fostered a collaborative, friendly, and relaxed atmosphere. We hope this report encourages future initiatives and the formation of shared consortia to support an open, collaborative, and bio-based plastic recycling community.</description>

      <title>Breaking the picomolar barrier in lateral flow assays using Bright-Dtech___ 614 -- Europium nanoparticles for enhanced sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) are among the most widely used rapid diagnostic tests for point-of-care screening of disease biomarkers. However, their limited sensitivity hinders their use in complex clinical applications that require accurate biomarker quantification for precise medicine. To address this limitation, we evaluated Bright-Dtech___-614 Europium nanoparticles to enhance LFIA assay sensitivity. These nanoparticles exhibited a luminescence quantum yield of 70 % and a 90 % conjugation efficacy with antibodies by direct adsorption. Considering these properties, we developed an LFIA to quantify human lactate dehydrogenase (h-LDH), a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer disease. The Bright-Dtech___-614 Eu nanoparticle-based assay achieved a detection limit of 38 pg mL -1 , representing a 686-fold, 15-fold, and 2.9-fold improvement in sensitivity over conventional LFIA platforms using gold (AuNPs), carbon nanoparticles, and standard ELISA, respectively. The assay exhibited strong accuracy, with a mean recovery rate of 108 $\pm$ 11 %, and demonstrated excellent reproducibility, as evidenced by inter-and intra-batch RSD values of 4.9 % and 9.7 %, respectively, when testing LDH-spiked serum samples. By substituting traditional gold nanoparticles with the Bright-Dtech___-614 Eu nanoparticles, we achieved detection limits in the femtomolar range, significantly broadening the applicability of LFIA for precision medicine.</description>

      <title>A million-scale dataset and generalizable foundation model for nanomaterial-protein interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlocking the potential of nanomaterials in medicine and environmental science hinges on understanding their interactions with proteins, a complex decision space where AI is poised to make a transformative impact. However, progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest nanomaterial-protein interaction dataset to date, comprising over 3.2 million samples and 37,000 unique proteins. Leveraging this, we present NanoProFormer, a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization, handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro applications.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Investigation of Vibrational Raman Spectra for Plant-Stress Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting stress in plants is crucial for both open-farm and controlled-environment agriculture. Biomolecules within plants serve as key stress indicators, offering vital markers for continuous health monitoring and early disease detection. Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful, non-invasive means to quantify these biomolecules through their molecular vibrational signatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized data-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and prior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases and inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation of Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated workflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches, DIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without manual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features in an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses, including abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic stressors (bacterial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational spectroscopy, DIVA paves the way for AI-driven plant health assessment, fostering more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.</description>

      <title>JAMUN: Bridging Smoothed Molecular Dynamics and Score-Based Learning for Conformational Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both for understanding protein function and drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles such as molecular dynamics (MD) are computationally inefficient, while many recent machine learning methods do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We propose JAMUN which performs MD in a smoothed, noised space of all-atom 3D conformations of molecules by utilizing the framework of walk-jump sampling. JAMUN enables ensemble generation for small peptides at rates of an order of magnitude faster than traditional molecular dynamics. The physical priors in JAMUN enables transferability to systems outside of its training data, even to peptides that are longer than those originally trained on. Our model, code and weights are available at https://github.com/prescient-design/jamun.</description>
