      <title>Reinforcement learning Based Automated Design of Differential Evolution Algorithm for Black-box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential evolution (DE) algorithm is recognized as one of the most effective evolutionary algorithms, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in black-box optimization due to its derivative-free nature. Numerous enhancements to the fundamental DE have been proposed, incorporating innovative mutation strategies and sophisticated parameter tuning techniques to improve performance. However, no single variant has proven universally superior across all problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that employs reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically design DE for black-box optimization through meta-learning. RL acts as an advanced meta-optimizer, generating a customized DE configuration that includes an optimal initialization strategy, update rule, and hyperparameters tailored to a specific black-box optimization problem. This process is informed by a detailed analysis of the problem characteristics. In this proof-of-concept study, we utilize a double deep Q-network for implementation, considering a subset of 40 possible strategy combinations and parameter optimizations simultaneously. The framework's performance is evaluated against black-box optimization benchmarks and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results highlight the promising potential of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>TOFFE -- Temporally-binned Object Flow from Events for High-speed and Energy-Efficient Object Detection and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection and tracking is an essential perception task for enabling fully autonomous navigation in robotic systems. Edge robot systems such as small drones need to execute complex maneuvers at high-speeds with limited resources, which places strict constraints on the underlying algorithms and hardware. Traditionally, frame-based cameras are used for vision-based perception due to their rich spatial information and simplified synchronous sensing capabilities. However, obtaining detailed information across frames incurs high energy consumption and may not even be required. In addition, their low temporal resolution renders them ineffective in high-speed motion scenarios. Event-based cameras offer a biologically-inspired solution to this by capturing only changes in intensity levels at exceptionally high temporal resolution and low power consumption, making them ideal for high-speed motion scenarios. However, their asynchronous and sparse outputs are not natively suitable with conventional deep learning methods. In this work, we propose TOFFE, a lightweight hybrid framework for performing event-based object motion estimation (including pose, direction, and speed estimation), referred to as Object Flow. TOFFE integrates bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and conventional Analog Neural Networks (ANNs), to efficiently process events at high temporal resolutions while being simple to train. Additionally, we present a novel event-based synthetic dataset involving high-speed object motion to train TOFFE. Our experimental results show that TOFFE achieves 5.7x/8.3x reduction in energy consumption and 4.6x/5.8x reduction in latency on edge GPU(Jetson TX2)/hybrid hardware(Loihi-2 and Jetson TX2), compared to previous event-based object detection baselines.</description>

      <title>On Accelerating Deep Neural Network Mutation Analysis by Neuron and Mutant Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutation analysis of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a promising method for effective evaluation of test data quality and model robustness, but it can be computationally expensive, especially for large models. To alleviate this, we present DEEPMAACC, a technique and a tool that speeds up DNN mutation analysis through neuron and mutant clustering. DEEPMAACC implements two methods: (1) neuron clustering to reduce the number of generated mutants and (2) mutant clustering to reduce the number of mutants to be tested by selecting representative mutants for testing. Both use hierarchical agglomerative clustering to group neurons and mutants with similar weights, with the goal of improving efficiency while maintaining mutation score. DEEPMAACC has been evaluated on 8 DNN models across 4 popular classification datasets and two DNN architectures. When compared to exhaustive, or vanilla, mutation analysis, the results provide empirical evidence that neuron clustering approach, on average, accelerates mutation analysis by 69.77%, with an average -26.84% error in mutation score. Meanwhile, mutant clustering approach, on average, accelerates mutation analysis by 35.31%, with an average 1.96% error in mutation score. Our results demonstrate that a trade-off can be made between mutation testing speed and mutation score error.</description>

      <title>Data re-uploading in Quantum Machine Learning for time series: application to traffic forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as it enables real-time traffic flow management, reduces congestion, and improves the overall efficiency of urban transportation networks. With the rise of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), it has emerged a new paradigm possessing the potential to enhance predictive capabilities beyond what classical machine learning models can achieve. In the present work we pursue a heuristic approach to explore the potential of QML, and focus on a specific transport issue. In particular, as a case study we investigate a traffic forecast task for a major urban area in Athens (Greece), for which we possess high-resolution data. In this endeavor we explore the application of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), and, notably, we present the first application of quantum data re-uploading in the context of transport forecasting. This technique allows quantum models to better capture complex patterns, such as traffic dynamics, by repeatedly encoding classical data into a quantum state. Aside from providing a prediction model, we spend considerable effort in comparing the performance of our hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with classical deep learning approaches. Our results show that hybrid models achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art classical methods, especially when the number of qubits and re-uploading blocks is increased. While the classical models demonstrate lower computational demands, we provide evidence that increasing the complexity of the quantum model improves predictive accuracy. These findings indicate that QML techniques, and specifically the data re-uploading approach, hold promise for advancing traffic forecasting models and could be instrumental in addressing challenges inherent in ITS environments.</description>

      <title>QGAIC: Quantum Inspired Genetic Algorithm for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses two meta-heuristics methodologies to introduce two novel quantum-inspired meta heuristic approaches: quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (QIGA1) and quantum-inspired genetic algorithm with dynamic approach (QIGA2). The two suggested methods combine a classical and quantum genetic algorithm approach. Both approaches use The correlation coefficient as an assessment function to identify the best (optimal) values for binary image. In quantum computing, they use simple ideas like qubits and state superposition. Due to these characteristics, parallelism which uses the time discreteness of quantum mechanical systems, is exhibited. For five distinct MNIST datasets, the performance of all participating algorithms has been assessed by comparing the suggested approaches first with their traditional approach counterparts and then with the proposed methods QIGA1 and QIGA2. Each method's ideal threshold value, associated fitness value (best and average), loss, and accuracy for each MNIST dataset have all been published. The outcomes demonstrate the superior efficiency of the suggested approaches over their traditional equivalents.</description>

      <title>Long-Form Text-to-Music Generation with Adaptive Prompts: A Case of Study in Tabletop Role-Playing Games Soundtracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic computing out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.</description>

      <title>Design Optimizer for Soft Growing Robot Manipulators in Three-Dimensional Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft growing robots are novel devices that mimic plant-like growth for navigation in cluttered or dangerous environments. Their ability to adapt to surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots; specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.</description>
