      <title>Quantum Mechanics in Curved Space(time) with a Noncommutative Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have previously presented a version of the Weak Equivalence Principle for a quantum particle as an exact analog of the classical case, based on the Heisenberg picture analysis of free particle motion. Here, we take that to a full formalism of quantum mechanics in a generic curved space(time). Our basic perspective is to take seriously the noncommutative symplectic geometry corresponding to the quantum observable algebra. Particle position coordinate transformations and a nontrivial metric assigning an invariant inner product to vectors, and covectors, are implemented accordingly. That allows an analog to the classical picture of the phase space as the cotangent bundle. The mass-independent quantum geodesic equations as equations of free particle motion under a generic metric as a quantum observable are obtained from an invariant Hamiltonian. Hermiticity of momentum observables is to be taken as reference frame dependent. Our results have a big contrast to the alternative obtained based on the Schr\"odinger wavefunction representation. Hence, the work points to a very different approach to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Massless Dirac Perturbations of black holes in f(Q) gravity: quasinormal modes and weak deflection angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article considers a static and spherical black hole (BH) in f(Q) gravity. f(Q) gravity is the extension of symmetric teleparallel general relativity, where both curvature and torsion are vanishing, and gravity is described by nonmetricity. In this study, we investigate the possible implications of quasinormal modes (QNM) modified Hawking spectra, and deflection angles generated by the model. The WKB method is used to solve the equations of motion for massless Dirac perturbation fields and explore the impact of the nonmetricity parameter ($Q_{0}$). Based on the QNMs computation, we can ensure that the BH is stable against massless Dirac perturbations and as $Q_{0}$ increases the the oscillatory frequency of the mode decrease. We then discuss the weak deflection angle in the weak field limit approximation. We compute the deflection angle up to the fourth order of approximation and show how the nonmetricity parameter affects it. We find that the $Q_{0}$ parameter reduces the deflection angle.</description>

      <title>Impact of Tolman-Kuchowicz Potentials on Gauss-Bonnet Gravity and Isotropic Stellar Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the behavior of charged isotropic compact stellar objects within the framework of the modified Gauss-Bonnety theory of gravity by considering the Tolman Kuchowicz spacetime. We use some matching conditions of spherically symmetric space-time with Bardeen model as an exterior geometry and examine the physical behavior of stellar structures. In the current analysis, we discuss the energy conditions to check the viability of our model. Many physical aspects have been examined, such as energy density, pressure evolution, equation of state parameter, and causality condition. Furthermore, an equilibrium condition can be visualized through the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equation. Further, we study mass-radius function, compactness and redshift function, which are some essential features of the charged compact star model. It is worthwhile to mention here for the current study that our stellar structure in the background of Bardeen's model is more viable and stable.</description>

      <title>Finding cosmic anisotropy with networks of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model involves the assumption of isotropy and homogeneity, a principle that is generally well-motivated but is now in conflict with various anisotropies found using independent astrophysical probes. These anisotropies tend to take the form of dipoles; while some can be explained by simple kinematic effects, many others are not fully understood. Thus, generic phenomenological models are being considered, such as a dipole in the luminosity distance. We demonstrate how such a dipole could be measured using gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers observed by six different networks of gravitational-wave detectors, ranging from upgraded LIGO detectors to anticipated next-generation ground-based observatories. We find that, for example, a network of three next-generation detectors would produce strong constraints on a dipole's amplitude ($\sim 13\%$) and location ($\sim 84$ deg$^2$) after just one year of observing. We demonstrate that the constraints scale with the number of detections, enabling projections for multiple years of observing. Our findings indicate that future observations of binary neutron star mergers would improve upon existing dipole constraints, provided that at least one next-generation detector is built. We also assess directional sensitivity of the dipole measurements by varying the dipole's location on a grid across the sky. We find that for a network of three next-generation detectors, the range of the constraints is only $\lesssim 1.2\%$ for the amplitude and $\lesssim 4\%$ for the location, indicating that the location of the dipole will not greatly impact our ability to measure its effects.</description>

      <title>Can the Near-Horizon Black Hole Memory be detected through Binary Inspirals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The memory effect, in the context of gravitational-waves (GWs), manifests itself in the permanent relative displacement of test masses when they encounter the GWs. A number of works have explored the possibility of detecting the memory when the source and detector are separated by large distances. A special type of memory, arising from BMS symmetries, called ``black-hole memory'', has been recently proposed. The black hole memory only manifests itself in the vicinity of its event horizon. Therefore, formally observing it requires placing a GW detector at the horizon of the BH, which prima-facie seems unfeasible. In this work, we describe a toy model that suggests a possible way the black hole memory may be observed, without requiring a human-made detector near the event horizon. The model considers a binary black hole (BBH), emanating GWs observable at cosmological distances, as a proxy for an idealized detector in the vicinity of a supermassive Schwarzschild black hole that is endowed with a supertranslation hair by sending a shock-wave to it. This sudden change affects the geometry near the horizon of the supertranslated black hole and it induces a change in the inspiraling orbital separation (and hence, orbital frequency) of the binary, which in turn imprints itself on the GWs. Using basic GW data analysis tools, we demonstrate that the black hole memory should be observable by a LISA-like space-based detector.</description>

      <title>Parameterized quasinormal frequencies and Hawking radiation for axial gravitational perturbations of a holonomy-corrected black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the fingerprints of black holes, quasinormal modes are closely associated with many properties of black holes. Especially, the ringdown phase of gravitational waveforms from the merger of compact binary components can be described by quasinormal modes. Serving as a model-independent approach, the framework of parameterized quasinormal frequencies offers a universal method for investigating quasinormal modes of diverse black holes. In this work, we first obtain the Schr\"{o}dinger-like master equation of the axial gravitational perturbation of a holonomy-corrected black hole. We calculate the corresponding quasinormal frequencies using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation and asymptotic iteration methods. We investigate the numerical evolution of an initial wave packet on the background spacetime. Then, we deduce the parameterized expression of the quasinormal frequencies and find that $r_0 \leq 10^{-2}$ is a necessary condition for the parameterized approximation to be valid. We also study the impact of the quantum parameter $r_0$ on the greybody factor and Hawking radiation. With more ringdown signals of gravitational waves detected in the future, our research will contribute to the study of the quantum properties of black holes.</description>

      <title>High order discontinuous Galerkin schemes with subcell finite volume limiter and AMR for a monolithic first--order BSSNOK formulation of the Einstein--Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme with subcell finite volume (FV) limiter to solve a monolithic first--order hyperbolic BSSNOK formulation of the coupled Einstein--Euler equations. The numerical scheme runs with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in three space dimensions, is endowed with time-accurate local time stepping (LTS) and is able to deal with both conservative and non-conservative hyperbolic systems. The system of governing partial differential equations was shown to be strongly hyperbolic and is solved in a monolithic fashion with one numerical framework that can be simultaneously applied to both the conservative matter subsystem as well as the non-conservative subsystem for the spacetime. Since high order unlimited DG schemes are well-known to produce spurious oscillations in the presence of discontinuities and singularities, our subcell finite volume limiter is crucial for the robust discretization of shock waves arising in the matter as well as for the stable treatment of puncture black holes. We test the new method on a set of classical test problems of numerical general relativity, showing good agreement with available exact or numerical reference solutions. In particular, we perform the first long term evolution of the inspiralling merger of two puncture black holes with a high order ADER-DG scheme.</description>

      <title>A frame-bundle formulation of quantum reference frames: from superposition of perspectives to superposition of geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a possible fully geometric formulation of the core idea of quantum reference frames (QRFs) as it has been applied in the context of gravity, freeing its definition from unnecessary (though convenient) ingredients, such as coordinate systems. Our formulation is based on two main ideas. First, a QRF encodes uncertainty about what is the observer's (and, hence, the measuring apparatus's) perception of time and space at each spacetime point (i.e., event). For this, an observer at an event $p$ is modeled, as usual, as a tetrad in the tangent space $T_p$. So a QRF at an event $p$ is a complex function on the tetrads at $p$. Second, we use the result that one can specify a metric on a given manifold by stipulating that a basis one assigns at each tangent space is to be a tetrad in the metric one wants to specify. Hence a spacetime, i.e. manifold plus metric, together with a choice of "point of view" on it, is represented by a section of the bundle of bases, understood as taking the basis assigned to each point to be a tetrad. Thus a superposition of spacetimes gets represented as, roughly speaking, an assignment of complex amplitudes to sections of this bundle. A QRF, defined here as the collection of complex amplitudes assigned to bases at events--i.e., a complex function defined on the bundle of bases of the manifold--can describe, in a local way (i.e., attributing the amplitudes to bases at events instead of to whole sections), these superpositions.
  We believe that this formulation sheds some light on some conceptual aspects and possible extensions of current ideas about QRFs. For instance, thinking in geometric terms makes it clear that the idea of QRFs applied to the gravitational scenarios treated in the literature (beyond linear approximation) lacks predictive power due to arbitrariness which, we argue, can only be resolved by some further input from physics.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamic potentials for asymptotic observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized second law states the total entropy of any closed system as the universe cannot decrease if we include black hole entropy. From the point of view of an asymptotic observer, a black hole can be described at late time as an open system at fixed temperature which can radiate energy and entropy to infinity. I argue that for massless free quantum fields propagating on a black hole background, we can define a black hole dynamical free energy using observables defined at future null infinity which decreases on successive cross sections. The proof of this spontaneous evolution law is similar to Wall's derivation of the generalized second law and relies on the monotonicity properties of the relative entropy. I discuss first the simpler case of the Schwarzschild background in which the grey body factor are neglected and show that in this case the free energy only depends on the Bondi mass, the Hawking temperature and the von Neumann entropy of the propagating quantum fields. Then I argue that taking into account the grey body factors adds a new term to the thermodynamic potential involving the number of particles detected at future null infinity conjugated to a chemical potential. Finally, I discuss the case of the Kerr black hole for which an angular momentum piece needs to be added to the free energy.</description>

      <title>Post-Minkowskian self-force in the low-velocity limit: scalar field scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present an approach to compute analytical post-Minkowskian corrections to unbound two-body scattering in the self-force formalism. Our method relies on a further low-velocity (post-Newtonian) expansion of the motion. We present a general strategy valid for gravitational and non-gravitational self-force, and we explicitly demonstrate our approach for a scalar charge scattering off a Schwarzschild black hole. We compare our results with recent calculations in [Barack et al., PRD 108, 024025 (2023)], showing complete agreement where appropriate and fixing undetermined scale factors in their calculation. Our results also extend their results by including in our dissipative sector the contributions from the flux into the black hole horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the role of scalar field potentials in the dynamical evolution of the Universe. A gravity theory with a non-minimally coupled scalar field with torsion in the geometrical action simulating effective dark energy is considered to study an extended matter bounce scenario. The dynamical behaviour of the equation of state parameter has been studied near the bouncing epoch. Keeping in mind the inflationary behaviour near the bounce, five different scalar field potential functions are explored, and their effect on the equation of state parameter is investigated.</description>

      <title>Measurable Parameter Combinations of Environmentally-dephased EMRI Gravitational-Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future space-borne Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect gravitational waves (GW) from Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) binaries which may live in nontrivial environments such as accretion disks. In this work, we apply the Fisher matrix Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to assess how well LISA observations can jointly constrain the source parameters and environmental densities around EMRIs. Specifically, we calculate the Fisher matrix from the post-Newtonian parameters of an EMRI binary embedded in a fluid with a constant density profile. We determine that the most dominant measurable parameter combination is dominated by contributions from environmental effects, namely, gravitational drag, accretion, and gravitational pull (in order of contribution). The proposed reparameterization of the PN parameters can be used to improve the power and efficiency of future detection and parameter estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Source anisotropies and pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we introduce and characterize a pseudo generalized Ricci-recurrent spacetimes. At first, we produce an example to justify the existence of such a spacetime. Then, it is provided that a pseudo generalized Ricci-recurrent generalized Robertson-Walker spacetime represents a perfect fluid spacetime and a pseudo generalized Ricci-recurrent perfect fluid spacetime represents either a dark energy epoch of the Universe or, the velocity vector field is parallel, conservative, acceleration-free, vorticity-free, and shear-free and becomes a static spacetime. Lastly, we study the impact of this spacetime under $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity scenario and deduce several energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Echoes from Braneworlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational echoes can be used to probe the structure of spacetime. In this paper, we investigate the gravitational echoes in different braneworld models in five-dimensional spacetime. We derive the gravitational perturbation equations of these models, and obtain the time-dependent evolution equations of the extra-dimensional and radial components. Using a Gaussian wave packet as initial data, we study the time evolution of the gravitational perturbation. By monitoring the evolution of the Gaussian wave packet, the gravitational echoes are observed whether the wave packet is generated from inside or outside the braneworld. Furthermore, we can restrict the parameters of the braneworld by calculating the strength of the first gravitational echo and using the current gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Observational Constraints on Theories Beyond General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis embarks on a comprehensive investigation of modified gravity theories and their implications on the properties of compact objects. Our primary objective is to shed light on the fundamental nature of gravity by exploring potential departures from General Relativity (GR) through a combination of theoretical analyses and observational techniques. On the theoretical side, we consider black hole thermodynamics, stability of compact objects, presence of black hole hairs, and the issue of causality that may provide valuable input towards the ultimate quantum theory of gravity. Moreover, on the observational side, we employ gravitational wave observations and black hole perturbation theory to explore new aspects of gravity and put stringent bounds on the beyond-GR parameters.
  To provide a structured overview of the thesis, we have organized it into chapters that progressively delve deeper into these diverse aspects of modified gravity and compact objects. Each chapter is dedicated to a specific facet of our investigation, building a coherent narrative that spans both theoretical and observational explorations. We aspire to achieve nothing less than imparting valuable insights and novel perspectives that may significantly enhance our understanding of the fundamental nature of gravitation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bayesian inference and model selection for continuous waves in pulsar timing array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding and characterizing gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries is a central goal of pulsar timing array experiments, which will require analysis methods that can be efficient on our rapidly growing datasets. Here we present a novel approach built on three key elements: i) precalculating and interpolating expensive matrix operations; ii) analytically marginalizing over the gravitational-wave phase at the pulsars; iii) numerically marginalizing over the pulsar distance uncertainties. With these improvements the recent NANOGrav 15yr dataset can be analyzed in minutes after an $\mathcal{O}(1\ \mathrm{hour})$ setup phase, instead of an analysis taking days-weeks with previous methods. The same setup can be used to efficiently analyze the dataset under any sinusoidal deterministic model. In particular, this will aid testing the binary hypothesis by allowing for efficient analysis of competing models (e.g. incoherent, monopolar, or dipolar sine wave model) and scrambled datasets for false alarm studies. The same setup can be updated in minutes for new realizations of the data, which enables large simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and experimental constraints on early-universe models in $F(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates Early Dark Energy (EDE) scenarios as a potential precombination solution to the Hubble tension problem in the $F(R)$ gravity theory. We first develop a dimensionless quantity to visualize the density ratio between the EDE field and matter. Following existing scenarios, we then discuss conditions under which the Hubble tension could be alleviated by introducing a temporary injection of $10\%$ fractional energy around the time of matter-radiation equality between $z=10^{3}-10^{4}$. We further confront these models with local gravity tests and find inconsistencies with observations. Taking a broader view, we convert constraints from local gravity tests into constraints for general EDE in $F(R)$ gravity. We eventually arrive at a no-go theorem for $F(R)$ gravity, which restricts nontrivial modifications to General Relativity in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Canonical quantization of the dark Dirac field and time asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform canonical quantization of the single-component, spin-zero field that was introduced by Dirac in 1971 and recently suggested as a candidate for dark matter by Bogomolny. The massive and massless cases are treated separately. Since in the massive case only positive-frequency modes are normalizable and regarded as physical, the mode expansion for the field involves annihilation operators only, making the quantization procedure particularly simple. The corresponding Hamiltonian of the system turns out to be unambiguous, with no need for normal ordering. The positive-energy requirement imposed on the second-quantized system leads to bosonic commutation relations, in agreement with the spin-statistics theorem. The boson nature of the positive-energy Dirac particles, which, evidently, have no antiparticles, hints at the possibility of a dark, background Bose-Einstein condensate that drives different parts of the universe in the same temporal direction. In the massless case, on the other hand, we explore the possibility of allowing the mode expansion to involve both positive- and negative-frequency components, which leads to the anticommutation relations, resulting in the fermionic behavior of the field in ultrarelativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Mind the step: On the frequency-domain analysis of gravitational-wave memory waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave memory is characterized by a signal component that persists after a transient signal has decayed. Treating such signals in the frequency domain is non-trivial, since discrete Fourier transforms assume periodic signals on finite time intervals. In order to reduce artifacts in the Fourier transform, it is common to use recipes that involve windowing and padding with constant values. Here we discuss how to regularize the Fourier transform in a straightforward way by splitting the signal into a given sigmoid function that can be Fourier transformed in closed form, and a residual which does depend on the details of the gravitational-wave signal and has to be Fourier transformed numerically, but does not contain a persistent component. We provide a detailed discussion of how to map between continuous and discrete Fourier transforms of signals that contain a persistent component. We apply this approach to discuss the frequency-domain phenomenology of the $(\ell=2, m=0)$ spherical harmonic mode, which contains both a memory and an oscillatory ringdown component.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem of analog gravity systems II: rotation and energy-dependent boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the inverse problem of analog gravity systems which admit rotation and energy-dependent boundary conditions. By extending two recent results, we provide a recipe that allows one to relate resonant transmission spectra with effective potentials and even reconstruct the boundary condition at the core. Our methodology is based on the WKB method and the identification of universal features in the transmission. One of the main advantages of this method is that it is parameter-free, and relies only on general properties of the underlying potential, instead of specific models. While the reconstruction of underlying potentials is generally not uniquely possible, the inverse method provides effective potentials with similar spectral properties to the original one. To demonstrate the accuracy and scope of our method, we apply it to a rotating imperfect draining vortex, which has been proposed as an analog system to astrophysical extreme compact objects. We conclude that the capability to explore energy-dependent boundary conditions could be of interest for experimental studies of such systems.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional representation of semantic relations between physical theories, fundamental constants and units of measurement with formal concept analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose several hierarchical graphs that represent the semantic relations between physical theories, their fundamental constants and units of measurement. We begin with an alternative representation of Zelmanov's cube of fundamental constants as a concept lattice. We then propose the inclusion of a new fundamental constant: Milgrom's critical acceleration and discuss the implications of such analysis. We then look for the same fundamental constants in a graph that relates magnitudes and units of measurement in the International System of Units. This exercise shows the potential of visualizing hierarchical networks as a tool to better comprehend the interrelations and dependencies of physical magnitudes, units and theories. New regimes of application may be deduced, as well as an interesting reflection on our ontologies and corresponding theoretical objects.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Histories: Chaotic Versus Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of decoherent histories in isolated systems based on exact numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation for a Heisenberg chain. We reveal that the nature of the system, which we switch from (i) chaotic to (ii) interacting integrable to (iii) non-interacting integrable, strongly impacts decoherence. From a finite size scaling law we infer a strong exponential suppression of coherences for (i), a weak exponential suppression for (ii) and no exponential suppression for (iii) on a relevant short (nonequilibrium) time scale. Moreover, for longer times we find stronger decoherence for (i) but the opposite for (ii), hinting even at a possible power-law decay for (ii) at equilibrium time scales. This behaviour is encoded in the multi-time properties of the quantum histories and it can not be explained by environmentally induced decoherence. Our results suggest that chaoticity plays a crucial role in the emergence of classicality in finite size systems.</description>

      <title>Meso-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking with non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a realization of the inflationary scenario where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is spontaneously broken during inflation, facilitated by its non-minimal coupling to gravity. This results in effectively two-field inflation: the early stage is driven by an inflaton field with the PQ symmetry intact, and the later stage is driven by the PQ scalar after its effective mass becomes tachyonic, causing destabilization from the origin. The non-minimal coupling serves the dual purpose of restoring the PQ symmetry during early inflation and flattening the PQ potential post-tachyonic shift, allowing for continued slow roll. We analyze the inflationary background solutions and scalar perturbations, which are amplified at small scales via significant isocurvature perturbations generated near the symmetry-breaking epoch. These perturbations lead to second-order gravitational waves, detectable by next-generation space-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Are General Relativity and Teleparallel Gravity Theoretically Equivalent?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleparallel gravity shares many qualitative features with general relativity, but differs from it in the following way: whereas in general relativity, gravitation is a manifestation of space-time curvature, in teleparallel gravity, spacetime is (always) flat. Gravitational effects in this theory arise due to spacetime torsion. It is often claimed that teleparallel gravity is an equivalent reformulation of general relativity. In this paper we question that view. We argue that the theories are not equivalent, by the criterion of categorical equivalence and any stronger criterion, and that teleparallel gravity posits strictly more structure than general relativity.</description>

      <title>Time transformation between the solar system barycenter and the surfaces of the Earth and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformation of time between the surface of the Earth, the solar system barycenter, and the surface of the Moon involves relativistic corrections. For solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), we also require that there be no rate difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) and TDB. The IAU has addressed these transformations with several resolutions. A series of robotic and crewed landings on the Moon are planned. The analogous transformation between TDB and time on the surface of the Moon (TL) needs a review and discussion. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system ephemerides.</description>

      <title>Revisited equilibrium solution of Fishbone and Moncrief torus for extended GRMHD simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion physics has become more important recently due to the detection of the first horizon-scale images of the super-massive black holes of M\,87$^*$ and Sgr~A$^*$ by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows onto a Kerr black hole have been used to interpret them. However, further testing the theory of gravity by using horizon-scale images requires performing consistent GRMHD simulations in non-Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we revisited the hydrodynamical equilibrium solution of the Fishbone and Moncrief (FM) torus that can be used to study any stationary, axisymmetric, vacuum, or non-vacuum spacetime. Further, we check the stability of the FM torus in non-Kerr spacetime by general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. We find that FM torus in non-Kerr spacetime is indeed stable under long-term evolution. We conclude that the generalized FM torus solution would be very useful for creating new GRMHD libraries in extended Kerr black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We connect the indications of 2D CFT for branes in non-supersymmetric strings to actual spacetime profiles, taking the bulk tadpole potentials into account. We find exact solutions for the uncharged branes that spread in the internal intervals of Dudas-Mourad vacua for non-tachyonic orientifolds and heterotic strings. These solutions involve suitable dressings of the uncharged branes of the nine-dimensional tadpole-free theory. Similar exact results for uncharged branes that are transverse to the internal space, or for charged branes, appear more challenging. Nevertheless, we identify their large-distance behavior, which is determined by linearized equations, and show that it is compatible with the CFT analysis in all expected cases. We also draw some indications on the leading back-reaction of the form-fields.</description>

      <title>Replica R\'enyi Wormholes and Generalised Modular Entropy in JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing semi-classical R\'enyi entropies of CFT on AdS$_2$ backgrounds in JT gravity with nongravitating baths, for general replica number $n$. Away from the $n\to 1$ limit, the backreaction of the CFT twist fields on the geometry is nontrivial. For one twist field insertion and general $n$, we show that the quantum extremal surface (QES) condition involves extremisation of the generalised modular entropy, consistent with Dong's generalisation of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for general $n$. For multiple QES we describe replica wormhole geometries using the theory of Fuchsian uniformisation, explicitly working out the analytically tractable case of the $n=2$ double trumpet wormhole geometry. We determine the off-shell dependence of the gravitational action on the QES locations and boundary map. In a factorisation limit, corresponding to late times, we are able to relate this action functional to area terms given by the value of the JT dilaton at the (off-shell) QES locations, with computable corrections. Applied to the two-sided eternal black hole, we find the $n$-dependent Page times for R\'enyi enropies in the high temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Detecting eclipsing double white dwarfs with electromagnetic and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarfs are predominant sources of gravitational waves in the millihertz frequencies accessible to space-borne gravitational wave detectors. With advances in multi-messenger astronomy, an increasing number of double white dwarf systems will be discovered through both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we simulated two populations of double white dwarfs originating from different star formation histories (hereafter referred to as Model 1 and Model 2) using the binary population synthesis method. We predicted the number of double white dwarfs in our Galaxy detectable by TianQin and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) individually, as well as through their joint observation. In addition, we performed an analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the parameter estimation using the Fisher information matrix. Furthermore, we predicted the number of eclipsing double white dwarfs detectable by Gaia and LSST. Our study found that over the nominal mission durations, TianQin, LISA, and their joint observation can detect $5\times10^3$ ($1\times10^4$), $1.7\times10^4$ ($3.3\times10^4$), and $1.8\times10^4$ ($3.5\times10^4$) double white dwarfs with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 7 in Model 1 (Model 2), respectively. Gaia and LSST are expected to detect 67 (186) and 273 (554) eclipsing double white dwarfs in Model 1 (Model 2) with orbital period less than 30 hours, respectively. We also found that several dozen eclipsing double white dwarfs can be detected jointly through electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating primordial gravitational waves from null energy condition violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the parity-violating effects in primordial gravitational waves (GWs) due to null energy condition (NEC) violation in two very early universe scenarios: bounce-inflation and intermediate NEC violation during inflation. In both scenarios, we numerically solve the power spectra of parity-violating primordial GWs generated by coupling the background field and the spectator field with the Nieh-Yan term, respectively. We find that the background field can significantly enhance parity-violating effects at scales corresponding to the maximum of the GW power spectra. In contrast, the parity-violating effects produced by the spectator show significantly weaker observability even if the coupling constant is large. Therefore, in NEC-violating scenarios, the significant observable parity-violating effects in primordial GWs primarily arise from the physics directly related to NEC violation. This result highlights the potential of primordial GWs as crucial tools for exploring NEC-violating and parity-violating physics.</description>

Abstract: The origins of merging compact binaries observed by gravitational-wave detectors remains highly uncertain. Several astrophysical channels may contribute to the overall merger rate, with distinct formation processes imprinted on the structure and correlations in the underlying distributions of binary source parameters. In the absence of confident theoretical models, the current understanding of this population mostly relies on simple parametric models that make strong assumptions and are prone to misspecification. Recent work has made progress using more flexible nonparametric models, but detailed measurement of the multidimensional population remains challenging. In pursuit of this, we present PixelPop-a high resolution Bayesian nonparametric model to infer joint distributions and parameter correlations with minimal assumptions. PixelPop densely bins the joint parameter space and directly infers the merger rate in each bin, assuming only that bins are coupled to their nearest neighbors. We demonstrate this method on mock populations with and without bivariate source correlations, employing several statistical metrics for information gain and correlation significance to quantify our nonparametric results. We show that PixelPop correctly recovers the true populations within posterior uncertainties and offers a conservative assessment of population-level features and parameter correlations. Its flexibility and tractability make it a useful data-driven tool to probe gravitational-wave populations in multiple dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Formation channels of merging compact binaries imprint themselves on the distributions and correlations of their source parameters. But current understanding of this population observed in gravitational waves is hindered by simplified parametric models. We overcome these limitations using PixelPop [Heinzel et al. (2024)]-our multidimensional Bayesian nonparametric population model. We analyze data from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs and make high resolution, minimally modeled measurements of the pairwise distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, and spins. There is no evidence that the mass spectrum evolves over redshift and we show that such measurements are fundamentally limited by the detector horizon. We find support for correlations of the spin distribution with binary mass ratio and redshift, but at reduced significance compared to overly constraining parametric models. Confident data-driven conclusions about population-level correlations using very flexible models like PixelPop will require more informative gravitational-wave catalogs.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled electromagnetic fields and observable implications for primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) postulates have been verified with high precision, yet our understanding of how gravity interacts with matter fields remains incomplete. Various modifications to GR have been proposed in both classical and quantum realms to address these interactions within the strong gravity regime. One such approach is non-minimal coupling (NMC), where the space-time curvature (scalar and tensor) interacts with matter fields, resulting in matter fields not following the geodesics. To probe the astrophysical implications of NMC, in this work, we investigate non-minimally coupled electromagnetic (EM) fields in the presence of black holes. Specifically, we show that primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a possible tool to constrain the NMC parameter. PBHs represent an intriguing cosmological black hole class that does not conform to the no-hair theorem. We model the PBH as a Sultana--Dyer black hole and compare it with Schwarzschild. We examine observables such as the radius of the photon sphere, critical impact parameter, and total deflection angles for non-minimally coupled photons for Schwarzschild and Sultana--Dyer black holes. Both the black hole space-times lead to similar constraints on the NMC parameter. For a PBH of mass $M=10^{-5} M_{\odot}$, the photon sphere will not be formed for one mode. Hence, the photons forming the photon sphere will be highly polarized, potentially leading to observable implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03736v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement an eccentric search for compact binary mergers based on particle swarm optimization. Orbital eccentricity is an invaluable input for understanding the formation scenarios of the binary mergers and can play a pivotal role in finding their electromagnetic counterparts. Current modelled searches rely on pre-computed template banks that are computationally expensive and resistant towards expanding the search parameter space dimensionality. On the other hand, particle swarm optimization offers a straightforward algorithm that dynamically selects template points while exploring an arbitrary dimensional parameter space. Through extensive evaluation using simulated signals from spin-aligned eccentric binary mergers, we discovered that the search exhibits a remarkable autonomy in capturing the effects of both eccentricity and spin. We describe our search pipeline and revisit some of the merger candidates from the gravitational wave transient catalogs.</description>

      <title>Automated Evaluation of Environmental Coupling for Advanced LIGO Gravitational Wave Detections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extreme sensitivity required for direct observation of gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO detectors means that environmental noise is increasingly likely to contaminate Advanced LIGO gravitational wave signals if left unaddressed. Consequently, environmental monitoring efforts have been undertaken and novel noise mitigation techniques have been developed which have reduced environmental coupling and made it possible to analyze environmental artifacts with potential to affect the 90 gravitational wave events detected from 2015-2020 by the Advanced LIGO detectors. So far, there is no evidence for environmental contamination in gravitational wave detections. However, automated, rapid ways to monitor and assess the degree of environmental coupling between gravitational wave detectors and their surroundings are needed as the rate of detections continues to increase. We introduce a computational tool, PEMcheck, for quantifying the degree of environmental coupling present in gravitational wave signals using data from the extant collection of environmental monitoring sensors at each detector. We find that PEMcheck's automated analysis identifies only a small number of gravitational waves that merit further study by environmental noise experts due to possible contamination, a substantial improvement over the manual vetting that occurred for every gravitational wave candidate in the first two observing runs. With the validation provided herein; PEMcheck will play a critical role in event validation during LIGO's fourth observing run as an integral part of the data quality report produced for each gravitational wave candidate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general asymptotically-flat, static, and spherical symmetrical wormhole without a thin shell has at least one unstable circular light orbit at a radius. If the wormhole has $Z_2$ symmetry against the throat, the stable or unstable circular light orbit must be on the throat but this fact is often overlooked. In this study, we categorize the numbers of the circular light orbits of the $Z_2$-symmetrical wormhole and their stability from the derivatives of an effective potential at the throat and we investigate the circular light orbits around a Simpson-Visser black-bounce spacetime, a DamourSolodukhin wormhole spacetime, a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black-hole-like wormhole spacetime or a charged Damour-Solodukhin wormhole spacetime as examples. We give complete treaments including degenerated circular light orbits made from more than one stable and unstable circular light orbits on and off the throat.</description>

      <title>Global Portraits of Nonminimal Inflation: Metric and Palatini</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global phase space dynamics of single nonminimally coupled scalar field inflation models in the metric and Palatini formalisms. Working in the Jordan frame, we derive the scalar-tensor general field equations and flat FLRW cosmological equations, and present the Palatini and metric equations in a common framework. We show that inflation is characterized by a "master" trajectory from a saddle-type de Sitter fixed point to a stable node fixed point, approximated by slow roll conditions (presented for the first time in the Palatini formalism). We show that, despite different underlying equations, the fixed point structure and properties of many models are congruent in metric and Palatini, which explains their qualitative similarities and their suitability for driving inflation. On the other hand, the global phase portraits reveal how even models which predict the same values for observable perturbations differ, both to the extent of the phase space physically available to their trajectories, as well as their past asymptotic states. We also note how the slow roll conditions tend to underestimate the end of inflationary accelerated expansion experienced by the true nonlinear "master" solution. The explicit examples we consider range from the metric and Palatini induced gravity quintic potential with a Coleman-Weinberg correction factor to Starobinsky, metric and Palatini nonminimal Higgs, second order pole, and several nontrivial Palatini models.</description>

      <title>Late-time tail and echoes of Damour-Solodukhin wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Damour-Solodukhin wormholes are intriguing theoretical constructs, closely mimicking many properties of black holes. This study delves into two distinct characteristics of the waveforms emitted from such wormholes, namely, the late-time tails and echoes, which can substantially be used to distinguish its identity. Notably, both features appear in the latter stages of quasinormal oscillations and stem from the singularities of the Green's function. The late-time tail, on the one hand, arises due to the branch cuts in the relevant Green's function. Within the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole paradigm, singularities are present in both ingoing and outgoing waveforms, which entails a generalization of the existing recipe for black hole metrics. On the other hand, the echoes are attributed to a new set of quasinormal poles, supplementing those of the respective black holes, reminiscent of the scenario where the spacetime metric possesses a discontinuity. It is inferred that both features are observationally relevant in distinguishing a wormhole from its black hole counterpart. Moreover, we suggest a potential interplay concerning the late-time evolution between the two mechanisms in question.</description>

      <title>Probing black hole `charge' from the binary black hole inspiral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave (GW) observations have enabled us to look beyond the standard paradigm of gravitational physics, namely general relativity (GR). Along with the mass and the angular momentum, which typical astrophysical black holes (BHs) are endowed with, theories beyond GR generically induce `charge' to these BHs. Notably, for BHs carrying the extra `charge' hair, we expect the BH absorption effects to modify accordingly and alter the tidal heating terms. Hence, the inclusion of the corrections in the GW waveform model, arising from the BH `charge', allows us to test the consistency of the observed binaries with Kerr BHs in GR. We compute the explicit dependence of the binary inspiral phase on the `charge' parameter arising from the tidal heating effect and study the measurability of the same from GW observations of binary mergers. Specifically, we employ the {\tt TaylorF2} waveform model, which accurately models the inspiral evolution of an aligned-spin binary merger, and Bayesian analysis-based GW data inference to measure the `charge' parameter for a selected set of detected binaries. We also present a detailed simulation study to investigate the possibility of measuring the charge parameter from binaries with different masses, spins and source locations. The analysis of selected GW events from the third GW transient catalogue shows that the `charge' parameter constraints are poor from the observed signals with the current sensitivity. In contrast, the simulation studies indicate that the spinning binaries with significant mass asymmetry provide the best constraints on the BH `charge' parameter. Finally, we study the prospects of measuring the BH `charge' parameter from a future GW detector with improved sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in the f(R,L,T) theory of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morris and Thorne developed wormhole solutions in the late 1980s when they discovered a recipe that wormholes must follow for travelers to cross them safely. They describe exotic matter as satisfying $-p_{r} &gt; \rho$, where $p_{r}$ is the radial pressure and $\rho$ is the energy density of the wormhole. This is a notable characteristic of the General Relativity Theory. The current article discusses traversable wormhole solutions in $f(R, L, T)=R+\alpha L+\beta T$, with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model parameters. The wormhole solutions presented here satisfy the metric constraints of traversability while remarkably avoiding the exotic matter condition, indicating that $f(R, L, T)$ gravity wormholes can be filled with ordinary matter. The derived solutions for the shape function of the wormhole meet the required metric conditions. They exhibit behavior that is comparable to that of wormholes reported in earlier references, which is also the case for our solutions for the energy density of such objects.</description>

Abstract: We present new, simple analytical formulas to accurately describe light rays in spherically symmetric static spacetimes. These formulas extend those introduced by Beloborodov and refined by Poutanen for the Schwarzschild metric. Our enhanced formulas are designed to be applicable to a broader range of spacetimes, making them particularly valuable for describing phenomena around compact objects like neutron stars and black holes. As an illustration of their application, we present analytical studies of images of thin accretion disks surrounding black holes and explore their associated polarimetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized Kerr-Schild ansatz for bigravity, already considered in the literature, which leads to linear interactions between the metrics is used to study the bigravity equations in the context of the double copy. By contracting the resulting spin-2 field bigravity equations of motion using Killing vector fields, as is usually carried out in general relativity, we arrive to the single and zeroth copy equations for the mentioned ansatz. For the case of stationary solutions, we obtain two Maxwell and two conformally coupled scalar field equations for the single and zeroth copies respectively, and the linear interactions are absent. In the time-dependent case we obtain equations for the fields which are coupled. By decoupling these equations and at the zeroth copy level, we recover a massless and a massive field whose mass is proportional to the Fierz-Pauli mass and depends on the coefficients of the interaction potential between the metrics. This has been also previously documented in the literature and is now reinterpreted within the context of the double copy proposal.</description>

Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the speed of light to be a universal speed of propagation of massless carriers. However, other possibilities exist -- including Lorentz-violating theories -- where different fundamental fields travel at different speeds. Black holes are interesting probes of such physics, as distinct fields would probe different horizons. Here, we build an exact spacetime for two interacting scalar fields which have different propagation speeds. One of these fields is able to probe the black hole interior of the other, giving rise to energy extraction from the black hole and a characteristic late-time relaxation. Our results provide further stimulus to the search for extra degrees of freedom, black hole instability, and extra ringdown modes in gravitational-wave events.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of finite-dimensional dynamical systems whose equations of motion are derived from a non-local-in-time action principle. The action functional has a zeroth order piece derived from a local Hamiltonian and a perturbation in the form of a non-local functional of the trajectory on phase space. We prove that the dynamics of these systems admits a local Hamiltonian description to all order in the perturbation and we provide explicit formulae for the $\mathcal{N}^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian and symplectic form in terms of the $(\mathcal{N}-1)^{\text{th}}$ order Hamiltonian flow. In the context of general relativity, these systems arise in the study of binary systems such as pairs of black holes or neutron stars in the small mass-ratio and post-Newtonian approximations. We provide applications of the formalism to binary systems in these regimes.</description>

Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole with cosmological constant, expressed in terms of the curvature radius, by using the approach of shadow thermodynamics and the formalism of geometrothermodynamics. We derive explicit expressions for the shadow radius in terms of the horizon, photon sphere, and observer radii. The phase transition structure turns out to strongly depend on the value of the curvature radius, including configurations with zero, one, or two phase transitions. We also analyze the black hole microscopic structure and find differences between the approaches of thermodynamic geometry and geometrothermodynamics, which are due to the presence of the curvature radius. We impose the important condition that the black hole is a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system to guarantee the consistency of the geometrothermodynamic approach.</description>

Abstract: By following closely Weinberg's soft theorem, which captures the $1/\omega$ pole contribution to the amplitude for soft graviton emissions ($\omega&lt;\Lambda$) on top of an arbitrary background hard process, we calculate the expectation value of the graviton's angular momentum operator for arbitrary collisions dressed with soft radiation. We find that the result becomes independent of the cutoff $\Lambda$ on the graviton's frequency, effectively localizing at $\omega=0$. In this way, our result captures the contribution to the angular momentum that comes from the zero-frequency modes. Like the soft theorem, our formula has an exact dependence on the kinematics of the hard particles and is only a function of their momenta. As an example, we discuss in some detail the case of the $2 \to 2$ scattering of spinless particles in General Relativity and ${\cal N}=8$ supergravity.</description>

      <title>The Fermionic Entanglement Entropy of the Vacuum State of a Schwarzschild Black Hole Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and analyze the fermionic entanglement entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole horizon for the regularized vacuum state of an observer at infinity. Using separation of variables and an integral representation of the Dirac propagator, the entanglement entropy is computed to be a prefactor times the number of occupied angular momentum modes on the event horizon.</description>

      <title>Localization of scalar field on the brane-world by coupling with gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a coupling mechanism between the kinetic term and the gravity, in which a coupling function $F(R)$ is introduced into the kinetic term of the five-dimensional scalar field. Based on this scenario, we investigate the localization of scalar fields in three specific braneworld models: the Minkowski brane, the de Sitter brane, and the Anti-de Sitter brane. The brane models considered here are regular with no singularity for scalar curvature. For the Minkowshi brane case, the zero mode can always be localized on the brane, and the massive modes can be localized or quasi-localized on the brane. For the dS$_4$ brane case, two forms of factor $F(R)$ is considered. The zero mode can always be localized, and the massive modes could be quasi-localized on the brane. Besides, with the second coupling factor, the scalar zero mode could be localized on the both sides of the origin of extra dimension, while the massive modes could be quasi-localized on the origin. Lastly, for the AdS$_4$ brane case, the localization of the scalar zero mode requires the consideration of a coupling potential $V(\Phi,\varphi)$, while the massive modes can still be localized on the brane with an infinite number.</description>

      <title>Metric perturbations in Noncommutative Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the framework of Hopf algebra and noncommutative differential geometry to build a noncommutative (NC) theory of gravity in a bottom-up approach. Noncommutativity is introduced via deformed Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms by means of a Drinfeld twist. The final result of the construction is a general formalism for obtaining NC corrections to the classical theory of gravity for a wide class of deformations and a general background. This also includes a novel proposal for noncommutative Einstein manifold. Moreover, the general construction is applied to the case of a linearized gravitational perturbation theory to describe a NC deformation of the metric perturbations. We specifically present an example for the Schwarzschild background and axial perturbations, which gives rise to a generalization of the work by Regge and Wheeler. All calculations are performed up to first order in perturbation of the metric and noncommutativity parameter. The main result is the noncommutative Regge-Wheeler potential. Finally, we comment on some differences in properties between the Regge-Wheeler potential and its noncommutative counterpart.</description>

      <title>Magnetized AdS/BCFT Correspondence in Horndeski Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work examines the thermodynamics and hydrodynamics behaviors of a five-dimensional black hole under the influence of an external magnetic field. The solution is the gravity dual to the Anti-de Sitter/Boundary Conformal Field Theory correspondence, enabling the study of properties within an anisotropic fluid framework. Utilizing holographic renormalization, we compute the free energy and the holographic stress tensor residing on the boundary denoted as $Q$. Within the fluid/gravity correspondence framework, we have a class of boundary extensions in $Q$, where the stress-energy tensor describes a magnetizing conformal fluid. We discuss the characteristics of this special solution as well as its thermodynamic properties, including the bulk and shear viscosity, the square of the speed of sound, as well as the anisotropic effects induced by the magnetic field in the magnetized conformal plasma.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation XLVI. The Near-IR Background Dipole Experiment with Euclid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verifying the fully kinematic nature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole is of fundamental importance in cosmology. In the standard cosmological model with the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric from the inflationary expansion the CMB dipole should be entirely kinematic. Any non-kinematic CMB dipole component would thus reflect the preinflationary structure of spacetime probing the extent of the FLRW applicability. Cosmic backgrounds from galaxies after the matter-radiation decoupling, should have kinematic dipole component identical in velocity with the CMB kinematic dipole. Comparing the two can lead to isolating the CMB non-kinematic dipole. It was recently proposed that such measurement can be done using the near-IR cosmic infrared background (CIB) measured with the currently operating Euclid telescope, and later with Roman. The proposed method reconstructs the resolved CIB, the Integrated Galaxy Light (IGL), from Euclid's Wide Survey and probes its dipole, with a kinematic component amplified over that of the CMB by the Compton-Getting effect. The amplification coupled with the extensive galaxy samples forming the IGL would determine the CIB dipole with an overwhelming signal/noise, isolating its direction to sub-degree accuracy. We develop details of the method for Euclid's Wide Survey in 4 bands spanning 0.6 to 2 mic. We isolate the systematic and other uncertainties and present methodologies to minimize them, after confining the sample to the magnitude range with negligible IGL/CIB dipole from galaxy clustering. These include the required star-galaxy separation, accounting for the extinction correction dipole using the method newly developed here achieving total separation, accounting for the Earth's orbital motion and other systematic effects.

      <title>Small-scale clustering of Primordial Black Holes: cloud-in-cloud and exclusion effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an excursion-set approach, we revisit the initial spatial clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) originating from the Hubble re-entry of large Gaussian density fluctuations in the early universe. We derive the two-point correlation functions of PBHs, properly accounting for the "cloud-in-cloud" mechanism. Our expressions naturally and intrinsically correlate the formation of pairs of PBHs, which is a key difference with the Poisson model of clustering. Our approach effectively includes short-range exclusion effects and clarifies the clustering behaviors at small scale: PBHs are anti-correlated at short distances. Using a scale-independent collapse threshold, we derive explicit expressions for the excess probability to find pairs of PBHs separated by a distance $r$, as well as the excess probability to find pairs with asymmetric mass ratio. Our framework is model-independent by construction and we discuss possible other applications.</description>

      <title>Bulk-local dS$_3$ holography: the Matter with $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which builds a concrete dual for large-radius 3d de Sitter with a timelike York boundary for both gravity and bulk effective fields. This generalizes the solvable $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ deformation, whose finite real spectrum accounts for the refined Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a microstate count while reproducing the radial static patch geometry. The required generalization to produce approximately local boundary conditions for bulk quantum fields requires a scheme for defining double-trace operators dual to deformed boundary conditions to realize the finite timelike boundary, valid at finite N. By starting with a small stint of a pure $T\bar T$ trajectory, the theory becomes finite, enabling well-defined subtractions to define the double-trace deformation so as to match the large-N prescription of Hartman, Kruthoff, Shaghoulian, and Tajdini to good approximation. We incorporate the matter effecting an uplift from negative to positive cosmological constant, and analyze the effect of matter on the energy spectrum of the theory arising from time-dependent bulk excitations. This validates the cosmic horizon $dS_3$ microstate count for large-radius $dS_3$ holography, embedding $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ concretely into a larger theory consistent with bulk locality for matter fields. We comment briefly on potential upgrades to four dimensions and other future directions.</description>

      <title>Microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud based on 20 years of OGLE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) can be used to probe the distribution and mass function of compact objects in the direction toward that galaxy - in the Milky Way disk, the Milky Way dark matter halo, and the LMC itself. The previous measurements, based on small statistical samples of events, found that the optical depth is an order of magnitude smaller than that expected from the entire dark matter halo in the form of compact objects. However, these previous studies were not sensitive to long-duration events with Einstein timescales longer than 2.5-3 yr, which are expected from massive ($10-100\,M_{\odot}$) and intermediate-mass ($10^2-10^5\,M_{\odot}$) black holes. Such events would have been missed by the previous studies and would not have been taken into account in calculations of the optical depth. Here, we present the analysis of nearly 20-year-long photometric monitoring of 78.7 million stars in the LMC by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 through 2020. We describe the observing setup, the construction of the 20-year OGLE dataset, the methods used for searching for microlensing events in the light-curve data, and the calculation of the event detection efficiency. In total, we find 16 microlensing events (thirteen using an automated pipeline and three with manual searches), all of which have timescales shorter than 1 yr. We use a sample of thirteen events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC $\tau=(0.121 \pm 0.037)\times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma=(0.74 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. These numbers are consistent with lensing by stars in the Milky Way disk and the LMC itself, and they demonstrate that massive and intermediate-mass black holes cannot comprise a significant fraction of the dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmological singularities, holographic complexity and entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study holographic volume complexity for various families of holographic cosmologies with Kasner-like singularities, in particular with $AdS$, hyperscaling violating and Lifshitz asymptotics. We find through extensive numerical studies that the complexity surface always bends in the direction away from the singularity and transitions from spacelike near the boundary to lightlike in the interior. As the boundary anchoring time slice approaches the singularity, the transition to lightlike is more rapid, with the spacelike part shrinking. The complexity functional has vanishing contributions from the lightlike region so in the vicinity of the singularity, complexity is vanishingly small, indicating a dual Kasner state of vanishingly low complexity, suggesting an extreme thinning of the effective degrees of freedom dual to the near singularity region. We also develop further previous studies on extremal surfaces for holographic entanglement entropy, and find that in the IR limit they reveal similar behaviour as complexity.</description>

      <title>Constraining ultra slow roll inflation using cosmological datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and PTA collaborations have raised the intriguing possibility of excess matter power at small scales. Such an increase can be achieved by ultra slow roll (USR) phase during inflationary epoch. We constrain excess power over small scales within the framework of such models using cosmological datasets, particularly of CMB anisotropies and Lyman-$\alpha$. We parameterize the USR phase in terms of the e-fold at the onset of USR (counted from the end of inflation) $\bar N_1$ and the duration of USR phase $\Delta N$. The former dictates the scale of enhancement in the primordial power spectrum, while the latter determines the amplitude of such an enhancement. From a joint dataset of CMB, SNIa and galaxy surveys, we obtain $\bar N_1 \lesssim 45$ with no bound on $\Delta N$. This in turn implies that the scales over which the power spectrum can deviate significantly from the nearly scale invariant behavior of a typical slow-roll model is $k \gtrsim 1 \, \rm Mpc^{-1}$. On the other hand, the Lyman-$\alpha$ data is sensitive to baryonic power spectrum along the line of sight. We consider a semi-analytic theoretical method and high spectral-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ data to constrain the model. The Lyman-$\alpha$ data limits both the USR parameters: $\bar N_1 \lesssim 41$ and $\Delta N \lesssim 0.4$. This constrains the amplitude of the power spectrum enhancement to be less than a factor of hundred over scales $1 \lesssim k/{\rm Mpc^{-1}} \lesssim 100$, thereby considerably improving the constraint on power over these scales as compared to the bounds arrived at from CMB spectral distortion.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-hermitian Chebyshev differential matrix and non-Hermitian Liouville quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral collocation method (SCM) exhibits a clear superiority in solving ordinary and partial differential equations compared to conventional techniques, such as finite difference and finite element methods. This makes SCM a powerful tool for addressing the Schr\"odinger-like equations with boundary conditions in physics. However, the Chebyshev differential matrix (CDM), commonly used in SCM to replace the differential operator, is not Hermitian but pseudo-Hermitian. This non-Hermiticity subtly affects the pseudospectra and leads to a loss of completeness in the eigenstates. Consequently, several issues arise with these eigenstates. In this paper, we revisit the non-Hermitian Liouville quantum mechanics by emphasizing the pseudo-Hermiticity of the CDM and explore its expanded models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spectral instability can be influenced by the compactification parameter.</description>

      <title>$n\pi$ phase ambiguity of cosmic birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the rotation angle $\beta$ of cosmic birefringence, which is a recently reported parity-violating signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has a phase ambiguity of $n\pi \,(n\in\mathbb{Z})$. This ambiguity has a significant impact on the interpretation of the origin of cosmic birefringence. Assuming an axion-like particle as the origin of cosmic birefringence, this ambiguity can be partly broken by the anisotropic cosmic birefringence and the shape of the CMB angular power spectra. We also discuss constraints on $\beta$ from existing experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study timelike and conventional entanglement entropy as potential probes of black hole singularities via the AdS/CFT correspondence. Using an analytically tractable example, we find characteristic behavior of holographic timelike entanglement entropy when the geometry involves a curvature singularity. We also observe interesting phenomena that, in some particular setups, holographic timelike and conventional entanglement entropy are determined from multiple complex saddle points, which fall outside the assumptions of the Lewkowycz-Maldacena type argument.</description>
