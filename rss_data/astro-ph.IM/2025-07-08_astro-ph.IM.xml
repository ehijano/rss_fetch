      <title>White dwarfs as probes of extrasolar planet compositions and fundamental astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs represent the most common end stage of stellar evolution and are important for a range of astrophysical questions. The high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic capability of the Habitable World Observatory (HWO) offers a unique capability to characterize white dwarfs. In this documents, we focus on two specific science cases for HWO -- white dwarfs as probes of extrasolar planet compositions, and fundamental astrophysics. HWO will have the sensitivity to measure a suite of heavy elements, such as S, C, O, Fe, and Si, in a large sample of polluted white dwarfs to constrain the water content and the light elements in the cores of extrasolar planets. HWO can also be used to search for any small variation on the fine structure constant in the presence of strong gravity. Both science cases require a minimum resolving power of 60,000, and a ultraviolet coverage down to at least 900 Angstrom.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Ultraviolet-to-nearinfrared Characterization of Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) offers a unique opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of planetary formation and evolution. The goal of this Science Case Development Document (SCDD) is to investigate the physical and chemical processes that shape the composition and atmospheric mass loss in exoplanets. We review the key observables currently known as diagnostics of mass loss via transit observations, i.e., absorption lines of escaping hydrogen (Lyman-alpha), helium, and metals (Fe, Mg, C, O). We also explore the challenges to infer planetary formation processes based on atmospheric composition characterization. HWO could enable a broad, continuous coverage from far-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectroscopy (~100--1600 nm) at high resolution (R &gt; 60, 000), which is essential to make these measurements, disentangle their planetary origin from stellar activity, and ultimately, contextualize the escape rates by simultaneously characterizing the composition, cloud predominance, and thermal structure of exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Detecting Surface Liquid Water on Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets with large bodies of water on their surface will have more temperate and stable climates, and such planets are the ideal places for life-as-we-know-it to arise and evolve. A key science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to determine which planets host surface liquid water. Aside from its implications for planetary climate and astrobiology, detecting surface water on terrestrial exoplanets would place important constraints on our theories of planet formation and volatile delivery. Rotational variability in the reflectance of an exoplanet may reveal surface features rotating in and out of view, including oceans. Orbital changes in reflectance and polarization, meanwhile, are sensitive to the scattering phase function of the planetary surface, including specular reflection from large bodies of water. Although these techniques are applicable to all temperate terrestrial exoplanets, we focus in this document on the directly-imaged planets that are more likely to drive the HWO coronagraph design. Identification of water oceans relies on detecting a liquid, and using other lines of evidence to narrow that liquid down to being water. Liquids have smoother surfaces than most solids, and hence exhibit specular reflection instead of diffuse reflection. In practice, this makes lakes and oceans look dark from most illumination angles, but mirror-like at glancing angles. HWO is uniquely capable of identifying surface liquid oceans via their optical properties. Given that discovering an ocean on an exoplanet would confirm its status as a habitable world, this science case is literally the raison d'etre of the Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>From stellar light to astrophysical insight: automating variable star research with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale photometric surveys are revolutionizing astronomy by delivering unprecedented amounts of data. The rich data sets from missions such as the NASA Kepler and TESS satellites, and the upcoming ESA PLATO mission, are a treasure trove for stellar variability, asteroseismology and exoplanet studies. In order to unlock the full scientific potential of these massive data sets, automated data-driven methods are needed. In this review, I illustrate how machine learning is bringing asteroseismology toward an era of automated scientific discovery, covering the full cycle from data cleaning to variability classification and parameter inference, while highlighting the recent advances in representation learning, multimodal datasets and foundation models. This invited review offers a guide to the challenges and opportunities machine learning brings for stellar variability research and how it could help unlock new frontiers in time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>Building SPARCS, an Ultraviolet Science CubeSat for Exoplanet Habitability Studies, Technology Advancements, and Mission Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Star-Planet Activity Research CubeSat (SPARCS) is a NASA-funded 6U-CubeSat mission designed to monitor ultraviolet (UV) radiation from low-mass stars. These stars' relatively high-frequency and high-energy UV flares significantly affect the atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets, driving atmospheric loss and altering the conditions for habitability. SPARCS aims to capture time-resolved photometric data in the far-UV and near-UV simultaneously to better characterize the flares and detect the strongest and rarest among them. In addition, SPARCS is testing innovative technology, such as delta-doped detectors with near 100% internal quantum efficiency and detector-integrated metaldielectric UV bandpass filters. This mission will increase the technology readiness level of these critical components, positioning them for inclusion in future flagship missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This paper outlines SPARCS' mission goals and provides an update as the spacecraft is completed and awaits its planned late-2025 launch to a sun-synchronous low-Earth orbit. It also highlights the critical role of small missions in providing training and leadership development opportunities for students and researchers, advancing technology for larger observatories, and shares lessons learned from collaborations between academic, government, and industry partners.</description>

      <title>Habitable Worlds Observatory: The Nature of the Astrophysical r-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the origin of the heaviest elements on the periodic table, with a focus on those produced by the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy can increase the number of r-process elements detectable in cool stars by more than 50% relative to optical and infrared spectra. These elements are key to characterizing the physical conditions that govern the r-process and identify the nature, sites, and environments where r-process events occurred. HWO has the potential to greatly expand the sample of stars where rarely studied heavy elements can be detected beyond the Solar neighborhood to the Galactic halo, globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Habitable Worlds Observatory: The Nature of the First Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the nature of the first stars using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy with the HWO has the potential to confirm any surviving low-mass zero-metallicity first stars by placing unprecedented low limits on their metal abundances. It also has the potential to substantially increase the number of elements detectable in the spectra of known long-lived low-mass stars, which exhibit extremely low metal abundances that reveal the metals produced by the first stars. Elements important for this science case with UV transitions include C, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. HWO would expand the discovery space when compared with the Hubble Space Telescope by enabling high-resolution UV spectroscopy for much fainter stars throughout the Milky Way and neighboring stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Cosmic Ultraviolet Background at the North Galactic Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I explore models of the dust-scattered component of the Cosmic Ultraviolet Background (CUVB) at the North Galactic Pole (NGP) in order to develop a framework for calculating the dust-scattered light as a function of the optical depths. As expected, I find that the dust-scattered emission scales linearly with reddening up to $E(B-V) \approx 0.1$\ mag and derive a parametric model for this dependence. I have applied these models to fit the far-ultraviolet (1350--1800 \AA) observations from the \textit{Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)} finding that the optical constants of the interstellar dust grains -- albedo ($a$) and phase function asymmetry factor ($g$) -- are consistent with predictions from the Astrodust model ($a = 0.33$, $g = 0.68$). I detect an isotropic offset of $267 \pm 7$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \AA$^{-1}$, half of which remains unaccounted for by known Galactic or extragalactic sources.
  I will now extend my analysis to wider sky regions with the goal of generating high-resolution extinction maps.</description>

      <title>Very Massive Stars with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very massive stars (VMS) are defined as stars with an initial mass in excess of 100 Msun. Because of their short lifetime and the shape of the stellar mass function, they are rare objects. Only about twenty of them are known in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. However VMS are important in several ways. They efficiently spread nucleosynthesis products through their boosted stellar winds, they are predicted to explode as pair-instability supernovae or to form heavy black-holes from direct collapse, and they outshine all other types of stars in the ultraviolet light, thus dominating the integrated light of starbursts. Their presence is indirectly suspected across all redshifts, all the way to cosmic dawn where they may have played a key role in the formation of the first galaxies. Their search and identification is currently hampered by instrumental limitation, especially spatial resolution. An integral field spectrograph working at the diffraction limit of HWO (5mas) and with a spectral resolution of about 2000 would revolutionize the understanding of VMS. We make the case for such an instrument in this contribution.</description>

      <title>Study of the atmospheric effects of energetic particle precipitations on giant planets with HWO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UV auroral emissions from giant planets are produced by extra-atmospheric energetic particles interacting with an atmosphere. They have been observed on Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus and should be present on Neptune. Even if the mechanisms are similar, each planet is unique due to its specific source of magnetospheric plasma and the structure and dynamics of its magnetosphere. How these precipitations modify atmospheric heating, dynamics and chemical balance at local and global atmospheric scale is still poorly known, especially on Uranus and Neptune, and critical to understanding the global atmosphere-magnetosphere system of giant planets and exoplanets. In this manucript we present how future observations by instruments, aboard \textit{the Habitable World Observatory} (HWO) will provide new information to better understand the origin and the atmospheric effects of these precipitations. A major interest is for the distant magnetospheres of Uranus and Neptune, never explored by an orbital spacecraft whose UV auroral emissions remains at (Uranus) or below (Neptune) the HST sensitivity. \textit{Pollux} is one such UV instrument concept, which will enable unprecedented high spectral resolution at fine spatial scale not previously seen and polarimetric observations of the planetary aurorae while \textit{LUMOS}, another UV instrument will image the full auroral regions with a good spectral resolution.</description>

      <title>Design, Fabrication and Characterization of the Thermal Filter Assembly on the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on-board Aditya- L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) observes the Sun in the near-ultraviolet regime on board the Aditya-L1 satellite, India's dedicated mission to study the Sun. SUIT will image the Sun in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm using 11 science bandpasses with varying spectral bandwidths between 0.1-58 nm. Within this range, the Sun provides huge incoming solar flux to the telescope that also varies by a factor of ~ 20 from the lower end to the upper end of the wavelength band of interest. Thermal Filter Assembly (TFA) is an optical component at the SUIT entrance aperture, directly facing the Sun. The TFA is used to control the heat load entering the telescope cavity and also to reduce the signal reaching the SUIT camera system and the charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor, which is limited in full-well capacity and the linear operational regime. The TFA is designed to allow only 0.1-0.45% of the incoming flux to pass within 200-400 nm. The choice of materials for substrate and coating for the filter poses several challenges in terms of contamination, corrosion/ oxidation and durability during the manufacturing process. Additionally, long-term exposure to harsh space environments and the formation of pinholes are other concerns. Direct exposure to the sun leads to a strong temperature gradient along the thickness of the filter. The design and assembly of the TFA are performed to avoid any thermo-elastic stress affecting optical performance. Different levels of qualification tests and the operation of SUIT in orbit for more than 14 months have confirmed the perfect working of the TFA. To the best of our knowledge, the design, development, and testing of such a rejection filter is the first of its kind for space telescopes in the near ultraviolet range.</description>

      <title>An accurate measurement of the spectral resolution of the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral resolution ($R \equiv \lambda / \Delta \lambda$) of spectroscopic data is crucial information for accurate kinematic measurements. In this letter, we present a robust measurement of the spectral resolution for the JWST's Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) in all its modes: fixed slit (FS), integral field spectroscopy (IFS), and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS). We modeled H and He lines of the planetary nebula SMP LMC 58 using a Gaussian line spread function (LSF) to estimate the wavelength-dependent resolution for multiple disperser and filter combinations. We corrected for the intrinsic width of the planetary nebula's H and He lines due to its expansion velocity by measuring it from a higher-resolution X-shooter spectrum. We find that NIRSpec's in-flight spectral resolutions exceed the pre-launch estimates provided in the JWST User Documentation by 5-45% across all the configurations and covered wavelengths. We recover the expected trend that the resolution increases with the wavelength within a configuration. The robust and accurate LSFs presented in this letter will enable high-accuracy kinematic measurements using NIRSpec for applications in cosmology and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of inclined cosmic-ray properties with GRAND data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-detection is now an established technique for studying ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays with energies exceeding $\sim 10^{17}$ eV. The next generation of radio experiments, such as the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), aims to expand this technique to the observation of Earth-skimming UHE neutrinos, which requires the detection of very inclined extensive air showers (EAS). Currently, GRAND is validating its detection principle -- autonomous radio detection -- in particular through the prototype array GRANDProto300, deployed in the Gobi Desert. In this phase, the array is limited to detecting inclined EAS from cosmic rays. Neutrinos cannot be observed because of the restricted detector size. We present a method to reconstruct the arrival direction and energy of EAS with zenith angles above $60^\circ$, applicable as well to upward-going trajectories. The approach combines a point-source-like description of the radio wavefront with the so-called Angular Distribution Function (ADF), a phenomenological model describing the angular pattern of radio signal amplitudes in the 50--200 MHz band. Applied directly to the voltage traces, this method enables efficient event selection with accurate direction reconstruction and a first-order energy estimate. We validate the approach with both simulations and experimental data, and reconstruct the first cosmic-ray candidates detected by GRANDProto300.</description>

      <title>NUTRIG: Development of a Novel Radio Self-Trigger for GRAND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NUTRIG project is dedicated to the development of advanced radio self-trigger methods for large-scale arrays such as the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND). The developed techniques are based on features of the radio emission of air showers to perform an efficient online rejection of background. We first describe a first-level trigger (FLT) template-matching method that uses the shape of transient radio pulses measured at the detection-unit level to target those induced by air showers. We present trigger efficiencies and throughput tests of the template-matching FLT in controlled laboratory conditions. Next, we describe the second-level trigger (SLT), which utilizes the measured FLT times and corresponding voltage amplitudes to construct a trigger at the array level. We present offline performances of the SLT, which performs a coarse reconstruction of timing, direction, and polarization of the air shower.</description>

      <title>The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring ultra-high energy neutrinos, with energies above $10^{16}$ eV, is the next frontier of the emerging multi-messenger era. Their detection requires building a large-scale detector with 10 times the instantaneous sensitivity of current instruments, sub-degree angular resolution, and wide daily field of view. The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to be that discovery instrument. HERON combines the complementary features of two radio techniques being demonstrated by the BEACON and GRAND prototypes. Its preliminary design consists of 24 compact, elevated phased stations with 24 antennas each, embedded in a sparse array of 360 standalone antennas. This setup tunes the energy threshold to below 100 PeV, where the neutrino flux should be high. The sensitivity of the phased stations combines with the powerful reconstruction capacities of the standalone antennas to produce an optimal detector. HERON is planned to be installed at an elevation of 1,000 m across a 72 km-long mountain range overlooking a valley in Argentina's San Juan province. It would be connected to the worldwide network of multimessenger observatories and search for neutrino bursts from candidate sources of cosmic rays, like gamma-ray bursts and other powerful transients. With HERON's deep sensitivity, this strategy targets discoveries that cast new light into the inner workings of the most violent astrophysical sources at uncharted energies. We present the preliminary design, performances, and observation strategy of HERON.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a next-generation Stage-IV sky survey telescope, distinguished by its large field of view (FoV), high image quality, and multi-band observation capabilities. It can simultaneously conduct precise measurements of the Universe by performing multi-color photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys. The CSST is equipped with five scientific instruments, i.e. Multi-band Imaging and Slitless Spectroscopy Survey Camera (SC), Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C), and THz Spectrometer (TS). Using these instruments, the CSST is expected to make significant contributions and discoveries across various astronomical fields, including cosmology, galaxy and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, stars, exoplanets, Solar System objects, astrometry, and transients and variable sources. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the CSST instruments, observational capabilities, data products, and scientific potential.</description>

      <title>A novel approach for the direct estimation of the instantaneous Earth rotation velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measures two standard observables: group delay and fringe frequency (delay rate). While group delay is widely used to estimate a broad range of geodetic and astrometric parameters, fringe frequency has, to date, been largely ignored. Here, we show that the fringe frequency is a unique tool for direct estimation of the instantaneous Earth angular rotation velocity, which is not accessible with the group delay alone. We estimate the magnitude of the Earth angular rotation velocity using a 30-year set of VLBI data and obtain daily estimates of X and Y angles linking the Instantaneous Rotation Pole (IRP) and the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) pole. The plain least-squares method was applied to analyse the fringe frequency available from routine geodetic VLBI observations. We estimate three components of the Earth rotation vector on a daily basis with a formal error of 1 prad/s in relative units, or better, if a large international VLBI network is at work. The newly obtained values can be used to monitor the Earth rotation irregularity in parallel to the traditional length-of-day (LOD) values and to directly assess the modern precession-nutation theory.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Framework for the LiteBIRD Instruments</title>

Abstract: LiteBIRD, the Lite (Light) satellite for the study of $B$-mode polarization and Inflation from cosmic background Radiation Detection, is a space mission focused on primordial cosmology and fundamental physics. In this paper, we present the LiteBIRD Simulation Framework (LBS), a Python package designed for the implementation of pipelines that model the outputs of the data acquisition process from the three instruments on the LiteBIRD spacecraft: LFT (Low-Frequency Telescope), MFT (Mid-Frequency Telescope), and HFT (High-Frequency Telescope). LBS provides several modules to simulate the scanning strategy of the telescopes, the measurement of realistic polarized radiation coming from the sky (including the Cosmic Microwave Background itself, the Solar and Kinematic dipole, and the diffuse foregrounds emitted by the Galaxy), the generation of instrumental noise and the effect of systematic errors, like pointing wobbling, non-idealities in the Half-Wave Plate, et cetera. Additionally, we present the implementation of a simple but complete pipeline that showcases the main features of LBS. We also discuss how we ensured that LBS lets people develop pipelines whose results are accurate and reproducible. A full end-to-end pipeline has been developed using LBS to characterize the scientific performance of the LiteBIRD experiment. This pipeline and the results of the first simulation run are presented in Puglisi et al. (2025).</description>

      <title>Global Optimization of Multi-Flyby Trajectories for Multi-Orbital-Plane Constellations Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of mega-constellations in low Earth orbits has posed significant challenges to space traffic management, necessitating periodic inspections of satellites to ensure the sustainability of the space environment when economically feasible. This study addresses the orbital design challenge associated with inspecting numerous satellites distributed across multiple orbital planes through flybys by proposing an innovative orbital-plane-based inspection strategy. The proposed methodology reformulates the multi-satellite flyby problem into a multi-rendezvous trajectory planning problem by proposing an analytical approach to determine a maneuver-free inspection orbit that enables flyby of all satellites within a specific orbital plane. Additionally, a three-layer global optimization framework is developed to tackle this problem. The first layer establishes an approximate cost evaluation model for orbital plane visitation sequences, utilizing a genetic algorithm to identify the optimal sequence from a vast array of candidate planes, thereby maximizing inspection targets while minimizing fuel consumption. The second layer constructs a mixed-integer programming model to locally refine the rendezvous epochs and orbital parameters of each inspection orbit to reduce the total velocity increment. The third layer accurately computes the optimal impulsive maneuvers and trajectories between inspection orbits. In contrast to traditional low-Earth orbit rendezvous optimization frameworks, the proposed framework fully leverages the adjustable freedom in inclination and right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) of inspection orbits, significantly reducing the total velocity increment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively address the trajectory optimization problem associated with constellation inspection for tens of thousands of satellites.</description>

      <title>Neural Dynamic Modes: Computational Imaging of Dynamical Systems from Sparse Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins. Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy, and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Observation and research on cosmic ray muons and solar modulation effect based on plastic scintillator detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays, originating from stars, supernovae, and other astrophysical sources, are composed of high-energy particles that enter Earths atmosphere. Upon interaction with atmospheric nuclei, these primary cosmic rays generate secondary particles, including neutrons, electrons, and muons, with muons constituting a dominant component at ground level. Muons, due to their relative abundance, stability, and well-characterized energy loss mechanisms, serve as critical probes for investigating the fundamental properties of cosmic rays. Studies of muon energy distribution, diurnal anisotropy, and their modulation by solar activity provide critical insights into the mechanism of particle acceleration in cosmic ray sources and the effects of solar and atmospheric.This study aims to characterize the counting spectra and anisotropic properties of cosmic ray muons by using a plastic scintillator detector system. The experiment was conducted over a three-month period, from December 2023 to February 2024, leveraging long-bar plastic scintillator detectors equipped with dual-end photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and a high-resolution digital data acquisition system. A dual-end coincidence measurement technique was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by suppressing thermal noise and other background interferences. Diurnal variations in muon count rates exhibit a pronounced pattern, with a systematic reduction occurring between 8:00 AM and 1:00 PM. This phenomenon is attributed to the solar shielding effects, where enhanced solar activity during daytime hours modulates the flux of galactic cosmic rays reaching Earths surface. The study further corroborates these findings through cross-comparisons with data from the Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Observatory. These observations underscore the robustness of the plastic scintillator detector system for capturing detailed muon spectra and anisotropic patterns.</description>

      <title>CosmoBench: A Multiscale, Multiview, Multitask Cosmology Benchmark for Geometric Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions, and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning. For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at https://cosmobench.streamlit.app</description>

Abstract: This study designs, implements, and evaluates a teaching strategy based on computational thinking (CT) 27 to strengthen the teaching of stellar astrophysics in secondary education. Thirty-one 11th-grade students 28 from the Escuela Normal Superior Leonor \'Alvarez Pinz\'on (Tunja, Colombia) were worked with using an 29 action research approach. The methodology combined documentary analysis and practical application 30 through a teaching sequence of four workshops, integrating CT skills such as abstraction, decomposition, 31 and algorithmic thinking in experimental activities and computational modeling. The evaluation, based on 32 rubrics and performance matrices, showed improvements in the structuring of thinking and conceptual 33 understanding of astrophysical phenomena. The results suggest that CP facilitates the teaching of physics 34 by promoting active and structured learning. It is recommended that the strategy be replicated in different 35 educational contexts to validate its applicability and optimize its impact.</description>

      <title>Solving Lane-Emden-Type Eigenvalue Problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lane-Emden equation, a nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equation, plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics and astrophysics, particularly in modeling the structure of stellar interiors. Also referred to as the polytropic differential equation, it describes the behavior of self-gravitating polytropic spheres. In this study, we present a novel approach to the solution of the eigenvalue problem which arises when considering the Lane-Emden equation for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The novelty of this work is that, we not only solve the Lane-Emden equation via PINNS but we also determine the eigenvalue, r, which is the stellar radius. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using Bayesian optimization in the Optuna framework to identify optimal values for the number of hidden layers, number of neurons, activation function, optimizer, and learning rate for each value of n. The results show that, for n = 0, 1, PINNs achieve near-exact agreement with theoretical eigenvalues (errors &lt; 0.000806%). While for more nonlinear cases, n = 2, 3 and n=4, PINNs yield errors below 0.0009% and 0.05% respectively, validating their robustness.</description>

      <title>Siberian radioheliograph image classification using ensemble of CLIP, EfficientNet and CatBoost models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Siberian Radioheliograph (SRH) is a ground-based radio interferometer in Irkutsk, Russia, designed for high-resolution solar observations in the microwave range. It can observe dynamic solar events with spatial resolutions of 7-30 arcseconds and temporal resolution up to 0.1 seconds.
  Generating solar radio images from the Siberian Radioheliograph (SRH) is a multi-step calibration process that corrects instrumental and atmospheric distortions, using redundancy-based calibration with both adjacent and non-adjacent antenna pairs to address phase and amplitude errors in visibility data. The CLEAN algorithm is then applied to deconvolve the point spread function, reduce sidelobes, and enhance the visibility of solar features, resulting in higher quality and more reliable images.
  While the calibration process generally improves image quality, it can sometimes result in noisy or spatially shifted images that are not suitable for scientific use. We developed a deep learning approach for automatic image quality classification. The training dataset was prepared using a zero-shot CLIP model and further validated manually. We evaluated four different models: a fine-tuned EfficientNet, two CatBoost variants using embeddings from CLIP and EfficientNet, and an Ensemble model that combined predictions from all three individual models. The Ensemble model achieved the best performance.
  The SRH daily image classification service has been created and is available online at https://forecasting.iszf.irk.ru/srh along with an API offering IDL and Python examples. Integration of Ensemble model into SRH image generating and calibration workflow can improve image reliability and reduces low-quality entries in SRH data catalog, enhancing solar research outcomes.</description>

      <title>Improved Binary Black Hole Search Discriminator from the Singular Value Decomposition of Non-Gaussian Noise Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of current gravitational wave (GW) detectors to transient GW signals is severely affected by a variety of non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise transients, such as the blip and tomte "glitches". These glitches share some time-frequency resemblance with GW signals from massive binary black holes. In earlier works [Joshi et al., Phys. Rev. D 103, 044035 (2021); Choudhary et al., Phys. Rev. D 110, 044051 (2024)], the authors presented a method for constructing a $\chi^2$-distributed optimized statistic, based on the unified formalism of $\chi^2$ discriminators [Dhurandhar et al., Phys. Rev. D 96, 103018 (2017)], to distinguish the blip and tomte glitches from the compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals. Unlike past works, the new $\chi^2$ discriminator is constructed from the most significant singular vectors obtained from the singular-value decomposition (SVD) of glitches in real detector data. We find that the chi-square developed in this work performs as efficiently as in Choudhary et al. [Phys. Rev. D 110, 044051 (2024)], which used sine-Gaussian basis vectors. This result supports past empirical findings that the blips and tomtes are well-modeled by sine-Gaussians. It also introduces a method for constructing signal- and glitch-based $\chi^2$ discriminators by directly using real data containing the glitches and, thus, holds promise for extensions to glitches that are captured less well by sine-Gaussians or other analytical functions.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of N-body simulations of the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most direct N-body integrations of planetary systems use a symplectic integrator with a fixed timestep. A large timestep is desirable because simulations run fast. However, simulations yield unphysical results if the timestep is too large. Surprisingly, no systematic convergence study has been performed on long (Gyr) timescales. In this paper we present numerical experiments to determine the minimum timestep one has to use in long-term integrations of the Solar System in order to recover the system's fundamental secular frequencies and instability rate. We find that timesteps of up to 32 days, i.e. a third of Mercury's orbital period, yield physical results in 5 Gyr integrations. We argue that the chaotic diffusion that drives the Solar System's long-term evolution dominates over numerical diffusion and timestep resonances. Our results bolster confidence that most simulations in the literature are indeed converged and provide guidance on how to run time and energy efficient simulations while making sure results can be trusted.</description>

      <title>A COMPASS to Model Comparison and Simulation-Based Inference in Galactic Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \texttt{COMPASS}, a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. \texttt{COMPASS} handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. %
Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, \texttt{COMPASS} evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova\,Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. %
Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.</description>

      <title>First Robust Detection of Linear Polarization from Metric Solar Emissions: Challenging Established Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarimetric radio observations of the Sun can provide rich information about emission mechanisms and the propagation medium. For the past five decades, solar polarimetric studies at low radio frequencies have almost always assumed the absence of linear polarization. This has been based on the expectations from coronal propagation effects. Here we present the first robust evidence of linear polarization from solar emissions at meter wavelengths using simultaneous measurements with two telescopes of very different designs separated by thousands of kilometers - the Murchison Widefield Array and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Both datasets show consistent linear polarization fractions, confirming this detection. Rapid changes in morphology, as well as the fractional linear polarization at small time and frequency spans, further rule out any possibilities of an instrumental origin. Assuming the absence of linear polarization in solar radio emissions can result in incorrect interpretation of solar observations as well as those of other flare stars, which are often guided by learnings from solar studies. This discovery highlights the need for relaxing this assumption, and is essential for precise estimation of polarization signatures, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the plasma conditions in the Sun and other stars.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Subtraction with Neural Density Estimators as a General Solution to Overlapping Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overlapping gravitational wave (GW) signals are expected in the third-generation (3G) GW detectors, leading to one of the major challenges in GW data analysis. Inference of overlapping GW sources is complicated - it has been reported that hierarchical inference with signal subtraction may amplify errors, while joint estimation, though more accurate, is computationally expensive. However, in this work, we show that hierarchical subtraction can achieve accurate results with a sufficient number of iterations, and on the other hand, neural density estimators, being able to generate posterior samples rapidly, make it possible to perform signal subtraction and inference repeatedly. We further develop likelihood-based resampling to accelerate the convergence of the iterative subtraction. Our method provides fast and accurate inference for overlapping GW signals and is highly adaptable to various source types and time separations, offering a potential general solution for overlapping GW signal analysis.</description>

      <title>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: discovery and physical description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I\ATLAS, discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity, v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. We obtained g, r, i photometry with the Palomar 200-inch Next Generation Palomar Spectrograph on 2025 July 3. We measured colour indices g-r = 0.43$\pm$0.02 mag, r-i = 0.16$\pm$0.02 mag, and g-i = 0.59$\pm$0.03 mag and a spectral slope of 1.3$\pm$0.9 $\%$/100 nm. We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000 km of the comet to be 230.0$\pm$5.2 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. The FWHM of 3I\ATLAS's detection is $\sim$2.2 arcsec as measured in our r-band images and has A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$ of 287.2$\pm$2.8 cm. Finally, we use the sunward extent of the coma to constrain the dust ejection speed, finding that \textmu m-scale to mm-scale particles have $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying the comet's dust mass-loss rate is $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.</description>

      <title>Accurate photometric calibration by fitting the system transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transforming the instrumental photometry of ground-based telescopes into a calibrated physical flux in a well-defined passband is a major challenge in astronomy. Along with the intrinsic instrumental difference between telescopes sharing the same filter, the effective transmission is continuously modified by the effects of the variable atmosphere of the Earth. We have developed a new approach to the absolute photometric calibration that simultaneously treats instrumental and atmospheric effects on an image-by-image basis by fitting the system transmission. This approach aims at breaking the 1% absolute photometric accuracy which limits current calibration methods for ground-based observatories. We fit the transmission, as a function of wavelength, for each image. The fit is done by comparing the instrumental fluxes of stars in the image to the synthetic photometry of the stars given their spectrum and the transmission function which have free parameters. A key element that enables this approach is the set of about 220 million low-resolution spectra measured by Gaia, which provides a large number of stellar calibrators in the image. We demonstrate the method using data from the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST). We show that the residuals between observations and synthetic photometry of the Gaia spectra in the fitted transmission have a standard deviation $&lt;$1% on an image-by-image basis, with no spatial and color dependencies. The median accuracy of the zero-point throughout the image is between 3-5 mmag, depending on the total image exposure. Furthermore we show that this method provides high stability over long temporal scales.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XVI: Lens search in HSC-PDR3 with a neural network committee and post-processing for false-positive removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have carried out a systematic search for galaxy-scale lenses exploiting multi-band imaging data from the third public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with the focus on false-positive removal, after applying deep learning classifiers to all 110 million sources with i-Kron radius above 0.8". To improve the performance, we tested the combination of multiple networks from our previous lens search projects and found the best performance by averaging the scores from five of our networks. Although this ensemble network leads already to a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0.01% at a true-positive rate (TPR) of 75% on known real lenses, we have elaborated techniques to further clean the network candidate list before visual inspection. In detail, we tested the rejection using SExtractor and the modeling network from HOLISMOKES IX, which resulted together in a candidate rejection of 29% without lowering the TPR. We carried out a comprehensive multi-stage visual inspection involving eight individuals and identified 95 grade A (average grade G &gt;2.5) and 503 grade B (2.5 &gt;G &gt;1.5) lens candidates, including 92 discoveries reported for the first time. This inspection also incorporated a novel environmental characterization using histograms of photometric redshifts. We publicly release the average grades, mass model predictions, and environment characterization of all visually inspected candidates, while including references for previously discovered systems, which makes this catalog one of the largest compilation of known lenses. The results demonstrate that (1) the combination of multiple networks enhances the selection performance and (2) both automated masking tools as well as modeling networks, which can be easily applied to hundreds of thousands of network candidates, help reduce the number of false positives that is the main limitation in lens search to date.</description>

      <title>Classification of Radio Sources Through Self-Supervised Learning</title>

Abstract: The morphology of radio galaxies is indicative of their interaction with their surroundings, among other effects. Since modern radio surveys contain a large number of radio sources that would be impossible to analyse and classify manually, it is important to develop automatic schemes. Unlike other fields, which benefit from established theoretical frameworks and simulations, there are no such comprehensive models built for radio galaxies. This stands as a challenge to data analysis in this field and novel approaches are required. In this study, we investigate the classification of radio galaxies from the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS-DR2) using self-supervised learning. Our deep clustering classification strategy involves three main steps: (i) self-supervised pre-training; (ii) fine-tuning using a labelled subsample created from the learned representations; and (iii) performing a final classification of the selected unlabelled sample. To enhance morphological information in the representations, we developed an additional random augmentation, called a random structural view (RSV). Our results demonstrate that the learned representations contain rich morphological information, enabling the creation of a labelled subsample that effectively captures the morphological diversity within the unlabelled sample. Additionally, the classification of the unlabelled sample into 12 morphological classes yields robust class probabilities. We successfully demonstrated that a subset of radio galaxies from LoTSS-DR2, encompassing diverse morphologies, can be classified using deep clustering based on self-supervised learning. The methodology developed here bridges the gap left by the absence of simulations and theoretical models, offering a framework that can readily be applied to astronomical image analyses in other bands.</description>

      <title>Fluid dynamics of a liquid mirror space telescope</title>

Abstract: Large aperture telescopes are pivotal for exploring the universe, yet even with state-of-the-art manufacturing and launch technology, their size is limited to several meters. As we aim to build larger telescopes - extending tens of meters - designs in which the main mirror is based on liquid deployment in space are emerging as promising candidates. However, alongside their enormous potential advantages, liquid-based surfaces present new challenges in material science, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. One of the fundamental questions is whether it is possible for such surfaces to maintain their precise optical shape over long durations, and in particular under the forces induced by the telescope's accelerations. In this paper, we present a model and a closed-form analytical solution for the non-self-adjoint problem of the dynamics of a thin liquid film pinned within a finite circular domain. We use the 50-meter Fluidic Telescope (FLUTE) concept as the case study, and examine the liquid dynamics of the telescope under both slewing actuation and relaxation regimes, elucidating the role of geometrical parameters and liquid properties. The solutions reveal a maneuvering 'budget' wherein the degradation of the mirror surface is directly linked to the choice of maneuvers and their sequence. By simulating ten years of typical operation, we show that, while the maximal deformation might reach several microns, the spatial distribution of the deformation and their propagation rate allows the telescope to maintain its optical functionality for years, with at least a substantial portion of the aperture remaining suitable for astronomical observations. The model provides valuable insights and guidelines into the performance of liquid-film space telescopes, marking a crucial step toward realizing the potential of this innovative concept.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference Benchmark for Weak Lensing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17975</link>

Abstract: Standard cosmological analysis, which relies on two-point statistics, fails to extract the full information of the data. This limits our ability to constrain with precision cosmological parameters. Thus, recent years have seen a paradigm shift from analytical likelihood-based to simulation-based inference. However, such methods require a large number of costly simulations. We focus on full-field inference, considered the optimal form of inference. Our objective is to benchmark several ways of conducting full-field inference to gain insight into the number of simulations required for each method. We make a distinction between explicit and implicit full-field inference. Moreover, as it is crucial for explicit full-field inference to use a differentiable forward model, we aim to discuss the advantages of having this property for the implicit approach. We use the sbi_lens package which provides a fast and differentiable log-normal forward model. This forward model enables us to compare explicit and implicit full-field inference with and without gradient. The former is achieved by sampling the forward model through the No U-Turns sampler. The latter starts by compressing the data into sufficient statistics and uses the Neural Likelihood Estimation algorithm and the one augmented with gradient. We perform a full-field analysis on LSST Y10 like weak lensing simulated mass maps. We show that explicit and implicit full-field inference yield consistent constraints. Explicit inference requires 630 000 simulations with our particular sampler corresponding to 400 independent samples. Implicit inference requires a maximum of 101 000 simulations split into 100 000 simulations to build sufficient statistics (this number is not fine tuned) and 1 000 simulations to perform inference. Additionally, we show that our way of exploiting the gradients does not significantly help implicit inference.</description>

      <title>A New Method for Wavefront Sensing using Optical Masking Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave front sensing of the surface of equal phase for a propagating electromagnetic wave is a vital technology in fields ranging from real time adaptive optics, to high accuracy metrology, to medical optometry. We have developed a new method of wavefront sensing that makes a direct measurement of the electromagnetic phase distribution, or path-length delay, across an optical wavefront. The method is based on techniques developed in radio astronomical interferometric imaging. The method employs optical interferometry using a 2-D aperture mask, a Fourier transform of the interferogram to derive interferometric visibilities, and self-calibration of the complex visibilities to derive the voltage amplitude and phase gains at each hole in the mask, corresponding to corrections for non-uniform illumination and wavefront distortions across the aperture, respectively. The derived self-calibration gain phases are linearly proportional to the electromagnetic path-length distribution to each hole in the aperture mask, relative to the path-length to the reference hole, and hence represent a wavefront sensor with a precision of a small fraction of a wavelength. The method was tested at $\lambda=400\,$nm at the Xanadu optical bench at the ALBA synchrotron light source using a rotating mirror to insert tip-tilt changes in the wavefront. We reproduce the wavefront tilts to within $0.1''$ ($5\times 10^{-7}$~radians). We also derive the static metrology though the optical system for non-planar wavefront distortions to $\sim \pm1$~nm repeatability. Lastly, we derive frame-to-frame variations of the wavefront tilt due to vibrations of the optical components which range up to $\sim 0.5"$. These variations are relevant to adaptive optics applications. Based on the measured visibility phase noise after self-calibration, we estimate an rms path-length precision per 1~ms exposure of 0.6 nm.</description>

      <title>Enabling Robust Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrievals with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric retrievals are essential tools for interpreting exoplanet transmission and eclipse spectra, enabling quantitative constraints on the chemical composition, aerosol properties, and thermal structure of planetary atmospheres. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers unprecedented spectral precision, resolution, and wavelength coverage, unlocking transformative insights into the formation, evolution, climate, and potential habitability of planetary systems. However, this opportunity is accompanied by challenges: modeling assumptions and unaccounted-for noise or signal sources can bias retrieval outcomes and their interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian Process (GP)-aided atmospheric retrieval framework that flexibly accounts for unmodeled features and correlated noise in exoplanet spectra. We validate this method on synthetic JWST observations and show that GP-aided retrievals reduce bias in inferred abundances and better capture model-data mismatches than traditional approaches. We also introduce the concept of mean squared error to quantify the trade-off between bias and variance, arguing that this metric more accurately reflects retrieval performance than bias alone. We then reanalyze the NIRISS/SOSS JWST transmission spectrum of WASP-96 b, finding that GP-aided retrievals yield broader constraints on CO2 and H2O, possibly alleviating tension between previous retrieval results and equilibrium predictions. Our GP framework provides precise and accurate constraints while highlighting regions where models fail to explain the data. As JWST matures and future facilities come online, a deeper understanding of the limitations of both data and models will be essential, and GP-enabled retrievals like the one presented here offer a principled path forward.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of BEACON to Ultra-High Energy Diffuse and Transient Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high energy neutrinos ($E&gt;10^{17}$ eV) can provide insight into the most powerful accelerators in the universe, however their flux is extremely low. The Beamforming Elevated Array for COsmic Neutrinos (BEACON) is a detector concept which efficiently achieves sensitivity to this flux by employing phased radio arrays on mountains, which search for the radio emission of up-going extensive air showers created by Earth-skimming tau neutrinos. Here, we calculate the point-source effective area of BEACON and characterize its sensitivity to transient neutrino fluences with both short ($&lt;15$ min) and long ($&gt; 1$ day) durations. Additionally, by integrating the effective area, we provide an updated estimate of the diffuse flux sensitivity. With just 100 stations, BEACON achieves sensitivity to short-duration transients such as nearby short gamma-ray bursts. With 1000 stations, BEACON achieves a sensitivity to long-duration transients, as well as the cosmogenic flux, ten times greater than existing experiments at 1 EeV. With an efficient design optimized for ultrahigh energy neutrinos, BEACON is capable of discovering the sources of neutrinos at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>(Re)-Defining Planets -- the Fundamental Plane of Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 6000+ exoplanets are now detected using various techniques, with estimates of billions of planets existing in our Galaxy alone. They are called super-Earths, hot Earths, mini-Neptunes, hot Neptunes, sub-Neptunes, Saturns, Jupiters, hot Jupiters, gas giants, ice giants, rocky, terran, subterran, superterran, and so on. This prompted the emergence of many recent works on taxonomy, or classification, of exoplanets. However, there is still no basic, fundamental definition of 'What is a planet?'. IAU has forwarded a definition in 2006 which, however, raised more questions than it solved. The first ambitious task here is to establish if there are limits on the size/mass of planets. The lower mass limit may be assumed as of Mimas - approximately minimum mass required to attain a nearly spherical hydrostatic equilibrium shape. The upper mass limit may be easier - there is a natural lower limit to what constitutes a star: ~0.08 SU. But then there are brown dwarfs: IAU has defined brown dwarfs as objects that exceed the deuterium burning limit (~13 JU), and giant exoplanets generally have masses of ~0.3 to ~60 JU. The resolution requires assembling the basic physical parameters that define planets quantitatively. Mass and radius are the two fundamental properties, and we propose to use a third correlated parameter: the moment of inertia. Based on this, we create the fundamental planet plane where the two parameters are correlated with the third, similar to a fundamental galactic plane. The fundamental planetary plane with turn-off point diagrams is constructed for the first time in this work. We define a planet as 'A celestial spherical object, bound to a star or unbound, that lies on the fundamental planetary plane, within a mass range between 0.02 EU to 13 JU'.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report initial observations aimed at the characterization of a third interstellar object candidate. This object, 3I/ATLAS or C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT and has an orbital eccentricity of $e\sim6.1$, perihelion of $q\sim 1.36$ au, inclination of $\sim175^\circ$, and hyperbolic velocity of $V_\infty\sim 58$ km s$^{-1}$. We report deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Very Large Telescope that resolve a compact coma. Using images obtained from several smaller ground-based telescopes, we find minimal light curve variation for the object over a $\sim4$ day time span. The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of the object is 17.1$\pm$0.2 %/100 nm, comparable to other interstellar objects and primitive solar system small bodies (comets and D-type asteroids), although this result is likely affected by some coma contamination. 3I/ATLAS will be observable through early September 2025, then unobservable by Earth-based observatories near perihelion due to low solar elongation. It will be observable again from the ground in late November 2025. Although this limitation unfortunately prohibits detailed Earth-based observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to peak, spacecraft at Mars could be used to make valuable observations at this time. Additional photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric monitoring of 3I/ATLAS by ground- and space-based telescopes, and possibly spacecraft based at Mars, are highly encouraged for characterizing 3I/ATLAS's rotational light curve, activity evolution, nongravitational acceleration, and compositional indicators of formation conditions.</description>
