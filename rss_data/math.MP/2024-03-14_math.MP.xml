      <title>Deep Learning Based Dynamics Identification and Linearization of Orbital Problems using Koopman Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the Two-Body and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problems in the field of aerospace engineering and sciences is deeply important because they help describe the motion of both celestial and artificial satellites. With the growing demand for satellites and satellite formation flying, fast and efficient control of these systems is becoming ever more important. Global linearization of these systems allows engineers to employ methods of control in order to achieve these desired results. We propose a data-driven framework for simultaneous system identification and global linearization of both the Two-Body Problem and Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem via deep learning-based Koopman Theory, i.e., a framework that can identify the underlying dynamics and globally linearize it into a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The linear Koopman operator is discovered through purely data-driven training of a Deep Neural Network with a custom architecture. This paper displays the ability of the Koopman operator to generalize to various other Two-Body systems without the need for retraining. We also demonstrate the capability of the same architecture to be utilized to accurately learn a Koopman operator that approximates the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem.</description>

      <title>Line geometry of pairs of second-order Hamiltonian operators and quasilinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a pair formed by a second-order homogeneous Hamiltonian structures in $N$ components and the associated system of conservation laws is in bijective correspondence with an alternating three-form on a $N+2$ vector space. We use this result to characterise these pairs up to $N=4$. We also show that the three-form provides $N+2$ linear equations in the Pl\"ucker coordinates which define the associated line congruence.</description>

      <title>On a criterion for a cutoff regularization in the coordinate representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses an applicability criterion for a cutoff regularization in the coordinate representation in the Euclidean space with a dimension larger than two. It is shown that the set of functions satisfying the criterion is not empty. As an example, an explicit function is presented. It is proved by explicit construction that there are functions satisfying the criterion in a stronger formulation.</description>

      <title>Infrared structure beyond locality in electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infrared problems of quantum electrodynamics, in contrast to ultraviolet difficulties which are of technical nature, are related to fundamental, conceptual physical questions, such as: what is a charged particle, is the particle interpretation of the electromagnetic field complete, does a vacuum state exist, or what is the quantum status of long range degrees of freedom. On the calculational level, the standard local formulations of quantum field theory have achieved procedures to deal with infinities related to long range correlations. However, the answers to the conceptual questions formulated above, based on the locality paradigm, do not seem to be fully convincing, which is confirmed by the fact that no canonical picture did emerge. This contribution briefly characterizes perspectives which open with an admission of nonlocal variables residing in infinity, or at the boundary of spacetime after compactification. Recently, this line of investigation gains popularity.</description>

      <title>Hadamard property of the Unruh state for massless fermions on Kerr spacetime : the large $a$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper by G\'erard, H\"afner, and Wrochna, the Unruh state for massless fermions on a Kerr spacetime was constructed and the authors showed its Hadmard property in the case of very slowly rotating black holes $\vert a\vert\ll M$. In this note, we extend this result to the full non extreme case $\vert a\vert&lt;M$.</description>

      <title>Classical-Quantum correspondence in Lindblad evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for the Lindblad evolution defined using (at most) quadratically growing classical Hamiltonians and (at most) linearly growing classical jump functions (quantized into jump operators assumed to satisfy certain ellipticity conditions and modeling interaction with a larger system), the evolution of a quantum observable remains close to the classical Fokker--Planck evolution in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm for times vastly exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the limit of such agreement with no jump operators). The time scale is the same as two recent papers by Hern\'andez--Ranard--Riedel but the statement and methods are different.</description>

      <title>Vertex coupling interpolation in quantum chain graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze band spectrum of the periodic quantum graph in the form of a chain of rings connected by line segments with the vertex coupling which violates the time reversal invariance, interpolating between the $\delta$ coupling and the one determined by a simple circulant matrix. We find that flat bands are generically absent and that the negative spectrum is nonempty even for interpolation with a non-attractive $\delta$ coupling; we also determine the high-energy asymptotic behavior of the bands.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a charge and current distribution with compact support, the associated potentials and fields are generally not integrable in the classical sense. However, it is convenient to be able to define their Fourier transform in order to create solutions to the wave equation. This paper develops the technology for this by considering the class of quasi split normal functions, examples of which are the solutions to Poisson's equation with a forcing term having compact support.</description>

      <title>From the Conformal Anomaly to the Virasoro Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformal anomaly and the Virasoro algebra are fundamental aspects of 2D conformal field theory and conformally covariant models in planar random geometry. In this article, we explicitly derive the Virasoro algebra from an axiomatization of the conformal anomaly in terms of real determinant lines, one-dimensional vector spaces associated to Riemann surfaces with analytically parametrized boundary components. Here, analytical orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms and deformations of the circle naturally act on the boundary components. We introduce a sewing operation on the real determinant lines over the semigroup of annuli, which then induces central extensions of the diffeomorphism group, as well as of the complex deformations.
  Our main theorem shows that on the one hand, the Lie algebra cocycle associated to the central extension of diffeomorphisms is trivial, while on the other hand, the one associated to the central extension of complex deformations is nontrivial, yielding the imaginary part of the Gel'fand-Fuks cocycle. The proof uses concrete computations, which we hope to be accessible to a wide audience. We also show an explicit relation to loop Loewner energy, anticipating the real determinant lines to be pertinent to semi-classical limits of random curves, as well as to Kahler geometry and geometric quantization of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. The conformal anomaly and real determinant line bundles are expected to be universal, following a classification of modular functors.</description>

Abstract: We give a full and detailed solution of eighth Arnold's trivium problem. We find critical points of a smooth function on a given one-parametric two-dimensional surface with Lagrange multipliers method. Basic Morse theory and Poincare-Hopf theorem makes it possible to determine a genus of this surface and gives a beautiful training example of Morse surgery on a two-dimensional surface of genus $g = 6$.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical Maxwell's electromagnetism, monopole term of the electric field is proportional to $r^{-2}$, while higher order multipole terms, sourced by anisotropic sources, fall-off faster. However, in nonlinear electromagnetism even a spherically symmetric field has multipole-like contributions. We prove that the leading subdominant term of the electric field, defined by nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangian obeying Maxwellian weak field limit, in a static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat spacetime, is of the order $O(r^{-6})$ as $r \to \infty$. Moreover, using Lagrange inversion theorem and Fa\`a di Bruno's formula, we derive the series expansion of the electric field from the Taylor series of an analytic electromagnetic Lagrangian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of new pairwise non-diffeomorphic structures on smooth manifolds, it has been questioned whether two topologically identical manifolds could admit different geometries. Not surprisingly, physicists have wondered whether a smooth structure assumption different from some classical known models could produce different physical meanings. In this paper, we inaugurate a very computational manner to produce physical models on classical and exotic spheres that can be built equivariantly, such as the classical Gromoll--Meyer exotic spheres. As first applications, we produce Lorentzian metrics on homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic manifolds that enjoy the same physical properties, such as geodesic completeness, positive Ricci curvature, and compatible time orientation. These constructions can be pulled back to higher models, such as exotic ten spheres bounding spin manifolds, to be approached in forthcoming papers.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes an extreme $C^k$ reducibility theorem of quasi-periodic $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ cocycles in the local perturbative region, revealing both the essence of Eliasson [Commun.Math.Phys.1992] and Hou-You [Invent.Math.2022] in respectively the non-resonant and resonant cases. By paralleling further the reducibility process with the almost reducibility, we are able to acquire the least initial regularity as well as the least loss of regularity for the whole KAM iterations. This, in return, makes various spectral applications of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators wide open.</description>

      <title>Sparse Data Structures for Efficient State-to-State Kinetic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-fidelity entry simulations can be enabled by integrating finer thermo-chemistry models into compressible flow physics. One such class of models are State-to-State (StS) kinetics, which explicitly track species populations among quantum energy levels. StS models can represent thermo-chemical non-equilibrium effects that are hardly captured by standard multi-temperature models. However, the associated increase in computational cost is dramatic. For implicit solution techniques that rely on standard block-sparse representations of the Jacobian, both the spatial complexity and the temporal complexity grow quadratically with respect to the number of quantum levels represented. We introduce a more efficient way to represent the Jacobian arising in first-order implicit simulations for compressible flow physics coupled with StS models. The key idea is to recognize that the density of local blocks of the Jacobian comes from rank-one updates that can be managed separately. This leads to a new Jacobian structure, consisting of a fully-sparse matrix and block-wise rank-one updates, whose overall complexity grows linearly with the number of quantum levels. This structure also brings forth a potentially faster variation of the block-Jacobi preconditioning algorithm by leveraging the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury inversion formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of string order and hidden symmetry breaking in the q-deformed AKLT model, an example of a spin chain that possesses generalized symmetry. We first argue that the non-local Kennedy-Tasaki duality transformation that was previously proposed to relate the string order to a local order parameter leads to a non-local Hamiltonian and thus does not provide a physically adequate description of the symmetry breaking. We then present a modified non-local transformation which is based on a recently developed generalization of Witten's Conjugation to frustration-free lattice models and capable of resolving this issue.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum discord of an arbitrary two-qudit state: the exact value and general upper bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric quantum discord of a two-qudit state has been studied in many papers, however, its exact analytical value in the explicit form is known only for a general two-qubit state, a general qubit-qudit state and some special families of two-qudit states. Based on the general Bloch vectors formalism [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54 195301 (2021)], we find the explicit exact analytical value of the geometric quantum discord for a general two-qudit state of an arbitrary dimension via the parameters of its correlation matrix and the Bloch vectors of its reduced states. This new general analytical result indicates that the lower bound on the geometric quantum discord found in [Phys. Rev. A. 85, 204102 (2012)] is attained on each two-qudit state and also, includes all the known exact results on the geometric discord only as particular cases. Moreover, it allows us to find for an arbitrary two-qudit state, pure or mixed, the new general upper bounds on its geometric quantum discord, expressed via the Hilbert space characteristics of this state and in case of a pure two-qudit state -- in terms of its concurrence.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Finite Geometries for Better Quantum Advantages in Mermin-Like Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum games embody non-intuitive consequences of quantum phenomena, such as entanglement and contextuality. The Mermin-Peres game is a simple example, demonstrating how two players can utilise shared quantum information to win a no - communication game with certainty, where classical players cannot. In this paper we look at the geometric structure behind such classical strategies, and borrow ideas from the geometry of symplectic polar spaces to maximise this quantum advantage. We introduce a new game called the Eloily game with a quantum-classical success gap of $0.2\overline{6}$, larger than that of the Mermin-Peres and doily games. We simulate this game in the IBM Quantum Experience and obtain a success rate of $1$, beating the classical bound of $0.7\overline{3}$ demonstrating the efficiency of the quantum strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.03854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A procedure is presented for solving the Fokker-Planck equation with constant diffusion but non-stationary drift. It is based on the correspondence between the Fokker-Planck equation and the non-stationary Schr\"odinger equation. The formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is extended by applying the Darboux transformation directly to the non-stationary Schr\"odinger equation. From a solution of a Fokker-Planck equation a solution of the Darboux partner is obtained. For drift coefficients satisfying the condition of shape invariance, a supersymmetric hierarchy of Fokker-Planck equations with solutions related by the Darboux transformation is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study flow of renormalization group (RG) transformations for the massless Gross-Neveu model in a non-perturbative formulation. The model is defined on a d=2 dimensional Euclidean space with a finite volume. The quadratic approximation to the flow stays bounded after suitable renormalization. We show that for weak coupling this property also is true for the complete flow. As an application we prove an ultraviolet stability bound for the model. Our treatment is an application of a method of Bauerschmidt, Brydges, and Slade. The method was developed for an infrared problem, and is now applied to an ultraviolet problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies wave localisation in chains of finitely many resonators. There is an extensive theory predicting the existence of localised modes induced by defects in infinitely periodic systems. This work extends these principles to finite-sized systems. We consider finite systems of subwavelength resonators arranged in dimers that have a geometric defect in the structure. This is a classical wave analogue of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We prove the existence of a spectral gap for defectless finite dimer structures and find a direct relationship between eigenvalues being within the spectral gap and the localisation of their associated eigenmode. Then we show the existence and uniqueness of an eigenvalue in the gap in the defect structure, proving the existence of a unique localised interface mode. To the best of our knowledge, our method, based on Chebyshev polynomials, is the first to characterise quantitatively the localised interface modes in systems of finitely many resonators.</description>

Abstract: We study the T-system of type $A_\infty$, also known as the octahedron recurrence/equation, viewed as a 2+1-dimensional discrete evolution equation. Generalizing the study of [P. Di Francesco and R. Soto-Garrido. Arctic curves of the octahedron equation. J. Phys. A, 47(28):285204, 34, 2014], we consider initial data along parallel ``slanted" planes perpendicular to an arbitrary admissible direction $(r,s,t)\in {\mathbb Z}_+^3$. The solution of the T-system is interpreted as the partition function of a dimer model on some suitable ``pinecone" graph introduced in [M. Bousquet-M\'elou, J. Propp, and J. West. Perfect matchings for the three-term Gale-Robinson sequences. Electron. J. Combin., 16(1):Research Paper 125, 37, 2009]. The T-system formulation and some exact solutions in uniform or periodic cases allow us to explore the thermodynamic limit of the corresponding dimer models and to derive exact arctic curves separating the various phases of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of interacting particles governed by the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in the presence of external confining potentials, singular repulsive forces, as well as memory kernels. Using a Mori-Zwanzig approach, we represent the system by a class of Markovian dynamics. Under a general set of conditions on the nonlinearities, we study the large-time asymptotics of the multi-particle Markovian GLEs. We show that the system is always exponentially attractive toward the unique invariant Gibbs probability measure. The proof relies on a novel construction of Lyapunov functions. We then establish the validity of the small mass approximation for the solutions by an appropriate equation on any finite-time window. Important examples of singular potentials in our results include the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07956v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Langevin dynamics for spherical $p$-spin models, focusing on the short time regime described by the Cugliandolo-Kurchan equations. Confirming a prediction of [Cugliandolo-Kurchan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 1993], we show the asymptotic energy achieved is exactly $E_{\infty}(p)=2\sqrt{\frac{p-1}{p}}$ in the low temperature limit. The upper bound uses hardness results for Lipschitz optimization algorithms and applies for all temperatures. For the lower bound, we prove the dynamics reaches and stays above the lowest energy of any approximate local maximum. In fact the latter behavior holds for any Hamiltonian obeying natural smoothness estimates, even with disorder-dependent initialization and on exponential time-scales.</description>

      <title>Large N instantons from topological strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $1/N$ expansion of matrix models is asymptotic, and it requires non-perturbative corrections due to large $N$ instantons. Explicit expressions for large $N$ instanton amplitudes are known in the case of Hermitian matrix models with one cut, but not in the multi-cut case. We show that the recent exact results on topological string instanton amplitudes provide the non-perturbative contributions of large $N$ instantons in generic multi-cut, Hermitian matrix models. We present a detailed test in the case of the cubic matrix model by considering the asymptotics of its $1/N$ expansion, which we obtain at relatively high genus for a generic two-cut background. These results can be extended to certain non-conventional matrix models which admit a topological string theory description. As an application, we determine the large $N$ instanton corrections for the free energy of ABJM theory on the three-sphere, which correspond to D-brane instanton corrections in superstring theory. We also illustrate the applications of topological string instantons in a more mathematical setting by considering orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants. By focusing on the example of $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_3$, we show that they grow doubly-factorially with the genus and we obtain and test explicit asymptotic formulae for them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: B. Feigin and A. Stoyanovsky found the basis of semi-infinite monomials in standard $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2'$-module $L_{(0, 1)}$ with Lefschetz formula for the corresponding flag variety. These semi-infinite monomials are constructed by modes of the current $e(z) = \sum\limits_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} e_n\,z^{- n - 1}$. We give an alternative proof of this fact using explicit fermionic construction of this module. Namely, we realize $L_{(0, 1)}$ inside of the zero-charge subspace of Fermionic Fock space and show linear independence of vectors corresponding to semi-infinite monomials.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a natural generalization of Maya diagrams -- the space of infinite Fibonacci configurations, which are specified functions on $\mathbb{Z}$ with values $1$ and $0$. Infinite Fibonacci configurations are particularly interesting as soon as they parametrize Feigin-Stoyanovsky type bases in lattice vertex superalgebras $V_{\sqrt{N}\mathbb{Z}}$ and their irreducible modules. We calculate the character of such configurations space by two different ways and obtain series of combinatorial identities. These identities turn out to be Durfee rectangle identities with shifts in base and height.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix configurations define noncommutative spaces endowed with extra structure including a generalized Laplace operator, and hence a metric structure. Made dynamical via matrix models, they describe rich physical systems including noncommutative gauge theory and emergent gravity. Refining the construction in [1], we construct a semi-classical limit through an immersed submanifold of complex projective space based on quasi-coherent states. We observe the phenomenon of oxidation, where the resulting semi-classical space acquires spurious extra dimensions. We propose to remove this artifact by passing to a leaf of a carefully chosen foliation, which allows to extract the geometrical content of the noncommutative spaces. This is demonstrated numerically via multiple examples.</description>

      <title>Geometric structure of Deep Learning networks and construction of global ${\mathcal L}^2$ minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly determine local and global minimizers of the $\mathcal{L}^2$ cost function in underparametrized Deep Learning (DL) networks; our main goal is to shed light on their geometric structure and properties. We accomplish this by a direct construction, without invoking the gradient descent flow at any point of this work. We specifically consider $L$ hidden layers, a ReLU ramp activation function, an $\mathcal{L}^2$ Schatten class (or Hilbert-Schmidt) cost function, input and output spaces $\mathbb{R}^Q$ with equal dimension $Q\geq1$, and hidden layers also defined on $\mathbb{R}^{Q}$; the training inputs are assumed to be sufficiently clustered. The training input size $N$ can be arbitrarily large - thus, we are considering the underparametrized regime. More general settings are left to future work. We construct an explicit family of minimizers for the global minimum of the cost function in the case $L\geq Q$, which we show to be degenerate. Moreover, we determine a set of $2^Q-1$ distinct degenerate local minima of the cost function. In the context presented here, the concatenation of hidden layers of the DL network is reinterpreted as a recursive application of a {\em truncation map} which "curates" the training inputs by minimizing their noise to signal ratio.</description>

Abstract: The Hofstadter model successfully describes the behavior of non-interacting quantum particles hopping on a lattice coupled to a gauge field, and hence is ubiquitous in many fields of research, including condensed matter, optical, and atomic physics. Motivated by this, we introduce HofstadterTools (https://hofstadter.tools), a Python package that can be used to analyze the energy spectrum of a generalized Hofstadter model, with any combination of hoppings on any regular Euclidean lattice. The package can be applied to compute key properties of the band structure, such as quantum geometry and topology, as well as plot Hofstadter butterflies and Wannier diagrams that are colored according to their Chern numbers.</description>

Abstract: For partially ordered sets $X$ we consider the square matrices $M^{X}$ with rows and columns indexed by linear extensions of the partial order on $X$. Each entry $\left( M^{X}\right)_{PQ}$ is a formal variable defined by a pedestal of the linear order $Q$ with respect to linear order $P$. We show that all the eigenvalues of any such matrix $M^{X}$ are $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combinations of those variables.</description>

      <title>KMS states on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-crossed products and twisted KMS functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: KMS states on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-crossed products of unital $C^*$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ are characterized in terms of KMS states and twisted KMS functionals of $\mathcal{A}$. These functionals are shown to describe the extensions of KMS states $\omega$ on $\mathcal{A}$ to the crossed product $\mathcal{A} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ and can also be characterized by the twisted center of the von Neumann algebra generated by the GNS representation corresponding to $\omega$.
  As a particular class of examples, KMS states on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-crossed products of CAR algebras with dynamics and grading given by Bogoliubov automorphisms are analyzed in detail. In this case, one or two extremal KMS states are found depending on a Gibbs type condition involving the odd part of the absolute value of the Hamiltonian.
  As an application in mathematical physics, the extended field algebra of the Ising QFT is shown to be a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-crossed product of a CAR algebra which has a unique KMS state.</description>
