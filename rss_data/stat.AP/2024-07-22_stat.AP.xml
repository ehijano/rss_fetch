      <title>FAVis: Visual Analytics of Factor Analysis for Psychological Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Psychological research often involves understanding psychological constructs through conducting factor analysis on data collected by a questionnaire, which can comprise hundreds of questions. Without interactive systems for interpreting factor models, researchers are frequently exposed to subjectivity, potentially leading to misinterpretations or overlooked crucial information. This paper introduces FAVis, a novel interactive visualization tool designed to aid researchers in interpreting and evaluating factor analysis results. FAVis enhances the understanding of relationships between variables and factors by supporting multiple views for visualizing factor loadings and correlations, allowing users to analyze information from various perspectives. The primary feature of FAVis is to enable users to set optimal thresholds for factor loadings to balance clarity and information retention. FAVis also allows users to assign tags to variables, enhancing the understanding of factors by linking them to their associated psychological constructs. Our user study demonstrates the utility of FAVis in various tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Variable Importance in Random Forests: A Novel Application of Global Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work provides an application of Global Sensitivity Analysis to supervised machine learning methods such as Random Forests. These methods act as black boxes, selecting features in high--dimensional data sets as to provide accurate classifiers in terms of prediction when new data are fed into the system. In supervised machine learning, predictors are generally ranked by importance based on their contribution to the final prediction. Global Sensitivity Analysis is primarily used in mathematical modelling to investigate the effect of the uncertainties of the input variables on the output. We apply it here as a novel way to rank the input features by their importance to the explainability of the data generating process, shedding light on how the response is determined by the dependence structure of its predictors. A simulation study shows that our proposal can be used to explore what advances can be achieved either in terms of efficiency, explanatory ability, or simply by way of confirming existing results.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian joint model of multiple longitudinal and categorical outcomes with application to multiple myeloma using permutation-based variable importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint models have proven to be an effective approach for uncovering potentially hidden connections between various types of outcomes, mainly continuous, time-to-event, and binary. Typically, longitudinal continuous outcomes are characterized by linear mixed-effects models, survival outcomes are described by proportional hazards models, and the link between outcomes are captured by shared random effects. Other modeling variations include generalized linear mixed-effects models for longitudinal data and logistic regression when a binary outcome is present, rather than time until an event of interest. However, in a clinical research setting, one might be interested in modeling the physician's chosen treatment based on the patient's medical history in order to identify prognostic factors. In this situation, there are often multiple treatment options, requiring the use of a multiclass classification approach. Inspired by this context, we develop a Bayesian joint model for longitudinal and categorical data. In particular, our motivation comes from a multiple myeloma study, in which biomarkers display nonlinear trajectories that are well captured through bi-exponential submodels, where patient-level information is shared with the categorical submodel. We also present a variable importance strategy for ranking prognostic factors. We apply our proposal and a competing model to the multiple myeloma data, compare the variable importance and inferential results for both models, and illustrate patient-level interpretations using our joint model.</description>

      <title>Analytics, have some humility: a statistical view of fourth-down decision making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03490v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard mathematical approach to fourth-down decision making in American football is to make the decision that maximizes estimated win probability. Win probability estimates arise from machine learning models fit from historical data. These models attempt to capture a nuanced relationship between a noisy binary outcome variable and game-state variables replete with interactions and non-linearities from a finite dataset of just a few thousand games. Thus, it is imperative to knit uncertainty quantification into the fourth-down decision procedure; we do so using bootstrapping. We find that uncertainty in the estimated optimal fourth-down decision is far greater than that currently expressed by sports analysts in popular sports media.</description>

      <title>Prediction intervals for overdispersed binomial endpoints and their application to historical control data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In toxicology, the validation of the concurrent control by historical control data (HCD) has become requirements. This validation is usually done by historical control limits (HCL) which in practice are often graphically displayed in a Sheward control chart like manner. In many applications, HCL are applied to dichotomous data, e.g. the number of rats with a tumor vs. the number of rats without a tumor (carcinogenicity studies) or the number of cells with a micronucleus out of a total number of cells. Dichotomous HCD may be overdispersed and can be heavily right- (or left-) skewed, which is usually not taken into account in the practical applications of HCL. To overcome this problem, four different prediction intervals (two frequentist, two Bayesian), that can be applied to such data, are proposed. Comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulations assessing the coverage probabilities of seven different methods for HCL calculation reveal, that frequentist bootstrap calibrated prediction intervals control the type-1-error best. Heuristics traditionally used in control charts (e.g. the limits in Sheward np-charts or the mean plus minus 2 SD) as well a the historical range fail to control a pre-specified coverage probability. The application of HCL is demonstrated based on a real life data set containing historical controls from long-term carcinogenicity studies run on behalf of the U.S. National Toxicology Program. The proposed frequentist prediction intervals are publicly available from the R package predint, whereas R code for the computation of the Bayesian prediction intervals is provided via GitHub.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Semi-supervised Multi-category Classification under Nonparanormality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.03798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning is a model training method that uses both labeled and unlabeled data. This paper proposes a fully Bayes semi-supervised learning algorithm that can be applied to any multi-category classification problem. We assume the labels are missing at random when using unlabeled data in a semi-supervised setting. Suppose we have $K$ classes in the data. We assume that the observations follow $K$ multivariate normal distributions depending on their true class labels after some common unknown transformation is applied to each component of the observation vector. The function is expanded in a B-splines series, and a prior is added to the coefficients. We consider a normal prior on the coefficients and constrain the values to meet the normality and identifiability constraints requirement. The precision matrices of the Gaussian distributions are given a conjugate Wishart prior, while the means are given the improper uniform prior. The resulting posterior is still conditionally conjugate, and the Gibbs sampler aided by a data-augmentation technique can thus be adopted. An extensive simulation study compares the proposed method with several other available methods. The proposed method is also applied to real datasets on diagnosing breast cancer and classification of signals. We conclude that the proposed method has a better prediction accuracy in various cases.</description>

      <title>Causal foundations of bias, disparity and fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of biases, such as gender or racial biases, is an important topic in the social and behavioural sciences. However, the literature does not always clearly define the concept. Definitions of bias are often ambiguous or not provided at all. To study biases in a precise manner, it is important to have a well-defined concept of bias. We propose to define bias as a direct causal effect that is unjustified. We propose to define the closely related concept of disparity as a direct or indirect causal effect that includes a bias. Our proposed definitions can be used to study biases and disparities in a more rigorous and systematic way. We compare our definitions of bias and disparity with various criteria of fairness introduced in the artificial intelligence literature. In addition, we discuss how our definitions relate to discrimination. We illustrate our definitions of bias and disparity in two case studies, focusing on gender bias in science and racial bias in police shootings. Our proposed definitions aim to contribute to a better appreciation of the causal intricacies of studies of biases and disparities. We hope that this will also promote an improved understanding of the policy implications of such studies.</description>

      <title>Time series on compact spaces, with an application to dynamic modeling of relative abundance data in Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the dynamic modeling of relative abundance data in ecology, we introduce a general approach to model stationary Markovian or non Markovian time series on (relatively) compact spaces such as a hypercube, the simplex or a sphere in the Euclidean space. Our approach is based on a general construction of infinite memory models, called chains with complete connections. The two main ingredients involved in our generic construction are a parametric family of probability distributions on the state space and a map from the state space to the parameter space. Our framework encompasses Markovian models, observation-driven models and more general infinite memory models. Simple conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of a stationary and ergodic path are given. We then study in more details statistical inference in two time series models on the simplex, based on either a Dirichlet or a multivariate logistic-normal conditional distribution. Usefulness of our models to analyze abundance data in ecosystems is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Symbolic Regression</title>

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) searches for analytical expressions representing the relationship between a set of explanatory and response variables. Current SR methods assume a single dataset extracted from a single experiment. Nevertheless, frequently, the researcher is confronted with multiple sets of results obtained from experiments conducted with different setups. Traditional SR methods may fail to find the underlying expression since the parameters of each experiment can be different. In this work we present Multi-View Symbolic Regression (MvSR), which takes into account multiple datasets simultaneously, mimicking experimental environments, and outputs a general parametric solution. This approach fits the evaluated expression to each independent dataset and returns a parametric family of functions f(x; theta) simultaneously capable of accurately fitting all datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MvSR using data generated from known expressions, as well as real-world data from astronomy, chemistry and economy, for which an a priori analytical expression is not available. Results show that MvSR obtains the correct expression more frequently and is robust to hyperparameters change. In real-world data, it is able to grasp the group behavior, recovering known expressions from the literature as well as promising alternatives, thus enabling the use of SR to a large range of experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>How Generalizable Is My Behavior Cloning Policy? A Statistical Approach to Trustworthy Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of stochastic generative models in robot policy learning, end-to-end visuomotor policies are increasingly successful at solving complex tasks by learning from human demonstrations. Nevertheless, since real-world evaluation costs afford users only a small number of policy rollouts, it remains a challenge to accurately gauge the performance of such policies. This is exacerbated by distribution shifts causing unpredictable changes in performance during deployment. To rigorously evaluate behavior cloning policies, we present a framework that provides a tight lower-bound on robot performance in an arbitrary environment, using a minimal number of experimental policy rollouts. Notably, by applying the standard stochastic ordering to robot performance distributions, we provide a worst-case bound on the entire distribution of performance (via bounds on the cumulative distribution function) for a given task. We build upon established statistical results to ensure that the bounds hold with a user-specified confidence level and tightness, and are constructed from as few policy rollouts as possible. In experiments we evaluate policies for visuomotor manipulation in both simulation and hardware. Specifically, we (i) empirically validate the guarantees of the bounds in simulated manipulation settings, (ii) find the degree to which a learned policy deployed on hardware generalizes to new real-world environments, and (iii) rigorously compare two policies tested in out-of-distribution settings. Our experimental data, code, and implementation of confidence bounds are open-source.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Basis Functions: Approximate Stationary Models for Large Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In geostatistics, traditional spatial models often rely on the Gaussian Process (GP) to fit stationary covariances to data. It is well known that this approach becomes computationally infeasible when dealing with large data volumes, necessitating the use of approximate methods. A powerful class of methods approximate the GP as a sum of basis functions with random coefficients. Although this technique offers computational efficiency, it does not inherently guarantee a stationary covariance. To mitigate this issue, the basis functions can be "normalized" to maintain a constant marginal variance, avoiding unwanted artifacts and edge effects. This allows for the fitting of nearly stationary models to large, potentially non-stationary datasets, providing a rigorous base to extend to more complex problems. Unfortunately, the process of normalizing these basis functions is computationally demanding. To address this, we introduce two fast and accurate algorithms to the normalization step, allowing for efficient prediction on fine grids. The practical value of these algorithms is showcased in the context of a spatial analysis on a large dataset, where significant computational speedups are achieved. While implementation and testing are done specifically within the LatticeKrig framework, these algorithms can be adapted to other basis function methods operating on regular grids.</description>

      <title>Exploring the difficulty of estimating win probability: a simulation study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating win probability is one of the classic modeling tasks of sports analytics. Many widely used win probability estimators are statistical win probability models, which fit the relationship between a binary win/loss outcome variable and certain game-state variables using data-driven regression or machine learning approaches. To illustrate just how difficult it is to accurately fit a statistical win probability model from noisy and highly correlated observational data, in this paper we conduct a simulation study. We create a simplified random walk version of football in which true win probability at each game-state is known, and we see how well a model recovers it. We find that the dependence structure of observational play-by-play data substantially inflates the bias and variance of estimators and lowers the effective sample size. This makes it essential to quantify uncertainty in win probability estimates, but typical bootstrapped confidence intervals are too narrow and don't achieve nominal coverage. Hence, we introduce a novel method, the fractional bootstrap, to calibrate these intervals to achieve adequate coverage.</description>
