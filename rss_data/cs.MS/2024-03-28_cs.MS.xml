      <title>EinExprs: Contraction Paths of Tensor Networks as Symbolic Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor Networks are graph representations of summation expressions in which vertices represent tensors and edges represent tensor indices or vector spaces. In this work, we present EinExprs.jl, a Julia package for contraction path optimization that offers state-of-art optimizers. We propose a representation of the contraction path of a Tensor Network based on symbolic expressions. Using this package the user may choose among a collection of different methods such as Greedy algorithms, or an approach based on the hypergraph partitioning problem. We benchmark this library with examples obtained from the simulation of Random Quantum Circuits (RQC), a well known example where Tensor Networks provide state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Automated MPI code generation for scalable finite-difference solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial in modelling diverse phenomena across scientific disciplines, including seismic and medical imaging, computational fluid dynamics, image processing, and neural networks. Solving these PDEs on a large scale is an intricate and time-intensive process that demands careful tuning. This paper introduces automated code-generation techniques specifically tailored for distributed memory parallelism (DMP) to solve explicit finite-difference (FD) stencils at scale, a fundamental challenge in numerous scientific applications. These techniques are implemented and integrated into the Devito DSL and compiler framework, a well-established solution for automating the generation of FD solvers based on a high-level symbolic math input. Users benefit from modelling simulations at a high-level symbolic abstraction and effortlessly harnessing HPC-ready distributed-memory parallelism without altering their source code. This results in drastic reductions both in execution time and developer effort. While the contributions of this work are implemented and integrated within the Devito framework, the DMP concepts and the techniques applied are generally applicable to any FD solvers. A comprehensive performance evaluation of Devito's DMP via MPI demonstrates highly competitive weak and strong scaling on the Archer2 supercomputer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in meeting the demands of large-scale scientific simulations.</description>
