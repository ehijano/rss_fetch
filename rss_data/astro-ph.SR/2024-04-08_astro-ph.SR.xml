      <title>The Advective Flux Transport Model: Improving the Far-Side with Active Regions observed by STEREO 304\r{A}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations the Sun's photospheric magnetic field are often confined to the Sun-Earth line. Surface flux transport (SFT) models, such as the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model, simulate the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field to produce magnetic maps over the entire surface of the Sun. While these models are able to evolve active regions that transit the near-side of the Sun, new far-side side flux emergence is typically neglected. We demonstrate a new method for creating improved maps of magnetic field over the Sun's entire photosphere using data obtained by the STEREO mission. The STEREO He II 304 \AA intensity images are used to infer the time, location, and total unsigned magnetic flux of far-side active regions. We have developed and automatic detection algorithm for finding and ingesting new far-side active region emergence into the AFT model. We conduct a series of simulations to investigate the impact of including active region emergence in AFT, both with and without data assimilation of magnetograms. We find that while the He II 304 \AA can be used to improve surface flux models, but care must taken to mitigate intensity surges from flaring events. We estimate that during Solar Cycle 24 maximum (2011-2015), 4-6 x 10^22 Mx of flux is missing from SFT models that do not include far-side data. We find that while He II 304 \AA data alone can be used to create synchronic maps of photospheric magnetic field that resemble the observations, it is insufficient to produce a complete picture without direct magnetic observations from magnetographs.</description>

      <title>Comparative Image Alignment for Multiple Telescopes: ALMA, IRIS, SDO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for aligning solar observations from different telescopes. We utilized helioprojective coordinates from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) as a reference to align images from ALMA and IRIS. The alignment is based on correlation analysis, employing both the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for assessing data correlations. PCC was preferred for its effectiveness with diverse datasets and its computational efficiency compared to SSIM. The alignment demonstrated less than 1.0\,arcsec variation in average centers between the two methods, ensuring consistent results. We illustrate this method using ALMA observations, labeled D06 in the Solar ALMA Science Archive (SALSA), as a case study.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Content of the Young Open Cluster Berkeley 50 (IC 1310)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed the Galactic open cluster Berkeley 50 in order to determine its stellar content, distance, and age. We obtained UBV photometry of 1145 stars in a 12.3' $\times$ 12.3' field, and used Gaia proper motions and parallaxes to identify 64 members, of which we obtained spectra of the 17 brightest members. The majority of the observed population we classified as B dwarfs, with the exception of a newly identified red supergiant star, which our spectroscopy shows has a B-type companion. Our study establishes the distance as 3.8 kpc, with an average color-excess $E(B-V)=0.9$. Comparison of the physical properties of the cluster with the Geneva evolutionary tracks places the age of the cluster as 50-60 Myr, with its most massive members being $\sim7M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the MMRD Relation for Novae in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of a two decade long $R$-band photometric survey of novae in M31 are presented. From these data, $R$-band light curves have been determined for 180 novae with data sufficient for estimating peak brightness and subsequent rate of decline. The data show a weak correlation of peak brightness with fade rate consistent with the well-known Maximum Magnitude versus Rate of Decline (MMRD) relation. As generally appreciated for Galactic novae, the large scatter in the MMRD relation precludes its use in determining distances to individual novae. The novae at maximum light are distributed with standard deviation $\sigma=0.89$ mag about a mean $R$-band absolute magnitude given by $\langle M_R \rangle=-7.57\pm0.07$. The overall M31 luminosity distribution is in excellent agreement with that found for Galactic novae suggesting that the nova populations in M31 and the Galaxy are quite similar. The notion that all novae can be characterized by a standard luminosity 15 d after maximum light ($M_{15}$) is also explored. Surprisingly, the distribution of $M_{15}$ values is characterized by a standard deviation only slightly smaller than that for novae at maximum light and thus offers little promise for precise extragalactic distance determinations. A dozen faint and fast novae that are likely to be previously unidentified recurrent novae have been identified from their position in the MMRD plot and in the $M_{15}$ distribution.</description>

      <title>A born ultramassive white dwarf-hot subdwarf super-Chandrasekhar candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although supernovae is a well-known endpoint of an accreting white dwarf, alternative theoretical possibilities has been discussing broadly, such as the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) event as the endpoint of oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarfs, either accreting up to or merging to excess the Chandrasekhar limit (the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf). AIC is an important channel to form neutron stars, especially for those unusual systems, which are hardly produced by core-collapse supernovae. However, the observational evidences for this theoretical predicted event and its progenitor are all very limited. In all of the known progenitors, white dwarfs increase in mass by accretion. Here, we report the discovery of an intriguing binary system Lan 11, consisted of a stripped core-helium-burning hot subdwarf and an unseen compact object of 1.08 to 1.35 $M_{\odot}$. Our binary population synthesis calculations, along with the absence of detection from the deep radio observations of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope, strongly suggest that the latter is an ONe white dwarf. The total mass of this binary is 1.67 to 1.92 $M_{\odot}$}, significantly excessing the Chandrasekhar limit. The reproduction of its evolutionary history indicates that the unique system has undergone two phases of common envelope ejections, implying a born nature of this massive ONe white dwarf rather than an accretion growth from its companion. These results, together with short orbital period of this binary (3.65 hours), suggest that this system will merge in 500-540 Myr, largely triggering an AIC event, although the possibility of type Ia supernova cannot be fully ruled out. This finding greatly provides valuable constraints on our understanding of stellar endpoints, whatever leading to an AIC or a supernova.</description>

      <title>Seeds and Sequences of Element Abundances in Solar Energetic Particle Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the small "impulsive" events, primarily accelerated during magnetic reconnection in solar jets, have strong enhancements of the abundances of increasingly heavy elements. In contrast, the shock acceleration of ambient coronal plasma in most large "gradual" SEP events produces flat or decreasing abundances vs. element mass-to-charge ratios A/Q. However, heavy-ion enhancements in the largest gradual SEP events can occur in two ways: (1) strong streaming of protons away from the shock amplifies Alfven waves that preferentially scatter and retard protons near the shock while increasingly-heavy ions can leak out, and (2) strong shock waves re-accelerate SEPs fed from persistent impulsive SEP events streaming from some active regions, with their pre-enhanced heavy ions becoming dominant. Power-law fits of abundance enhancements vs. A/Q can distinguish the latter events by the presence of both impulsive and coronal-seed components, and the best-fit charges Q define characteristic source temperatures. Intense impulsively-seeded events can occur in sequences fed from a single persistent active-region as it rotates across the disk of the Sun. Three week-long event sequences, each producing two or three very large events, occur early in the strong solar-cycle 23. The weak solar-cycle 24, produces only one impulsively-seeded event sequence - perhaps a dearth of both impulsive seeds and sufficiently strong shocks. In contrast, there are other active regions where large events alternate SEPs with and without impulsively-seeded sources. We also find that events with moderate Alfven-wave trapping near the shock can release ions slowly or rapidly as a function of A/Q. This A/Q-dependent trapping acts almost as a magnetic spectrometer that separates elements in space and time.</description>

      <title>Gaia21blx: Complete resolution of a binary microlensing event in the Galactic disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Gravitational microlensing is a method that is used to discover planet-hosting systems at distances of several kiloparsec in the Galactic disk and bulge. We present the analysis of a microlensing event reported by the Gaia photometric alert team that might have a bright lens. Aims. In order to infer the mass and distance to the lensing system, the parallax measurement at the position of Gaia21blx was used. In this particular case, the source and the lens have comparable magnitudes and we cannot attribute the parallax measured by Gaia to the lens or source alone. Methods. Since the blending flux is important, we assumed that the Gaia parallax is the flux-weighted average of the parallaxes of the lens and source. Combining this assumption with the information from the microlensing models and the finite source effects we were able to resolve all degeneracies and thus obtained the mass, distance, luminosities and projected kinematics of the binary lens and the source. Results. According to the best model, the lens is a binary system at $2.18 \pm 0.07$ kpc from Earth. It is composed of a G star with $0.95\pm 0.17\,M_{\odot}$ and a K star with $0.53 \pm 0.07 \, M_{\odot}$. The source is likely to be an F subgiant star at $2.38 \pm 1.71$ kpc with a mass of $1.10 \pm 0.18 \, M_{\odot}$. Both lenses and the source follow the kinematics of the thin-disk population. We also discuss alternative models, that are disfavored by the data or by prior expectations, however.</description>

      <title>A model for heating the super-hot corona in solar active regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What physical mechanisms heat the outer solar or stellar atmosphere to million-Kelvin temperatures is a fundamental but long-standing open question. In particular, the solar corona in active region cores contains an even hotter component reaching ten million Kelvin, manifesting as persistent coronal loops in extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray images, which imposes a more stringent energy budget. Here, we present a self-consistent coronal heating model using a state-of-the-art three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We find that the continuous magnetic flux emergence in active regions keeps driving magnetic reconnections that release energy impulsively but, on time average, persistently. As a result, numerous sub-structures are heated to ten million Kelvin and then evolve independently, which collectively form long-lived and stable coronal loops as in observations. This provides a heating model explaining the origin of the super-hot coronal plasma and the persistence of hot coronal loops in emerging active regions.</description>

      <title>The Galactic bulge exploration II. Line-of-sight velocity templates for single-mode RR~Lyrae stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new set of tools to derive systemic velocities for single-mode RR~Lyrae stars from visual and near-infrared spectra. We derived scaling relations and line-of-sight velocity templates using both APOGEE and {\it Gaia} spectroscopic products combined with photometric $G$-band amplitudes. We provide a means to estimate systemic velocities for the RR~Lyrae subclasses, RRab and RRc. Our analysis indicates that the scaling relation between the photometric and line-of-sight velocity amplitudes is nonlinear, with a break in a linear relation occurring around 0.4mag in both the $V$-band and $G$-band amplitudes. We did not observe such a break in the relation for the first-overtone pulsators. Using stellar pulsation models, we further confirm and examine the nonlinearity in scaling relation for the RRab subclass. We observed little to no variation with stellar parameters (mass, metallicity, and luminosity) in the scaling relation between the photometric and line-of-sight velocity amplitudes for fundamental-mode pulsators. We observed an offset in the scaling relation between the observations and stellar pulsation models, mainly in the low-amplitude RR~Lyrae regime. This offset disappears when different sets of convective parameters are used. Thus, the Fourier amplitudes obtained from the photometry and line-of-sight velocity measurements can be utilized to constrain convective parameters of stellar pulsation models. The scaling relations and templates for APOGEE and {\it Gaia} data accurately predict systemic velocities compared to literature values. In addition, our tools derived from the {\it Gaia} spectra improve the precision of the derived systemic velocities by approximately 50 percent and provide a better description of the uncertainty distribution in comparison with previous studies. Our newly derived tools will be used for RR~Lyrae variables observed toward the Galactic bulge.</description>

      <title>Accretion Funnel Reconfiguration during an Outburst in a Young Stellar Object: EX Lupi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EX Lupi, a low-mass young stellar object, went into an accretion-driven outburst in March of 2022. The outburst caused a sudden phase change of ~ 112$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 5$^{\circ}$ in periodically oscillating multiband lightcurves. Our high resolution spectra obtained with HRS on SALT also revealed a consistent phase change in the periodically varying radial velocities, along with an increase in the radial velocity amplitude of various emission lines. The phase change and increase of radial velocity amplitude morphologically translates to a change in the azimuthal and latitudinal location of the accretion hotspot over the stellar surface, which indicates a reconfiguration of the accretion funnel geometry. Our 3D MHD simulations reproduce the phase change for EX Lupi. To explain the observations we explored the possibility of forward shifting of the dipolar accretion funnel as well as the possibility of an emergence of a new accretion funnel. During the outburst, we also found evidence of the hotspot's morphology extending azimuthally, asymmetrically with a leading hot edge and cold tail along the stellar rotation. Our high cadence photometry showed that the accretion flow has clumps. We also detected possible clumpy accretion events in the HRS spectra, that showed episodically highly blue-shifted wings in the Ca II IRT and Balmer H lines.</description>

      <title>PHL 5038AB: Is the brown dwarf causing pollution of its white dwarf host star?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new results on PHL 5038AB, a widely separated binary system composed of a white dwarf and a brown dwarf, refining the white and brown dwarf parameters and determining the binary separation to be $66^{+12}_{-24}$~AU. New spectra of the white dwarf show calcium absorption lines suggesting the hydrogen-rich atmosphere is weakly polluted, inferring the presence of planetesimals in the system, which we determine are in an S-type orbit around the white dwarf in orbits closer than 17-32 AU. We do not detect any infrared excess that would indicate the presence of a disc, suggesting all dust present has either been totally accreted or is optically thin. In this system, we suggest the metal pollution in the white dwarf atmosphere can be directly attributed to the presence of the brown dwarf companion disrupting the orbits of planetesimals within the system.</description>

      <title>Origin and Properties of the Near Subsonic Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify and examine the solar wind intervals near the sonic critical point (i.e., $M_S \sim 1$) observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The near subsonic wind intervals show similar properties: a low density, an extremely low velocity, a low proton temperature, and essentially no magnetic field deflections compared with the surrounding solar wind. The extremely low velocity is the primary contributor to the near crossing of the sonic critical point rather than the sound speed, which is roughly constant in these intervals. Source tracing with a potential field source surface (PFSS) model suggests that the near subsonic intervals all connect to the boundaries inside coronal holes. Heliospheric current sheet (HCS) and partial HCS crossings around the near subsonic intervals indicate that the near subsonic wind is a transition layer between the slow and fast wind. The above scenario is consistent with the nature of the near subsonic wind as a low Mach-number boundary layer (LMBL), which facilitates the crossing of the sonic critical point at 15-20 $R_S$. Moreover, we find a dependence of the amplitude of switchbacks on the radial sonic Mach number. Magnetic field deflections essentially disappear near the sonic critical point, which suggests that switchbacks originate from above the sonic critical point.</description>

      <title>Horizontally and vertically polarized kink oscillations in curved solar coronal loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kink oscillations are frequently observed in coronal loops. This work aims to numerically clarify the influence of loop curvature on horizontally and vertically polarized kink oscillations. Working within the framework of ideal MHD, we conduct 3D simulations of axial fundamental kink oscillations in curved density-enhanced loops embedded in a potential magnetic field. Both horizontal and vertical polarizations are examined, and their oscillation frequencies are compared with WKB expectations. We discriminate two different density specifications. In the first (dubbed"uniform-density"), the density is axially uniform and varies continuously in the transverse direction toward a uniform ambient corona. Some further stratification is implemented in the second specification (dubbed"stratified"), allowing us to address the effect of evanescent barriers. Examining the oscillating profiles of the initially perturbed uniform-density loops, we found that the frequencies for both polarizations deviate from the WKB expectation by $\sim 10\%$. In the stratified loop, however, the frequency of the horizontal polarization deviates to a larger extent ($\sim 25\%$). We illustrate the lateral leakage of kink modes through wave tunnelling in 3D simulations, for the first time. Despite this, in both loops, the damping time-to-period ratios are similar and close to the analytical predictions for straight configurations under the thin-tube-thin-boundary (TTTB) assumption. The WKB expectation for straight configurations can reasonably describe the eigenfrequency of kink oscillations only in loops without an asymmetrical cross-loop density profile perpendicular to the oscillating direction. Lateral leakage via wave tunnelling is found to be less efficient than resonant absorption, meaning that the latter remains a robust damping mechanism for kink motions even when loop curvature is included.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption of Planetesimals from an Eccentric Debris Disk Following a White Dwarf Natal Kick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surfaces of many white dwarfs are polluted by metals, implying a recent accretion event. The tidal disruption of planetesimals is a viable source of white dwarf pollution and offers a unique window into the composition of exoplanet systems. The question of how planetary material enters the tidal disruption radius of the white dwarf is currently unresolved. Using a series of $N$-body simulations, we explore the response of the surrounding planetesimal debris disk as the white dwarf receives a natal kick caused by anisotropic mass loss on the asymptotic giant branch. We find that the kick can form an apse-aligned, eccentric debris disk in the range 30 to 240 AU which corresponds to the orbits of Neptune, the Kuiper Belt, and the scattered disk in our solar system. In addition, many planetesimals beyond 240 AU flip to counter-rotating orbits. Assuming an isotropic distribution of kicks, we predict that approximately 80% of white dwarf debris disks should exhibit significant apsidal alignment and fraction of counter-rotating orbits. The eccentric disk is able to efficiently and continuously torque planetesimals onto radial, star-grazing orbits. We show that the kick causes both an initial burst in tidal disruption events as well as an extended period of 100 Myr where tidal disruption rates are consistent with observed mass accretion rates on polluted white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations favor a pure deflagration origin of the near-Chandrasekhar mass supernova remnant 3C 397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suzaku X-ray observations of the Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) 3C 397 discovered exceptionally high mass ratios of Mn/Fe, Ni/Fe, and Cr/Fe, consistent with a near $M_{\rm Ch}$ progenitor white dwarf (WD). The Suzaku observations have established 3C 397 as our best candidate for a near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ SNR Ia, and opened the way to address additional outstanding questions about the origin and explosion mechanism of these transients. In particular, subsequent XMM-Newton observations revealed an unusually clumpy distribution of iron group elemental (IGE) abundances within the ejecta of 3C 397. In this paper, we undertake a suite of two dimensional hydrodynamical models, varying both the explosion mechanism -- either deflagration-to-detonation (DDT), or pure deflagration -- WD progenitors, and WD progenitor metallicity, and analyze their detailed nucleosynthetic abundances and associated clumping. We find that pure deflagrations naturally give rise to clumpy distributions of neutronized species concentrated towards the outer limb of the remnant, and confirm DDTs have smoothly structured ejecta with a central concentration of neutronization. Our findings indicate that 3C 397 was most likely a pure deflagration of a high central density WD. We discuss a range of implications of these findings for the broader SN Ia progenitor problem.</description>

      <title>Long-term variability in debris transiting white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining archival photometric observations from multiple large-area surveys spanning the past 17 years, we detect long-term variability in the light curves of ZTFJ032833.52-121945.27 (ZTFJ0328-1219), ZTFJ092311.41+423634.16 (ZTFJ0923+4236) and WD1145+017, all known to exhibit transits from planetary debris. ZTFJ0328-1219 showed an overall fading in brightness from 2011 through to 2015, with a maximum dimming of ~0.3 mag, and still remains ~0.1 mag fainter compared to 2006. We complement the analysis of the long-term behaviour of these systems with high-speed photometry. In the case of ZTFJ0923+4236 and WD1145+017, the time-series photometry exhibits vast variations in the level of transit activity, both in terms of numbers of transits, as well as their shapes and depths, and these variations correlate with the overall brightness of the systems. Inspecting the current known sample of white dwarfs with transiting debris, we estimate that similar photometric signatures may be detectable in one in a few hundred of all white dwarfs. Accounting for the highly aligned geometry required to detect transits, our estimates imply that a substantial fraction of all white dwarfs exhibiting photospheric metal pollution from accreted debris host close-in planetesimals that are currently undergoing disintegration.</description>

      <title>Constraining free-free emission and photoevaporative mass loss rates for known proplyds and new VLA-identified candidate proplyds in NGC 1977</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations covering the NGC 1977 region at 3.0, 6.4, and 15.0 GHz. We search for compact radio sources and detect continuum emission from 34 NGC 1977 cluster members and 37 background objects. Of the 34 radio-detected cluster members, 3 are associated with known proplyds in NGC 1977, 22 are associated with additional young stellar objects in NGC 1977, and 9 are newly-identified cluster members. We examine the radio spectral energy distributions, circular polarization, and variability of the detected NGC 1977 sources, and identify 10 new candidate proplyds whose radio fluxes are dominated by optically thin free-free emission. We use measurements of free-free emission to calculate the mass-loss rates of known proplyds and new candidate proplyds in NGC 1977, and find values $\sim10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which are lower than the mass-loss rates measured towards proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster, but consistent with the mass-loss rates predicted by external photoevaporation models for spatially-extended disks that are irradiated by the typical external UV fields encountered in NGC 1977. Finally, we show that photoevaporative disk winds in NGC 1977 may be illuminated by internal or external sources of ionization, depending on their positions within the cluster. This study provides new constraints on disk properties in a clustered star-forming region with a weaker UV environment than the Orion Nebula Cluster, but a stronger UV environment than low-mass star-forming regions like Taurus. Such intermediate UV environments represent the typical conditions of Galactic star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>First ALMA observations of the HD 105211 debris disc: A warm dust component close to a gigayear-old star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most debris discs consist of a gas-poor, cold dust belt located tens to hundreds of astronomical units away from the host star. Many cold dust belts exhibit distinct structures attributed to the dynamic interaction of planetary systems. Moreover, in a few systems, additional warm components can be found closer to the central star, resembling the asteroid belt or zodiacal dust in our Solar System. In this work, we investigate the structure of the disc surrounding the nearby F2V star HD 105211, which has a warm excess and a potential asymmetry in the cold belt. We applied the CASA pipeline to obtain the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images. Then we constructed the SED and performed MCMC simulations to fit a model to the ALMA visibility data. To characterise the disc asymmetry, we analysed the ALMA images of two individual observation blocks and compared them to the previous Herschel images. Our modelling reveals that the disc is a narrow ring (23.6+-4.6 au) with low eccentricity positioned at a distance of 133.7+-1.6 au from the central star, which differs from the broad disc (100+-20 au) starting at an inner edge of 87+-2.5 au, inferred from the Herschel images. We found that both observation blocks show excess emission at the stellar position, while OB1 shows an offset between the star and the phase centre, and OB2 shows brightness clumps. We used a two-temperature model to fit the infrared SED and used the ALMA detection to constrain the warm component to a nearly pure blackbody model. The relatively low ratio of actual radius to blackbody radius of the HD105211 debris disc indicates that this system is depleted in small grains, which could indicate that it is dynamically cold. The excess emission from the stellar position suggests that there should be a warm mm-sized dust component close to the star, for which we suggest two possible origins: in situ asteroid belt or comet delivery.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation of Type Ia Supernova Spectra into the Near-Infrared Using PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method of extrapolating the spectroscopic behavior of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength regime up to 2.30 $\mu$m using optical spectroscopy. Such a process is useful for accurately estimating K-corrections and other photometric quantities of SNe Ia in the NIR. Principal component analysis is performed on data consisting of Carnegie Supernova Project I &amp; II optical and near-infrared FIRE spectra to produce models capable of making these extrapolations. This method differs from previous spectral template methods by not parameterizing models strictly by photometric light-curve properties of SNe Ia, allowing for more flexibility of the resulting extrapolated NIR flux. A difference of around -3.1% to -2.7% in the total integrated NIR flux between these extrapolations and the observations is seen here for most test cases including Branch core-normal and shallow-silicon subtypes. However, larger deviations from the observation are found for other tests, likely due to the limited high-velocity and broad-line SNe Ia in the training sample. Maximum-light principal components are shown to allow for spectroscopic predictions of the color-stretch light-curve parameter, $s_{BV}$, within approximately $\pm$0.1 units of the value measured with photometry. We also show these results compare well with NIR templates, although in most cases the templates are marginally more fitting to observations, illustrating a need for more concurrent optical+NIR spectroscopic observations to truly understand the diversity of SNe Ia in the NIR.</description>

      <title>The spin, expansion and contraction of open star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical constraints on the internal dynamics of open clusters are important for understanding their evolution and evaporation. High precision astrometry from Gaia DR3 are thus useful to observe aspects of the cluster dynamics. This work aims to identify dynamically peculiar clusters such as spinning and expanding clusters. We also quantify the spin frequency and expansion rate and compare them with $N$-body models to identify the origins of the peculiarities. We used the latest Gaia DR3 and archival spectroscopic surveys to analyse the radial velocities and proper motions of the cluster members in 1379 open clusters. A systematic analysis of synthetic clusters is performed to demonstrate the observability of the cluster spin along with effects of observational uncertainties. $N$-body simulations were used to understand the evolution of cluster spin and expansion for initially non-rotating clusters. We identified spin signatures in 10 clusters (and 16 candidates). Additionally, we detected expansion in 18 clusters and contraction in 3 clusters. The expansion rate is compatible with previous theoretical estimates based on expulsion of residual gas. The orientation of the spin axis is independent of the orbital angular momentum. The spin frequencies are much larger than what is expected from simulated initially non-rotating clusters. This indicates that &gt;1% of the clusters are born rotating and/or they have undergone strong interactions. Higher precision observations are required to increase the sample of such dynamically peculiar clusters and to characterise them.</description>

Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to study both the Interstellar Medium (ISM) and the young stellar population in the three star-forming regions, namely IRAS 05137+3919, 05168+3634, and 19110+1045. The study of the ISM includes determination of the hydrogen column density (N(H_2)) and dust temperature (T_d) in the regions using Modified blackbody fitting. The main parameters of identified and classified young stellar objects (YSOs) belonging to the regions were determined comparing with the radiation transfer models. We also constructed a colour-magnitude diagram to compare the parameters of the YSOs with the results of the radiative transfer models. The three stellar populations appear to have formed under different scenarios. In the cases of IRAS 05137+3919 and IRAS 05168+3634, the age spread is considerably wider, suggesting that the stellar population likely emerged from independent condensations. In contrast, the third region comprises a pair of ultra-compact HII regions (UCHIIs), G45.12+0.13 and G45.07+0.13, with a notably smaller age spread. This hints at the possibility that these clusters originated from a single triggering event.</description>

      <title>Differential reddening in 48 globular clusters: An end to the quest for the intracluster medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For decades, it has been theorized that a tenuous but detectable intracluster medium should be present in globular clusters, which is continuously replenished by the gas and dust ejected by bright giants and periodically cleared by interactions with the Galactic disk. However, dedicated searches, especially in infrared and radio wavelengths, have returned mostly upper limits, which are lower than theoretical expectations by several orders of magnitude. We profited from recent wide-field photometry for 48 Galactic globular clusters to compute high-resolution maps of differential reddening, which can be used to correct any photometric catalog in these areas for reddening variations. Using 3D reddening maps from the literature, we evaluated the amount of foreground extinction. This allowed us to estimate the masses of the intracluster medium in our sample clusters, with an accuracy of one order of magnitude. Our estimates agree with the few available literature detections and with theoretical expectations. Because the discrepancy between observations and expectations only concerns literature upper limits, we explored possible reasons why they could be underestimated and we show that two recent discoveries can explain the discrepancy. The first is the recent discovery that the intracluster medium in 47 Tuc is not centrally concentrated. This is also supported by our maps, which in the majority of cases do not show a central reddening concentration. The second is the discovery that the dust in metal-poor ([Fe/H] less than about -1 dex) globular clusters is dominated by iron grains rather than silicates, which undermines previous dust mass estimates from observed upper limits. We conclude that current evidence, including our maps, does not contradict theoretical expectations and the problem of the missing intracluster medium is no longer an issue.</description>

      <title>Thermal Structure Determines Kinematics: Vertical Shear Instability in Stellar Irradiated Protoplanetary Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is crucial for protoplanetary disk dynamics, and Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism in outer disk regions to generate turbulence. We use Athena++ radiation module to study VSI in full and transition disks, accounting for radiation transport and stellar irradiation. We find that the thermal structure and cooling timescale significantly influence VSI behavior. The inner rim location and radial optical depth affect disk kinematics. Compared with previous vertically-isothermal simulations, our full disk and transition disks with small cavities have a superheated atmosphere and cool midplane with long cooling timescales, which suppresses the corrugation mode and the associated meridional circulation. This temperature structure also produces a strong vertical shear at $\mathrm{\tau_*}$ = 1, producing an outgoing flow layer at $\tau_* &lt; 1$ on top of an ingoing flow layer at $\tau_* \sim 1$. The midplane becomes less turbulent, while the surface becomes more turbulent with effective $\alpha$ reaching $\sim10^{-2}$ at $\tau_* \lesssim$1. This large surface stress drives significant surface accretion, producing substructures. Using temperature and cooling time measured/estimated from radiation-hydro simulations, we demonstrate that less computationally-intensive simulations incorporating simple orbital cooling can almost reproduce radiation-hydro results. By generating synthetic images, we find that substructures are more pronounced in disks with larger cavities. The higher velocity dispersion at the gap edge could also slow particle settling. Both properties are consistent with recent Near-IR and ALMA observations. Our simulations predict that regions with significant temperature changes are accompanied by significant velocity changes, which can be tested by ALMA kinematics/chemistry observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution Doppler spectroscopy provides an avenue to study the atmosphere of both transiting and non-transiting planets. This powerful method has also yielded some of the most robust atmospheric detections to date. Currently, high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy detects atmospheric signals by cross-correlating observed data with a model atmospheric spectrum. This technique has been successful in detecting various molecules such as H2O, CO, HCN and TiO, as well as several atomic species. Here we present an alternative method of performing high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy, using a technique known as Doppler tomography. We present an analysis of HD 179949 b using Doppler tomography and provide Doppler tomograms confirming previous detections of CO at 2.3 microns, and H2O at both 2.3 microns, and 3.5 microns within the atmosphere of HD 179949 b, showing significantly lower background noise levels when compared to cross-correlation methods applied to the same data. We also present a novel detection of H2O at 2.1 microns, as well as a tentative detection of CO on the night side of the planet at 2.3 microns. This represents the first observational evidence for molecular absorption in the night-side emission spectrum of an exoplanet using Doppler spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Optimized Bandpasses for the Habitable Worlds Observatory's ExoEarth Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary scientific goal of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory will be the direct detection and characterization of Earth-like planets. Estimates of the exoplanet yields for this concept will help guide mission design through detailed trade studies. It is therefore critical that yield estimation codes optimally adapt observations to the mission's performance parameters to ensure accurate trade studies. To aid in this, we implement wavelength optimization in yield calculations for the first time, allowing the yield code to determine the ideal detection and characterization bandpasses. We use this new capability to confirm the observational wavelength assumptions made for the LUVOIR-B study, namely that the optimum detection wavelength is 500 nm for the majority of targets and the optimum wavelength to detect water is near 1000 nm, given LUVOIR-B's assumed instrument performance parameters. We show that including the wavelength dependent albedo of an Earth twin as a prior provides no significant benefit to the yields of exoEarth candidates and caution against tuning observations to modern Earth twins. We also show that coronagraphs whose inner working angles are similar to step functions may benefit from wavelength optimization and demonstrate how wavelength-dependent instrument performance can impact the optimum wavelengths for detection and characterization. The optimization methods we implement automate wavelength selection and remove uncertainties regarding these choices, helping to adapt the observations to the instrument's performance parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study we estimate the stellar ages of LAMOST DR8 Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars based on the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm (GBDT). We used 2,643 RGB stars extracted from the APOKASC-2 astero-seismological catalog as training data-set. After selecting the parameterses ([$\alpha$/Fe], [C/Fe], T$_{eff}$, [N/Fe], [C/H], log g) highly correlated with age using GBDT, we apply the same GBDT method to the new catalog of more than 590,000 stars classified as RGB stars. The test data-set shows that the median relative error is around 11.6$\%$ for the method. We also compare the predicted ages of RGB stars with other studies (e.g., based on APOGEE), and find systematic differences. The final uncertainty is about 15 to 30$\%$ compared to open clusters' ages. Then we present the spatial distribution of the RGB sample having an age determination, which could recreate the expected result, and discuss systematic biases. All these diagnostics show that one can apply the GBDT method to other stellar samples to estimate atmospheric parameters and age.</description>

      <title>Pulsation Phases and Mode Identification of Tidally Excited Oscillations in Fourteen Kepler Heartbeat Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) in Heartbeat Stars (HBSs) are an essential probe of the internal properties of the systems, but their potential has yet to be fully exploited. Based on the orbital parameters of TEO candidates from our previous works, we identify the pulsation phases and amplitudes of TEOs in fourteen Kepler HBSs. Most pulsation phases of most systems can be explained by the dominant being $l=2$, $m=0$, or $\pm2$ spherical harmonic, assuming that the spin and orbital axes are aligned, and the pulsations are adiabatic and standing waves. The largest deviation ($&gt;6\sigma$) occurs in KIC 8459354, which can be explained by the spin-orbit misalignment, and KIC 5877364 has a similar scenario. For KIC 11122789, almost half of the harmonics show large deviations; we cautiously suggest that these harmonics may not be considered TEO candidates. A similar scenario also exists in KIC 6290740. This phases and mode identification approach can also be used inversely to verify the TEO candidates derived by the Fourier analysis. Furthermore, the harmonics with large deviations ($&gt;2\sigma$) in KIC 4377638, KIC 5090937, and KIC 11403032 can be expected to be travelling waves rather than standing waves. In addition, we also suggest that the apsidal motion could cause large deviations in TEO phases from theoretical values.</description>

      <title>Expansion of accreting main-sequence stars during rapid mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting main-sequence stars expand significantly when the mass accretion timescale is much shorter than their thermal timescales. This occurs during mass transfer from an evolved giant star onto a main-sequence companion in a binary system, and is an important phase in the formation of compact binaries including X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables, and gravitational-wave sources. In this study, we compute 1D stellar models of main-sequence accretors with different initial masses and accretion rates. The calculations are used to derive semi-analytical approximations to the maximum expansion radius. We assume that mass transfer remains fully conservative as long as the inflated accretor fits within its Roche lobe, leading stars to behave like hamsters, stuffing excess material behind their expanding cheeks. We suggest a physically motivated prescription for the mass growth of such "hamstars", which can be used to determine mass-transfer efficiency in rapid binary population synthesis models. With this prescription, we estimate that progenitors of high-mass X-ray binaries and gravitational-wave sources may have experienced highly non-conservative mass transfer. In contrast, for low-mass accretors, the accretion timescale can exceed the thermal timescale by a larger factor without causing significant radial expansion.</description>

      <title>Formation of long-period post-common-envelope binaries II. Explaining the self-lensing binary KOI 3278</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast majority of close binaries containing a compact object form through common-envelope (CE) evolution. Despite this importance, we struggle to even understand the energy budget of CE evolution. For decades, observed long-period post-CE binaries have been interpreted as evidence for additional energies to contribute during CE evolution. We have recently shown that this argument is based on simplified assumptions for all long-period post-CE binaries containing massive white dwarfs. The only remaining post-CE binary star that has been claimed to require contributions from additional energy sources to understand its formation is KOI 3278. Here we address in detail the potential evolutionary history of KOI 3278. In particular, we investigated whether extra energy sources, such as recombination energy, are indeed required to explain its existence. We used the 1D stellar evolution code MESA to carry out binary evolution simulations and searched for potential formation pathways for KOI 3278 that are able to explain its observed properties. We found that KOI 3278 can be explained if the white dwarf progenitor filled its Roche lobe during a helium shell flash. In this case, the orbital period of KOI 3278 can be reproduced if the CE binding energy is calculated taking into account gravitational energy and thermodynamic internal energy. While the CE evolution that led to the formation of KOI 3278 must have been efficient, that is, most of the available orbital energy must have been used to unbind the CE, recombination energy is not required. We conclude that currently not a single observed post-CE binary requires to assume energy sources other than gravitational and thermodynamic energy to contribute to CE evolution. KOI 3278, however, remains an intriguing post-CE binary as, unlike its siblings, understanding its existence requires highly efficient CE ejection.</description>

      <title>Spectral Libraries for Analyzing Spectra of Low-Metalicity Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a set of isochrone-tailored spectral libraries for analyzing composite spectra of low-metallicity massive star clusters or starburst galaxies. Specifically, we have computed non-LTE spectra for stars of all initial masses for isochrones at metallicities, Z=0.006, 0.002,and 0.0004, with and without considering rotation. These isochrones were constructed by the Geneva group (Ekstr\"{o}m et al., 2011; Georgy et al., 2013; Groh et al., 2019; Eggenberger et al. 2020). We also present a Python program for integrating individual spectra for an arbitrary initial mass function.</description>

      <title>A Computational Model for Ion and Electron Energization during Macroscale Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of equations are developed that extend the macroscale magnetic reconnection simulation model kglobal to include particle ions. The extension from earlier versions of kglobal, which included only particle electrons, requires the inclusion of the inertia of particle ions in the fluid momentum equation, which was not required in the electron-only model. The new equations will facilitate the exploration of the simultaneous non-thermal energization of ions and electrons during magnetic reconnection in macroscale systems. Numerical tests of the propagation of Alfv\'en waves in a plasma with anisotropic electron and ion pressure are presented to benchmark the new model.</description>
