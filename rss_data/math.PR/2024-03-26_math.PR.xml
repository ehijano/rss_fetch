      <title>Set-Valued Stochastic Differential Equations with Unbounded Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly focus on the set-valued (stochastic) analysis on the space of convex, closed, but possibly unbounded sets, and try to establish a useful theoretical framework for studying the set-valued stochastic differential equations with unbounded coefficients. The space that we will be focusing on are convex, closed sets that are "generated" by a given cone, in the sense that the Hausdorff distance of all elements to the "generating" cone is finite. Such space should in particular include the so-called "upper sets", and has many useful cases in finance, such as the well-known set-valued risk measures, as well as the solvency cone in some super-hedging problems. We shall argue that, for such a special class of unbounded sets, under some conditions, the cancellation law is still valid, eliminating a major obstacle for extending the set-valued analysis to non-compact sets. We shall establish some basic algebraic and topological properties of such spaces, and show that some standard techniques will again be valid in studying the set-valued SDEs with unbounded (drift) coefficients which, to the best of our knowledge, is new.</description>

      <title>Measure comparison problems for dilations of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a version of the Busemann-Petty problem for $\log$-concave measures with additional information about dilates. One of our main tools is a an analog of of the classical large deviation principle to the case of $\log$-concave measures depending on a norm of a convex body, which we hope will be of independent interest.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to obtain the existence and uniqueness of $L^p$-solution to quantum stochastic differential equation driven by Fermion fields with nonlocal conditions in the case of non-Lipschitz coefficients for $p&gt;2$. The key to our technique is to make use of the Burkholder-Gundy inequality given by Pisier and Xu and Minkowski-type inequality to iterate instead of the fixed point theorem commonly used for nonlocal problems. Moreover, we also obtain the self-adjointness of the $L^p$-solution which is important in the study of optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Comparison Principles for Stochastic Volterra equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a comparison principle for stochastic Volterra equations with respect to the initial condition and the drift $b$ applicable to a wide class of Volterra kernels and driving forces $g$ that may be singular in zero. For completely monotone Volterra kernels such a result holds without any further restrictions, while for not completely monotone kernels it is shown that such a principle fails unless the drift is additionally monotone. As a side-product of our results, we also complement the literature on the weak existence of continuous nonnegative solutions. This covers the rough Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process with singular initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Balancing art and money in pursuit of a Kelly-type optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a mathematical model of an art collector. In our model, the collector is a rational agent whose actions in the art market are driven by two competing long-term objectives, namely sustainable financial health and maintaining the collection. Mathematically, our model is a two-dimensional random linear dynamical system with transformation matrix of a peculiar type. In some examples we are able to show that within the Kelly-type optimization paradigm, that is optimizing the system's Lyapunov exponent over a set of policy parameters, the dilemma ``art or money" can be successfully resolved, namely the optimal policy creates a coexistence equilibrium where the value of both is increasing over the time.</description>

      <title>Putting all eggs in one basket: some insights from a correlation inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give examples of situations -- stochastic production, military tactics, corporate merger -- where it is beneficial to concentrate risk rather than to diversify it, that is, to put all eggs in one basket. Our examples admit a dual interpretation: as optimal strategies of a single player (the `principal') or, alternatively, as dominant strategies in a non-cooperative game with multiple players (the `agents').
  The key mathematical result can be formulated in terms of a convolution structure on the set of increasing functions on a Boolean lattice (the lattice of subsets of a finite set). This generalizes the well-known Harris inequality from statistical physics and discrete mathematics; we give a simple self-contained proof of this result, and prove a further generalization based on the game-theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Markovian projections for It\^o semimartingales with jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a general It\^o semimartingale, its Markovian projection is an It\^o process, with Markovian differential characteristics, that matches the one-dimensional marginal laws of the original process. We construct Markovian projections for It\^o semimartingales with jumps, whose flows of one-dimensional marginal laws are solutions to non-local Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations (FPKEs). As an application, we show how Markovian projections appear in building calibrated diffusion/jump models with both local and stochastic features.</description>

      <title>On the Navier-Stokes equations and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation on the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new derivation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ via the Bellman dynamic programming principle on the infinite dimensional group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms $G={\rm SDiff}(M)$. In particular, when the viscosity vanishes, we give a new derivation of the incompressible Euler equation on a compact Riemannian manifold. The main result of this paper indicates an interesting relationship between the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $M$ and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation on $G={\rm SDiff}(M)$.</description>

Abstract: For the deformed complex Ginibre ensemble with a mean normal matrix, under certain assumptions on the mean matrix we prove that the same bulk statistics holds as in the complex Ginibre matrix bulk. This is the continuation of the previous joint papers ``Critical edge statistics for deformed GinUEs Preprint arXiv: 2311.13227v1'' and ``Repeated erfc statistics for deformed GinUEs Preprint arXiv: 2402.14362'', which deal with local eigenvalue statistics at the edge.</description>

      <title>Rearranged Stochastic Heat Equation: Ergodicity and Related Gradient Descent on the Space of Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a case study for a recently introduced diffusion in the space of probability measures over the reals, namely rearranged stochastic heat, which solves a stochastic partial differential equation valued in the set of symmetrised quantile functions over the unit circle. Probability measure-valued flows perturbed by this noise are studied, with a special focus on gradient flows. This is done by introducing a drift to the rearranged stochastic heat equation by means of a vector field from the set of random variables over the unit circle into itself. When the flow is a gradient flow, the vector field may coincide with the Wasserstein derivative of a mean-field potential function, as defined in Lions' approach to the differential calculus on the space of probability measures. The resulting equation reads as a sort of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation with an infinite dimensional common noise. Conditions on the drift are provided, under which solutions exist uniquely for any time horizon and converge exponentially fast towards a unique equilibrium. When the drift derives from a potential on the space of probability measures, some metastability properties are obtained as the intensity of the noise is tuned to zero: it is shown that under a particular scaling regime, the gradient descent lingers near local minimizers for expected times of the same order as in the finite dimensional setting. Interestingly, in order to accommodate a wider class of potentials, such as the square of the second Wasserstein distance, a weaker notion of derivative is defined over the subspace of symmetrised quantile functions.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Game of Mutual Holding with common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the mean field game of cross--holding introduced in \citeauthor*{DjeteTouzi} \cite{DjeteTouzi} in the context where the equity value dynamics are affected by a common noise. In contrast with \cite{DjeteTouzi}, the problem exhibits the standard paradigm of mean--variance trade off. Our crucial observation is to search for equilibrium solutions of our mean field game among those models which satisfy an appropriate notion of no--arbitrage. Under this condition, it follows that the representative agent optimization step is reduced to a standard portfolio optimization problem with random endowment.</description>

      <title>Road layout in the KPZ class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a road layout and traffic model, based on last passage percolation (LPP). An easy naive argument shows that coalescence of traffic trajectories is essential to be considered when observing traffic networks around us. This is a fundamental feature in first passage percolation (FPP) models where nearby geodesics naturally coalesce in search of the easiest passage through the landscape. Road designers seek the same in pursuing cost savings, hence FPP geodesics are straightforward candidates to model road layouts. Unfortunately no detailed knowledge is rigorously available on FPP geodesics. To address this, we use exponential LPP instead to build a stochastic model of road traffic and prove certain characteristics thereof. Cars start from every point of the lattice and follow half-infinite geodesics in random directions. Exponential LPP is known to be in the KPZ universality class and it is widely expected that FPP shares very similar properties, hence our findings should equally apply to FPP-based modelling. We address several traffic-related quantities of this model and compare our theorems to real life road networks.</description>

      <title>Accumulated spectrograms for hyperuniform determinantal point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the accumulated spectrogram associated to a locally trace class orthogonal projection operator and to a bounded set using the polar decomposition of its restriction on that set and prove a convergence theorem for accumulated spectrograms along an exhaustion in the case when the corresponding determinantal point process is hyperuniform. We prove that a radial determinantal point process on Rd is always hyperuniform along the exhaustion formed by the dilations of a bounded open set, and as a consequence, we obtain that dilations of the corresponding accumulated spectrogram converge to the indicator function of the considered set, establishing thus a universal phenomenon. Our result is a generalisation of a theorem by Abreu-Gr\"ochenig-Romero in [1] concerning time-frequency localization operators.</description>

      <title>Transient Waiting Time Distributions in Small Call Centres with Skills-Based Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many call centres are subject to service level agreements that stipulate that they must achieve targets in terms of the proportion of calls that are answered within a specified time. In order to manage a centre so that targets like these are met, we need to have a method of calculating the waiting time distributions experienced by customers. In this paper, we provide such a method for small call centres that employ skills-based routing. We first build the methodology for the single-skill case and then extend it to a multi-skill case. We model the call centre system as a continuous-time Markov chain and then make use of the Laplace transform to calculate the relevant quantities. We later demonstrate the use of this method to find the optimal routing policy in a certain class of policies.</description>

      <title>Multinomial random combinatorial structures and $r$-versions of Stirling, Eulerian and Lah numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce multinomial and $r$-variants of several classic objects of combinatorial probability, such as the random recursive and Hoppe trees, random set partitions and compositions, the Chinese restaurant process, Feller's coupling, and some others. Just as various classic combinatorial numbers - like Stirling, Eulerian and Lah numbers - emerge as essential ingredients defining the distributions of the mentioned processes, the so-called $r$-versions of these numbers appear in exact distributional formulas for the multinomial and $r$-counterparts. This approach allows us to offer a concise probabilistic interpretation for various identities involving $r$-versions of these combinatorial numbers, which were either unavailable or meaningful only for specific values of the parameter $r$. We analyze the derived distributions for fixed-size structures and establish distributional limit theorems as the size tends to infinity. Utilizing the aforementioned generalized Stirling numbers of both kinds, we define and analyze $(r,s)$-Lah distributions, which have arisen in the existing literature on combinatorial probability in various contexts.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the confluent hypergeometric process with a varying external potential in the super-exponential region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a determinantal point process on the interval $(-s,s)$, associated with the confluent hypergeometric kernel. Let $\mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s$ denote the trace class integral operator acting on $L^2(-s, s)$ with the confluent hypergeometric kernel. Our focus is on deriving the asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant $\det(I-\gamma \mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s)$ as $s \to +\infty$, while simultaneously $\gamma \to 1^-$ in a super-exponential region. In this regime of double scaling limit, our asymptotic result also gives us asymptotics of the eigenvalues $\lambda^{(\alpha, \beta)}_k(s)$ of the integral operator $\mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s$ as $s \to +\infty$. Based on the integrable structure of the confluent hypergeometric kernel, we derive our asymptotic results by applying the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method to analyze the related Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>Ergodic theorem for branching Markov chains indexed by trees with arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an ergodic theorem for Markov chains indexed by the Ulam-Harris-Neveu tree over large subsets with arbitrary shape under two assumptions: with high probability, two vertices in the large subset are far from each other and have their common ancestor close to the root. The assumption on the common ancestor can be replaced by some regularity assumption on the Markov transition kernel. We verify that those assumptions are satisfied for some usual trees. Finally, with Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo considerations in mind, we prove when the underlying Markov chain is stationary and reversible that the Markov chain, that is the line graph, yields minimal variance for the empirical average estimator among trees with a given number of nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dvoretzky--Kiefer--Wolfowitz--Massart inequality gives a sub-Gaussian tail bound on the supremum norm distance between the empirical distribution function of a random sample and its population counterpart. We provide a short proof of a result that improves the existing bound in two respects. First, our one-sided bound holds without any restrictions on the failure probability, thereby verifying a conjecture of Birnbaum and McCarty (1958). Second, it is local in the sense that it holds uniformly over sub-intervals of the real line with an error rate that adapts to the behaviour of the population distribution function on the interval.</description>

More precisely, under suitable sufficient conditions, we construct a Lyapunov function such that the origin of the multivariate geometric Brownian motion is globally asymptotically stable in probability. Moreover, we show that such conditions can be rewritten as a Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI) feasibility problem. We stress that no commutativity relations between the drift matrix and the noise dispersion matrices are assumed and therefore the so-called Magnus representation of the solution of the multivariate geometric Brownian motion is complicated. In addition, we exemplify our method in numerous specific models from the literature such as random linear oscillators, satellite dynamics, inertia systems, diagonal noise systems, cancer self-remission and smoking.</description>

      <title>Spectral Initialization for High-Dimensional Phase Retrieval with Biased Spatial Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a spectral initialization method that plays a central role in contemporary research on signal estimation in nonconvex scenarios. In a noiseless phase retrieval framework, we precisely analyze the method's performance in the high-dimensional limit when sensing vectors follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution for two rotationally invariant models of the covariance matrix C. In the first model C is a projector on a lower dimensional space while in the second it is a Wishart matrix. Our analytical results extend the well-established case when C is the identity matrix. Our examination shows that the introduction of biased spatial directions leads to a substantial improvement in the spectral method's effectiveness, particularly when the number of measurements is less than the signal's dimension. This extension also consistently reveals a phase transition phenomenon dependent on the ratio between sample size and signal dimension. Surprisingly, both of these models share the same threshold value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional integral representations for solutions of the motion equations for wall-bounded incompressible viscous flows, expressed (implicitly) in terms of distributions of solutions to stochastic differential equations of McKean-Vlasov type, are established by using a perturbation technique. These representations are used to obtain exact random vortex dynamics for wall-bounded viscous flows. Numerical schemes therefore are proposed and the convergence of the numerical schemes for random vortex dynamics with an additional force term is established. Several numerical experiments are carried out for demonstrating the motion of a viscous flow within a thin layer next to the fluid boundary.</description>

      <title>Fourier Galerkin approximation of mean field control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to provide a finite dimensional approximation of the solution to a mean field optimal control problem set on the $d$-dimensional torus. The approximation is obtained by means of a Fourier-Galerkin method, the main principle of which is to convolve probability measures on the torus by the Dirichlet kernel or, equivalently, to truncate the Fourier expansion of probability measures on the torus. However, this operation has the main feature not to leave the space of probability measures invariant, which drawback is know as \textit{Gibbs}' phenomenon. In spite of this, we manage to prove that, for initial conditions in the `interior' of the space of probability measures and for sufficiently large levels of truncation, the Fourier-Galerkin method induces a new finite dimensional control problem whose trajectories take values in the space of probability measures with a finite number of Fourier coefficients. Our main result asserts that, whenever the cost functionals are smooth and convex, the distance between the optimal trajectories of the original and approximating control problems decreases at a polynomial rate as the index of truncation in the Fourier-Galerkin method tends to $\infty$. A similar result holds for the distance between the corresponding value functions. From a practical point of view, our approach provides an efficient strategy to approximate mean field control optimizers by finite dimensional parameters and opens new perspectives for the numerical analysis of mean field control problems. It may be also applied to discretize more general mean field game systems.</description>

      <title>Reviving pseudo-inverses: Asymptotic properties of large dimensional Moore-Penrose and Ridge-type inverses with applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive high-dimensional asymptotic properties of the Moore-Penrose inverse and the ridge-type inverse of the sample covariance matrix. In particular, the analytical expressions of the weighted sample trace moments are deduced for both generalized inverse matrices and are present by using the partial exponential Bell polynomials which can easily be computed in practice. The existent results are extended in several directions: (i) First, the population covariance matrix is not assumed to be a multiple of the identity matrix; (ii) Second, the assumption of normality is not used in the derivation; (iii) Third, the asymptotic results are derived under the high-dimensional asymptotic regime. Our findings are used to construct improved shrinkage estimators of the precision matrix, which asymptotically minimize the quadratic loss with probability one. Finally, the finite sample properties of the derived theoretical results are investigated via an extensive simulation study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative method for constructing copula models capable of describing arbitrary non-monotone dependence structures. The proposed method enables the creation of such copulas in parametric form, thus allowing the resulting models to adapt to diverse and intricate real-world data patterns. We apply this novel methodology to analyze the relationship between returns and trading volumes in financial markets, a domain where the existence of non-monotone dependencies is well-documented in the existing literature. Our approach exhibits superior adaptability compared to other models which have previously been proposed in the literature, enabling a deeper understanding of the dependence structure among the considered variables.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of nonconvex viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations in stationary ergodic media in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish homogenization for nondegenerate viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations in one space dimension when the diffusion coefficient $a(x,\omega) &gt; 0$ and the Hamiltonian $H(p,x,\omega)$ are general stationary ergodic processes in $x$. Our result is valid under mild regularity assumptions on $a$ and $H$ plus standard coercivity and growth assumptions (in $p$) on the latter. In particular, we impose neither any additional condition on the law of the media nor any shape restriction on the graph of $p\mapsto H(p,x,\omega)$. Our approach consists of two main steps: (i) constructing a suitable candidate $\overline{H}$ for the effective Hamiltonian; (ii) proving homogenization. In the first step, we work with the set $E$ of all points at which $\overline{H}$ is naturally determined by correctors with stationary derivatives. We prove that $E$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is unbounded from above and below, and, if $E\neq\mathbb{R}$, then $\overline{H}$ can be extended continuously to $\mathbb{R}$ by setting it to be constant on each connected component of $E^c$. In the second step, we use a key bridging lemma, comparison arguments and several general results to verify that homogenization holds with this $\overline{H}$ as the effective Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: We consider discrete Schr\"odinger operators on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ with bounded random but not necessarily identically distributed values of the potential. We prove spectral localization (with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions) as well as dynamical localization for this model. An important ingredient of the proof is a non-stationary version of the parametric Furstenberg Theorem on random matrix products, which is also of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the linear quadratic stochastic optimal control problems in infinite dimension without Markovian restriction for coefficients. The necessary and sufficient conditions for open-loop optimal controls are presented. We prove the Fr\'echet differentiable of the cost functional with respect to the control variable, and the Fr\'echet derivatives are characterized in detail by operators derived from dual analysis, which are proven to be the stationary conditions. Transposition methods are adopted to deal with the adjoint equations. As applications, we employ the results to study open-loop Nash equilibria for two-person stochastic differential games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a weighted mean-field control problem with jump-diffusion as its state process. The main difficulty is from the non-Lipschitz property of the coefficients. We overcome this difficulty by an $L_{p,q}$-estimate of the solution processes with a suitably chosen $p$ and $q$. Convex pertubation method combining with the aforementioned $L_{p,q}$-estimation method is utilized to derive the stochastic maximum principle for this control problem. A sufficient condition for the optimality is also given.</description>

Abstract: We provide deterministic controllability conditions that imply exponential mixing properties for randomly forced constrained dynamical systems with possibly unbounded state space. As an application, new ergodicity results are obtained for non-smooth models in elasto-plasticity driven by various types of noise, including white noise. It is thereby illustrated how tools from control theory can be utilized to tackle regularity issues that commonly arise in the qualitative study of constrained systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this document, we aim to gather various results related to a compositional/categorical approach to rigorous Statistical Mechanics. Rigorous Statistical Mechanics is centered on the mathematical study of statistical systems. Central concepts in this field have a natural expression in terms of diagrams in a category that couples measurable maps and Markov kernels. We showed that statistical systems are particular representations of partially ordered sets (posets), that we call A-specifications, and expressed their phases, i.e., Gibbs measures, as invariants of these representations. It opens the way to the use of homological algebra to compute phases of statistical systems. Two central results of rigorous Statistical Mechanics are, firstly, the characterization of extreme Gibbs measures as it relates to the zero-one law for extreme Gibbs measures, and, secondly, their variational principle which states that for translation invariant Hamiltonians, Gibbs measures are the minima of the Gibbs free energy. We showed how the characterization of extreme Gibbs measures extends to A-specifications; we proposed an Entropy functional for A-specifications and gave a message-passing algorithm, that generalized the belief propagation algorithm of graphical models, to find critical points of the associated variational free energy.</description>

Abstract: We consider a discrete-time random walk where a cost is incurred at each jump. We obtain an exact analytical formula for the distribution of the total cost of a trajectory until the process returns to the origin for the first time. The formula is valid for arbitrary jump distribution and cost function (heavy- and light-tailed alike), provided they are symmetric and continuous. The tail behavior of the distribution is universal and independent of the details of the model. Applications are given to the motion of an active particle in one dimension and extensions to multiple cost variables are considered. The analytical results are in perfect agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a family of linear operators, diagonalized by the Hankel transform. The Fredholm determinants of these operators, restricted to $L_2[0, R]$, are expressed in a convenient form for asymptotic analysis as $R\to\infty$. The result is an identity, in which the determinant is equal to the leading asymptotic multiplied by an asymptotically small factor, for which an explicit formula is derived. We apply the result to the determinantal point process with the Bessel kernel, calculating the speed of the convergence of additive functionals with respect to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a probabilistic generalization of the dual Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence, called $qt$RSK${}^*$, depending on two parameters $q$ and $t$. This correspondence extends the $q$RS$t$ correspondence, recently introduced by the authors, and allows the first tableaux-theoretic proof of the dual Cauchy identity for Macdonald polynomials. By specializing $q$ and $t$, one recovers the row and column insertion version of the classical dual RSK correspondence as well as of $q$- and $t$-deformations thereof which are connected to $q$-Whittaker and Hall--Littlewood polynomials. When restricting to Jack polynomials and $\{0,1\}$-matrices corresponding to words, we prove that the insertion tableaux obtained by $qt$RSK${}^*$ are invariant under swapping letters in the input word. Our approach is based on Fomin's growth diagrams and the notion of probabilistic bijections.</description>

In a particular case of random dynamical systems with a strongly mixing base transformation, we derive an error estimate of order $O(N^{-1/2})$ in the quenched multivariate CLT, provided that the covariance matrix \say{grows linearly} with the number of summands $N$. The error in the normal approximation is estimated for the class of all convex sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze continuous-time SIS epidemics subject to arrivals and departures of agents, by using an approximated process based on replacements. In defining the SIS dynamics in an open network, we consider a stochastic setting in which arrivals and departures take place according to Poisson processes with similar rates, and the new value of the infection probability of an arriving agent is drawn from a continuous distribution. Since the system size changes with time, we define an approximated process, in which replacements take place instead of arrivals and departures, and we focus on the evolution of an aggregate measure of the level of infection. So long as the reproduction number is less than one, the long-term behavior of this function measures the impact of the changes of the set of agents in the epidemic. We derive upper bounds for the expectation and variance of this function and we include a numerical example to show that the approximated process is close to the original SIS process.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a single-layer neural network trained with the online actor critic algorithm converges in distribution to a random ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number of hidden units and the number of training steps $\rightarrow \infty$. In the online actor-critic algorithm, the distribution of the data samples dynamically changes as the model is updated, which is a key challenge for any convergence analysis. We establish the geometric ergodicity of the data samples under a fixed actor policy. Then, using a Poisson equation, we prove that the fluctuations of the model updates around the limit distribution due to the randomly-arriving data samples vanish as the number of parameter updates $\rightarrow \infty$. Using the Poisson equation and weak convergence techniques, we prove that the actor neural network and critic neural network converge to the solutions of a system of ODEs with random initial conditions. Analysis of the limit ODE shows that the limit critic network will converge to the true value function, which will provide the actor an asymptotically unbiased estimate of the policy gradient. We then prove that the limit actor network will converge to a stationary point.</description>

      <title>Robust estimates for elliptic nonlocal operators on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study weak Harnack inequality and a priori H\"older regularity of harmonic functions for symmetric nonlocal Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces. Our analysis relies on three main assumptions: the existence of a strongly local Dirichlet form with sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates, a tail estimate of the jump measure outside balls and a local energy comparability condition. We establish the robustness of our results, ensuring that the constants in our estimates remain bounded, provided that the order of the scale function appearing in the tail estimate and local energy comparability condition, maintains a certain distance from zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the stochastic Abelian-Higgs equations in two dimensions. The proof is based on a new covariant approach, which consists of two parts: First, we introduce covariant stochastic objects. The covariant stochastic objects and their multi-linear interactions are controlled using covariant heat kernel estimates. Second, we control nonlinear remainders using a covariant monotonicity formula, which is inspired by earlier work of Hamilton.</description>

      <title>An $\alpha$-potential game framework for $N$-player games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and studies a general form of dynamic $N$-player non-cooperative games called $\alpha$-potential games, where the change of a player's value function upon her unilateral deviation from her strategy is equal to the change of an $\alpha$-potential function up to an error $\alpha$. Analogous to the static potential game (which corresponds to $\alpha=0$), the $\alpha$-potential game framework is shown to reduce the challenging task of finding approximate Nash equilibria for a dynamic game to minimizing the $\alpha$-potential function. Moreover, an analytical characterization of $\alpha$-potential functions is established, with $\alpha$ represented in terms of the magnitude of the asymmetry of value functions' second-order derivatives. For stochastic differential games in which the state dynamic is a controlled diffusion, $\alpha$ is explicitly identified in terms of the number of players, the choice of admissible strategies, and the intensity of interactions, and the level of heterogeneity among players. This is achieved by introducing a suitable linear derivative of the value functions with respect to unilateral deviations of strategies and via analyzing the sensitivity processes of state dynamics with respect to controls.
  For games with mean-field type interactions, $\alpha$ is shown to decay to zero as the number of players goes to infinity, even with heterogeneity in state dynamics, cost functions, and admissible strategy classes. For distributed games, if a static potential function can be derived from the cost functions, then $\alpha=0$. For crowd aversion games, $\alpha$ is capable of capturing the subtle difference between the choice of admissible strategies.</description>

Abstract: For a class of additive processes driven by the affine recursion $X_{n+1} = A_n X_n + B_n$, we develop a sample-path large deviations principle in the $M_1'$ topology on $D [0,1]$. We allow $B_n$ to have both signs and focus on the case where Kesten's condition holds on $A_1$, leading to heavy-tailed distributions. The most likely paths in our large deviations results are step functions with both positive and negative jumps.</description>

      <title>On the TAP equations via the cavity approach in the generic mixed $p$-spin models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1977, Thouless, Anderson, and Palmer (TAP) derived a system of consistent equations in terms of the effective magnetization in order to study the free energy in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model. The solutions to their equations were predicted to contain vital information about the landscapes in the SK Hamiltonian and the TAP free energy and moreover have direct connections to Parisi's replica ansatz. In this work, we aim to investigate the validity of the TAP equations in the generic mixed $p$-spin model. By utilizing the ultrametricity of the overlaps, we show that the TAP equations are asymptotically satisfied by the conditional local magnetizations on the asymptotic pure states.</description>

      <title>Boundary crossing problems and functional transformations for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the law of the first passage time of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to time-varying thresholds. We show that this problem is connected to the laws of the first passage time of the process to members of a two-parameter family of functional transformations of a time-varying boundary. For specific values of the parameters, these transformations appear in a realisation of a standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bridge. We provide three different proofs of this connection. The first one is based on a similar result for Brownian motion, the second uses a generalisation of the so-called Gauss-Markov processes and the third relies on the Lie group symmetry method. We investigate the properties of these transformations and study the algebraic and analytical properties of an involution operator which is used in constructing them. We also show that these transformations map the space of solutions of Sturm-Liouville equations into the space of solutions of the associated nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Lastly, we interpret our results through the method of images and give new examples of curves with explicit first passage time densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new version of the Tikhonov theorem for both two-scale forward systems and also two-scale forward-backward systems of stochastic differential equations, which also covers the McKean-Vlasov case. Differently from what is usually done in the literature, we prove a type of convergence for the ''fast'' variable, which allows the limiting process to be discontinuous. This is relevant for the second part of the paper, where we present a new application of this theory to the approximation of the solution of mean field control problems. Towards this aim, we construct a two-scale system whose ''fast'' component converges to the optimal control process, while the ''slow'' component converges to the optimal state process. The interest in such a procedure is that it allows to approximate the solution of the control problem avoiding the usual step of the minimization of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Tilted biorthogonal ensembles, Grothendieck random partitions, and determinantal tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study probability measures on partitions based on symmetric Grothendieck polynomials. These deformations of Schur polynomials introduced in the K-theory of Grassmannians share many common properties. Our Grothendieck measures are analogs of the Schur measures on partitions introduced by Okounkov (arXiv:math/9907127 [math.RT]). Despite the similarity of determinantal formulas for the probability weights of Schur and Grothendieck measures, we demonstrate that Grothendieck measures are \emph{not} determinantal point processes. This question is related to the principal minor assignment problem in algebraic geometry, and we employ a determinantal test first obtained by Nanson in 1897 for the $4\times4$ problem. We also propose a procedure for getting Nanson-like determinantal tests for matrices of any size $n\ge4$ which appear new for $n\ge 5$.
  By placing the Grothendieck measures into a new framework of tilted biorthogonal ensembles generalizing a rich class of determinantal processes introduced by Borodin (arXiv:math/9804027 [math.CA]), we identify Grothendieck random partitions as a cross-section of a Schur process, a determinantal process in two dimensions. This identification expresses the correlation functions of Grothendieck measures through sums of Fredholm determinants, which are not immediately suitable for asymptotic analysis. A more direct approach allows us to obtain a limit shape result for the Grothendieck random partitions. The limit shape curve is not particularly explicit as it arises as a cross-section of the limit shape surface for the Schur process. The gradient of this surface is expressed through the argument of a complex root of a cubic equation.</description>

      <title>Derivation of all structure constants for boundary Liouville CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the probabilistic definition of the most general boundary three-point and bulk-boundary structure constants in Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT) agree respectively with the formula proposed by Ponsot-Techsner (2002) and by Hosomichi (2001). These formulas also respectively describe the fusion kernel and modular kernel of the Virasoro conformal blocks, which are important functions in various contexts of mathematical physics. As an intermediate step, we obtain the formula for the boundary reflection coefficient of LCFT proposed by Fateev-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (2000). Our proof relies on the boundary Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov differential equation recently proved by the first named author, and inputs from the coupling theory of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) and Schramm Loewner evolution. Our results supply all the structure constants needed to perform the conformal bootstrap for boundary LCFT. They also yield exact descriptions for the joint law of the area and boundary lengths of basic LQG surfaces, including quantum triangles and two-pointed quantum disks.</description>

      <title>Four universal growth regimes in degree-dependent first passage percolation on spatial random graphs I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dependent first passage percolation is a spreading process on a graph where the transmission time through each edge depends on the direct surroundings of the edge. In particular, the classical iid transmission time $L_{xy}$ is multiplied by $(W_xW_y)^\mu$, a polynomial of the expected degrees $W_x, W_y$ of the endpoints of the edge $xy$, which we call the penalty function. Beyond the Markov case, we also allow any distribution for $L_{xy}$ with regularly varying distribution near $0$. We then run this process on three spatial scale-free random graph models: finite and infinite Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these spatial models, the connection probability between two vertices depends on their spatial distance and on their expected degrees.
  We show that as the penalty-function, i.e., $\mu$ increases, the transmission time between two far away vertices sweeps through four universal phases: explosive (with tight transmission times), polylogarithmic, polynomial but strictly sublinear, and linear in the Euclidean distance. The strictly polynomial growth phase here is a new phenomenon that so far was extremely rare in spatial graph models. The four growth phases are highly robust in the model parameters and are not restricted to phase boundaries. Further, the transition points between the phases depend non-trivially on the main model parameters: the tail of the degree distribution, a long-range parameter governing the presence of long edges, and the behaviour of the distribution $L$ near $0$. In this paper we develop new methods to prove the upper bounds in all sub-explosive phases. Our companion paper complements these results by providing matching lower bounds in the polynomial and linear regimes.</description>

Abstract: We prove asymptotic results for a modification of the cross-entropy estimator originally introduced by Ziv and Merhav in the Markovian setting in 1993. Our results concern a more general class of decoupled measures on shift spaces over a finite alphabet and in particular imply strong asymptotic consistency of the modified estimator for all pairs of functions of stationary, irreducible, finite-state Markov chains satisfying a mild decay condition. Our approach is based on the study of a rescaled cumulant-generating function called the cross-entropic pressure, importing to information theory some techniques from the study of large deviations within the thermodynamic formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15228v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses convolutions of the gamma density and the one-sided stable density to construct higher level densities. The approach is applied to constructing a 4-parameter Mittag-Leffler density, whose Laplace transform is a corresponding Mittag-Leffler function, which is completely monotone (CM) by construction. Laplace transforms of mixtures of the stable densities with respect to the 4-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution are compositions of the Mittag-Leffler functions with Bernstein functions, thereby generating a rich family of CM variants of the base CM Mittag-Leffler functions, including known instances as special cases.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the scaling limit of heavy-tailed unstable INAR($\infty$) processes. These processes exhibit a power law tail of the form $n^{-(1+\alpha)}$, with $\alpha \in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$, where the $\ell^1$ norm of the kernel vector is close to $1$. The result is in contrast to scaling limit of the continuous-time heavy tailed unstable Hawkes processes and the one of INAR($p$) processes. We show that the discrete-time scaling limit also has long-memory property and can also be seen as an integrated fractional Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process.</description>

Abstract: We derive large- and moderate-deviation results in random networks given as planar directed navigations on homogeneous Poisson point processes. In this non-Markovian routing scheme, starting from the origin, at each consecutive step a Poisson point is joined by an edge to its nearest Poisson point to the right within a cone. We establish precise exponential rates of decay for the probability that the vertical displacement of the random path is unexpectedly large. The proofs rest on controlling the dependencies of the individual steps and the randomness in the horizontal displacement as well as renewal-process arguments.</description>

Abstract: Differential privacy is a mathematical concept that provides an information-theoretic security guarantee. While differential privacy has emerged as a de facto standard for guaranteeing privacy in data sharing, the known mechanisms to achieve it come with some serious limitations. Utility guarantees are usually provided only for a fixed, a priori specified set of queries. Moreover, there are no utility guarantees for more complex - but very common - machine learning tasks such as clustering or classification. In this paper we overcome some of these limitations. Working with metric privacy, a powerful generalization of differential privacy, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that creates a private measure from a data set. This private measure allows us to efficiently construct private synthetic data that are accurate for a wide range of statistical analysis tools. Moreover, we prove an asymptotically sharp min-max result for private measures and synthetic data for general compact metric spaces. A key ingredient in our construction is a new superregular random walk, whose joint distribution of steps is as regular as that of independent random variables, yet which deviates from the origin logarithmicaly slowly.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering in the Gaussian mixture block model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture block models are distributions over graphs that strive to model modern networks: to generate a graph from such a model, we associate each vertex $i$ with a latent feature vector $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ sampled from a mixture of Gaussians, and we add edge $(i,j)$ if and only if the feature vectors are sufficiently similar, in that $\langle u_i,u_j \rangle \ge \tau$ for a pre-specified threshold $\tau$. The different components of the Gaussian mixture represent the fact that there may be different types of nodes with different distributions over features -- for example, in a social network each component represents the different attributes of a distinct community. Natural algorithmic tasks associated with these networks are embedding (recovering the latent feature vectors) and clustering (grouping nodes by their mixture component).
  In this paper we initiate the study of clustering and embedding graphs sampled from high-dimensional Gaussian mixture block models, where the dimension of the latent feature vectors $d\to \infty$ as the size of the network $n \to \infty$. This high-dimensional setting is most appropriate in the context of modern networks, in which we think of the latent feature space as being high-dimensional. We analyze the performance of canonical spectral clustering and embedding algorithms for such graphs in the case of 2-component spherical Gaussian mixtures, and begin to sketch out the information-computation landscape for clustering and embedding in these models.</description>

      <title>A Traffic Management Framework for On-Demand Urban Air Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) offers a solution to current traffic congestion by providing on-demand air mobility in urban areas. Effective traffic management is crucial for efficient operation of UAM systems, especially for high-demand scenarios. In this paper, we present a centralized traffic management framework for on-demand UAM systems. Specifically, we provide a scheduling policy, called VertiSync, which schedules the aircraft for either servicing trip requests or rebalancing in the system subject to aircraft safety margins and energy requirements. We characterize the system-level throughput of VertiSync, which determines the demand threshold at which passenger waiting times transition from being stabilized to being increasing over time. We show that the proposed policy is able to maximize throughput for sufficiently large fleet sizes. We demonstrate the performance of VertiSync through a case study for the city of Los Angeles, and show that it significantly reduces passenger waiting times compared to a first-come first-serve scheduling policy.</description>

      <title>Covariance Operator Estimation: Sparsity, Lengthscale, and Ensemble Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates covariance operator estimation via thresholding. For Gaussian random fields with approximately sparse covariance operators, we establish non-asymptotic bounds on the estimation error in terms of the sparsity level of the covariance and the expected supremum of the field. We prove that thresholded estimators enjoy an exponential improvement in sample complexity compared with the standard sample covariance estimator if the field has a small correlation lengthscale. As an application of the theory, we study thresholded estimation of covariance operators within ensemble Kalman filters.</description>

      <title>Best of Both Worlds Guarantees for Smoothed Online Quadratic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the smoothed online quadratic optimization (SOQO) problem where, at each round $t$, a player plays an action $x_t$ in response to a quadratic hitting cost and an additional squared $\ell_2$-norm cost for switching actions. This problem class has strong connections to a wide range of application domains including smart grid management, adaptive control, and data center management, where switching-efficient algorithms are highly sought after. We study the SOQO problem in both adversarial and stochastic settings, and in this process, perform the first stochastic analysis of this class of problems. We provide the online optimal algorithm when the minimizers of the hitting cost function evolve as a general stochastic process, which, for the case of martingale process, takes the form of a distribution-agnostic dynamic interpolation algorithm (LAI). Next, we present the stochastic-adversarial trade-off by proving an $\Omega(T)$ expected regret for the adversarial optimal algorithm in the literature (ROBD) with respect to LAI and, a sub-optimal competitive ratio for LAI in the adversarial setting. Finally, we present a best-of-both-worlds algorithm that obtains a robust adversarial performance while simultaneously achieving a near-optimal stochastic performance.</description>

      <title>Faster identification of faster Formula 1 drivers via time-rank duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two natural ways of modelling Formula 1 race outcomes are a probabilistic approach, based on the exponential distribution, and econometric modelling of the ranks. Both approaches lead to exactly soluble race-winning probabilities. Equating race-winning probabilities leads to a set of equivalent parametrisations. This time-rank duality is attractive theoretically and leads to quicker ways of dis-entangling driver and car level effects.</description>

      <title>A quantization of interacting particle systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems studied in this paper are probabilistic cellular automata with nearest-neighbor interaction including the Domany-Kinzel model. A special case of the Domany-Kinzel model is directed percolation. We regard the interacting particle system as a Markov chain on a graph. Then we present a new quantization of the interacting particle system. After that, we introduce a zeta function of the quantized model and give its determinant expression. Moreover, we calculate the absolute zeta function of the quantized model for the Domany-Kinzel model.</description>

      <title>A Random-Player Game and Derangement Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10246v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the following game between a random player R and a deterministic player D. There is a pile of n elements at the beginning. The rules for playing are as follows: In each turn of R, if the pile contains exactly m elements, R removes k elements from the pile, where k is independently identically distributed from {1, . . . , m}. In each turn of D, D removes only one element. The winner is the player that, at the end of its round, has no elements remaining. R starts first to play. This short paper shows that Dn, which is defined as the probability of D winning the game (when is initialized with n elements), approaches 1/e when n increases; and more specifically, Dn = dn/n!, where dn is the n-th derangement number.</description>

      <title>On some dynamical features of the complete Moran model for neutral evolution in the presence of mutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a version of the classical Moran model, in which mutations are taken into account; the possibility of mutations was introduced by Moran in his seminal paper, but it is more often overlooked in discussing the Moran model. For this model, fixation is prevented by mutation, and we have an ergodic Markov process; the equilibrium distribution for such a process was determined by Moran. The problems we consider in this paper are those of first hitting either one of the ``pure'' (uniform population) states, depending on the initial state; and that of first hitting times. The presence of mutations leads to a nonlinear dependence of the hitting probabilities on the initial state, and to a larger mean hitting time compared to the mutation-free process (in which case hitting corresponds to fixation of one of the alleles).</description>

      <title>Iterated Monodromy Group With Non-Martingale Fixed-Point Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct families of rational functions $f: \mathbb{P}^1_k \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1_k$ of degree $d \geq 2$ over a perfect field $k$ with non-martingale fixed-point processes. Then for any normal variety $X$ over $\mathbb{P}_{\bar{k}}^N$, we give conditions on $f: X \rightarrow X$ to guarantee that the associated fixed-point process is a martingale. This work extends the previous work of Bridy, Jones, Kelsey, and Lodge on martingale conditions and answers their question on the existence of a non-martingale fixed-point process associated with the iterated monodromy group of a rational function.</description>

      <title>Markovian lifting and optimal control for integral stochastic Volterra equations with completely monotone kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on solving the optimal control problem for integral stochastic Volterra equations in a finite dimensional setting. In our setting, the noise term is driven by a pure jump L\'evy noise and the control acts on the intensity of the jumps.
  We use recent techniques proposed by Hamaguchi, where a crucial requirement is that the convolution kernel should be a completely monotone function. This allows us to use Bernstein's representation and the machinery of Laplace transform to obtain a Markovian lift.
  It is natural that the Markovian lift, in whatever form constructed, transforms the state equation into a stochastic differential equation in an infinite-dimensional space. This space should be large enough to contain all the information about the history of the process. Hence, although the original equation is taken in a finite dimensional space, the resulting lift is always infinite dimensional.
  We solve the problem by using the forward-backward approach in the infinite-dimensional setting and prove the existence of the optimal control for the original problem. Under additional assumptions on the coefficients, we see that a control in closed-loop form can be achieved.</description>
