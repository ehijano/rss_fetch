      <title>KKT Optimality Conditions for Multiobjective Optimal Control Problems with Endpoint and Mixed Constraints: Application to Sustainable Energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive first and second-order optimality conditions of KKT type for locally optimal solutions to a class of multiobjective optimal control problems with endpoint constraint and mixed pointwise constraints. We give some sufficient conditions for normality of multipliers. Namely, we show that if the linearized system is controllable or some constraint qualifications are satisfied, then the multiplier corresponding to the objective function is different from zero. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our theoretical results, we apply these conditions to a multiobjective optimal control problem for sustainable energy management in smart grids, providing insights into the trade-offs between cost, renewable energy utilization, environmental impact, and grid stability.</description>

      <title>A New Nonsmooth Optimal Control Framework for Wind Turbine Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control theory extending from the calculus of variations has not been used to study the wind turbine power system (WTPS) control problem, which aims at achieving two targets: (i) maximizing power generation in lower wind speed conditions; and (ii) maintaining the output power at the rated level in high wind speed conditions. A lack of an optimal control framework for the WTPS (i.e., no access to actual optimal control trajectories) reduces optimal control design potential and prevents competing control methods of WTPSs to have a reference control solution for comparison. In fact, the WTPS control literature often relies on reduced and linearized models of WTPSs, and avoids the nonsmoothness present in the system during transitions between different conditions of operation. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimal control framework for the WTPS control problem. We use in our formulation a recent accurate, nonlinear differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model of WTPSs, which we then generalize over all wind speed ranges using non-smooth functions. We also use developments in nonsmooth optimal control theory to take into account nonsmoothness present in the system. We implement this new WTPS optimal control approach to solve the problem numerically, including (i) different wind speed profiles for testing the system response; (ii) real-world wind data; and (iii) a comparison with smoothing and naive approaches. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Quadratic versus Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Models for Quantum Optimization illustrated on Railway Timetabling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most short-term promising quantum-classical algorithm to solve unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems. It alternates between the execution of a parametrized quantum circuit and a classical optimization. There are numerous levers for enhancing QAOA performances, such as the choice of quantum circuit meta-parameters or the choice of the classical optimizer. In this paper, we stress on the importance of the input problem formulation by illustrating it with the resolution of an industrial railway timetabling problem. Specifically, we present a generic method to reformulate any polynomial problem into a Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO) problem, with a specific formulation imposing penalty terms to take binary values when the constraints are linear. We also provide a generic reformulation into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. We then conduct a numerical comparison between the PUBO with binary penalty terms and the QUBO formulations proposed on a railway timetabling problem solved with QAOA. Our results illustrate that the PUBO reformulation outperforms the QUBO one for the problem at hand.</description>

      <title>Shape optimization involving the Tresca friction law in a 2D linear elastic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to analyse a shape optimization problem in a mechanical friction context. Precisely we perform a shape sensitivity analysis of a Tresca friction problem, that is, a boundary value problem involving the usual linear elasticity equations together with the (nonsmooth) Tresca friction law on a part of the boundary. We prove that the solution to the Tresca friction problem admits a directional shape derivative which moreover coincides with the solution to a boundary value problem involving tangential Signorini's unilateral conditions. Then an explicit expression of the shape gradient of the Tresca energy functional is provided (which allows us to provide numerical simulations illustrating our theoretical results). Our methodology is not based on any regularization procedure, but rather on the twice epi-differentiability of the (nonsmooth) Tresca friction functional which is analyzed thanks to a change of variables which is well-suited in the two-dimensional case. The obstruction in the higher-dimensional case is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-interacting dynamics that mimics the standard Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) model is introduced. This single-particle dynamics is shown to converge to a unique invariant measure that approximates the global minimum of a given function. As an application, its connection to CBO with Personal Best introduced by C. Totzeck and M.-T. Wolfram (Math. Biosci. Eng., 2020) has been established.</description>

      <title>Offline and Online Nonlinear Inverse Differential Games with Known and Approximated Cost and Value Function Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose novel offline and online Inverse Differential Game (IDG) methods for nonlinear Differential Games (DG), which identify the cost functions of all players from control and state trajectories constituting a feedback Nash equilibrium. The offline approach computes the sets of all equivalent cost function parameters that yield the observed trajectories. Our online method is guaranteed to converge to cost function parameters of the offline calculated sets. For both methods, we additionally analyze the case where the cost and value functions are not given by known parameterized structures and approximation structures, like polynomial basis functions, need to be chosen. Here, we found that for guaranteeing a bounded error between the trajectories resulting from the offline and online IDG solutions and the observed trajectories an appropriate selection of the cost function structures is required. They must be aligned to assumed value function structures such that the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations can be fulfilled. Finally, the theoretical results and the effectiveness of our new methods are illustrated with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Assortment Optimization under the Multinomial Logit Model with Covering Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an assortment optimization problem under the multinomial logit choice model with general covering constraints. In this problem, the seller offers an assortment that should contain a minimum number of products from multiple categories. We refer to these constraints as covering constraints. Such constraints are common in practice due to service level agreements with suppliers or diversity considerations within the assortment. We consider both the deterministic version, where the seller decides on a single assortment, and the randomized version, where they choose a distribution over assortments. In the deterministic case, we provide a $1/(\log K+2)$-approximation algorithm, where $K$ is the number of product categories, matching the problem's hardness up to a constant factor. For the randomized setting, we show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time via an equivalent linear program. We also extend our analysis to multi-segment assortment optimization with covering constraints, where there are $m$ customer segments, and an assortment is offered to each. In the randomized setting, the problem remains polynomially solvable. In the deterministic setting, we design a $(1 - \epsilon) / (\log K + 2)$-approximation algorithm for constant $m$ and a $1 / (m (\log K + 2))$-approximation for general $m$, which matches the hardness up to a logarithmic factor. Finally, we conduct a numerical experiment using real data from an online electronics store, categorizing products by price range and brand. Our findings demonstrate that, in practice, it is feasible to enforce a minimum number of representatives from each category while incurring a relatively small revenue loss. Moreover, we observe that the optimal expected revenue in both deterministic and randomized settings is often comparable, and the optimal solution in the randomized setting typically involves only a few assortments.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Negative Curvature in Conjunction with Adaptive Sampling: Theoretical Results and a Practical Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose algorithms that exploit negative curvature for solving noisy nonlinear nonconvex unconstrained optimization problems. We consider both deterministic and stochastic inexact settings, and develop two-step algorithms that combine directions of negative curvature and descent directions to update the iterates. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove second-order convergence results and derive complexity guarantees for both settings. To tackle large-scale problems, we develop a practical variant that utilizes the conjugate gradient method with negative curvature detection and early stopping to compute a step, a simple adaptive step size scheme, and a strategy for selecting the sample sizes of the gradient and Hessian approximations as the optimization progresses. Numerical results on two machine learning problems showcase the efficacy and efficiency of the practical method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a continuous-time formulation for the AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam optimization algorithms by modeling them as first-order integro-differential equations. We perform numerical simulations of these equations to demonstrate their validity as accurate approximations of the original algorithms. Our results indicate a strong agreement between the behavior of the continuous-time models and the discrete implementations, thus providing a new perspective on the theoretical understanding of adaptive optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the SUPG Method for the Solution of Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of the streamline upwind/Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) stabilized finite element method on the discretization of optimal control problems governed by linear advection-diffusion equations. We compare two approaches for the numerical solution of such optimal control problems. In the discretize-then-optimize approach, the optimal control problem is first discretized, using the SUPG method for the discretization of the advection-diffusion equation, and then the resulting finite dimensional optimization problem is solved. In the optimize-then-discretize approach one first computes the infinite dimensional optimality system, involving the advection-diffusion equation as well as the adjoint advection-diffusion equation, and then discretizes this optimality system using the SUPG method for both the original and the adjoint equations. These approaches lead to different results. The main result of this paper are estimates for the error between the solution of the infinite dimensional optimal control problem and their approximations computed using the previous approaches. For a class of problems prove that the optimize-then-discretize approach has better asymptotic convergence properties if finite elements of order greater than one are used. For linear finite elements our theoretical convergence results for both approaches are comparable, except in the zero diffusion limit where again the optimize-then-discretize approach seems favorable. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate some of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based control of nonlinear systems with closed-loop guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a tutorial overview and an extension of a recently developed framework for data-driven control of unknown nonlinear systems with rigorous closed-loop guarantees. The proposed approach relies on the Koopman operator representation of the nonlinear system, for which a bilinear surrogate model is estimated based on data. In contrast to existing Koopman-based estimation procedures, we state guaranteed bounds on the approximation error using the stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) framework. The resulting surrogate model and the uncertainty bounds allow us to design controllers via robust control theory and sum-of-squares optimization, guaranteeing desirable properties for the closed-loop system. We present results on stabilization both in discrete and continuous time, and we derive a method for controller design with performance objectives. The benefits of the presented framework over established approaches are demonstrated with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>MARS: Unleashing the Power of Variance Reduction for Training Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks--and more recently, large models--demands efficient and scalable optimizers. Adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam, AdamW, and their variants have been central to this task. Despite the development of numerous variance reduction algorithms in the past decade aimed at accelerating stochastic optimization in both convex and nonconvex settings, variance reduction has not found widespread success in training deep neural networks or large language models. Consequently, it has remained a less favored approach in modern AI. In this paper, to unleash the power of variance reduction for efficient training of large models, we propose a unified optimization framework, MARS (Make vAriance Reduction Shine), which reconciles preconditioned gradient methods with variance reduction via a scaled stochastic recursive momentum technique. Within our framework, we introduce three instances of MARS that leverage preconditioned gradient updates based on AdamW, Lion, and Shampoo, respectively. We also draw a connection between our algorithms and existing optimizers. Experimental results on training GPT-2 models indicate that MARS consistently outperforms AdamW by a large margin.</description>

      <title>On the interplay between pricing, competition and QoS in ride-hailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse a non-cooperative game between two competing ride-hailing platforms, each of which is modeled as a two-sided queueing system, where drivers (with a limited level of patience) are assumed to arrive according to a Poisson process at a fixed rate, while the arrival process of (price-sensitive) passengers is split across the two platforms based on Quality of Service (QoS) considerations. As a benchmark, we also consider a monopolistic scenario, where each platform gets half the market share irrespective of its pricing strategy. The key novelty of our formulation is that the total market share is fixed across the platforms. The game thus captures the competition between the platforms over market share, with pricing being the lever used by each platform to influence its share of the market. The market share split is modeled via two different QoS metrics: (i) probability that an arriving passenger obtains a ride, and (ii) the average passenger pick-up time. The platform aims to maximize the rate of revenue generated from matching drivers and passengers.
  In each of the above settings, we analyse the equilibria associated with the game in certain limiting regimes. We also show that these equilibria remain relevant in the more practically meaningful 'pre-limit.' Interestingly, we show that for a certain range of system parameters, no pure Nash equilibrium exists. Instead, we demonstrate a novel solution concept called an \textit{equilibrium cycle}, which has interesting dynamic connotations. Our results highlight the interplay between competition, passenger-side price sensitivity, and passenger/driver arrival rates.</description>

      <title>A Control Theoretical Approach to Online Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on the solution of online problems with time-varying, linear equality and inequality constraints. Our approach is to design a novel online algorithm by leveraging the tools of control theory. In particular, for the case of equality constraints only, using robust control we design an online algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal trajectory, differently from the alternatives that achieve non-zero tracking error. When also inequality constraints are present, we show how to modify the proposed algorithm to account for the wind-up induced by the nonnegativity constraints on the dual variables. We report numerical results that corroborate the theoretical analysis, and show how the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms both with equality and inequality constraints.</description>

Abstract: We propose novel optimal and parameter-free algorithms for computing an approximate solution with small (projected) gradient norm. Specifically, for computing an approximate solution such that the norm of its (projected) gradient does not exceed $\varepsilon$, we obtain the following results: a) for the convex case, the total number of gradient evaluations is bounded by $O(1)\sqrt{L\|x_0 - x^*\|/\varepsilon}$, where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of the gradient and $x^*$ is any optimal solution; b) for the strongly convex case, the total number of gradient evaluations is bounded by $O(1)\sqrt{L/\mu}\log(\|\nabla f(x_0)\|/\epsilon)$, where $\mu$ is the strong convexity modulus; and c) for the nonconvex case, the total number of gradient evaluations is bounded by $O(1)\sqrt{Ll}(f(x_0) - f(x^*))/\varepsilon^2$, where $l$ is the lower curvature constant. Our complexity results match the lower complexity bounds of the convex and strongly cases, and achieve the above best-known complexity bound for the nonconvex case for the first time in the literature. Our results can also be extended to problems with constraints and composite objectives. Moreover, for all the convex, strongly convex, and nonconvex cases, we propose parameter-free algorithms that do not require the input of any problem parameters or the convexity status of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, there do not exist such parameter-free methods before especially for the strongly convex and nonconvex cases. Since most regularity conditions (e.g., strong convexity and lower curvature) are imposed over a global scope, the corresponding problem parameters are notoriously difficult to estimate. However, gradient norm minimization equips us with a convenient tool to monitor the progress of algorithms and thus the ability to estimate such parameters in-situ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using standard tools of harmonic analysis, we state and solve the problem of moments for positive measures supported on the unit ball of a Sobolev space of multivariate periodic trigonometric functions. We describe outer and inner semidefinite approximations of the cone of Sobolev moments. They are the basic components of an infinite-dimensional moment-sums of squares hierarchy, allowing to solve numerically non-convex polynomial optimization problems on infinite-dimensional Sobolev spaces, with global convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Long-term Hydrothermal Bid-based Market Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating long-term hydrothermal bid-based markets considering strategic agents is a challenging task. The representation of strategic agents considering intertemporal constraints within a stochastic framework brings additional complexity to the already difficult single-period bilevel, thus, non-convex, optimal bidding problem. Thus, we propose a simulation methodology that effectively addresses these challenges for large-scale hydrothermal power systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a case study with real data from the large-scale Brazilian power system. In the case studies, we show the effects of market concentration in power systems and how contracts can be used to mitigate them. In particular, we show how market power might affect the current setting in Brazil. The developed method can strongly benefit policymakers, market monitors, and market designers as simulations can be used to understand existing power systems and experiment with alternative designs.</description>

      <title>Managing Distributional Ambiguity in Stochastic Optimization through a Statistical Upper Bound Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08966v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic optimization is often hampered by distributional ambiguity, where critical probability distributions are poorly characterized or unknown. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a new framework that targets the minimization of a statistical upper bound for the expected value of uncertain objectives, facilitating more statistically robust decision-making. Central to our approach is the Average Percentile Upper Bound (APUB), a novel construct that simultaneously delivers a statistically rigorous upper bound for the population mean and a meaningful risk metric for the sample mean. The integration of APUB into stochastic optimization not only fortifies the process against distributional ambiguity but also reinforces key data-driven decision-making attributes, such as reliability, consistency, and comprehensibility. Notably, APUB-enriched optimization problems feature tractability, with particular advantages in two-stage stochastic optimization with random recourse. Empirical demonstrations on two-stage product mix and multi-product newsvendor benchmark problems reveal the benefit of the APUB optimization framework, in comparison with conventional techniques such as sample average approximation and distributionally robust optimization.</description>

      <title>Single-Loop Stochastic Algorithms for Difference of Max-Structured Weakly Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18577v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of non-smooth non-convex problems in the form of $\min_{x}[\max_{y\in Y}\phi(x, y) - \max_{z\in Z}\psi(x, z)]$, where both $\Phi(x) = \max_{y\in Y}\phi(x, y)$ and $\Psi(x)=\max_{z\in Z}\psi(x, z)$ are weakly convex functions, and $\phi(x, y), \psi(x, z)$ are strongly concave functions in terms of $y$ and $z$, respectively. It covers two families of problems that have been studied but are missing single-loop stochastic algorithms, i.e., difference of weakly convex functions and weakly convex strongly-concave min-max problems. We propose a stochastic Moreau envelope approximate gradient method dubbed SMAG, the first single-loop algorithm for solving these problems, and provide a state-of-the-art non-asymptotic convergence rate. The key idea of the design is to compute an approximate gradient of the Moreau envelopes of $\Phi, \Psi$ using only one step of stochastic gradient update of the primal and dual variables. Empirically, we conduct experiments on positive-unlabeled (PU) learning and partial area under ROC curve (pAUC) optimization with an adversarial fairness regularizer to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>McCormick envelopes in mixed-integer PDE-constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: McCormick envelopes are a standard tool for deriving convex relaxations of optimization problems that involve polynomial terms. Such McCormick relaxations provide lower bounds, for example, in branch-and-bound procedures for mixed-integer nonlinear programs but have not gained much attention in PDE-constrained optimization so far. This lack of attention may be due to the distributed nature of such problems, which on the one hand leads to infinitely many linear constraints (generally state constraints that may be difficult to handle) in addition to the state equation for a pointwise formulation of the McCormick envelopes and renders bound-tightening procedures that successively improve the resulting convex relaxations computationally intractable.
  We analyze McCormick envelopes for a problem class that is governed by a semilinear PDE involving a bilinearity and integrality constraints. We approximate the nonlinearity by averaging the involved terms over the cells of a partition of the computational domain on which the PDE is defined. This yields convex relaxations that underestimate the original problem up to an a priori error estimate that depends on the mesh size of the discretization. These approximate McCormick relaxations can be improved by means of an optimization-based bound-tightening procedure. We show that their minimizers converge to minimizers to a limit problem with a pointwise formulation of the McCormick envelopes when driving the mesh size to zero.
  We provide a computational example, for which we certify all of our imposed assumptions. The results point to both the potential of the methodology and the gaps in the research that need to be closed.</description>

      <title>State Dependent Riccati for dynamic boundary control to optimize irrigation in Richards' Equation framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach for the optimization of irrigation in a Richards' equation framework. We introduce a proper cost functional, aimed at minimizing the amount of water provided by irrigation, at the same time maximizing the root water uptake, which is modeled by a sink term in the continuity equation. The control is acting on the boundary of the dynamics and due to the nature of the mathematical problem we use a State-Dependent Riccati approach which provides suboptimal control in feedback form, applied to the system of ODEs resulting from the Richards' equation semidiscretization in space. The problem is tested with existing hydraulic parameters, also considering proper root water uptake functions. The numerical simulations also consider the presence of noise in the model to further validate the use of a feedback control approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the semistability of quiver representations from an algorithmic perspective. We present efficient algorithms for several fundamental computational problems on the semistability of quiver representations: deciding the semistability and $\sigma$-semistability, finding the maximizers of King's criterion, and computing the Harder--Narasimhan filtration. We also investigate a class of polyhedral cones defined by the linear system in King's criterion, which we refer to as King cones. For rank-one representations, we demonstrate that these King cones can be encoded by submodular flow polytopes, enabling us to decide the $\sigma$-semistability in strongly polynomial time. Our approach employs submodularity in quiver representations, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Extensions of $\mathcal{KL}$ and Lyapunov Functions for Discrete-time Dynamical System Peaks Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend two classes of functions classically involved in asymptotic stability analyses for studying a maximization problem on the reachable values of a discrete-time dynamical system. This maximization problem is called a peaks computation problem. The problem is to find a couple composed of an initial state and a time which maximizes a given function over states. The paper focuses on the time component of the optimal solution which is an integer as the time is discrete. We develop a method to provide an upper bound of this integer from a formula which requires a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on [0,1] and a scalar in (0,1). A first result proves that the formula provides, in theory, the optimal integer. However, in practice, the computation cannot be so precise. Then, we develop two alternative methods. The first is based on discontinuous and non strictly increasing/decreasing $\mathcal{KL}$-like functions named $\klgen$ functions. We prove that the existence of a $mathcal{KL}_{\rm gen}$ upper bound is equivalent to the existence of a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on [0,1] and a scalar in (0,1). The construction of the strictly increasing continuous function from a $mathcal{KL}_{\rm gen}$ function needs an extension of the famous Sontag's lemma. Finally, we construct a new type of Lyapunov functions, called Opt-Lyapunov functions, well designed for our peaks computation problem. Opt-Lyapunov functions are well designed as we establish an equivalence theorem between the existence of an Opt-Lyapunov function and of a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on $[0,1]$ and a scalar in (0,1). The construction of a Opt-Lyapunov function from a pair of a strictly increasing and continuous function on [0,1] and a convergent geometric sequence is insipred by the Yoshizawa construction of Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <title>The robust isolated calmness of spectral norm regularized convex matrix optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide a series of characterizations of the robust isolated calmness of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) mapping for spectral norm regularized convex optimization problems. By establishing the variational properties of the spectral norm function, we directly prove that the KKT mapping is isolated calm if and only if the strict Robinson constraint qualification (SRCQ) and the second order sufficient condition (SOSC) hold. Furthermore, we obtain the crucial result that the SRCQ for the primal problem and the SOSC for the dual problem are equivalent. The obtained results can derive more equivalent or sufficient conditions of the robust isolated calmness of the KKT mapping, thereby enriching the stability theory of spectral norm regularized optimization problems and enhancing the usability of isolated calmness in algorithm applications.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas in Wireless Systems: A Tool for Connectivity or a New Security Threat?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of movable antenna (MA) technology has marked a significant advancement in the field of wireless communication research, paving the way for enhanced connectivity, improved signal quality, and adaptability across diverse environments. By allowing antennas to adjust positions dynamically within a finite area at transceivers, this technology enables more favourable channel conditions, optimizing performance across applications like mobile telecommunications and remote sensing. However, throughout history, the introduction of every new technology has presented opportunities for misuse by malicious individuals. Just as MAs can enhance connectivity, they may also be exploited for disruptive purposes such as jamming. In this paper, we examine the impact of an MA-enhanced jamming system equipped with $M$ antennas in a downlink multi-user communication scenario, where a base station (BS) with $N$ antennas transmits data to $K$ single-antenna users. Simulation results show that an adversary equipped with MAs reduce the system sum rate by $30\%$ more effectively than fixed-position antennas (FPAs). Additionally, MAs increase the outage probability by $25\%$ over FPAs, leading to a $20\%$ increase in the number of users experiencing outages. The highlighted risks posed by unauthorized use of this technology, underscore the urgent need for effective regulations and countermeasures to ensure its secure application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.06961v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize a rich class of valuated matroids, called R-minor valuated matroids that includes the indicator functions of matroids, and is closed under operations such as taking minors, duality, and induction by network. We exhibit a family of valuated matroids that are not R-minor based on sparse paving matroids. Valuated matroids are inherently related to gross substitute valuations in mathematical economics. By the same token we refute the Matroid Based Valuation Conjecture by Ostrovsky and Paes Leme (Theoretical Economics 2015) asserting that every gross substitute valuation arises from weighted matroid rank functions by repeated applications of merge and endowment operations. Our result also has implications in the context of Lorentzian polynomials: it reveals the limitations of known construction operations.</description>

      <title>Discretization of Total Variation in Optimization with Integrality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce discretizations of infinite-dimensional optimization problems with total variation regularization and integrality constraints on the optimization variables. We advance the discretization of the dual formulation of the total variation term with Raviart--Thomas functions which is known from literature for certain convex problems. Since we have an integrality constraint, the previous analysis from Caillaud and Chambolle [10] does not hold anymore. Even weaker $\Gamma$-convergence results do not hold anymore because the recovery sequences generally need to attain non-integer values to recover the total variation of the limit function. We solve this issue by introducing a discretization of the input functions on an embedded, finer mesh. A superlinear coupling of the mesh sizes implies an averaging on the coarser mesh of the Raviart--Thomas ansatz, which enables to recover the total variation of integer-valued limit functions with integer-valued discretized input functions. Moreover, we are able to estimate the discretized total variation of the recovery sequence by the total variation of its limit and an error depending on the mesh size ratio. For the discretized optimization problems, we additionally add a constraint that vanishes in the limit and enforces compactness of the sequence of minimizers, which yields their convergence to a minimizer of the original problem. This constraint contains a degree of freedom whose admissible range is determined. Its choice may have a strong impact on the solutions in practice as we demonstrate with an example from imaging.</description>

      <title>Learning rheological parameters of non-Newtonian fluids from velocimetry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct the flow field and learn the unknown N-S parameters. By incorporating a Carreau shear-thinning viscosity model into the N-S problem, we devise an algorithm that learns the most likely Carreau parameters of a shear-thinning fluid, and estimates their uncertainties, from velocimetry data alone. We then conduct a flow-MRI experiment to obtain velocimetry data of an axisymmetric laminar jet through an idealised medical device (FDA nozzle) for a blood analogue fluid. We show that the algorithm can successfully reconstruct the flow field by learning the most likely Carreau parameters, and that the learned parameters are in very good agreement with rheometry measurements. The algorithm accepts any algebraic effective viscosity model, as long as the model is differentiable, and it can be extended to more complicated non-Newtonian fluids (e.g. Oldroyd-B fluid) if a viscoelastic model is incorporated into the N-S problem.</description>
