      <title>Comparison of Methods for Rotating a Point in $\mathbb{R}^3$: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents and compares four approaches for computing the rotation of a point about an axis by an angle in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We illustrate these methods by computing, by hand, the rotation of point $P=(1,0,1)^T$ about axis $\mathbf{a}=(1,1,1)^T$ by angle $\theta=60^\circ$ (following the right-hand rule). The four methods considered are:
  (1) an ad hoc geometric method exploiting a symmetry in the situation;
  (2) a projection method that sets up a new coordinate system using the dot and cross products;
  (3) a matrix method which rotates the standard basis and uses matrix-vector multiplication;
  (4) a Geometric (Clifford) Algebra method that represents the rotation as a double reflection via a rotor.
  All methods yield the same exact result: $P'=\left(\tfrac{4}{3},\tfrac{1}{3},\tfrac{1}{3}\right)^T$.</description>

      <title>Distinct Distances Between a Line and Strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of distinct distances result: a lower bound on the number of distances between points on a line and points on a two-dimensional strip. This can be seen as a generalization of the well-studied problems of distances between points on two lines or curves. Unlike these existing problems, this new variant only makes sense if the points satisfy an additional spacing condition.
  Our work can also be seen as an exploration of the proximity technique that was recently introduced by Solymosi and Zahl. This technique lies at the heart of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Fractal Zeta Functions and Complex Dimensions of Ahlfors Metric Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While classical analysis dealt primarily with smooth spaces, much research has been done in the last half century on expanding the theory to the nonsmooth case. Metric Measure spaces are the natural setting for such analysis, and it is thus important to understand the geometry of subsets of these spaces. In this paper we will focus on the geometry of Ahlfors regular spaces, Metric Measure spaces with an additional regularity condition. Historically, fractals have been studied using different ideas of dimension which have all proven to be unsatisfactory to some degree. The theory of complex dimensions, developed by M.L. Lapidus and a number of collaborators, was developed in part to better understand fractality in the Euclidean case and seeks to overcome these problems. Of particular interest is the recent theory of complex dimensions in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, as studied by M.L.Lapidus, G. Radunovi\'c, and D. Zubrini\'c, who introduced and studied the properties of the distance zeta function $\zeta_A$. We will show that this theory of complex dimensions naturally generalizes to the case of Ahlfors regular spaces, as the distance zeta function can be modified to these spaces and all of its main properties carry over. We also provide a selection of examples in Ahlfors spaces, as well as hints that the theory can be expanded to a more general setting.</description>

      <title>The Vectorial Hadwiger Theorem on Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete classification of continuous, dually epi-translation invariant, and rotation equivariant valuations on convex functions is established. This characterizes the recently introduced functional Minkowski vectors, which naturally extend the classical Minkowski relations. For this, the existence of these operators with singular densities is shown, along with additional representations involving mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures, Kubota-type formulas, and area measures of higher dimensional convex bodies. Dual results are formulated for valuations on super-coercive convex functions.</description>

      <title>Lattice packing of spheres in high dimensions using a stochastically evolving ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that in any dimension $n$ there exists an origin-symmetric ellipsoid ${\mathcal{E}} \subset {\mathbb{R}}^n$ of volume $ c n^2 $ that contains no points of ${\mathbb{Z}}^n$ other than the origin, where $c &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Equivalently, there exists a lattice sphere packing in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ whose density is at least $cn^2 \cdot 2^{-n}$. Previously known constructions of sphere packings in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ had densities of the order of magnitude of $n \cdot 2^{-n}$, up to logarithmic factors. Our proof utilizes a stochastically evolving ellipsoid that accumulates at least $c n^2$ lattice points on its boundary, while containing no lattice points in its interior except for the origin.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian correlation inequality for centered convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Gaussian correlation inequality holds true for centered convex sets. The proof is based on Milman's observation that the Gaussian correlation inequality may be regarded as an example of the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality. We give further extensions of the Gaussian correlation inequality formulated by Szarek--Werner.</description>

      <title>A general framework for quasi-isometries in symbolic dynamics beyond groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algebraic structure which encodes a collection of countable graphs through a set of states, generators and relations. For these structures, which we call blueprints, we provide a general framework for symbolic dynamics under a partial monoid action, and for transferring invariants of their symbolic dynamics through quasi-isometries. In particular, we show that the undecidability of the domino problem, the existence of strongly aperiodic subshifts of finite type, and the existence of subshifts of finite type without computable points are all quasi-isometry invariants for finitely presented blueprints. As an application of this model, we show that a variant of the domino problem for geometric tilings of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is undecidable for $d \geq 2$ on any underlying tiling space with finite local complexity.</description>

      <title>Universal coding, intrinsic volumes, and metric complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sequential probability assignment in the Gaussian setting, where the goal is to predict, or equivalently compress, a sequence of real-valued observations almost as well as the best Gaussian distribution with mean constrained to a given subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. First, in the case of a convex constraint set $K$, we express the hardness of the prediction problem (the minimax regret) in terms of the intrinsic volumes of $K$; specifically, it equals the logarithm of the Wills functional from convex geometry. We then establish a comparison inequality for the Wills functional in the general nonconvex case, which underlines the metric nature of this quantity and generalizes the Slepian-Sudakov-Fernique comparison principle for the Gaussian width. Motivated by this inequality, we characterize the exact order of magnitude of the considered functional for a general nonconvex set, in terms of global covering numbers and local Gaussian widths. This implies sharp estimates, of metric nature, on the log-Laplace transform of the intrinsic volume sequence of a convex body. As part of our analysis, we also characterize the minimax redundancy for a general constraint set. We finally relate and contrast our findings with classical asymptotic results in information theory.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity for quasiminima of double-phase problems on metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition for H\"older continuity at a boundary point for quasiminima of double-phase functionals of $p,q$-Laplace type, in the setting of metric measure spaces equipped with a doubling measure and supporting a Poincar\'e inequality. We use a variational approach based on De Giorgi-type conditions to give a pointwise estimate near a boundary point. The proofs are based on a careful phase analysis and estimates in the intrinsic geometries.</description>

      <title>The Power of Recursive Embeddings for $\ell_p$ Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metric embedding is a powerful tool used extensively in mathematics and computer science. We devise a new method of using metric embeddings recursively, which turns out to be particularly effective in $\ell_p$ spaces, $p&gt;2$, yielding state-of-the-art results for Lipschitz decomposition, for Nearest Neighbor Search, and for embedding into $\ell_2$. In a nutshell, our method composes metric embeddings by viewing them as reductions between problems, and thereby obtains a new reduction that is substantially more effective than the known reduction that employs a single embedding. We in fact apply this method recursively, oftentimes using double recursion, which further amplifies the gap from a single embedding.</description>

      <title>On the $W$-entropy and Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the $W$-entropy formula and the monotonicity and rigidity theorem of the $W$-entropy for the heat flow on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces $(X, d, \mu)$, where $K\in \mathbb{R}$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$ is the geometric dimension of $(X, d, \mu)$ and $N\geq n$. We also prove the $K$-concavity of the Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ spaces. As an application, we derive the Shannon entropy isoperimetric inequality and the Stam type logarithmic Sobolev inequality on RCD$(0, N)$ spaces with maximal volume growth condition. Finally, we prove the rigidity theorem for the Stam type logarithmic Sobolev inequality with sharp constant on noncollapsing RCD$(0, N)$ spaces.</description>
