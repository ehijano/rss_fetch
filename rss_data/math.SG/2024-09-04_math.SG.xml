      <title>Instability of Legendrian knottedness, and non-regular Lagrangian concordances of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the family of smoothly non-isotopic Legendrian pretzel knots from the work of Cornwell-Ng-Sivek that all have the same Legendrian invariants as the standard unknot have front-spuns that are Legendrian isotopic to the front-spun of the unknot. Besides that, we construct the first examples of Lagrangian concordances between Legendrian knots that are not regular, and hence not decomposable. Finally, we show that the relation of Lagrangian concordance between Legendrian knots is not anti-symmetric, and hence does not define a partial order. The latter two results are based upon a new type of flexibility for Lagrangian concordances with stabilised Legendrian ends.</description>

      <title>A survey of equivariant operations on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey paper, we will collate various different ideas and thoughts regarding equivariant operations on quantum cohomology (and some in more general Floer theory) for a symplectic manifold. We will discuss a general notion of equivariant quantum operations associated to finite groups, in addition to their properties, examples, and calculations. We will provide a brief connection to Floer theoretic invariants. We then provide abridged descriptions (as per the author's understanding) of work by other authors in the field, along with their major results. Finally we discuss the first step to compact groups, specifically $S^1$-equivariant operations. Contained within this survey are also a sketch of the idea of mod-$p$ pseudocycles, and an in-depth appendix detailing the author's understanding of when one can define these equivariant operations in an additive way.</description>

      <title>Transverse foliations for two-degree-of-freedom mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-degree-of-freedom mechanical system for energies slightly above a critical value. The critical set of the potential function is assumed to contain a finite number of saddle points. As the energy increases across the critical value, a disk-like component of the Hill region gets connected to other components precisely at the saddles. Under certain convexity assumptions on the critical set, we show the existence of a weakly convex foliation in the region of the energy surface where the interesting dynamics takes place. The binding of the foliation is formed by the index-$2$ Lyapunov orbits in the neck region about the rest points and a particular index-$3$ orbit. Among other dynamical implications, the transverse foliation forces the existence of periodic orbits, homoclinics, and heteroclinics to the Lyapunov orbits. We apply the results to the H\'enon-Heiles potential for energies slightly above $1/6$. We also discuss the existence of transverse foliations for decoupled mechanical systems, including the frozen Hill's lunar problem with centrifugal force, the Stark problem, the Euler problem of two centers, and the potential of a chemical reaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the derived Rabinowitz Fukaya category of a Liouville domain $M$ of dimension $2n$ is $(n-1)$-Calabi--Yau assuming the wrapped Fukaya category of $M$ admits an at most countable set of Lagrangians that generate it and satisfy some finiteness condition on morphism spaces between them.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Lagrangian correspondence and a conjecture of Teleman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13926v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Floer theory of equivariant Lagrangian correspondences and apply it to deduce a conjecture of Teleman, which finds the relation between the disc potential of an invariant Lagrangian submanifold and that of its quotient. A main step is to extend Fukaya's construction of an $A_\infty$ tri-module for Lagrangian correspondences to Borel spaces. We find that the equivariant obstruction of a Lagrangian correspondence plays an essential role, which leads to quantum corrections in the disc potentials of quotients. We solve the obstruction in the toric setup and find the relation with mirror maps for compact semi-Fano toric manifolds.</description>

      <title>Generic doubling of rectangular pegs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13209v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a multiplicity result for rectangular pegs that there is a generic class of smooth Jordan curves in which every curve admits two geometrically distinct similar inscribed rectangles with aspect angle in $(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$, based on the a priori existence result of rectangular peg by Greene and Lobb [GL21], in which the rectangular peg problem is translated into finding intersection points of two Lagrangian tori. The key insights are certain generic geometric transversality of the two tori, and the correspondence between the intersection points and the inscribed rectangles. We present two distinct proofs: one involves the Lagrangian Floer homology, and the other is differential topological in nature which employs a novel computation formula for the algebraic intersection number. Moreover, such generic doubling result can be further extended to cyclic quadrilateral pegs based on [GL23]. In Appendix B, written jointly with Urs Frauenfelder, we provide the detailed derivation of this computation formula.</description>

      <title>On Amiot's conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a survey paper in 2011, Amiot proposed a conjectural characterisation of the cluster categories which were conceived in the mid 2000s to lift the combinatorics of Fomin-Zelevinsky's cluster algebras to the categorical level. This paper is devoted to a proof of (a variant of) her conjecture. More generally, cluster categories admit higher-dimensional and relative variants, the so-called Higgs categories recently introduced by Wu. We also prove higher-dimensional and relative variants of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Deformation quantization and perverse sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kashiwara, Polesello, Schapira and D'Agnolo defined canonical deformation quantizations of a holomorphic symplectic manifold and a holomorphic Lagrangian submanifold equipped with an orientation data. The goal of this paper is to use deformation quantization modules to construct a Fukaya-like category of holomorphic Lagrangians, resolving a conjecture of Joyce. Our main result describes the RHom complex between two such deformation quantization modules associated to a pair of Lagrangian submanifolds in terms of the derived geometry of the Lagrangian intersection. Namely, we identify the RHom complex with the DT sheaf associated to the d-critical structure on the Lagrangian intersection. Via a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence this describes the RHom complex in the category of microsheaves of sheaf quantizations of conic holomorphic Lagrangians.</description>

      <title>Circle Foliations Revisited: Periods of Flows whose Orbits are all Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our purpose here is to adapt the results of Geodesic circle foliations for Reeb flows or Hamiltonian flows on contact manifolds. Consequently, all periods are exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the contact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic flows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and some geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic oscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct calculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum of semiclassical Shr\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical analogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.</description>
