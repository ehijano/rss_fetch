      <title>PierGuard: A Planning Framework for Underwater Robotic Inspection of Coastal Piers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using underwater robots instead of humans for the inspection of coastal piers can enhance efficiency while reducing risks. A key challenge in performing these tasks lies in achieving efficient and rapid path planning within complex environments. Sampling-based path planning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree* (RRT*), have demonstrated notable performance in high-dimensional spaces. In recent years, researchers have begun designing various geometry-inspired heuristics and neural network-driven heuristics to further enhance the effectiveness of RRT*. However, the performance of these general path planning methods still requires improvement when applied to highly cluttered underwater environments. In this paper, we propose PierGuard, which combines the strengths of bidirectional search and neural network-driven heuristic regions. We design a specialized neural network to generate high-quality heuristic regions in cluttered maps, thereby improving the performance of the path planning. Through extensive simulation and real-world ocean field experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method compared with previous research. Our method achieves approximately 2.6 times the performance of the state-of-the-art geometric-based sampling method and nearly 4.9 times that of the state-of-the-art learning-based sampling method. Our results provide valuable insights for the automation of pier inspection and the enhancement of maritime safety.

      <title>A Physics-informed End-to-End Occupancy Framework for Motion Planning of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and interpretable motion planning is essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs) navigating complex and uncertain environments. While recent end-to-end occupancy prediction methods have improved environmental understanding, they typically lack explicit physical constraints, limiting safety and generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that integrates verifiable physical rules into the occupancy learning process. Specifically, we embed artificial potential fields (APF) as physics-informed guidance during network training to ensure that predicted occupancy maps are both data-efficient and physically plausible. Our architecture combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture spatial and temporal dependencies while preserving model flexibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves task completion rate, safety margins, and planning efficiency across diverse driving scenarios, confirming its potential for reliable deployment in real-world AV systems.</description>

      <title>VISTA: Generative Visual Imagination for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks agents with locating specific objects in unseen environments using natural language instructions and visual cues. Many existing VLN approaches typically follow an 'observe-and-reason' schema, that is, agents observe the environment and decide on the next action to take based on the visual observations of their surroundings. They often face challenges in long-horizon scenarios due to limitations in immediate observation and vision-language modality gaps. To overcome this, we present VISTA, a novel framework that employs an 'imagine-and-align' navigation strategy. Specifically, we leverage the generative prior of pre-trained diffusion models for dynamic visual imagination conditioned on both local observations and high-level language instructions. A Perceptual Alignment Filter module then grounds these goal imaginations against current observations, guiding an interpretable and structured reasoning process for action selection. Experiments show that VISTA sets new state-of-the-art results on Room-to-Room (R2R) and RoboTHOR benchmarks, e.g.,+3.6% increase in Success Rate on R2R. Extensive ablation analysis underscores the value of integrating forward-looking imagination, perceptual alignment, and structured reasoning for robust navigation in long-horizon environments.</description>

      <title>Virtual Holonomic Constraints in Motion Planning: Revisiting Feasibility and Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the feasibility of virtual holonomic constraints (VHCs) in the context of motion planning for underactuated mechanical systems with a single degree of underactuation. While existing literature has established a widely accepted definition of VHC, we argue that this definition is overly restrictive and excludes a broad class of admissible trajectories from consideration. To illustrate this point, we analyze a periodic motion of the Planar Vertical Take-Off and Landing (PVTOL) aircraft. The corresponding phase trajectory and reference control input are analytic functions. We demonstrate the stabilizability of this solution by constructing a feedback controller that ensures asymptotic orbital stability. However, for this solution -- as well as for a broad class of similar ones -- there exists no VHC that satisfies the conventional definition. This observation calls for a reconsideration of how the notion of VHC is defined, with the potential to significantly expand the practical applicability of VHCs in motion planning.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Complete Online Decentralized Multi-Agent Pathfinding with Rapid Information Sharing using Motion Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Pathfinding with Rapid Information Sharing using Motion Constraints), a decentralized algorithm designed to address the multi-task multi-agent pathfinding (MT-MAPF) problem. PRISM enables large teams of agents to concurrently plan safe and efficient paths for multiple tasks while avoiding collisions. It employs a rapid communication strategy that uses information packets to exchange motion constraint information, enhancing cooperative pathfinding and situational awareness, even in scenarios without direct communication. We prove that PRISM resolves and avoids all deadlock scenarios when possible, a critical challenge in decentralized pathfinding. Empirically, we evaluate PRISM across five environments and 25 random scenarios, benchmarking it against the centralized Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and the decentralized Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS) algorithms. PRISM demonstrates scalability and solution quality, supporting 3.4 times more agents than CBS and handling up to 2.5 times more tasks in narrow passage environments than TPTS. Additionally, PRISM matches CBS in solution quality while achieving faster computation times, even under low-connectivity conditions. Its decentralized design reduces the computational burden on individual agents, making it scalable for large environments. These results confirm PRISM's robustness, scalability, and effectiveness in complex and dynamic pathfinding scenarios.</description>

      <title>Land-Coverage Aware Path-Planning for Multi-UAV Swarms in Search and Rescue Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become vital in search-and-rescue (SAR) missions, with autonomous mission planning improving response times and coverage efficiency. Early approaches primarily used path planning techniques such as A*, potential-fields, or Dijkstra's algorithm, while recent approaches have incorporated meta-heuristic frameworks like genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization to balance competing objectives such as network connectivity, energy efficiency, and strategic placement of charging stations. However, terrain-aware path planning remains under-explored, despite its critical role in optimizing UAV SAR deployments. To address this gap, we present a computer-vision based terrain-aware mission planner that autonomously extracts and analyzes terrain topology to enhance SAR pre-flight planning. Our framework uses a deep segmentation network fine-tuned on our own collection of landcover datasets to transform satellite imagery into a structured, grid-based representation of the operational area. This classification enables terrain-specific UAV-task allocation, improving deployment strategies in complex environments. We address the challenge of irregular terrain partitions, by introducing a two-stage partitioning scheme that first evaluates terrain monotonicity along coordinate axes before applying a cost-based recursive partitioning process, minimizing unnecessary splits and optimizing path efficiency. Empirical validation in a high-fidelity simulation environment demonstrates that our approach improves search and dispatch time over multiple meta-heuristic techniques and against a competing state-of-the-art method. These results highlight its potential for large-scale SAR operations, where rapid response and efficient UAV coordination are critical.</description>

      <title>What Matters for Batch Online Reinforcement Learning in Robotics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to learn from large batches of autonomously collected data for policy improvement -- a paradigm we refer to as batch online reinforcement learning -- holds the promise of enabling truly scalable robot learning by significantly reducing the need for human effort of data collection while getting benefits from self-improvement. Yet, despite the promise of this paradigm, it remains challenging to achieve due to algorithms not being able to learn effectively from the autonomous data. For example, prior works have applied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch online RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from the autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This raises the question of what matters for effective batch online RL in robotics. Motivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three axes -- (i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy expressivity -- and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with the amount of autonomous data. Through our analysis, we make several observations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch online RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods. Building on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction -- via choosing the best action in the distribution of the policy -- is necessary over traditional policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an expressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based on this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL. We then show a simple addition to the recipe of using temporally-correlated noise to obtain more diversity results in further performance gains. Our recipe obtains significantly better performance and scaling compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>A Tightly Coupled IMU-Based Motion Capture Approach for Estimating Multibody Kinematics and Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) enable portable, multibody motion capture (MoCap) in diverse environments beyond the laboratory, making them a practical choice for diagnosing mobility disorders and supporting rehabilitation in clinical or home settings. However, challenges associated with IMU measurements, including magnetic distortions and drift errors, complicate their broader use for MoCap. In this work, we propose a tightly coupled motion capture approach that directly integrates IMU measurements with multibody dynamic models via an Iterated Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) to simultaneously estimate the system's kinematics and kinetics. By enforcing kinematic and kinetic properties and utilizing only accelerometer and gyroscope data, our method improves IMU-based state estimation accuracy. Our approach is designed to allow for incorporating additional sensor data, such as optical MoCap measurements and joint torque readings, to further enhance estimation accuracy. We validated our approach using highly accurate ground truth data from a 3 Degree of Freedom (DoF) pendulum and a 6 DoF Kuka robot. We demonstrate a maximum Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) in the pendulum's computed joint angles of 3.75 degrees compared to optical MoCap Inverse Kinematics (IK), which serves as the gold standard in the absence of internal encoders. For the Kuka robot, we observe a maximum joint angle RMSD of 3.24 degrees compared to the Kuka's internal encoders, while the maximum joint angle RMSD of the optical MoCap IK compared to the encoders was 1.16 degrees. Additionally, we report a maximum joint torque RMSD of 2 Nm in the pendulum compared to optical MoCap Inverse Dynamics (ID), and 3.73 Nm in the Kuka robot relative to its internal torque sensors.</description>

      <title>CLTP: Contrastive Language-Tactile Pre-training for 3D Contact Geometry Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in integrating tactile sensing with vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for robotic multimodal perception. However, existing tactile descriptions remain limited to superficial attributes like texture, neglecting critical contact states essential for robotic manipulation. To bridge this gap, we propose CLTP, an intuitive and effective language tactile pretraining framework that aligns tactile 3D point clouds with natural language in various contact scenarios, thus enabling contact-state-aware tactile language understanding for contact-rich manipulation tasks. We first collect a novel dataset of 50k+ tactile 3D point cloud-language pairs, where descriptions explicitly capture multidimensional contact states (e.g., contact location, shape, and force) from the tactile sensor's perspective. CLTP leverages a pre-aligned and frozen vision-language feature space to bridge holistic textual and tactile modalities. Experiments validate its superiority in three downstream tasks: zero-shot 3D classification, contact state classification, and tactile 3D large language model (LLM) interaction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to align tactile and language representations from the contact state perspective for manipulation tasks, providing great potential for tactile-language-action model learning. Code and datasets are open-sourced at https://sites.google.com/view/cltp/.</description>

      <title>HandCept: A Visual-Inertial Fusion Framework for Accurate Proprioception in Dexterous Hands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As robotics progresses toward general manipulation, dexterous hands are becoming increasingly critical. However, proprioception in dexterous hands remains a bottleneck due to limitations in volume and generality. In this work, we present HandCept, a novel visual-inertial proprioception framework designed to overcome the challenges of traditional joint angle estimation methods. HandCept addresses the difficulty of achieving accurate and robust joint angle estimation in dynamic environments where both visual and inertial measurements are prone to noise and drift. It leverages a zero-shot learning approach using a wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and 9-axis IMUs, fused in real time via a latency-free Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Our results show that HandCept achieves joint angle estimation errors between $2^{\circ}$ and $4^{\circ}$ without observable drift, outperforming visual-only and inertial-only methods. Furthermore, we validate the stability and uniformity of the IMU system, demonstrating that a common base frame across IMUs simplifies system calibration. To support sim-to-real transfer, we also open-sourced our high-fidelity rendering pipeline, which is essential for training without real-world ground truth. This work offers a robust, generalizable solution for proprioception in dexterous hands, with significant implications for robotic manipulation and human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>Rethink Repeatable Measures of Robot Performance with Statistical Query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a specific aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly imposed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth reference) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equipment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject robot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expected value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We propose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenarios: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (ii) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracking performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.</description>

      <title>Scaling Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning for Underwater Acoustic Tracking via Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AV) offer a cost-effective solution for scientific missions such as underwater tracking. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for controlling AVs in complex marine environments. However, scaling these techniques to a fleet--essential for multi-target tracking or targets with rapid, unpredictable motion--presents significant computational challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is notoriously sample-inefficient, and while high-fidelity simulators like Gazebo's LRAUV provide 100x faster-than-real-time single-robot simulations, they offer no significant speedup for multi-vehicle scenarios, making MARL training impractical. To address these limitations, we propose an iterative distillation method that transfers high-fidelity simulations into a simplified, GPU-accelerated environment while preserving high-level dynamics. This approach achieves up to a 30,000x speedup over Gazebo through parallelization, enabling efficient training via end-to-end GPU acceleration. Additionally, we introduce a novel Transformer-based architecture (TransfMAPPO) that learns multi-agent policies invariant to the number of agents and targets, significantly improving sample efficiency. Following large-scale curriculum learning conducted entirely on GPU, we perform extensive evaluations in Gazebo, demonstrating that our method maintains tracking errors below 5 meters over extended durations, even in the presence of multiple fast-moving targets. This work bridges the gap between large-scale MARL training and high-fidelity deployment, providing a scalable framework for autonomous fleet control in real-world sea missions.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-based Fault-Tolerant Control for Quadrotor with Online Transformer Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multirotors play a significant role in diverse field robotics applications but remain highly susceptible to actuator failures, leading to rapid instability and compromised mission reliability. While various fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategies using reinforcement learning (RL) have been widely explored, most previous approaches require prior knowledge of the multirotor model or struggle to adapt to new configurations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid RL-based FTC framework integrated with a transformer-based online adaptation module. Our framework leverages a transformer architecture to infer latent representations in real time, enabling adaptation to previously unseen system models without retraining. We evaluate our method in a PyBullet simulation under loss-of-effectiveness actuator faults, achieving a 95% success rate and a positional root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.129 m, outperforming existing adaptation methods with 86% success and an RMSE of 0.153 m. Further evaluations on quadrotors with varying configurations confirm the robustness of our framework across untrained dynamics. These results demonstrate the potential of our framework to enhance the adaptability and reliability of multirotors, enabling efficient fault management in dynamic and uncertain environments.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel constrained Factor Graph Optimization (FGO)-based approach for networked inertial navigation in pedestrian localization. To effectively mitigate the drift inherent in inertial navigation solutions, we incorporate kinematic constraints directly into the nonlinear optimization framework. Specifically, we utilize equality constraints, such as Zero-Velocity Updates (ZUPTs), and inequality constraints representing the maximum allowable distance between body-mounted Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) based on human anatomical limitations. While equality constraints are straightforwardly integrated as error factors, inequality constraints cannot be explicitly represented in standard FGO formulations. To address this, we introduce a differentiable softmax-based penalty term in the FGO cost function to enforce inequality constraints smoothly and robustly. The proposed constrained FGO approach leverages temporal correlations across multiple epochs, resulting in optimal state trajectory estimates while consistently maintaining constraint satisfaction. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms conventional Kalman filter approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for pedestrian navigation.</description>

      <title>SKiD-SLAM: Robust, Lightweight, and Distributed Multi-Robot LiDAR SLAM in Resource-Constrained Field Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed LiDAR SLAM is crucial for achieving efficient robot autonomy and improving the scalability of mapping. However, two issues need to be considered when applying it in field environments: one is resource limitation, and the other is inter/intra-robot association. The resource limitation issue arises when the data size exceeds the processing capacity of the network or memory, especially when utilizing communication systems or onboard computers in the field. The inter/intra-robot association issue occurs due to the narrow convergence region of ICP under large viewpoint differences, triggering many false positive loops and ultimately resulting in an inconsistent global map for multi-robot systems. To tackle these problems, we propose a distributed LiDAR SLAM framework designed for versatile field applications, called SKiD-SLAM. Extending our previous work that solely focused on lightweight place recognition and fast and robust global registration, we present a multi-robot mapping framework that focuses on robust and lightweight inter-robot loop closure in distributed LiDAR SLAM. Through various environmental experiments, we demonstrate that our method is more robust and lightweight compared to other state-of-the-art distributed SLAM approaches, overcoming resource limitation and inter/intra-robot association issues. Also, we validated the field applicability of our approach through mapping experiments in real-world planetary emulation terrain and cave environments, which are in-house datasets. Our code will be available at https://sparolab.github.io/research/skid_slam/.</description>

      <title>Motion Control of High-Dimensional Musculoskeletal Systems with Hierarchical Model-Based Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional nonlinear systems, such as those found in biological and robotic applications, is challenging due to large state and action spaces. While deep reinforcement learning has achieved a number of successes in these domains, it is computationally intensive and time consuming, and therefore not suitable for solving large collections of tasks that require significant manual tuning. In this work, we introduce Model Predictive Control with Morphology-aware Proportional Control (MPC^2), a hierarchical model-based learning algorithm for zero-shot and near-real-time control of high-dimensional complex dynamical systems. MPC^2 uses a sampling-based model predictive controller for target posture planning, and enables robust control for high-dimensional tasks by incorporating a morphology-aware proportional controller for actuator coordination. The algorithm enables motion control of a high-dimensional human musculoskeletal model in a variety of motion tasks, such as standing, walking on different terrains, and imitating sports activities. The reward function of MPC^2 can be tuned via black-box optimization, drastically reducing the need for human-intensive reward engineering.</description>

      <title>Training Strategies for Efficient Embodied Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) -- wherein a model predicts helpful intermediate representations before choosing actions -- provides an effective method for improving the generalization and performance of robot policies, especially vision-language-action models (VLAs). While such approaches have been shown to improve performance and generalization, they suffer from core limitations, like needing specialized robot reasoning data and slow inference speeds. To design new robot reasoning approaches that address these issues, a more complete characterization of why reasoning helps policy performance is critical. We hypothesize several mechanisms by which robot reasoning improves policies -- (1) better representation learning, (2) improved learning curricularization, and (3) increased expressivity -- then devise simple variants of robot CoT reasoning to isolate and test each one. We find that learning to generate reasonings does lead to better VLA representations, while attending to the reasonings aids in actually leveraging these features for improved action prediction. Our results provide us with a better understanding of why CoT reasoning helps VLAs, which we use to introduce two simple and lightweight alternative recipes for robot reasoning. Our proposed approaches achieve significant performance gains over non-reasoning policies, state-of-the-art results on the LIBERO-90 benchmark, and a 3x inference speedup compared to standard robot reasoning.</description>

      <title>Automatic Curriculum Learning for Driving Scenarios: Towards Robust and Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a ``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization, achieving higher success rates: +9\% in low traffic density, +21\% in high traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of RL-based autonomous driving agents.</description>

      <title>Fast Contact Detection via Fusion of Joint and Inertial Sensors for Parallel Robots in Human-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast contact detection is crucial for safe human-robot collaboration. Observers based on proprioceptive information can be used for contact detection but have first-order error dynamics, which results in delays. Sensor fusion based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of accelerometers and gyroscopes is advantageous for reducing delays. The acceleration estimation enables the direct calculation of external forces. For serial robots, the installation of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes is required for dynamics modeling since the joint coordinates are the minimal coordinates. Alternatively, parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential to use only one IMU on the end-effector platform, which already presents the minimal coordinates of the PR. This work introduces a sensor-fusion method for contact detection using encoders and only one low-cost, consumer-grade IMU for a PR. The end-effector accelerations are estimated by an extended Kalman filter and incorporated into the dynamics to calculate external forces. In real-world experiments with a planar PR, we demonstrate that this approach reduces the detection duration by up to 50% compared to a momentum observer and enables the collision and clamping detection within 3-39ms.</description>

      <title>MA-ROESL: Motion-aware Rapid Reward Optimization for Efficient Robot Skill Learning from Single Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated excellent high-level planning capabilities, enabling locomotion skill learning from video demonstrations without the need for meticulous human-level reward design. However, the improper frame sampling method and low training efficiency of current methods remain a critical bottleneck, resulting in substantial computational overhead and time costs. To address this limitation, we propose Motion-aware Rapid Reward Optimization for Efficient Robot Skill Learning from Single Videos (MA-ROESL). MA-ROESL integrates a motion-aware frame selection method to implicitly enhance the quality of VLM-generated reward functions. It further employs a hybrid three-phase training pipeline that improves training efficiency via rapid reward optimization and derives the final policy through online fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that MA-ROESL significantly enhances training efficiency while faithfully reproducing locomotion skills in both simulated and real-world settings, thereby underscoring its potential as a robust and scalable framework for efficient robot locomotion skill learning from video demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Diffusion Policy Optimization for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown the great potential of diffusion models in improving reinforcement learning (RL) by modeling complex policies, expressing a high degree of multi-modality, and efficiently handling high-dimensional continuous control tasks. However, there is currently limited research on how to optimize diffusion-based polices (e.g., Diffusion Policy) fast and stably. In this paper, we propose an Adam-based Diffusion Policy Optimization (ADPO), a fast algorithmic framework containing best practices for fine-tuning diffusion-based polices in robotic control tasks using the adaptive gradient descent method in RL. Adaptive gradient method is less studied in training RL, let alone diffusion-based policies. We confirm that ADPO outperforms other diffusion-based RL methods in terms of overall effectiveness for fine-tuning on standard robotic tasks. Concretely, we conduct extensive experiments on standard robotic control tasks to test ADPO, where, particularly, six popular diffusion-based RL methods are provided as benchmark methods. Experimental results show that ADPO acquires better or comparable performance than the baseline methods. Finally, we systematically analyze the sensitivity of multiple hyperparameters in standard robotics tasks, providing guidance for subsequent practical applications. Our video demonstrations are released in https://github.com/Timeless-lab/ADPO.git.</description>

      <title>Continuous World Coverage Path Planning for Fixed-Wing UAVs using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is critical for applications such as precision agriculture and search and rescue. While traditional methods rely on discrete grid-based representations, real-world UAV operations require power-efficient continuous motion planning. We formulate the UAV CPP problem in a continuous environment, minimizing power consumption while ensuring complete coverage. Our approach models the environment with variable-size axis-aligned rectangles and UAV motion with curvature-constrained B\'ezier curves. We train a reinforcement learning agent using an action-mapping-based Soft Actor-Critic (AM-SAC) algorithm employing a self-adaptive curriculum. Experiments on both procedurally generated and hand-crafted scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning energy-efficient coverage strategies.</description>

      <title>MDF: Multi-Modal Data Fusion with CNN-Based Object Detection for Enhanced Indoor Localization Using LiDAR-SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor localization faces persistent challenges in achieving high accuracy, particularly in GPS-deprived environments. This study unveils a cutting-edge handheld indoor localization system that integrates 2D LiDAR and IMU sensors, delivering enhanced high-velocity precision mapping, computational efficiency, and real-time adaptability. Unlike 3D LiDAR systems, it excels with rapid processing, low-cost scalability, and robust performance, setting new standards for emergency response, autonomous navigation, and industrial automation. Enhanced with a CNN-driven object detection framework and optimized through Cartographer SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping ) in ROS, the system significantly reduces Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 21.03%, achieving exceptional precision compared to state-of-the-art approaches like SC-ALOAM, with a mean x-position error of -0.884 meters (1.976 meters). The integration of CNN-based object detection ensures robustness in mapping and localization, even in cluttered or dynamic environments, outperforming existing methods by 26.09%. These advancements establish the system as a reliable, scalable solution for high-precision localization in challenging indoor scenarios</description>

      <title>ORACLE-Grasp: Zero-Shot Task-Oriented Robotic Grasping using Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grasping unknown objects in unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring both semantic understanding and spatial reasoning. Existing methods often rely on dense training datasets or explicit geometric modeling, limiting their scalability to real-world tasks. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offer new possibilities for integrating vision and language understanding, but their application to autonomous robotic grasping remains largely unexplored. We present ORACLE-Grasp, a zero-shot framework that leverages LMMs as semantic oracles to guide grasp selection without requiring additional training or human input. The system formulates grasp prediction as a structured, iterative decision process, using dual-prompt tool calling to first extract high-level object context and then select task-relevant grasp regions. By discretizing the image space and reasoning over candidate areas, ORACLE-Grasp mitigates the spatial imprecision common in LMMs and produces human-like, task-driven grasp suggestions. Early stopping and depth-based refinement steps further enhance efficiency and physical grasp reliability. Experiments demonstrate that the predicted grasps achieve low positional and orientation errors relative to human-annotated ground truth and lead to high success rates in real-world pick up tasks. These results highlight the potential of combining language-driven reasoning with lightweight vision techniques to enable robust, autonomous grasping without task-specific datasets or retraining.</description>

      <title>HMR-ODTA: Online Diverse Task Allocation for a Team of Heterogeneous Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating time-sensitive deliveries in environments like hospitals poses a complex challenge, particularly when managing multiple online pickup and delivery requests within strict time windows using a team of heterogeneous robots. Traditional approaches fail to address dynamic rescheduling or diverse service requirements, typically restricting robots to single-task types. This paper tackles the Multi-Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (MPDPTW), where autonomous mobile robots are capable of handling varied service requests. The objective is to minimize late delivery penalties while maximizing task completion rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework leveraging a heterogeneous robot team and an efficient dynamic scheduling algorithm that supports dynamic task rescheduling. Users submit requests with specific time constraints, and our decentralized algorithm, Heterogeneous Mobile Robots Online Diverse Task Allocation (HMR-ODTA), optimizes task assignments to ensure timely service while addressing delays or task rejections. Extensive simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness. For smaller task sets (40-160 tasks), penalties were reduced by nearly 63%, while for larger sets (160-280 tasks), penalties decreased by approximately 50%. These results highlight the algorithm's effectiveness in improving task scheduling and coordination in multi-robot systems, offering a robust solution for enhancing delivery performance in structured, time-critical environments.</description>

      <title>Symbolically-Guided Visual Plan Inference from Uncurated Video Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual planning, by offering a sequence of intermediate visual subgoals to a goal-conditioned low-level policy, achieves promising performance on long-horizon manipulation tasks. To obtain the subgoals, existing methods typically resort to video generation models but suffer from model hallucination and computational cost. We present Vis2Plan, an efficient, explainable and white-box visual planning framework powered by symbolic guidance. From raw, unlabeled play data, Vis2Plan harnesses vision foundation models to automatically extract a compact set of task symbols, which allows building a high-level symbolic transition graph for multi-goal, multi-stage planning. At test time, given a desired task goal, our planner conducts planning at the symbolic level and assembles a sequence of physically consistent intermediate sub-goal images grounded by the underlying symbolic representation. Our Vis2Plan outperforms strong diffusion video generation-based visual planners by delivering 53\% higher aggregate success rate in real robot settings while generating visual plans 35$\times$ faster. The results indicate that Vis2Plan is able to generate physically consistent image goals while offering fully inspectable reasoning steps.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation using Reinforcement Learning Causal Curiosity: Limits and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal understanding is important in many disciplines of science and engineering, where we seek to understand how different factors in the system causally affect an experiment or situation and pave a pathway towards creating effective or optimising existing models. Examples of use cases are autonomous exploration and modelling of unknown environments or assessing key variables in optimising large complex systems. In this paper, we analyse a Reinforcement Learning approach called Causal Curiosity, which aims to estimate as accurately and efficiently as possible, without directly measuring them, the value of factors that causally determine the dynamics of a system. Whilst the idea presents a pathway forward, measurement accuracy is the foundation of methodology effectiveness. Focusing on the current causal curiosity's robotic manipulator, we present for the first time a measurement accuracy analysis of the future potentials and current limitations of this technique and an analysis of its sensitivity and confounding factor disentanglement capability - crucial for causal analysis. As a result of our work, we promote proposals for an improved and efficient design of Causal Curiosity methods to be applied to real-world complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>FOCI: Trajectory Optimization on Gaussian Splats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity as a faster alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis methods. Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

      <title>From Seeing to Doing: Bridging Reasoning and Decision for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical challenge, particularly for unseen scenarios and novel tasks. Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing), a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8 real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Multi-Task Policy Learning from NMPC for Quadruped Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadruped robots excel in traversing complex, unstructured environments where wheeled robots often fail. However, enabling efficient and adaptable locomotion remains challenging due to the quadrupeds' nonlinear dynamics, high degrees of freedom, and the computational demands of real-time control. Optimization-based controllers, such as Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), have shown strong performance, but their reliance on accurate state estimation and high computational overhead makes deployment in real-world settings challenging. In this work, we present a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework in which expert NMPC demonstrations are used to train a single neural network to predict actions for multiple locomotion behaviors directly from raw proprioceptive sensor inputs. We evaluate our approach extensively on the quadruped robot Go1, both in simulation and on real hardware, demonstrating that it accurately reproduces expert behavior, allows smooth gait switching, and simplifies the control pipeline for real-time deployment. Our MTL architecture enables learning diverse gaits within a unified policy, achieving high $R^{2}$ scores for predicted joint targets across all tasks.</description>

      <title>MC-Swarm: Minimal-Communication Multi-Agent Trajectory Planning and Deadlock Resolution for Quadrotor Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For effective multi-agent trajectory planning, it is important to consider lightweight communication and its potential asynchrony. This paper presents a distributed trajectory planning algorithm for a quadrotor swarm that operates asynchronously and requires no communication except during the initial planning phase. Moreover, our algorithm guarantees no deadlock under asynchronous updates and absence of communication during flight. To effectively ensure these points, we build two main modules: coordination state updater and trajectory optimizer. The coordination state updater computes waypoints for each agent toward its goal and performs subgoal optimization while considering deadlocks, as well as safety constraints with respect to neighbor agents and obstacles. Then, the trajectory optimizer generates a trajectory that ensures collision avoidance even with the asynchronous planning updates of neighboring agents. We provide a theoretical guarantee of collision avoidance with deadlock resolution and evaluate the effectiveness of our method in complex simulation environments, including random forests and narrow-gap mazes. Additionally, to reduce the total mission time, we design a faster coordination state update using lightweight communication. Lastly, our approach is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with cluttered environment scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beyond Predefined Actions: Integrating Behavior Trees and Dynamic Movement Primitives for Robot Learning from Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretable policy representations like Behavior Trees (BTs) and Dynamic Motion Primitives (DMPs) enable robot skill transfer from human demonstrations, but each faces limitations: BTs require expert-crafted low-level actions, while DMPs lack high-level task logic. We address these limitations by integrating DMP controllers into a BT framework, jointly learning the BT structure and DMP actions from single demonstrations, thereby removing the need for predefined actions. Additionally, by combining BT decision logic with DMP motion generation, our method enhances policy interpretability, modularity, and adaptability for autonomous systems. Our approach readily affords both learning to replicate low-level motions and combining partial demonstrations into a coherent and easy-to-modify overall policy.</description>

      <title>Augmented Reality for RObots (ARRO): Pointing Visuomotor Policies Towards Visual Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visuomotor policies trained on human expert demonstrations have recently shown strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel calibration-free visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene without requiring additional training. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on several tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo and OpenVLA. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

      <title>A Comparative Study of Human Activity Recognition: Motion, Tactile, and multi-modal Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is essential for effective Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), enabling robots to interpret and respond to human actions. This study evaluates the ability of a vision-based tactile sensor to classify 15 activities, comparing its performance to an IMU-based data glove. Additionally, we propose a multi-modal framework combining tactile and motion data to leverage their complementary strengths. We examined three approaches: motion-based classification (MBC) using IMU data, tactile-based classification (TBC) with single or dual video streams, and multi-modal classification (MMC) integrating both. Offline validation on segmented datasets assessed each configuration's accuracy under controlled conditions, while online validation on continuous action sequences tested online performance. Results showed the multi-modal approach consistently outperformed single-modality methods, highlighting the potential of integrating tactile and motion sensing to enhance HAR systems for collaborative robotics.</description>

      <title>A Social Robot with Inner Speech for Dietary Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the use of inner speech as a mechanism to enhance transparency and trust in social robots for dietary advice. In humans, inner speech structures thought processes and decision-making; in robotics, it improves explainability by making reasoning explicit. This is crucial in healthcare scenarios, where trust in robotic assistants depends on both accurate recommendations and human-like dialogue, which make interactions more natural and engaging. Building on this, we developed a social robot that provides dietary advice, and we provided the architecture with inner speech capabilities to validate user input, refine reasoning, and generate clear justifications. The system integrates large language models for natural language understanding and a knowledge graph for structured dietary information. By making decisions more transparent, our approach strengthens trust and improves human-robot interaction in healthcare. We validated this by measuring the computational efficiency of our architecture and conducting a small user study, which assessed the reliability of inner speech in explaining the robot's behavior.</description>

      <title>NavDP: Learning Sim-to-Real Navigation Diffusion Policy with Privileged Information Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning navigation in dynamic open-world environments is an important yet challenging skill for robots. Most previous methods rely on precise localization and mapping or learn from expensive real-world demonstrations. In this paper, we propose the Navigation Diffusion Policy (NavDP), an end-to-end framework trained solely in simulation and can zero-shot transfer to different embodiments in diverse real-world environments. The key ingredient of NavDP's network is the combination of diffusion-based trajectory generation and a critic function for trajectory selection, which are conditioned on only local observation tokens encoded from a shared policy transformer. Given the privileged information of the global environment in simulation, we scale up the demonstrations of good quality to train the diffusion policy and formulate the critic value function targets with contrastive negative samples. Our demonstration generation approach achieves about 2,500 trajectories/GPU per day, 20$\times$ more efficient than real-world data collection, and results in a large-scale navigation dataset with 363.2km trajectories across 1244 scenes. Trained with this simulation dataset, NavDP achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outstanding generalization capability on quadruped, wheeled, and humanoid robots in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. In addition, we present a preliminary attempt at using Gaussian Splatting to make in-domain real-to-sim fine-tuning to further bridge the sim-to-real gap. Experiments show that adding such real-to-sim data can improve the success rate by 30\% without hurting its generalization capability.</description>

      <title>UniSkill: Imitating Human Videos via Cross-Embodiment Skill Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mimicry is a fundamental learning mechanism in humans, enabling individuals to learn new tasks by observing and imitating experts. However, applying this ability to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent differences between human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance and physical capabilities. While previous methods bridge this gap using cross-embodiment datasets with shared scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned data between humans and robots at scale is not trivial. In this paper, we propose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns embodiment-agnostic skill representations from large-scale cross-embodiment video data without any labels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively transfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills successfully guide robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen video prompts.

      <title>Pose Estimation for Intra-cardiac Echocardiography Catheter via AI-Based Anatomical Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intra-cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) plays a crucial role in Electrophysiology (EP) and Structural Heart Disease (SHD) interventions by providing high-resolution, real-time imaging of cardiac structures. However, existing navigation methods rely on electromagnetic (EM) tracking, which is susceptible to interference and position drift, or require manual adjustments based on operator expertise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anatomy-aware pose estimation system that determines the ICE catheter position and orientation solely from ICE images, eliminating the need for external tracking sensors. Our approach leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based deep learning model, which captures spatial relationships between ICE images and anatomical structures. The model is trained on a clinically acquired dataset of 851 subjects, including ICE images paired with position and orientation labels normalized to the left atrium (LA) mesh. ICE images are patchified into 16x16 embeddings and processed through a transformer network, where a [CLS] token independently predicts position and orientation via separate linear layers. The model is optimized using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, balancing positional and orientational accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate an average positional error of 9.48 mm and orientation errors of (16.13 deg, 8.98 deg, 10.47 deg) across x, y, and z axes, confirming the model accuracy. Qualitative assessments further validate alignment between predicted and target views within 3D cardiac meshes. This AI-driven system enhances procedural efficiency, reduces operator workload, and enables real-time ICE catheter localization for tracking-free procedures. The proposed method can function independently or complement existing mapping systems like CARTO, offering a transformative approach to ICE-guided interventions.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Floor Separation Using Node Embeddings and Clustering of WiFi Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor positioning systems (IPSs) are increasingly vital for location-based services in complex multi-storey environments. This study proposes a novel graph-based approach for floor separation using Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, addressing the challenge of vertical localization in indoor settings. We construct a graph where nodes represent Wi-Fi fingerprints, and edges are weighted by signal similarity and contextual transitions. Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset, our method outperforms traditional community detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 68.97%, an F1- score of 61.99%, and an Adjusted Rand Index of 57.19%. By publicly releasing the preprocessed dataset and implementation code, this work contributes to advancing research in indoor positioning. The proposed approach demonstrates robustness to signal noise and architectural complexities, offering a scalable solution for floor-level localization.</description>

      <title>SLAG: Scalable Language-Augmented Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language-augmented scene representations hold great promise for large-scale robotics applications such as search-and-rescue, smart cities, and mining. Many of these scenarios are time-sensitive, requiring rapid scene encoding while also being data-intensive, necessitating scalable solutions. Deploying these representations on robots with limited computational resources further adds to the challenge. To address this, we introduce SLAG, a multi-GPU framework for language-augmented Gaussian splatting that enhances the speed and scalability of embedding large scenes. Our method integrates 2D visual-language model features into 3D scenes using SAM and CLIP. Unlike prior approaches, SLAG eliminates the need for a loss function to compute per-Gaussian language embeddings. Instead, it derives embeddings from 3D Gaussian scene parameters via a normalized weighted average, enabling highly parallelized scene encoding. Additionally, we introduce a vector database for efficient embedding storage and retrieval. Our experiments show that SLAG achieves an 18 times speedup in embedding computation on a 16-GPU setup compared to OpenGaussian, while preserving embedding quality on the ScanNet and LERF datasets.

      <title>A spherical amplitude-phase formulation for 3-D adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) guidance with USGES stability guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently proposed 3-D adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) path-following algorithm addressed coupled motion dynamics of marine craft, aircraft, and uncrewed vehicles under environmental disturbances such as wind, waves, and ocean currents. Stability analysis established uniform semiglobal exponential stability (USGES) of the cross- and vertical-track errors using a body-velocity-based amplitude-phase representation of the North-East-Down (NED) kinematic differential equations. In this brief paper, we revisit the ALOS framework and introduce a novel spherical amplitude-phase representation. This formulation yields a more geometrically intuitive and physically observable description of the guidance errors and enables a significantly simplified stability proof. Unlike the previous model, which relied on a vertical crab angle derived from body-frame velocities, the new representation uses an alternative vertical crab angle and retains the USGES property. It also removes restrictive assumptions such as constant altitude/depth or zero horizontal crab angle, and remains valid for general 3-D maneuvers with nonzero roll, pitch, and flight-path angles.</description>

      <title>Achieving Scalable Robot Autonomy via neurosymbolic planning using lightweight local LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PDDL-based symbolic task planning remains pivotal for robot autonomy yet struggles with dynamic human-robot collaboration due to scalability, re-planning demands, and delayed plan availability. Although a few neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and extended context for multi-domain support. Preliminary experiments in single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that the figure can be further scaled through additional data. Multi-domain tests on 16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a positive effect on learning efficiency. Although long-horizon planning and reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration. Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation pipeline.</description>

      <title>MESSI: A Multi-Elevation Semantic Segmentation Image Dataset of an Urban Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Elevation Semantic Segmentation Image (MESSI) dataset comprising 2525 images taken by a drone flying over dense urban environments. MESSI is unique in two main features. First, it contains images from various altitudes, allowing us to investigate the effect of depth on semantic segmentation. Second, it includes images taken from several different urban regions (at different altitudes). This is important since the variety covers the visual richness captured by a drone's 3D flight, performing horizontal and vertical maneuvers. MESSI contains images annotated with location, orientation, and the camera's intrinsic parameters and can be used to train a deep neural network for semantic segmentation or other applications of interest (e.g., localization, navigation, and tracking). This paper describes the dataset and provides annotation details. It also explains how semantic segmentation was performed using several neural network models and shows several relevant statistics. MESSI will be published in the public domain to serve as an evaluation benchmark for semantic segmentation using images captured by a drone or similar vehicle flying over a dense urban environment.</description>

      <title>Cost Function Estimation Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Minimal Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an iterative inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to infer optimal cost functions in continuous spaces. Based on a popular maximum entropy criteria, our approach iteratively finds a weight improvement step and proposes a method to find an appropriate step size that ensures learned cost function features remain similar to the demonstrated trajectory features. In contrast to similar approaches, our algorithm can individually tune the effectiveness of each observation for the partition function and does not need a large sample set, enabling faster learning. We generate sample trajectories by solving an optimal control problem instead of random sampling, leading to more informative trajectories. The performance of our method is compared to two state of the art algorithms to demonstrate its benefits in several simulated environments.</description>

      <title>DLO-Splatting: Tracking Deformable Linear Objects Using 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents DLO-Splatting, an algorithm for estimating the 3D shape of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) from multi-view RGB images and gripper state information through prediction-update filtering. The DLO-Splatting algorithm uses a position-based dynamics model with shape smoothness and rigidity dampening corrections to predict the object shape. Optimization with a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based rendering loss iteratively renders and refines the prediction to align it with the visual observations in the update step. Initial experiments demonstrate promising results in a knot tying scenario, which is challenging for existing vision-only methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trajectory Planning with Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Vehicle Maneuvering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To perform autonomous driving maneuvers, such as parallel or perpendicular parking, a vehicle requires continual speed and steering adjustments to follow a generated path. In consequence, the path's quality is a limiting factor of the vehicle maneuver's performance. While most path planning approaches include finding a collision-free route, optimal trajectory planning involves solving the best transition from initial to final states, minimizing the action over all paths permitted by a kinematic model. Here we propose a novel method based on sequential convex optimization, which permits flexible and efficient optimal trajectory generation. The objective is to achieve the fastest time, shortest distance, and fewest number of path segments to satisfy motion requirements, while avoiding sensor blind-spots. In our approach, vehicle kinematics are represented by a discretized Dubins model. To avoid collisions, each waypoint is constrained by linear inequalities representing closest distance of obstacles to a polygon specifying the vehicle's extent. To promote smooth and valid trajectories, the solved kinematic state and control variables are constrained and regularized by penalty terms in the model's cost function, which enforces physical restrictions including limits for steering angle, acceleration and speed. In this paper, we analyze trajectories obtained for several parking scenarios. Results demonstrate efficient and collision-free motion generated by the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>iA$^*$: Imperative Learning-based A$^*$ Search for Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pathfinding problem, which aims to identify a collision-free path between two points, is crucial for many applications, such as robot navigation and autonomous driving. Classic methods, such as A$^*$ search, perform well on small-scale maps but face difficulties scaling up. Conversely, data-driven approaches can improve pathfinding efficiency but require extensive data labeling and lack theoretical guarantees, making it challenging for practical applications. To combine the strengths of the two methods, we utilize the imperative learning (IL) strategy and propose a novel self-supervised pathfinding framework, termed imperative learning-based A$^*$ (iA$^*$). Specifically, iA$^*$ is a bilevel optimization process where the lower-level optimization is dedicated to finding the optimal path by a differentiable A$^*$ search module, and the upper-level optimization narrows down the search space to improve efficiency via setting suitable initial values from a data-driven model. Besides, the model within the upper-level optimization is a fully convolutional network, trained by the calculated loss in the lower-level optimization. Thus, the framework avoids extensive data labeling and can be applied in diverse environments. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that iA$^*$ surpasses both classical and data-driven methods in pathfinding efficiency and shows superior robustness among different tasks, validated with public datasets and simulation environments.</description>

      <title>PRIMER: Perception-Aware Robust Learning-based Multiagent Trajectory Planner</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decentralized multiagent trajectory planners, agents need to communicate and exchange their positions to generate collision-free trajectories. However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Embodying Control in Soft Multistable Robots from Morphofunctional Co-design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft robots are distinguished by their flexibility and adaptability, allowing them to perform nearly impossible tasks for rigid robots. However, controlling their behavior is challenging due to their nonlinear material response and infinite degrees of freedom. A potential solution to these challenges is to discretize the infinite-dimensional configuration space into a finite but sufficiently large number of functional modes with programmed dynamics. We present a strategy for co-designing the desired tasks and morphology of pneumatically actuated soft robots with multiple encoded stable states and dynamic responses. Our approach introduces a general method to capture the soft robots' response using an energy-based analytical model, the parameters of which are obtained using Recursive Feature Elimination. The resulting lumped-parameter model facilitates inverse co-design of the robot's morphology and planned tasks by embodying specific dynamics upon actuation. We illustrate our approach's ability to explore the configuration space by co-designing kinematics with optimized stiffnesses and time responses to obtain robots capable of classifying the size and weight of objects and displaying adaptable locomotion with minimal feedback control. This strategy offers a framework for simplifying the control of soft robots by exploiting the nonlinear mechanics of multistable structures and embodying mechanical intelligence into soft material systems</description>

      <title>TinyVLA: Towards Fast, Data-Efficient Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12514v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable potential in visuomotor control and instruction comprehension through end-to-end learning processes. However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning. Our project is at https://tiny-vla.github.io.</description>

      <title>ERPoT: Effective and Reliable Pose Tracking for Mobile Robots Using Lightweight Polygon Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an effective and reliable pose tracking solution, termed ERPoT, for mobile robots operating in large-scale outdoor and challenging indoor environments, underpinned by an innovative prior polygon map. Especially, to overcome the challenge that arises as the map size grows with the expansion of the environment, the novel form of a prior map composed of multiple polygons is proposed. Benefiting from the use of polygons to concisely and accurately depict environmental occupancy, the prior polygon map achieves long-term reliable pose tracking while ensuring a compact form. More importantly, pose tracking is carried out under pure LiDAR mode, and the dense 3D point cloud is transformed into a sparse 2D scan through ground removal and obstacle selection. On this basis, a novel cost function for pose estimation through point-polygon matching is introduced, encompassing two distinct constraint forms: point-to-vertex and point-to-edge. In this study, our primary focus lies on two crucial aspects: lightweight and compact prior map construction, as well as effective and reliable robot pose tracking. Both aspects serve as the foundational pillars for future navigation across diverse mobile platforms equipped with different LiDAR sensors in varied environments. Comparative experiments based on the publicly available datasets and our self-recorded datasets are conducted, and evaluation results show the superior performance of ERPoT on reliability, prior map size, pose estimation error, and runtime over the other six approaches.

      <description>arXiv:2409.17116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of developing a multi-arm quadrupedal robot capable of efficiently harvesting fruit in complex, natural environments. To overcome the inherent limitations of traditional bimanual manipulation, we introduce the first three-arm quadrupedal robot LocoHarv-3 and propose a novel hierarchical tri-manual planning approach, enabling automated fruit harvesting with collision-free trajectories. Our comprehensive semi-autonomous framework integrates teleoperation, supported by LiDAR-based odometry and mapping, with learning-based visual perception for accurate fruit detection and pose estimation. Validation is conducted through a series of controlled indoor experiments using motion capture and extensive field tests in natural settings. Results demonstrate a 90\% success rate in in-lab settings with a single attempt, and field trials further verify the system's robustness and efficiency in more challenging real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Learning with Less: Optimizing Tactile Sensor Configurations for Dexterous Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is critical for learning-based robotic dexterous manipulation, enabling real-time force perception, slip detection, and grip adjustments during interactions. While full-hand sensor arrays provide precise control, their deployment is limited by high costs, complex integration, and significant computational demands. Practical constraints, including limited space and the complexity of the wiring, further restrict the use of the entire sensor. Consequently, optimizing sensor configurations to achieve efficient coverage and good performance using fewer sensors remains a significant and open research challenge.In this work, we investigate the influence of tactile sensor quantity and placement on a robotic hand for dexterous manipulation tasks. Through systematic analysis of various sensor configurations, an optimized layout with only 21 sensors is identified, achieving over 93% of the task success rate relative to full-hand coverage (92 sensors). This configuration reduces the sensor count by 77% and offers a considerable reduction in integration costs, demonstrating a cost-effective yet high-performing tactile sensing strategy. Additionally, we develop a multi-factor regression model to predict task success rate under arbitrary sensor configurations. The model achieves strong generalization, with an average prediction error of 3.12% on unseen manipulation tasks. These results offer a scalable framework for deploying tactile sensing in real-world robotic manipulation systems.</description>

      <title>Consensus Building in Human-robot Co-learning via Bias Controlled Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics and Non-verbal Communication through Robotic Eyes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consensus between humans and robots is crucial as robotic agents become more prevalent and deeply integrated into our daily lives. This integration presents both unprecedented opportunities and notable challenges for effective collaboration. However, the active guidance of human actions and their integration in co-learning processes, where humans and robots mutually learn from each other, remains under-explored. This article demonstrates how consensus between human and robot opinions can be established by modeling decision-making processes as non-linear opinion dynamics. We utilize dynamic bias as a control parameter to steer the robot's opinion toward consensus and employ visual cues via a robotic eye gaze to guide human decisions. These non-verbal cues communicate the robot's future intentions, gradually guiding human decisions to align with them. To design robot behavior for consensus, we integrate a human opinion observation algorithm with the robot's opinion formation, controlling its actions based on that formed opinion. Experiments with $51$ participants ($N=51$) in a two-choice decision-making task show that effective consensus and trust can be established in a human--robot co-learning setting by guiding human decisions through nonverbal robotic cues and using bias-controlled opinion dynamics to shape robot behavior. Finally, we provide detailed information on the perceived cognitive load and the behavior of robotic eyes based on user feedback and post-experiment interviews.</description>

      <title>EMPERROR: A Flexible Generative Perception Error Model for Probing Self-Driving Planners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To handle the complexities of real-world traffic, learning planners for self-driving from data is a promising direction. While recent approaches have shown great progress, they typically assume a setting in which the ground-truth world state is available as input. However, when deployed, planning needs to be robust to the long-tail of errors incurred by a noisy perception system, which is often neglected in evaluation. To address this, previous work has proposed drawing adversarial samples from a perception error model (PEM) mimicking the noise characteristics of a target object detector. However, these methods use simple PEMs that fail to accurately capture all failure modes of detection. In this paper, we present EMPERROR, a novel transformer-based generative PEM, apply it to stress-test an imitation learning (IL)-based planner and show that it imitates modern detectors more faithfully than previous work. Furthermore, it is able to produce realistic noisy inputs that increase the planner's collision rate by up to 85%, demonstrating its utility as a valuable tool for a more complete evaluation of self-driving planners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present DiffusionVLA, a novel framework that seamlessly combines the autoregression model with the diffusion model for learning visuomotor policy. Central to our approach is a next-token prediction objective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in the context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is attached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through self-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates reasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole framework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the effectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting task, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not seen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model interpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and identify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test DiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\% accuracy on 102 previously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual changes, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new embodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain conversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at inference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can train from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally, we scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved generalization capabilities with increased model size.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scene Coordinate Regression with Efficient Keypoint Detection and Sequential Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) is a visual localization technique that utilizes deep neural networks (DNN) to directly regress 2D-3D correspondences for camera pose estimation. However, current SCR methods often face challenges in handling repetitive textures and meaningless areas due to their reliance on implicit triangulation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate SCR system. Compared to existing SCR methods, we propose a unified architecture for both scene encoding and salient keypoint detection, allowing our system to prioritize the encoding of informative regions. This design significantly improves computational efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a mechanism that utilizes sequential information during both mapping and relocalization. The proposed method enhances the implicit triangulation, especially in environments with repetitive textures. Comprehensive experiments conducted across indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SCR methods. Our single-frame relocalization mode improves the recall rate of our baseline by 6.4% and increases the running speed from 56Hz to 90Hz. Furthermore, our sequence-based mode increases the recall rate by 11% while maintaining the original efficiency.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Importance Sampling through Latent Space Exploration in Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Importance sampling is a rare event simulation technique used in Monte Carlo simulations to bias the sampling distribution towards the rare event of interest. By assigning appropriate weights to sampled points, importance sampling allows for more efficient estimation of rare events or tails of distributions. However, importance sampling can fail when the proposal distribution does not effectively cover the target distribution. In this work, we propose a method for more efficient sampling by updating the proposal distribution in the latent space of a normalizing flow. Normalizing flows learn an invertible mapping from a target distribution to a simpler latent distribution. The latent space can be more easily explored during the search for a proposal distribution, and samples from the proposal distribution are recovered in the space of the target distribution via the invertible mapping. We empirically validate our methodology on simulated robotics applications such as autonomous racing and aircraft ground collision avoidance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The UAV-VLA (Visual-Language-Action) system is a tool designed to facilitate communication with aerial robots. By integrating satellite imagery processing with the Visual Language Model (VLM) and the powerful capabilities of GPT, UAV-VLA enables users to generate general flight paths-and-action plans through simple text requests. This system leverages the rich contextual information provided by satellite images, allowing for enhanced decision-making and mission planning. The combination of visual analysis by VLM and natural language processing by GPT can provide the user with the path-and-action set, making aerial operations more efficient and accessible. The newly developed method showed the difference in the length of the created trajectory in 22% and the mean error in finding the objects of interest on a map in 34.22 m by Euclidean distance in the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Latent Redundancy in Behavior Cloning: An Information Bottleneck Approach for Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02853v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a widely adopted visual imitation learning method in robot manipulation. Current BC approaches often enhance generalization by leveraging large datasets and incorporating additional visual and textual modalities to capture more diverse information. However, these methods overlook whether the learned representations contain redundant information and lack a solid theoretical foundation to guide the learning process. To address these limitations, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and introduce mutual information to quantify and mitigate redundancy in latent representations. Building on this, we incorporate the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle into BC, which extends the idea of reducing redundancy by providing a structured framework for compressing irrelevant information while preserving task-relevant features. This work presents the first comprehensive study on redundancy in latent representations across various methods, backbones, and experimental settings, while extending the generalizability of the IB to BC. Extensive experiments and analyses on the CortexBench and LIBERO benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements with IB, underscoring the importance of reducing input data redundancy and highlighting its practical value for more practical applications.

      <title>DexVLA: Vision-Language Model with Plug-In Diffusion Expert for General Robot Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enabling robots to perform diverse tasks across varied environments is a central challenge in robot learning. While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.</description>

Abstract: Technologies such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Computer Vision (CV) can be applied to crime scene analysis (CSA) to help protect lives, facilitate justice, and deter crime, but an overview of the tasks that can be automated has been lacking. Here we follow a speculative prototyping approach: First, the STAIR tool is used to rapidly review the literature and identify tasks that seem to have not received much attention, like accessing crime scenes through a window, mapping/gathering evidence, and analyzing blood smears. Secondly, we present a prototype of a small drone that implements these three tasks with 75%, 85%, and 80% performance, to perform a minimal analysis of an indoor crime scene. Lessons learned are reported, toward guiding next work.</description>

      <title>UAV-VLRR: Vision-Language Informed NMPC for Rapid Response in UAV Search and Rescue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergency search and rescue (SAR) operations often require rapid and precise target identification in complex environments where traditional manual drone control is inefficient. In order to address these scenarios, a rapid SAR system, UAV-VLRR (Vision-Language-Rapid-Response), is developed in this research. This system consists of two aspects: 1) A multimodal system which harnesses the power of Visual Language Model (VLM) and the natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT-4o (LLM) for scene interpretation. 2) A non-linearmodel predictive control (NMPC) with built-in obstacle avoidance for rapid response by a drone to fly according to the output of the multimodal system. This work aims at improving response times in emergency SAR operations by providing a more intuitive and natural approach to the operator to plan the SAR mission while allowing the drone to carry out that mission in a rapid and safe manner. When tested, our approach was faster on an average by 33.75% when compared with an off-the-shelf autopilot and 54.6% when compared with a human pilot.

      <title>Follow Everything: A Leader-Following and Obstacle Avoidance Framework with Goal-Aware Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust and flexible leader-following is a critical capability for robots to integrate into human society. While existing methods struggle to generalize to leaders of arbitrary form and often fail when the leader temporarily leaves the robot's field of view, this work introduces a unified framework addressing both challenges. First, traditional detection models are replaced with a segmentation model, allowing the leader to be anything. To enhance recognition robustness, a distance frame buffer is implemented that stores leader embeddings at multiple distances, accounting for the unique characteristics of leader-following tasks. Second, a goal-aware adaptation mechanism is designed to govern robot planning states based on the leader's visibility and motion, complemented by a graph-based planner that generates candidate trajectories for each state, ensuring efficient following with obstacle avoidance. Simulations and real-world experiments with a legged robot follower and various leaders (human, ground robot, UAV, legged robot, stop sign) in both indoor and outdoor environments show competitive improvements in follow success rate, reduced visual loss duration, lower collision rate, and decreased leader-follower distance.</description>

      <title>Aerial Path Online Planning for Urban Scene Updation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first scene-update aerial path planning algorithm specifically designed for detecting and updating change areas in urban environments. While existing methods for large-scale 3D urban scene reconstruction focus on achieving high accuracy and completeness, they are inefficient for scenarios requiring periodic updates, as they often re-explore and reconstruct entire scenes, wasting significant time and resources on unchanged areas. To address this limitation, our method leverages prior reconstructions and change probability statistics to guide UAVs in detecting and focusing on areas likely to have changed. Our approach introduces a novel changeability heuristic to evaluate the likelihood of changes, driving the planning of two flight paths: a prior path informed by static priors and a dynamic real-time path that adapts to newly detected changes. The framework integrates surface sampling and candidate view generation strategies, ensuring efficient coverage of change areas with minimal redundancy. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our method significantly reduces flight time and computational overhead, while maintaining high-quality updates comparable to full-scene re-exploration and reconstruction. These contributions pave the way for efficient, scalable, and adaptive UAV-based scene updates in complex urban environments.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Robotic Leaf Manipulation: A Hybrid Geometric-Neural Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automating leaf manipulation in agricultural settings faces significant challenges, including the variability of plant morphologies and deformable leaves. We propose a novel hybrid geometric-neural approach for autonomous leaf grasping that combines traditional computer vision with neural networks through self-supervised learning. Our method integrates YOLOv8 for instance segmentation and RAFT-Stereo for 3D depth estimation to build rich leaf representations, which feed into both a geometric feature scoring pipeline and a neural refinement module (GraspPointCNN). The key innovation is our confidence-weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically balances the contribution of each approach based on prediction certainty. Our self-supervised framework uses the geometric pipeline as an expert teacher to automatically generate training data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves an 88.0% success rate in controlled environments and 84.7% in real greenhouse conditions, significantly outperforming both purely geometric (75.3%) and neural (60.2%) methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for agricultural robotics where domain expertise is seamlessly integrated with machine learning capabilities, providing a foundation for fully automated crop monitoring systems.</description>

Abstract: How can we teach humanoids to climb staircases and sit on chairs using the surrounding environment context? Arguably, the simplest way is to just show them-casually capture a human motion video and feed it to humanoids. We introduce VIDEOMIMIC, a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that mines everyday videos, jointly reconstructs the humans and the environment, and produces whole-body control policies for humanoid robots that perform the corresponding skills. We demonstrate the results of our pipeline on real humanoid robots, showing robust, repeatable contextual control such as staircase ascents and descents, sitting and standing from chairs and benches, as well as other dynamic whole-body skills-all from a single policy, conditioned on the environment and global root commands. VIDEOMIMIC offers a scalable path towards teaching humanoids to operate in diverse real-world environments.</description>

      <title>CHD: Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion for Long-Horizon Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown strong performance in short-horizon tasks but often fail in complex, long-horizon settings. We trace the failure to loose coupling between high-level (HL) sub-goal selection and low-level (LL) trajectory generation, which leads to incoherent plans and degraded performance. We propose Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD), a framework that models HL sub-goals and LL trajectories jointly within a unified diffusion process. A shared classifier passes LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals self-correct while sampling proceeds. This tight HL-LL coupling improves trajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon diffusion planning. Experiments across maze navigation, tabletop manipulation, and household environments show that CHD consistently outperforms both flat and hierarchical diffusion baselines.

      <description>arXiv:2307.05033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras respond to changes in log-brightness at the millisecond level, making them ideal for optical flow estimation. However, existing datasets from event cameras provide only low frame rate ground truth for optical flow, limiting the research potential of event-driven optical flow. To address this challenge, we introduce a low-latency event representation, Unified Voxel Grid, and propose EVA-Flow, an EVent-based Anytime Flow estimation network to produce high-frame-rate event optical flow with only low-frame-rate optical flow ground truth for supervision. Furthermore, we propose the Rectified Flow Warp Loss (RFWL) for the unsupervised assessment of intermediate optical flow. A comprehensive variety of experiments on MVSEC, DESC, and our EVA-FlowSet demonstrates that EVA-Flow achieves competitive performance, super-low-latency (5ms), time-dense motion estimation (200Hz), and strong generalization. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Yaozhuwa/EVA-Flow.</description>

      <title>Unravelling Responsibility for AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely acknowledged that we need to establish where responsibility lies for the outputs and impacts of AI-enabled systems. This is important to achieve justice and compensation for victims of AI harms, and to inform policy and engineering practice. But without a clear, thorough understanding of what `responsibility' means, deliberations about where responsibility lies will be, at best, unfocused and incomplete and, at worst, misguided. Furthermore, AI-enabled systems exist within a wider ecosystem of actors, decisions, and governance structures, giving rise to complex networks of responsibility relations. To address these issues, this paper presents a conceptual framework of responsibility, accompanied with a graphical notation and general methodology, for visualising these responsibility networks and for tracing different responsibility attributions for AI. Taking the three-part formulation 'Actor A is responsible for Occurrence O,' the framework unravels the concept of responsibility to clarify that there are different possibilities of who is responsible for AI, senses in which they are responsible, and aspects of events they are responsible for. The notation allows these permutations to be represented graphically. The methodology enables users to apply the framework to specific scenarios. The aim is to offer a foundation to support stakeholders from diverse disciplinary backgrounds to discuss and address complex responsibility questions in hypothesised and real-world cases involving AI. The work is illustrated by application to a fictitious scenario of a fatal collision between a crewless, AI-enabled maritime vessel in autonomous mode and a traditional, crewed vessel at sea.</description>

      <title>Optimization-free Smooth Control Barrier Function for Polygonal Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polygonal collision avoidance (PCA) is short for the problem of collision avoidance between two polygons (i.e., polytopes in planar) that own their dynamic equations. This problem suffers the inherent difficulty in dealing with non-smooth boundaries and recently optimization-defined metrics, such as signed distance field (SDF) and its variants, have been proposed as control barrier functions (CBFs) to tackle PCA problems. In contrast, we propose an optimization-free smooth CBF method in this paper, which is computationally efficient and proved to be nonconservative. It is achieved by three main steps: a lower bound of SDF is expressed as a nested Boolean logic composition first, then its smooth approximation is established by applying the latest log-sum-exp method, after which a specified CBF-based safety filter is proposed to address this class of problems. To illustrate its wide applications, the optimization-free smooth CBF method is extended to solve distributed collision avoidance of two underactuated nonholonomic vehicles and drive an underactuated container crane to avoid a moving obstacle respectively, for which numerical simulations are also performed.</description>

      <title>Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful tool for high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic scenes. However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application in robotics. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MBGS), a novel framework that uses motion graphs as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of a graph's links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions that determine the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MBGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the highly challenging iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF. We demonstrate the application potential of our method in animating novel object poses, synthesizing real robot demonstrations, and predicting robot actions through visual planning.

      <title>Web2Grasp: Learning Functional Grasps from Web Images of Hand-Object Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional grasp is essential for enabling dexterous multi-finger robot hands to manipulate objects effectively. However, most prior work either focuses on power grasping, which simply involves holding an object still, or relies on costly teleoperated robot demonstrations to teach robots how to grasp each object functionally. Instead, we propose extracting human grasp information from web images since they depict natural and functional object interactions, thereby bypassing the need for curated demonstrations. We reconstruct human hand-object interaction (HOI) 3D meshes from RGB images, retarget the human hand to multi-finger robot hands, and align the noisy object mesh with its accurate 3D shape. We show that these relatively low-quality HOI data from inexpensive web sources can effectively train a functional grasping model. To further expand the grasp dataset for seen and unseen objects, we use the initially-trained grasping policy with web data in the IsaacGym simulator to generate physically feasible grasps while preserving functionality. We train the grasping model on 10 object categories and evaluate it on 9 unseen objects, including challenging items such as syringes, pens, spray bottles, and tongs, which are underrepresented in existing datasets. The model trained on the web HOI dataset, achieving a 75.8% success rate on seen objects and 61.8% across all objects in simulation, with a 6.7% improvement in success rate and a 1.8x increase in functionality ratings over baselines. Simulator-augmented data further boosts performance from 61.8% to 83.4%. The sim-to-real transfer to the LEAP Hand achieves a 85% success rate.
