      <title>Dissecting intervalley coupling mechanisms in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer (1L) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a unique opportunity to control the valley degree of freedom of optically excited charge carriers due to the spin-valley locking effect. Despite extensive studies of the valley-contrasting physics, stimulated by perspective valleytronic applications, a unified picture of competing intervalley coupling processes in 1L-TMDs is lacking. Here, we apply broadband helicity-resolved transient absorption to explore exciton valley polarization dynamics in 1L-WSe${}_2$. By combining experimental results with microscopic simulations, we dissect individual intervalley coupling mechanisms and reveal the crucial role of phonon-assisted scattering in the fast decay of the A exciton circular dichroism and the formation of the dichroism of opposite polarity for the B exciton. We further provide a consistent description of the valley depolarization driven by the combined action of Coulomb scattering processes and indicate the presence of efficient single spin-flip mechanisms. Our study brings us closer to a complete understanding of exciton dynamics in TMDs.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Floquet topological phases in the SSH lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological materials, known for their edge states robust against local perturbations, hold promise for next-generation quantum technologies, but remain scarce in nature and challenging to realize in static systems. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain is a one-dimensional system for topological phases, although its static control is limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose to use high-frequency monochromatic driving and modulated amplitude pulses to dynamically induce and switch the Floquet topological phases. Using a Kramers-Henneberger-like transformation, we encode all Floquet sidebands into a single effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that both monochromatic and experimental pulse protocols (Gaussian and fast-beating envelopes) can induce topological edge states, enabling dynamic phase switching. Notably, fast-beating modulations require significantly lower field strengths than monochromatic ones, especially with larger inter-dimer separations. Our findings offer an experimentally feasible route for Floquet engineering, paving the way for ultrafast and energy efficient control of topological phases in quantum platforms, opening up new possibilities in the field of dynamic quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum gates for exchange-only qubits using simultaneous exchange pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The benefit of exchange-only qubits compared to other spin qubit types is the universal control using only voltage controlled exchange interactions between neighboring spins. As a compromise, qubit operations have to be constructed from non-orthogonal rotation axes of the Bloch sphere and result in rather long pulsing sequences. This paper aims to develop a faster implementation of single-qubit gates using simultaneous exchange pulses and manifests their potential for the construction of two-qubit gates. We introduce pulse sequences in which single-qubit gates could be executed faster and show that subsequences on three spins in two-qubit gates could be implemented in fewer steps. Our findings can particularly speed up gate sequences for realistic idle times between sequential pulses and we show that this advantage increases with more interconnectivity of the quantum dots. We further demonstrate how a phase operation can introduce a relative phase between the computational and some of the leakage states, which can be advantageous for the construction of two-qubit gates. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize a simultaneous exchange implementation of $X$ rotations in a SiGe quantum dot device and compare to the state of the art with sequential exchange pulses.</description>

      <title>Large-scale stochastic simulation of open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the precise interaction mechanisms between quantum systems and their environment is crucial for advancing stable quantum technologies, designing reliable experimental frameworks, and building accurate models of real-world phenomena. However, simulating open quantum systems, which feature complex non-unitary dynamics, poses significant computational challenges that require innovative methods to overcome. In this work, we introduce the tensor jump method (TJM), a scalable, embarrassingly parallel algorithm for stochastically simulating large-scale open quantum systems, specifically Markovian dynamics captured by Lindbladians. This method is built on three core principles where, in particular, we extend the Monte Carlo wave function (MCWF) method to matrix product states, use a dynamic time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) to significantly reduce errors during time evolution, and introduce what we call a sampling MPS to drastically reduce the dependence on the simulation's time step size. We demonstrate that this method scales more effectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian solution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and numerically. Finally, we provide evidence of its utility by simulating Lindbladian dynamics of XXX Heisenberg models up to a thousand spins using a consumer-grade CPU. This work represents a significant step forward in the simulation of large-scale open quantum systems, with the potential to enable discoveries across various domains of quantum physics, particularly those where the environment plays a fundamental role, and to both dequantize and facilitate the development of more stable quantum hardware.</description>
