      <title>Invariants and equidecomposability in rings of polygons with sides of given directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate equidecomposability in the ring of polygons with sides restricted to given directions and using only translations. Extending classical results of Dehn and Hadwiger, we prove that equidecomposability in these rings is equivalent to the equality of some invariants. We also consider the algebraic structure of direction sets. We show that under mild conditions, equidecomposability with respect to a set $S$ of slopes of the given directions is equivalent to equidecomposability with respect to the field generated by $S$. We also provide a complete description of all invariants of these polygon rings.</description>

      <title>Illumination number of 3-dimensional cap bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress on the Illumination conjecture, it remains open in general, as well as for specific classes of bodies. Bezdek, Ivanov, and Strachan showed that the conjecture holds for symmetric cap bodies in sufficiently high dimensions. Further, Ivanov and Strachan calculated the illumination number for the class of 3-dimensional centrally symmetric cap bodies to be 6.
  In this paper, we show that even the broader class of all 3-dimensional cap bodies has the same illumination number 6, in particular, the illumination conjecture holds for this class. The illuminating directions can be taken to be vertices of a regular tetrahedron, together with two special directions depending on the body. The proof is based on probabilistic arguments and integer linear programming.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic spaces not quasi-isometric to curve complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a condition that prevents a hyperbolic space from being quasi-isometric to the curve complex of any non-sporadic surface. Our result applies to several hyperbolic complexes, including arc complexes, disk complexes, non-separating curve complexes, (hyperbolic) pants complexes, and to free splitting complexes of free groups.</description>

      <title>Energy inequalities for cutoff functions of $p$-energies on metric measures spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, and for a $p$-energy on a metric measure space, we establish equivalent conditions for the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality. In particular, we employ a technique of Trudinger and Wang [Amer. J. Math. 124 (2002), no. 2, 369--410] to derive a Wolff potential estimate for superharmonic functions, and a method of Holopainen [Contemp. Math. 338 (2003), 219--239] to prove the elliptic Harnack inequality for harmonic functions. As applications, we make progress toward the capacity conjecture of Grigor'yan, Hu, and Lau [Springer Proc. Math. Stat. 88 (2014), 147--207], and we prove that the $p$-energy measure is singular with respect to the Hausdorff measure on the Sierpi\'nski carpet for all $p&gt;1$, resolving a problem posed by Murugan and Shimizu [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., to appear].</description>

      <title>Carath\'eodory distance-preserving maps between bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rigidity of maps between bounded symmetric domains that preserve the Carath\'eodory/Kobayashi distance. We show that such maps are only possible when the rank of the co-domain is at least as great as that of the domain. When the ranks are equal, and the domain is irreducible, we prove that the map is either holomorphic or antiholomorphic. In the holomorphic case, we show that the map is in fact a triple homomorphism, under the additional assumption that the origin is mapped to the origin. We exploit the large-scale geometry of the Carath\'eodory distance and use the horocompactification and Gromov product to obtain these results without requiring any smoothness assumptions on the maps.</description>

      <title>A link condition for simplicial complexes, and CUB spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We motivate the study of metric spaces with a unique convex geodesic bicombing, which we call CUB spaces. These encompass many classical notions of nonpositive curvature, such as CAT(0) spaces and Busemann-convex spaces. Groups having a geometric action on a CUB space enjoy numerous properties.
  We want to know when a simplicial complex, endowed with a natural polyhedral metric, is CUB. We establish a link condition, stating essentially that the complex is locally a lattice. This generalizes Gromov's link condition for cube complexes, for the $\ell^\infty$ metric.
  The link condition applies to numerous examples, including Euclidean buildings, simplices of groups, Artin complexes of Euclidean Artin groups, (weak) Garside groups, some arcs and curve complexes, and minimal spanning surfaces of knots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08980v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similarity matrices are fundamentals of the theory of magnitude. We show that finite metric spaces can be identified by the characteristic polynomials of the similartity matrices of $tX$ $(t&gt;0)$, where $tX$ is a homothetical expansion of $X$ by a factor $t$, if we restrict ourselves to a certain open dense subset of the set of finite metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Sobolev and quasiconformal distortion of intermediate dimension with applications to conformal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distortion of intermediate dimension under supercritical Sobolev mappings and also under quasiconformal or quasisymmetric homeomorphisms. In particular, we extend to the setting of intermediate dimensions both the Gehring--V\"ais\"al\"a theorem on dilatation-dependent quasiconformal distortion of dimension and Kovalev's theorem on the nonexistence of metric spaces with conformal dimension strictly between zero and one. Applications include new contributions to the quasiconformal classification of Euclidean sets and a new sufficient condition for the vanishing of conformal box-counting dimension. We illustrate our conclusions with specific consequences for Bedford--McMullen carpets, samples of Mandelbrot percolation, and product sets containing a polynomially convergent sequence factor.</description>

      <title>Locally elliptic actions, torsion groups, and nonpositively curved spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending and unifying a number of well-known conjectures and open questions, we conjecture that locally elliptic (that is, every element has a bounded orbit) actions by automorphisms of finitely generated groups on finite dimensional nonpositively curved complexes have global fixed points. In particular, finitely generated torsion groups cannot act without fixed points on such spaces. We prove these conjectures for a wide class of complexes, including all infinite families of Euclidean buildings, Helly complexes, some graphical small cancellation and systolic complexes, uniformly locally finite Gromov hyperbolic graphs. We present consequences of these result, e.g. concerning the automatic continuity.
  Our main tool are Helly graphs. On the way we prove several results concerning their automorphisms. We present and study a new notion of geodesic clique paths. Their local-to-global properties are crucial in our proof of ellipticity results.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fr\'echet Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet mean is a key measure of central tendency as a barycenter for a given set of points in a general metric space. It is computed by solving an optimization problem and is a fundamental quantity in statistics. In this paper, we study Fr\'echet means in tropical geometry -- a piecewise linear, combinatorial, and polyhedral variant of algebraic geometry that has gained prominence in applications. A key property of Fr\'echet means is that uniqueness is generally not guaranteed, which is true in tropical settings. In solving the tropical Fr\'echet mean optimization problem, we obtain a geometric characterization of the collection of all Fr\'echet means in a general tropical space as a tropically and classically convex polytope. Furthermore, we prove that a certificate of positivity for finitely many quadratic polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ always exists, given that their quadratic homogeneous components are sums of squares. We propose an algorithm to symbolically compute the Fr\'echet mean polytope based on our exact quadratic optimization result and study its complexity.</description>
