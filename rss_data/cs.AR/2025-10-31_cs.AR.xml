      <title>CHIPSIM: A Co-Simulation Framework for Deep Learning on Chiplet-Based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to reduced manufacturing yields, traditional monolithic chips cannot keep up with the compute, memory, and communication demands of data-intensive applications, such as rapidly growing deep neural network (DNN) models. Chiplet-based architectures offer a cost-effective and scalable solution by integrating smaller chiplets via a network-on-interposer (NoI). Fast and accurate simulation approaches are critical to unlocking this potential, but existing methods lack the required accuracy, speed, and flexibility. To address this need, this work presents CHIPSIM, a comprehensive co-simulation framework designed for parallel DNN execution on chiplet-based systems. CHIPSIM concurrently models computation and communication, accurately capturing network contention and pipelining effects that conventional simulators overlook. Furthermore, it profiles the chiplet and NoI power consumptions at microsecond granularity for precise transient thermal analysis. Extensive evaluations with homogeneous/heterogeneous chiplets and different NoI architectures demonstrate the framework's versatility, up to 340% accuracy improvement, and power/thermal analysis capability.</description>

      <title>MIREDO: MIP-Driven Resource-Efficient Dataflow Optimization for Computing-in-Memory Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have emerged as a promising solution for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by mitigating data movement bottlenecks. However, realizing the potential of CIM requires specialized dataflow optimizations, which are challenged by an expansive design space and strict architectural constraints. Existing optimization approaches often fail to fully exploit CIM accelerators, leading to noticeable gaps between theoretical and actual system-level efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the MIREDO framework, which formulates dataflow optimization as a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. MIREDO introduces a hierarchical hardware abstraction coupled with an analytical latency model designed to accurately reflect the complex data transfer behaviors within CIM systems. By jointly modeling workload characteristics, dataflow strategies, and CIM-specific constraints, MIREDO systematically navigates the vast design space to determine the optimal dataflow configurations. Evaluation results demonstrate that MIREDO significantly enhances performance, achieving up to $3.2\times$ improvement across various DNN models and hardware setups.</description>

      <title>Detecting Anomalies in Machine Learning Infrastructure via Hardware Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) has grown into a tightly coupled, full-stack ecosystem that combines hardware, software, network, and applications. Many users rely on cloud providers for elastic, isolated, and cost-efficient resources. Unfortunately, these platforms as a service use virtualization, which means operators have little insight into the users' workloads. This hinders resource optimizations by the operator, which is essential to ensure cost efficiency and minimize execution time. In this paper, we argue that workload knowledge is unnecessary for system-level optimization. We propose System-X, which takes a \emph{hardware-centric} approach, relying only on hardware signals -- fully accessible by operators. Using low-level signals collected from the system, System-X detects anomalies through an unsupervised learning pipeline. The pipeline is developed by analyzing over 30 popular ML models on various hardware platforms, ensuring adaptability to emerging workloads and unknown deployment patterns. Using System-X, we successfully identified both network and system configuration issues, accelerating the DeepSeek model by 5.97%.</description>

      <title>Wireless Sensor Networks as Parallel and Distributed Hardware Platform for Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are proposing fully parallel and maximally distributed hardware realization of a generic neuro-computing system. More specifically, the proposal relates to the wireless sensor networks technology to serve as a massively parallel and fully distributed hardware platform to implement and realize artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. A parallel and distributed (PDP) hardware realization of ANNs makes it possible to have real time computation of large-scale (and complex) problems in a highly robust framework. We will demonstrate how a network of hundreds of thousands of processing nodes (or motes of a wireless sensor network), which have on-board processing and wireless communication features, can be used to implement fully parallel and massively distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms for solution of truly large-scale problems in real time. The realization of artificial neural network algorithms in a massively parallel and fully distributed hardware has been the goal of neural network computing researchers. This is because a parallel and distributed computation of artificial neural network algorithms could not have been achieved against all the advancements in silicon- or optics-based computing. Accordingly, artificial neural networks could not be applied to very large-scale problems for real time computation of solutions. This hindered the development of neural algorithms for affordable and practical solutions of challenging problems since often special-purpose computing approaches in hardware, software or hybrid (non-neural) had to be developed for and fine-tuned to specific problems that are very large-scale and highly complex. Successful implementation is likely to revolutionize computing as we know it by making it possible to solve very large scale scientific, engineering or technical problems in real time.</description>

      <title>Systolic Array Acceleration of Diagonal-Optimized Sparse-Sparse Matrix Multiplication for Efficient Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a key workload in quantum computing, enabling the study of complex quantum systems and serving as a critical tool for classical verification of quantum devices. However, it is computationally challenging because the Hilbert space dimension grows exponentially with the number of qubits. The growing dimensions make matrix exponentiation, the key kernel in Hamiltonian simulations, increasingly expensive. Matrix exponentiation is typically approximated by the Taylor series, which contains a series of matrix multiplications. Since Hermitian operators are often sparse, sparse matrix multiplication accelerators are essential for improving the scalability of classical Hamiltonian simulation. Yet, existing accelerators are primarily designed for machine learning workloads and tuned to their characteristic sparsity patterns, which differ fundamentally from those in Hamiltonian simulations that are often dominated by structured diagonals.
  In this work, we present \name, the first diagonal-optimized quantum simulation accelerator. It exploits the diagonal structure commonly found in problem-Hamiltonian (Hermitian) matrices and leverages a restructured systolic array dataflow to transform diagonally sparse matrices into dense computations, enabling high utilization and performance. Through detailed cycle-level simulation of diverse benchmarks in HamLib, \name{} demonstrates average performance improvements of $10.26\times$, $33.58\times$, and $53.15\times$ over SIGMA, Outer Product, and Gustavson's algorithm, respectively, with peak speedups up to $127.03\times$ while reducing energy consumption by an average of $471.55\times$ and up to $4630.58\times$ compared to SIGMA.</description>
