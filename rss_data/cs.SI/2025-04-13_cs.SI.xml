      <title>Large-Scale Analysis of Online Questions Related to Opioid Use Disorder on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a leading health problem that affects individual well-being as well as general public health. Due to a variety of reasons, including the stigma faced by people using opioids, online communities for recovery and support were formed on different social media platforms. In these communities, people share their experiences and solicit information by asking questions to learn about opioid use and recovery. However, these communities do not always contain clinically verified information. In this paper, we study natural language questions asked in the context of OUD-related discourse on Reddit. We adopt transformer-based question detection along with hierarchical clustering across 19 subreddits to identify six coarse-grained categories and 69 fine-grained categories of OUD-related questions. Our analysis uncovers ten areas of information seeking from Reddit users in the context of OUD: drug sales, specific drug-related questions, OUD treatment, drug uses, side effects, withdrawal, lifestyle, drug testing, pain management and others, during the study period of 2018-2021. Our work provides a major step in improving the understanding of OUD-related questions people ask unobtrusively on Reddit. We finally discuss technological interventions and public health harm reduction techniques based on the topics of these questions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of collective minds in online communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How communities respond to diverse societal challenges, from economic crises to political upheavals, is shaped by their collective minds - shared representations of ongoing events and current topics. In turn, collective minds are shaped by a continuous stream of influences, amplified by the rapid rise of online platforms. Online communities must understand these influences to maintain healthy discourse and avoid being manipulated, but understanding is hindered by limited observations and the inability to conduct counterfactual experiments. Here, we show how collective minds in online news communities can be influenced by different editorial agenda-setting practices and aspects of community dynamics, and how these influences can be reversed. We develop a computational model of collective minds, calibrated and validated with data from 400 million comments across five U.S. online news platforms and a large-scale survey. The model enables us to describe and experiment with a variety of influences and derive quantitative insights into their magnitude and persistence in different communities. We find that some editorial influences can be reversed relatively rapidly, but others, such as amplification and reframing of certain topics, as well as community influences such as trolling and counterspeech, tend to persist and durably change the collective mind. These findings illuminate ways collective minds can be manipulated and pathways for communities to maintain healthy and authentic collective discourse amid ongoing societal challenges.</description>

      <title>The Impact of External Sources on the Friedkin-Johnsen Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To obtain a foundational understanding of timeline algorithms and viral content in shaping public opinions, computer scientists started to study augmented versions of opinion formation models from sociology. In this paper, we generalize the popular Friedkin--Johnsen model to include the effects of external media sources on opinion formation. Our goal is to mathematically analyze the influence of biased media, arising from factors such as manipulated news reporting or the phenomenon of false balance. Within our framework, we examine the scenario of two opposing media sources, which do not adapt their opinions like ordinary nodes, and analyze the conditions and the number of periods required for radicalizing the opinions in the network. When both media sources possess equal influence, we theoretically characterize the final opinion configuration. In the special case where there is only a single media source present, we prove that media sources which do not adapt their opinions are significantly more powerful than those which do. Lastly, we conduct the experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, showing that our theoretical guarantees closely align with experimental simulations.</description>

      <title>Between Linear and Sinusoidal: Rethinking the Time Encoder in Dynamic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic graph learning is essential for applications involving temporal networks and requires effective modeling of temporal relationships. Seminal attention-based models like TGAT and DyGFormer rely on sinusoidal time encoders to capture temporal relationships between edge events. In this paper, we study a simpler alternative: the linear time encoder, which avoids temporal information loss caused by sinusoidal functions and reduces the need for high dimensional time encoders. We show that the self-attention mechanism can effectively learn to compute time spans from linear time encodings and extract relevant temporal patterns. Through extensive experiments on six dynamic graph datasets, we demonstrate that the linear time encoder improves the performance of TGAT and DyGFormer in most cases. Moreover, the linear time encoder can lead to significant savings in model parameters with minimal performance loss. For example, compared to a 100-dimensional sinusoidal time encoder, TGAT with a 2-dimensional linear time encoder saves 43% of parameters and achieves higher average precision on five datasets. These results can be readily used to positively impact the design choices of a wide variety of dynamic graph learning architectures.

      <title>The anonymization problem in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a general version of the anonymization problem in social networks, in which the goal is to maximize the number of anonymous nodes by altering a given graph. We define three variants of this optimization problem being full, partial and budgeted anonymization. In each, the objective is to maximize the number of k-anonymous nodes, i.e., nodes for which there are at least k-1 equivalent nodes, according to a particular anonymity measure of structural node equivalence. We propose four new heuristic algorithms for solving the anonymization problem which we implement into a reusable computational framework. As a baseline, we use an edge sampling method introduced in previous work. Experiments on both graph models and 23 real-world network datasets result in three empirical findings. First, we demonstrate that edge deletion is the most effective graph alteration operation. Second, we compare four commonly used anonymity measures from the literature and highlight how the choice of anonymity measure has a tremendous effect on both the initial anonymity as well as the difficulty of solving the anonymization problem. Third, we find that the proposed algorithm that preferentially deletes edges with a larger effect on nodes at a structurally unique position consistently outperforms heuristics solely based on network structure. Our best performing algorithm retains on average 14 times more edges in full anonymization, and overall ensures a better trade-off between anonymity and data utility. In the budgeted variant, it achieves 4.8 times more anonymous nodes than the baseline. This work lays foundations for future development of algorithms for anonymizing social networks.</description>

      <title>Opinion de-polarization of social networks with GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, social media is the ground for political debate and exchange of opinions. There is a significant amount of research that suggests that social media are highly polarized. A phenomenon that is commonly observed is the echo chamber structure, where users are organized in polarized communities and form connections only with similar-minded individuals, limiting themselves to consume specific content. In this paper we explore a way to decrease the polarization of networks with two echo chambers. Particularly, we observe that if some users adopt a moderate opinion about a topic, the polarization of the network decreases. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify a good set of K users, such that if they adopt a moderate stance around a topic, the polarization is minimized. Our algorithm employs a Graph Neural Network and thus it can handle large graphs more effectively than other approaches</description>

      <title>The Schwurbelarchiv: a German Language Telegram dataset for the Study of Conspiracy Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sociality borne by language, as is the predominant digital trace on text-based social media platforms, harbours the raw material for exploring multiple social phenomena. Distinctively, the messaging service Telegram provides functionalities that allow for socially interactive as well as one-to-many communication. Our Telegram dataset contains over 6,000 groups and channels, 40 million text messages, and over 3 million transcribed audio files, originating from a data-hoarding initiative named the ``Schwurbelarchiv'' (from German schwurbeln: speaking nonsense). This dataset publication details the structure, scope, and methodological specifics of the Schwurbelarchiv, emphasising its relevance for further research on the German-language conspiracy theory discourse. We validate its predominantly German origin by linguistic and temporal markers and situate it within the context of similar datasets. We describe process and extent of the transcription of multimedia files. Thanks to this effort the dataset uniquely supports multimodal analysis of online social dynamics and content dissemination. Researchers can employ this resource to explore societal dynamics in misinformation, political extremism, opinion adaptation, and social network structures on Telegram. The Schwurbelarchiv thus offers unprecedented opportunities for investigations into digital communication and its societal implications.</description>
