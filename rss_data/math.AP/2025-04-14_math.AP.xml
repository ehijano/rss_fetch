      <title>Periodic homogenization of convolution type operators with heavy tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with periodic homogenization of nonlocal symmetric convolution type operators in $L^2(\mathbb R^d)$,
  whose kernel is the product of a density that belongs to the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law
  and a rapidly oscillating positive periodic function.
  Assuming that the local oscillation of the said density satisfies a proper upper bound at infinity, we prove homogenization result for the studied family of operators.</description>

      <title>Doubly Connected V-States in Geophysical Models: A General Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of doubly connected V-states (rotating patches) close to an annulus for active scalar equations with completely monotone kernels. This provides a unified framework for various results related to geophysical flows. This allows us to recover existing results on this topic while also extending to new models, such as the gSQG and QGSW equations in radial domains and 2D Euler equation in annular domains.</description>

      <title>Finite energy solutions of quasilinear elliptic equations with Orlicz growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sufficient condition, expressed in terms of Wolff potentials, for the existence of a finite energy solution to the measure data $(p,q)$-Laplacian equation with a "sublinear growth" rate. Furthermore, we prove that such a solution is minimal. Additionally, a lower bound of a suitably generalized Wolff-type potential is necessary for the existence of a solution, even if the energy is not finite. Our main tools include integral inequalities closely associated with $(p,q)$-Laplacian equations with measure data and pointwise potential estimates, which are crucial for establishing the existence of solutions to this type of problem. This method also enables us to address other nonlinear elliptic problems involving a general class of quasilinear operators.</description>

      <title>Gradient Estimates for the doubly nonlinear diffusion equation on Complete Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the elliptic version of doubly nonlinear diffusion equations on a complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. Through the combination of a special nonlinear transformation and the standard Nash-Moser iteration procedure, some Cheng-Yau type gradient estimates for positive solutions are derived. As by-products, we also obtain Liouville type results and Harnack's inequality. These results fill a gap in Yan and Wang (2018)\cite{YW}, due to the lack of one key inequality when $b=\gamma-\frac{1}{p-1}&gt;0$, and provide a partial answer to the question that whether gradient estimates for the doubly nonlinear diffusion equation can be extended to the case $b&gt;0$ .</description>

      <title>Sharp norm inflation for 3D Navier-Stokes equations in supercritical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations exhibit norm inflation in $\dot B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ with smooth, compactly supported initial data. Such norm inflation is shown in all supercritical $\dot B^{s}_{p,q} $ near the scaling-critical line $s = -1+ \frac{3}{p}$ except at $s=0$. The growth mechanism differs depending on the sign of the regularity index $s$: forward energy cascade driven by mixing for $s&gt;0$ and backward energy cascade caused by un-mixing for $s&lt;0$. The construction also demonstrates arbitrarily large, finite-time growth of the vorticity, the first of such examples for the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>On the Cauchy problem for the reaction-diffusion system with point-interaction in $\mathbb R^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies the existence of solutions for the reaction-diffusion equation in $\mathbb R^2$ with point-interaction laplacian $\Delta_\alpha$ with $\alpha\in(-\infty,+\infty]$, assuming the functions to remain on the absolute continuous projection space. By semigroup estimates, we get the existence and uniqueness of solutions on $$ L^\infty\left((0,T);H^1_\alpha\left(\mathbb R^2\right)\right)\cap L^r\left((0,T);H^{s+1}_\alpha\left(\mathbb R^2\right)\right), $$ with $r&gt;2$, $s&lt;\frac{2}{r}$ for the Cauchy problem with small $T&gt;0$ or small initial conditions on $H^1_\alpha(\mathbb R^2)$. Finally, we prove decay in time of the functions.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities: a review on stability and instability results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we review recent results on stability and instability in logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, with a particular emphasis on strong norms. We consider several versions of these inequalities on the Euclidean space, for the Lebesgue and the Gaussian measures, and discuss their differences in terms of moments and stability. We give new and direct proofs, as well as examples. Although we do not cover all aspects of the topic, we hope to contribute to establishing the state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a smooth divisor on a closed K\"ahler manifold $X$. Suppose that $Aut_0(D)=\{Id\}$. We prove that the Poincar\'e type extremal K\"ahler metric with a cusp singularity at $D$ is unique up to a holomorphic transformation on $X$ that preserves $D$. This generalizes Berman-Berndtson's work on the uniqueness of extremal K\"ahler metrics from closed manifolds to some complete and noncompact manifolds.</description>

      <title>On eigenvibrations of branched structures with heterogeneous mass density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deal with a spectral problem for the Laplace-Beltrami operator posed on a stratified set $\Omega$ which is composed of smooth surfaces joined along a line $\gamma$, the junction. Through this junction we impose the Kirchhoff-type vertex conditions, which imply the continuity of the solutions and some balance for normal derivatives, and Neumann conditions on the rest of the boundary of the surfaces. Assuming that the density is $O(\varepsilon^{-m})$ along small bands of width $O(\varepsilon)$, which collapse into the line $\gamma$ as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero, and it is $O(1)$ outside these bands, we address the asymptotic behavior, as $\varepsilon\to 0$, of the eigenvalues and of the corresponding eigenfunctions for a parameter $m\geq 1$. We also study the asymptotics for high frequencies when $m\in(1,2)$.</description>

      <title>Holley--Stroock uniqueness method for the $\varphi^4_2$ dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approach initiated by Holley--Stroock establishes the uniqueness of invariant measures of Glauber dynamics of lattice spin systems from a uniform log-Sobolev inequality. We use this approach to prove uniqueness of the invariant measure of the $\varphi^4_2$ SPDE up to the critical temperature (characterised by finite susceptibility). The approach requires three ingredients: a uniform log-Sobolev inequality (which is already known), a propagation speed estimate, and a crude estimate on the relative entropy of the law of the finite volume dynamics at time $1$ with respect to the finite volume invariant measure. The last two ingredients are understood very generally on the lattice, but the proofs do not extend to SPDEs, and are here established in the instance of the $\varphi^4_2$ dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate fractional energy methods for Micropolar fluids, starting with an initial angular velocity of negative Sobolev regularity. For the initial angular velocity assumption, we consider a non-homogeneous Sobolev norm of negative order. The regularity -1/2 studied here corresponds to the critical scaling of a simplified associated system, and the general framework can also be applied to the Boussinesq system with viscosity. Since our approach differs from those based on mild solutions and does not rely on a projected system, this work provides new tools for studying the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg theory of singularities in coupled variables within the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two results related to magnetized Vlasov equations. Our first contribution concerns the stability of solutions to the magnetized Vlasov-Poisson system with a non-uniform magnetic field using the optimal transport approach introduced by Loeper [24]. We show that the extra magnetized terms can be suitably controlled by imposing stronger decay in velocity on one of the distribution functions, illustrating how the external magnetic field creates anisotropy in the evolution. This allows us to generalize the classical 2-Wasserstein stability estimate by Loeper [24, Theorem 1.2] and the recent stability estimate using a kinetic Wasserstein distance by Iacobelli [20, Theorem 3.1] to the magnetized Vlasov-Poisson system. In our second result, we extend the improved Dobrushin estimate by Iacobelli [20, Theorem 2.1] to the magnetized Vlasov equation with a uniform magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of helical vortex filaments in non viscous incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study concentrated solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations in helical symmetry without swirl. We prove that any helical vorticity solution initially concentrated around helices of pairwise distinct radii remains concentrated close to filaments. As suggested by the vortex filament conjecture, we prove that those filaments are translating and rotating helices. Similarly to what is obtained in other frameworks, the localization is weak in the direction of the movement but strong in its normal direction, and holds on an arbitrary long time interval in the naturally rescaled time scale. In order to prove this result, we derive a new explicit formula for the singular part of the Biot-Savart kernel in a two-dimensional reformulation of the problem. This allows us to obtain an appropriate decomposition of the velocity field to reproduce recent methods used to describe the dynamics of vortex rings or point-vortices for the lake equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we establish fine results on the boundary behavior of solutions to nonlocal equations in $C^{k,\gamma}$ domains which satisfy local Neumann conditions on the boundary. Such solutions typically blow up at the boundary like $v \asymp d^{s-1}$ and are sometimes called large solutions. In this setup we prove optimal regularity results for the quotients $v/d^{s-1}$, depending on the regularity of the domain and on the data of the problem. The results of this article will be important in a forthcoming work on nonlocal free boundary problems.</description>

Abstract: We prove the non-degeneracy of solutions to a fractional and singular Liouville equation defined on the whole real line in presence of a singular term. We use conformal transformations to rewrite the linearized equation as a Steklov eigenvalue problem posed in a bounded domain, which is defined either by an intersection or a union of two disks. We conclude by proving the simplicity of the corresponding eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson systems in dimension two: the zero mass case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an existence result for a Schr\"odinger-Poisson system in gradient form, set in the whole plane, in the case of zero mass. Since the setting is limiting for the Sobolev embedding, we admit nonlinearities with subcritical or critical growth in the sense of Trudinger-Moser. In particular, the absence of the mass term requires a nonstandard functional framework, based on homogeneous Sobolev spaces. These features, combined with the logarithmic behaviour of the kernel of the Poisson equation, make the analysis delicate, since standard variational tools cannot be applied. The system is solved by considering the corresponding logarithmic Choquard equation. The existence of a mountain pass-type solution is established by means of a careful analysis of appropriate Cerami sequences, whose boundedness is ensured through a nonstandard variational method, suggested by the subtle nature of the functional geometry involved. As a key tool in our estimates, we also introduce a logarithmic weighted Trudinger-Moser inequality, along with a related Cao-type inequality, both of which hold in our functional setting and are, we believe, of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the optimal sets in P\'olya and Makai type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine some shape functionals, introduced by P\'olya and Makai, involving the torsional rigidity and the first Dirichlet-Laplacian eigenvalue for bounded, open and convex sets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We establish new quantitative bounds, which give us key properties and information on the behavior of the optimizing sequences. In particular, we consider two kinds of reminder terms that provide information about the structure of these minimizing sequences, such as information about the thickness.</description>

      <title>An initial-boundary problem for a mixed fractional wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to prove a unique solvability of an initial-boundary value problem (IBVP) for a time-fractional wave equation in a rectangular domain. We exploit the spectral expansion method as the main tool and used the solution to Cauchy problems for fractional-order differential equations. Moreover, we apply certain properties of the Mittag-Leffler-type functions of single and two variables to prove the uniform convergence of the solution to the considered problem, represented in the form of infinite series.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on $\mathbb{T}^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove global well-posedness for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation for periodic initial data in the mass-critical dimension $d=2$ for initial data of arbitrary size in the defocusing case and data below the ground state threshold in the focusing case. The result is based on a new inverse Strichartz inequality, which is proved by using incidence geometry and additive combinatorics, in particular, the inverse theorems for Gowers uniformity norms by Green-Tao-Ziegler. This allows to transfer the analogous results of Dodson for the non-periodic mass-critical NLS to the periodic setting. In addition, we construct an approximate periodic solution which implies sharpness of the results.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic relaxation of a sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the solvability of a sixth-order Cahn--Hilliard equation with an inertial term, which serves as a relaxation of a higher-order variant of the classical Cahn--Hilliard equation. The equation includes a source term that disrupts the conservation of the mean value of the order parameter. The incorporation of additional spatial derivatives allows the model to account for curvature effects, leading to a more precise representation of isothermal phase separation dynamics. We establish the existence of a weak solution for the associated initial and boundary value problem under the assumption that the double-well-type nonlinearity is globally defined. Additionally, we derive uniform stability estimates, which enable us to demonstrate that any family of solutions satisfying these estimates converges in a suitable topology to the unique solution of the limiting problem as the relaxation parameter approaches zero. Furthermore, we provide an error estimate for specific norms of the difference between solutions in terms of the relaxation parameter.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel and local index theorem for open complex manifolds with $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a complex manifold $\Sigma $ with $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action, we define the $m$-th $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$ Fourier-Dolbeault cohomology group and consider the $m$-index on $\Sigma $. By applying the method of transversal heat kernel asymptotics, we obtain a local index formula for the $m$-index. We can reinterpret Kawasaki's Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula for a compact complex orbifold with an orbifold holomorphic line bundle by our integral formulas over a (smooth) complex manifold and finitely many complex submanifolds arising from singular strata. We generalize $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-action to complex reductive Lie group $G$-action on a compact or noncompact complex manifold. Among others, we study the nonextendability of open group action and the space of all $G$-invariant holomorphic $p$-forms. Finally, in the case of two compatible holomorphic $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$-actions, a mirror-type isomorphism is found between two linear spaces of holomorphic forms, and the Euler characteristic associated with these spaces can be computed by our $\mathbb{C}^{\ast }$ local index formula on the total space. In the perspective of the equivariant algebraic cobordism theory $\Omega _{\ast }^{\mathbb{C}^{\ast }}(\Sigma ),$ a speculative connection is remarked. Possible relevance to the recent development in physics and number theory is briefly mentioned.</description>
