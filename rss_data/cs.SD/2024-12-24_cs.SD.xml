      <title>Efficient VoIP Communications through LLM-based Real-Time Speech Reconstruction and Call Prioritization for Emergency Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergency communication systems face disruptions due to packet loss, bandwidth constraints, poor signal quality, delays, and jitter in VoIP systems, leading to degraded real-time service quality. Victims in distress often struggle to convey critical information due to panic, speech disorders, and background noise, further complicating dispatchers' ability to assess situations accurately. Staffing shortages in emergency centers exacerbate delays in coordination and assistance. This paper proposes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges by reconstructing incomplete speech, filling contextual gaps, and prioritizing calls based on severity. The system integrates real-time transcription with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate contextual responses, using Twilio and AssemblyAI APIs for seamless implementation. Evaluation shows high precision, favorable BLEU and ROUGE scores, and alignment with real-world needs, demonstrating the model's potential to optimize emergency response workflows and prioritize critical cases effectively.</description>

      <title>Decoding Poultry Vocalizations -- Natural Language Processing and Transformer Models for Semantic and Emotional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciphering the acoustic language of chickens offers new opportunities in animal welfare and ecological informatics. Their subtle vocal signals encode health conditions, emotional states, and dynamic interactions within ecosystems. Understanding the semantics of these calls provides a valuable tool for interpreting their functional vocabulary and clarifying how each sound serves a specific purpose in social and environmental contexts. We apply advanced Natural Language Processing and transformer based models to translate bioacoustic data into meaningful insights. Our method integrates Wave2Vec 2.0 for raw audio feature extraction with a fine tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model, pretrained on a broad corpus of animal sounds and adapted to poultry tasks. This pipeline decodes poultry vocalizations into interpretable categories including distress calls, feeding signals, and mating vocalizations, revealing emotional nuances often overlooked by conventional analyses. Achieving 92 percent accuracy in classifying key vocalization types, our approach demonstrates the feasibility of real time automated monitoring of flock health and stress. By tracking this functional vocabulary, farmers can respond proactively to environmental or behavioral changes, improving poultry welfare, reducing stress related productivity losses, and supporting more sustainable farm management. Beyond agriculture, this research enhances our understanding of computational ecology. Accessing the semantic foundation of animal calls may indicate biodiversity, environmental stressors, and species interactions, informing integrative ecosystem level decision making.</description>

      <title>A Classification Benchmark for Artificial Intelligence Detection of Laryngeal Cancer from Patient Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cases of laryngeal cancer are predicted to rise significantly in the coming years. Current diagnostic pathways cause many patients to be incorrectly referred to urgent suspected cancer pathways, putting undue stress on both patients and the medical system.
  Artificial intelligence offers a promising solution by enabling non-invasive detection of laryngeal cancer from patient speech, which could help prioritise referrals more effectively and reduce inappropriate referrals of non-cancer patients. To realise this potential, open science is crucial. A major barrier in this field is the lack of open-source datasets and reproducible benchmarks, forcing researchers to start from scratch. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a benchmark suite comprising 36 models trained and evaluated on open-source datasets. These models are accessible in a public repository, providing a foundation for future research. They evaluate three different algorithms and three audio feature sets, offering a comprehensive benchmarking framework. We propose standardised metrics and evaluation methodologies to ensure consistent and comparable results across future studies.
  The presented models include both audio-only inputs and multimodal inputs that incorporate demographic and symptom data, enabling their application to datasets with diverse patient information. By providing these benchmarks, future researchers can evaluate their datasets, refine the models, and use them as a foundation for more advanced approaches. This work aims to provide a baseline for establishing reproducible benchmarks, enabling researchers to compare new methods against these standards and ultimately advancing the development of AI tools for detecting laryngeal cancer.</description>

      <title>Text2midi: Generating Symbolic Music from Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces text2midi, an end-to-end model to generate MIDI files from textual descriptions. Leveraging the growing popularity of multimodal generative approaches, text2midi capitalizes on the extensive availability of textual data and the success of large language models (LLMs). Our end-to-end system harnesses the power of LLMs to generate symbolic music in the form of MIDI files. Specifically, we utilize a pretrained LLM encoder to process captions, which then condition an autoregressive transformer decoder to produce MIDI sequences that accurately reflect the provided descriptions. This intuitive and user-friendly method significantly streamlines the music creation process by allowing users to generate music pieces using text prompts. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations, incorporating both automated and human studies, that show our model generates MIDI files of high quality that are indeed controllable by text captions that may include music theory terms such as chords, keys, and tempo. We release the code and music samples on our demo page (https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/Text2midi) for users to interact with text2midi.</description>

      <title>Improving Lip-synchrony in Direct Audio-Visual Speech-to-Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech-to-Speech Translation typically prioritizes improving translation quality and naturalness. However, an equally critical aspect in audio-visual content is lip-synchrony-ensuring that the movements of the lips match the spoken content-essential for maintaining realism in dubbed videos. Despite its importance, the inclusion of lip-synchrony constraints in AVS2S models has been largely overlooked. This study addresses this gap by integrating a lip-synchrony loss into the training process of AVS2S models. Our proposed method significantly enhances lip-synchrony in direct audio-visual speech-to-speech translation, achieving an average LSE-D score of 10.67, representing a 9.2% reduction in LSE-D over a strong baseline across four language pairs. Additionally, it maintains the naturalness and high quality of the translated speech when overlaid onto the original video, without any degradation in translation quality.</description>

      <title>Mamba-SEUNet: Mamba UNet for Monaural Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent speech enhancement (SE) research, transformer and its variants have emerged as the predominant methodologies. However, the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism imposes certain limitations on practical deployment. Mamba, as a novel state-space model (SSM), has gained widespread application in natural language processing and computer vision due to its strong capabilities in modeling long sequences and relatively low computational complexity. In this work, we introduce Mamba-SEUNet, an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba with U-Net for SE tasks. By leveraging bidirectional Mamba to model forward and backward dependencies of speech signals at different resolutions, and incorporating skip connections to capture multi-scale information, our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Experimental results on the VCTK+DEMAND dataset indicate that Mamba-SEUNet attains a PESQ score of 3.59, while maintaining low computational complexity. When combined with the Perceptual Contrast Stretching technique, Mamba-SEUNet further improves the PESQ score to 3.73.</description>

      <title>SoundLoc3D: Invisible 3D Sound Source Localization and Classification Using a Multimodal RGB-D Acoustic Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D sound sources and estimating their semantic labels -- where the sources may not be visible, but are assumed to lie on the physical surface of objects in the scene -- have many real applications, including detecting gas leak and machinery malfunction. The audio-visual weak-correlation in such setting poses new challenges in deriving innovative methods to answer if or how we can use cross-modal information to solve the task. Towards this end, we propose to use an acoustic-camera rig consisting of a pinhole RGB-D camera and a coplanar four-channel microphone array~(Mic-Array). By using this rig to record audio-visual signals from multiviews, we can use the cross-modal cues to estimate the sound sources 3D locations. Specifically, our framework SoundLoc3D treats the task as a set prediction problem, each element in the set corresponds to a potential sound source. Given the audio-visual weak-correlation, the set representation is initially learned from a single view microphone array signal, and then refined by actively incorporating physical surface cues revealed from multiview RGB-D images. We demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of SoundLoc3D on large-scale simulated dataset, and further show its robustness to RGB-D measurement inaccuracy and ambient noise interference.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Frequency State Space Duality: An Efficient Paradigm for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) plays a critical role in enhancing user experience within human-computer interaction. However, existing methods are overwhelmed by temporal domain analysis, overlooking the valuable envelope structures of the frequency domain that are equally important for robust emotion recognition. To overcome this limitation, we propose TF-Mamba, a novel multi-domain framework that captures emotional expressions in both temporal and frequency dimensions.Concretely, we propose a temporal-frequency mamba block to extract temporal- and frequency-aware emotional features, achieving an optimal balance between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. Besides, we design a Complex Metric-Distance Triplet (CMDT) loss to enable the model to capture representative emotional clues for SER. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that TF-Mamba surpasses existing methods in terms of model size and latency, providing a more practical solution for future SER applications.</description>

      <title>AV-DTEC: Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Fusion for Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of compact UAVs has created significant threats to public safety, while traditional drone detection systems are often bulky and costly. To address these challenges, we propose AV-DTEC, a lightweight self-supervised audio-visual fusion-based anti-UAV system. AV-DTEC is trained using self-supervised learning with labels generated by LiDAR, and it simultaneously learns audio and visual features through a parallel selective state-space model. With the learned features, a specially designed plug-and-play primary-auxiliary feature enhancement module integrates visual features into audio features for better robustness in cross-lighting conditions. To reduce reliance on auxiliary features and align modalities, we propose a teacher-student model that adaptively adjusts the weighting of visual features. AV-DTEC demonstrates exceptional accuracy and effectiveness in real-world multi-modality data. The code and trained models are publicly accessible on GitHub

      <title>Trainingless Adaptation of Pretrained Models for Environmental Sound Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based models for environmental sound classification are not robust against a domain to which training data do not belong, that is, out-of-distribution or unseen data. To utilize pretrained models for the unseen domain, adaptation methods, such as finetuning and transfer learning, are used with rich computing resources, e.g., the graphical processing unit (GPU). However, it is becoming more difficult to keep up with research trends for those who have poor computing resources because state-of-the-art models are becoming computationally resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose a trainingless adaptation method for pretrained models for environmental sound classification. To introduce the trainingless adaptation method, we first propose an operation of recovering time--frequency-ish (TF-ish) structures in intermediate layers of DNN models. We then propose the trainingless frequency filtering method for domain adaptation, which is not a gradient-based optimization widely used. The experiments conducted using the ESC-50 dataset show that the proposed adaptation method improves the classification accuracy by 20.40 percentage points compared with the conventional method.</description>

      <title>Multiple Consistency-guided Test-Time Adaptation for Contrastive Audio-Language Models with Unlabeled Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One fascinating aspect of pre-trained Audio-Language Models (ALMs) learning is their impressive zero-shot generalization capability and test-time adaptation (TTA) methods aiming to improve domain performance without annotations. However, previous test time adaptation (TTA) methods for ALMs in zero-shot classification tend to be stuck in incorrect model predictions. In order to further boost the performance, we propose multiple guidance on prompt learning without annotated labels. First, guidance of consistency on both context tokens and domain tokens of ALMs is set. Second, guidance of both consistency across multiple augmented views of each single test sample and contrastive learning across different test samples is set. Third, we propose a corresponding end-end learning framework for the proposed test-time adaptation method without annotated labels. We extensively evaluate our approach on 12 downstream tasks across domains, our proposed adaptation method leads to 4.41% (max 7.50%) average zero-shot performance improvement in comparison with the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Adapting Whisper for Code-Switching through Encoding Refining and Language-Aware Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16507v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code-switching (CS) automatic speech recognition (ASR) faces challenges due to the language confusion resulting from accents, auditory similarity, and seamless language switches. Adaptation on the pre-trained multi-lingual model has shown promising performance for CS-ASR. In this paper, we adapt Whisper, which is a large-scale multilingual pre-trained speech recognition model, to CS from both encoder and decoder parts. First, we propose an encoder refiner to enhance the encoder's capacity of intra-sentence swithching. Second, we propose using two sets of language-aware adapters with different language prompt embeddings to achieve language-specific decoding information in each decoder layer. Then, a fusion module is added to fuse the language-aware decoding. The experimental results using the SEAME dataset show that, compared with the baseline model, the proposed approach achieves a relative MER reduction of 4.1% and 7.2% on the dev_man and dev_sge test sets, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Through experiments, we found that the proposed method significantly improves the performance on non-native language in CS speech, indicating that our approach enables Whisper to better distinguish between the two languages.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Speech Synthesis with Next-Distribution Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce KALL-E, a novel autoregressive (AR) language modeling approach with next-distribution prediction for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. Unlike existing methods, KALL-E directly models and predicts the continuous speech distribution conditioned on text without relying on VAE- or diffusion-based components. Specifically, we use WaveVAE to extract continuous speech distributions from waveforms instead of using discrete speech tokens. A single AR language model predicts these continuous speech distributions from text, with a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss as the constraint. Experimental results show that KALL-E outperforms open-source implementations of YourTTS, VALL-E, NaturalSpeech 2, and CosyVoice in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity in zero-shot TTS scenarios. Moreover, KALL-E demonstrates exceptional zero-shot capabilities in emotion and accent cloning. Importantly, KALL-E presents a more straightforward and effective paradigm for using continuous speech representations in TTS.

      <title>FADA: Fast Diffusion Avatar Synthesis with Mixed-Supervised Multi-CFG Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based audio-driven talking avatar methods have recently gained attention for their high-fidelity, vivid, and expressive results. However, their slow inference speed limits practical applications. Despite the development of various distillation techniques for diffusion models, we found that naive diffusion distillation methods do not yield satisfactory results. Distilled models exhibit reduced robustness with open-set input images and a decreased correlation between audio and video compared to teacher models, undermining the advantages of diffusion models. To address this, we propose FADA (Fast Diffusion Avatar Synthesis with Mixed-Supervised Multi-CFG Distillation). We first designed a mixed-supervised loss to leverage data of varying quality and enhance the overall model capability as well as robustness. Additionally, we propose a multi-CFG distillation with learnable tokens to utilize the correlation between audio and reference image conditions, reducing the threefold inference runs caused by multi-CFG with acceptable quality degradation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that FADA generates vivid videos comparable to recent diffusion model-based methods while achieving an NFE speedup of 4.17-12.5 times. Demos are available at our webpage http://fadavatar.github.io.</description>

      <title>InterDance:Reactive 3D Dance Generation with Realistic Duet Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans perform a variety of interactive motions, among which duet dance is one of the most challenging interactions. However, in terms of human motion generative models, existing works are still unable to generate high-quality interactive motions, especially in the field of duet dance. On the one hand, it is due to the lack of large-scale high-quality datasets. On the other hand, it arises from the incomplete representation of interactive motion and the lack of fine-grained optimization of interactions. To address these challenges, we propose, InterDance, a large-scale duet dance dataset that significantly enhances motion quality, data scale, and the variety of dance genres. Built upon this dataset, we propose a new motion representation that can accurately and comprehensively describe interactive motion. We further introduce a diffusion-based framework with an interaction refinement guidance strategy to optimize the realism of interactions progressively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and algorithm.</description>

      <title>Why Do Speech Language Models Fail to Generate Semantically Coherent Outputs? A Modality Evolving Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although text-based large language models exhibit human-level writing ability and remarkable intelligence, speech language models (SLMs) still struggle to generate semantically coherent outputs. There are several potential reasons for this performance degradation: (A) speech tokens mainly provide phonetic information rather than semantic information, (B) the length of speech sequences is much longer than that of text sequences, and (C) paralinguistic information, such as prosody, introduces additional complexity and variability. In this paper, we explore the influence of three key factors separately by transiting the modality from text to speech in an evolving manner. Our findings reveal that the impact of the three factors varies. Factor A has a relatively minor impact, factor B influences syntactical and semantic modeling more obviously, and factor C exerts the most significant impact, particularly in the basic lexical modeling. Based on these findings, we provide insights into the unique challenges of training SLMs and highlight pathways to develop more effective end-to-end SLMs.</description>

      <title>Scalable Speech Enhancement with Dynamic Channel Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Enhancement (SE) is essential for improving productivity in remote collaborative environments. Although deep learning models are highly effective at SE, their computational demands make them impractical for embedded systems. Furthermore, acoustic conditions can change significantly in terms of difficulty, whereas neural networks are usually static with regard to the amount of computation performed. To this end, we introduce Dynamic Channel Pruning to the audio domain for the first time and apply it to a custom convolutional architecture for SE. Our approach works by identifying unnecessary convolutional channels at runtime and saving computational resources by not computing the activations for these channels and retrieving their filters. When trained to only use 25% of channels, we save 29.6% of MACs while only causing a 0.75% drop in PESQ. Thus, DynCP offers a promising path toward deploying larger and more powerful SE solutions on resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Visual Contribution in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) combines auditory and visual speech cues to enhance the accuracy and robustness of speech recognition systems. Recent advancements in AVSR have improved performance in noisy environments compared to audio-only counterparts. However, the true extent of the visual contribution, and whether AVSR systems fully exploit the available cues in the visual domain, remains unclear. This paper assesses AVSR systems from a different perspective, by considering human speech perception. We use three systems: Auto-AVSR, AVEC and AV-RelScore. We first quantify the visual contribution using effective SNR gains at 0 dB and then investigate the use of visual information in terms of its temporal distribution and word-level informativeness. We show that low WER does not guarantee high SNR gains. Our results suggest that current methods do not fully exploit visual information, and we recommend future research to report effective SNR gains alongside WERs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of speech temporal dynamics in application to automatic speaker verification and speaker voice anonymization tasks. We propose several metrics to perform automatic speaker verification based only on phoneme durations. Experimental results demonstrate that phoneme durations leak some speaker information and can reveal speaker identity from both original and anonymized speech. Thus, this work emphasizes the importance of taking into account the speaker's speech rate and, more importantly, the speaker's phonetic duration characteristics, as well as the need to modify them in order to develop anonymization systems with strong privacy protection capacity.</description>

      <title>Investigating Prosodic Signatures via Speech Pre-Trained Models for Audio Deepfake Source Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate various state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech pre-trained models (PTMs) for their capability to capture prosodic signatures of the generative sources for audio deepfake source attribution (ADSD). These prosodic characteristics can be considered one of major signatures for ADSD, which is unique to each source. So better is the PTM at capturing prosodic signs better the ADSD performance. We consider various SOTA PTMs that have shown top performance in different prosodic tasks for our experiments on benchmark datasets, ASVSpoof 2019 and CFAD. x-vector (speaker recognition PTM) attains the highest performance in comparison to all the PTMs considered despite consisting lowest model parameters. This higher performance can be due to its speaker recognition pre-training that enables it for capturing unique prosodic characteristics of the sources in a better way. Further, motivated from tasks such as audio deepfake detection and speech recognition, where fusion of PTMs representations lead to improved performance, we explore the same and propose FINDER for effective fusion of such representations. With fusion of Whisper and x-vector representations through FINDER, we achieved the topmost performance in comparison to all the individual PTMs as well as baseline fusion techniques and attaining SOTA performance.</description>

      <title>A Language Model With Million Context Length For Raw Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling long-term dependencies for audio signals is a particularly challenging problem, as even small-time scales yield on the order of a hundred thousand samples. With the recent advent of Transformers, neural architectures became good at modeling dependencies over longer time scales, but they suffered from quadratic constraints to scale them. We propose a generative auto-regressive architecture that can model audio waveforms over quite a large context, greater than 500,000 samples. Our work is adapted to learn time dependencies by learning a latent representation by a CNN front-end, and then learning dependencies over these representations using Transformer encoders, fully trained end-to-end: thereby allowing to learn representations as it deems fit for the next sample. Unlike previous works that compared different time scales to show improvement, we use a standard dataset, with the same number of parameters/context to show improvements. We achieve a state-of-the-art performance as compared to other approaches such as Wavenet, SaSHMI, and Sample-RNN on a standard dataset for modeling long-term structure. This work gives very exciting direction for the field, given improvements in context modeling that can be scaled with more data, as well as potentially better results by using billions/trillions of parameters.</description>

      <title>Content Adaptive Front End For Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a learnable content adaptive front end for audio signal processing. Before the modern advent of deep learning, we used fixed representation non-learnable front-ends like spectrogram or mel-spectrogram with/without neural architectures. With convolutional architectures supporting various applications such as ASR and acoustic scene understanding, a shift to a learnable front ends occurred in which both the type of basis functions and the weight were learned from scratch and optimized for the particular task of interest. With the shift to transformer-based architectures with no convolutional blocks present, a linear layer projects small waveform patches onto a small latent dimension before feeding them to a transformer architecture. In this work, we propose a way of computing a content-adaptive learnable time-frequency representation. We pass each audio signal through a bank of convolutional filters, each giving a fixed-dimensional vector. It is akin to learning a bank of finite impulse-response filterbanks and passing the input signal through the optimum filter bank depending on the content of the input signal. A content-adaptive learnable time-frequency representation may be more broadly applicable, beyond the experiments in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human auditory perception is compositional in nature -- we identify auditory streams from auditory scenes with multiple sound events. However, such auditory scenes are typically represented using clip-level representations that do not disentangle the constituent sound sources. In this work, we learn source-centric audio representations where each sound source is represented using a distinct, disentangled source embedding in the audio representation. We propose two novel approaches to learning source-centric audio representations: a supervised model guided by classification and an unsupervised model guided by feature reconstruction, both of which outperform the baselines. We thoroughly evaluate the design choices of both approaches using an audio classification task. We find that supervision is beneficial to learn source-centric representations, and that reconstructing audio features is more useful than reconstructing spectrograms to learn unsupervised source-centric representations. Leveraging source-centric models can help unlock the potential of greater interpretability and more flexible decoding in machine listening.</description>

Abstract: When applying parameter-efficient finetuning via LoRA onto speaker adaptive text-to-speech models, adaptation performance may decline compared to full-finetuned counterparts, especially for out-of-domain speakers. Here, we propose VoiceGuider, a parameter-efficient speaker adaptive text-to-speech system reinforced with autoguidance to enhance the speaker adaptation performance, reducing the gap against full-finetuned models. We carefully explore various ways of strengthening autoguidance, ultimately finding the optimal strategy. VoiceGuider as a result shows robust adaptation performance especially on extreme out-of-domain speech data. We provide audible samples in our demo page.</description>

Abstract: We present NanoVoice, a personalized text-to-speech model that efficiently constructs voice adapters for multiple speakers simultaneously. NanoVoice introduces a batch-wise speaker adaptation technique capable of fine-tuning multiple references in parallel, significantly reducing training time. Beyond building separate adapters for each speaker, we also propose a parameter sharing technique that reduces the number of parameters used for speaker adaptation. By incorporating a novel trainable scale matrix, NanoVoice mitigates potential performance degradation during parameter sharing. NanoVoice achieves performance comparable to the baselines, while training 4 times faster and using 45 percent fewer parameters for speaker adaptation with 40 reference voices. Extensive ablation studies and analysis further validate the efficiency of our model.</description>

      <title>HDMoLE: Mixture of LoRA Experts with Hierarchical Routing and Dynamic Thresholds for Fine-Tuning LLM-based ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in integrating Large Language Models (LLM) with automatic speech recognition (ASR) have performed remarkably in general domains. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of all model parameters is often employed to adapt pre-trained LLM-based ASR models to specific domains, it imposes high computational costs and notably reduces their performance in general domains. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient multi-domain fine-tuning method for adapting pre-trained LLM-based ASR models to multi-accent domains without catastrophic forgetting named \textit{HDMoLE}, which leverages hierarchical routing and dynamic thresholds based on combining low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with the mixer of experts (MoE) and can be generalized to any linear layer. Hierarchical routing establishes a clear correspondence between LoRA experts and accent domains, improving cross-domain collaboration among the LoRA experts. Unlike the static Top-K strategy for activating LoRA experts, dynamic thresholds can adaptively activate varying numbers of LoRA experts at each MoE layer. Experiments on the multi-accent and standard Mandarin datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HDMoLE. Applying HDMoLE to an LLM-based ASR model projector module achieves similar performance to full fine-tuning in the target multi-accent domains while using only 9.6% of the trainable parameters required for full fine-tuning and minimal degradation in the source general domain.</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Spatial Knowledge Understanding for Immersive Visual Text-to-Speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Text-to-Speech (VTTS) aims to take the environmental image as the prompt to synthesize reverberant speech for the spoken content. Previous works focus on the RGB modality for global environmental modeling, overlooking the potential of multi-source spatial knowledge like depth, speaker position, and environmental semantics. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-source spatial knowledge understanding scheme for immersive VTTS, termed MS2KU-VTTS. Specifically, we first prioritize RGB image as the dominant source and consider depth image, speaker position knowledge from object detection, and Gemini-generated semantic captions as supplementary sources. Afterwards, we propose a serial interaction mechanism to effectively integrate both dominant and supplementary sources. The resulting multi-source knowledge is dynamically integrated based on the respective contributions of each source.This enriched interaction and integration of multi-source spatial knowledge guides the speech generation model, enhancing the immersive speech experience. Experimental results demonstrate that the MS$^2$KU-VTTS surpasses existing baselines in generating immersive speech. Demos and code are available at: https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/MS2KU-VTTS.</description>

Abstract: We participated in track 2 of the VoiceMOS Challenge 2024, which aimed to predict the mean opinion score (MOS) of singing samples. Our submission secured the first place among all participating teams, excluding the official baseline. In this paper, we further improve our submission and propose a novel Pitch-and-Spectrum-aware Singing Quality Assessment (PS-SQA) method. The PS-SQA is designed based on the self-supervised-learning (SSL) MOS predictor, incorporating singing pitch and spectral information, which are extracted using pitch histogram and non-quantized neural codec, respectively. Additionally, the PS-SQA introduces a bias correction strategy to address prediction biases caused by low-resource training samples, and employs model fusion technology to further enhance prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that our proposed PS-SQA significantly outperforms all competing systems across all system-level metrics, confirming its strong sing quality assessment capabilities.</description>

      <title>TAME: Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of compact UAVs has introduced significant risks to public safety, while traditional drone detection systems are often bulky and costly. To address these challenges, we present TAME, the Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification. This innovative anti-UAV detection model leverages a parallel selective state-space model to simultaneously capture and learn both the temporal and spectral features of audio, effectively analyzing propagation of sound. To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification. Our model sets a new standard of performance on the MMUAD benchmarks, demonstrating superior accuracy and effectiveness. The code and trained models are publicly available on GitHub \url{https://github.com/AmazingDay1/TAME}.</description>

      <title>PI-Whisper: Designing an Adaptive and Incremental Automatic Speech Recognition System for Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies are increasingly prevalent in the development of intelligent and personalized assistants. However, resource-constrained ASR models face significant challenges in adaptivity, incrementality, and inclusivity when faced with a diverse population. To tackle those challenges, we propose PI-Whisper, a novel ASR system that adaptively enhances recognition capabilities by identifying speakers' characteristics in real-time. In this work, we show how the design of PI-Whisper allows for incremental adaptation of new characteristics without the need for repetitive retraining, enhances recognition capabilities, and improves equity and fairness across diverse speaker groups. PI-Whisper demonstrates these advantages by achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing the word error rate (WER) by up to 13.7% relative to baselines while scaling linearly to computing resources.</description>

      <title>DCIM-AVSR : Efficient Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Dual Conformer Interaction Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech recognition is the technology that enables machines to interpret and process human speech, converting spoken language into text or commands. This technology is essential for applications such as virtual assistants, transcription services, and communication tools. The Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) model enhances traditional speech recognition, particularly in noisy environments, by incorporating visual modalities like lip movements and facial expressions. While traditional AVSR models trained on large-scale datasets with numerous parameters can achieve remarkable accuracy, often surpassing human performance, they also come with high training costs and deployment challenges. To address these issues, we introduce an efficient AVSR model that reduces the number of parameters through the integration of a Dual Conformer Interaction Module (DCIM). In addition, we propose a pre-training method that further optimizes model performance by selectively updating parameters, leading to significant improvements in efficiency. Unlike conventional models that require the system to independently learn the hierarchical relationship between audio and visual modalities, our approach incorporates this distinction directly into the model architecture. This design enhances both efficiency and performance, resulting in a more practical and effective solution for AVSR tasks.</description>

      <title>vec2wav 2.0: Advancing Voice Conversion via Discrete Token Vocoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new speech discrete token vocoder, vec2wav 2.0, which advances voice conversion (VC). We use discrete tokens from speech self-supervised models as the content features of source speech, and treat VC as a prompted vocoding task. To amend the loss of speaker timbre in the content tokens, vec2wav 2.0 utilizes the WavLM features to provide strong timbre-dependent information. A novel adaptive Snake activation function is proposed to better incorporate timbre into the waveform reconstruction process. In this way, vec2wav 2.0 learns to alter the speaker timbre appropriately given different reference prompts. Also, no supervised data is required for vec2wav 2.0 to be effectively trained. Experimental results demonstrate that vec2wav 2.0 outperforms all other baselines to a considerable margin in terms of audio quality and speaker similarity in any-to-any VC. Ablation studies verify the effects made by the proposed techniques. Moreover, vec2wav 2.0 achieves competitive cross-lingual VC even only trained on monolingual corpus. Thus, vec2wav 2.0 shows timbre can potentially be manipulated only by speech token vocoders, pushing the frontiers of VC and speech synthesis.</description>

      <title>Cross-attention Inspired Selective State Space Models for Target Sound Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transformer model, particularly its cross-attention module, is widely used for feature fusion in target sound extraction which extracts the signal of interest based on given clues. Despite its effectiveness, this approach suffers from low computational efficiency. Recent advancements in state space models, notably the latest work Mamba, have shown comparable performance to Transformer-based methods while significantly reducing computational complexity in various tasks. However, Mamba's applicability in target sound extraction is limited due to its inability to capture dependencies between different sequences as the cross-attention does. In this paper, we propose CrossMamba for target sound extraction, which leverages the hidden attention mechanism of Mamba to compute dependencies between the given clues and the audio mixture. The calculation of Mamba can be divided to the query, key and value. We utilize the clue to generate the query and the audio mixture to derive the key and value, adhering to the principle of the cross-attention mechanism in Transformers. Experimental results from two representative target sound extraction methods validate the efficacy of the proposed CrossMamba.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is an important speech processing component for smart devices with voice assistance capability. In this paper, we investigate if Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) can be used to enhance the performance of KWS. We explore various approaches to integrate KAN for a model architecture based on 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We find that KAN is effective at modeling high-level features in lower-dimensional spaces, resulting in improved KWS performance when integrated appropriately. The findings shed light on understanding KAN for speech processing tasks and on other modalities for future researchers.</description>

      <title>RF-GML: Reference-Free Generative Machine Listener</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel reference-free (RF) audio quality metric called the RF-Generative Machine Listener (RF-GML), designed to evaluate coded mono, stereo, and binaural audio at a 48 kHz sample rate. RF-GML leverages transfer learning from a state-of-the-art full-reference (FR) Generative Machine Listener (GML) with minimal architectural modifications. The term "generative" refers to the model's ability to generate an arbitrary number of simulated listening scores. Unlike existing RF models, RF-GML accurately predicts subjective quality scores across diverse content types and codecs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate its superiority in rating unencoded audio and distinguishing different levels of coding artifacts. RF-GML's performance and versatility make it a valuable tool for coded audio quality assessment and monitoring in various applications, all without the need for a reference signal.</description>

      <title>Joint Fine-tuning and Conversion of Pretrained Speech and Language Models towards Linear Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.</description>

      <title>LSCodec: Low-Bitrate and Speaker-Decoupled Discrete Speech Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although discrete speech tokens have exhibited strong potential for language model-based speech generation, their high bitrates and redundant timbre information restrict the development of such models. In this work, we propose LSCodec, a discrete speech codec that has both low bitrate and speaker decoupling ability. LSCodec adopts a three-stage unsupervised training framework with a speaker perturbation technique. A continuous information bottleneck is first established, followed by vector quantization that produces a discrete speaker-decoupled space. A discrete token vocoder finally refines acoustic details from LSCodec. By reconstruction experiments, LSCodec demonstrates superior intelligibility and audio quality with only a single codebook and smaller vocabulary size than baselines. The 25Hz version of LSCodec also achieves the lowest bitrate (0.25kbps) of codecs so far with decent quality. Voice conversion evaluations prove the satisfactory speaker disentanglement of LSCodec, and ablation study further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed training framework.</description>

      <title>Ditto: Motion-Space Diffusion for Controllable Realtime Talking Head Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized audio-driven talking head synthesis. Beyond precise lip synchronization, diffusion-based methods excel in generating subtle expressions and natural head movements that are well-aligned with the audio signal. However, these methods are confronted by slow inference speed, insufficient fine-grained control over facial motions, and occasional visual artifacts largely due to an implicit latent space derived from Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which prevent their adoption in realtime interaction applications. To address these issues, we introduce Ditto, a diffusion-based framework that enables controllable realtime talking head synthesis. Our key innovation lies in bridging motion generation and photorealistic neural rendering through an explicit identity-agnostic motion space, replacing conventional VAE representations. This design substantially reduces the complexity of diffusion learning while enabling precise control over the synthesized talking heads. We further propose an inference strategy that jointly optimizes three key components: audio feature extraction, motion generation, and video synthesis. This optimization enables streaming processing, realtime inference, and low first-frame delay, which are the functionalities crucial for interactive applications such as AI assistants. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Ditto generates compelling talking head videos and substantially outperforms existing methods in both motion control and realtime performance.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Controllable Video-to-Music Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hangeul was created as a phonetic alphabet and is known to have the best 1:1 correspondence between letters and pronunciation among existing alphabets. In this paper, we examine the possibility of modifying the basic form of Hangeul and using it as a kind of phonetic symbol. The core concept of this approach is to preserve the basic form of the alphabet, modifying only the shape of a stroke rather than the letter itself. To the best of our knowledge, no previous attempts in any language have been made to express pronunciations of an alphabet different from the original simply by changing the shape of the alphabet strokes, and this paper is probably the first attempt in this direction.</description>

      <title>LAMA-UT: Language Agnostic Multilingual ASR through Orthography Unification and Language-Specific Transliteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building a universal multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that performs equitably across languages has long been a challenge due to its inherent difficulties. To address this task we introduce a Language-Agnostic Multilingual ASR pipeline through orthography Unification and language-specific Transliteration (LAMA-UT). LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific modules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a minimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps. First, we utilize a universal transcription generator to unify orthographic features into Romanized form and capture common phonetic characteristics across diverse languages. Second, we utilize a universal converter to transform these universal transcriptions into language-specific ones. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method leveraging universal transcriptions for massively multilingual ASR. Our pipeline achieves a relative error reduction rate of 45% when compared to Whisper and performs comparably to MMS, despite being trained on only 0.1% of Whisper's training data. Furthermore, our pipeline does not rely on any language-specific modules. However, it performs on par with zero-shot ASR approaches which utilize additional language-specific lexicons and language models. We expect this framework to serve as a cornerstone for flexible multilingual ASR systems that are generalizable even to unseen languages.</description>
