      <title>Defining the mean turbulent boundary layer thickness based on streamwise velocity skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new statistical definition for the mean turbulent boundary layer thickness is introduced, based on the identification of the point where streamwise velocity skewness changes sign in the outermost region of the boundary layer. This definition is motivated by the phenomenology of streamwise velocity fluctuations near the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, whose local characteristics are shown to be universal for turbulent boundary layers under low freestream turbulence conditions (e.g., with or without pressure gradients, surface roughness, etc.). This approach provides a turbulent boundary layer thickness that is consistent with previous definitions, such as those based on Reynolds shear stress or `composite' mean velocity profiles, while being independent of arbitrary thresholds and applicable to past single-point measurements. Two methods are proposed for estimating the turbulent boundary layer thickness using this definition: one based on simple linear interpolation and the other on fitting a generalised Fourier model to the outer skewness profile. The robustness and limitations of these methods are demonstrated through analysis of several published experimental and numerical datasets, which cover a range of canonical and non-canonical turbulent boundary layers. These datasets vary in wall-normal resolution and measurement noise, particularly in the critical turbulent/non-turbulent interface region.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions for probability density function transport equations in fluid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of the probability density function (PDF) transport equation at the limits of the probability space is studied from the point of view of fluid mechanics. Different boundary conditions are considered depending on the nature of the variable considered (velocity, scalar, and position). A study of the implications of entrance and exit conditions is performed, showing that a new term should be added to the PDF transport equation to preserve normalization in some nonstationary processes. In practice, this term is taken into account naturally in particle methods. Finally, the existence of discontinuities at the limits is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Fourth-order statistical moments of the velocity gradient tensor in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compact expression of fourth-order statistical moments of the velocity gradient tensor in homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible turbulence is obtained as a function of its invariants and of generic components of the velocity gradient. This single, compact expression is in full agreement with the four different expressions previously obtained by Siggia as functions of the same invariants and of generic components of the vorticity vector and the strain tensor; however, some discrepancies arise with respect to a similar, single expression obtained by Phan-Thien and Antonia. The used algorithm may be easily extended to handle higher order statistical moments of the velocity gradient.</description>

      <title>Shoaling of Finite-Amplitude Rogue Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00400v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rogue wave formation and enhancement over coastal areas have been documented over the last decade. However, this recent knowledge is in apparent contradiction with the established observation of sub-Gaussian wave statistics near shallow water. Current theories and experiments describe the rogue wave amplification near shallow water regimes, but only for small-amplitude waves, and thus, not accounting for wave-breaking processes. To address this gap, we perform experiments to probe inhomogeneous wave fields nearing the wave-breaking regime. We also show that by increasing the significant wave height towards the breaking limit, the kinetic energy grows faster than the variance of the surface elevation due to nonlinearity, providing a physical explanation why the occurrence of rogue wave first increases in shallower waters and suddenly decreases further shorewards.</description>

      <title>Pulsatility delays the transition to sustained turbulence in quasi-two-dimensional shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates efficient routes to turbulence in quasi-two-dimensional shear flows. Two-dimensional disturbances require high Reynolds numbers to incite transition from a steady base flow, as transient growth is modest. With the addition of an oscillatory base flow component, this work shows that the transient growth experienced by two-dimensional initial perturbations is often well above that provided by the steady component. However, as has been shown for three-dimensional flows [Pier &amp; Schmid J. Fluid Mech. 926, A11 (2021)], the transient growth is almost entirely composed of modal intracyclic growth, rather than a transient mechanism which takes advantage of non-normality. This lack of transient growth, relative to the severe decay induced by the favorable pressure gradient during the acceleration phase of the oscillatory base flow, only ever delays the transition to sustained turbulence. Thus, a non-oscillatory driving force remains the most efficient strategy for sustained turbulence in quasi-two-dimensional shear flows. The only benefit provided by pulsatility is that the amplitude of the initial condition required to trigger intermittent turbulence is orders of magnitude smaller.</description>

      <title>A parametric study of the pipeline hammer phenomenon in plastic Bingham slurry flows using the finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We do a numerical study of the transient phenomenon in pipelines transporting plastic Bingham slurry flows, using a lowest-order finite element method (FEM). While most pipeline hammer studies focus on Newtonian fluids, the transient dynamics in Bingham fluids remains elusive and poorly afforded, even though this case has significant impact in industry like mining. A detailed parametric study asses the effects of the slurry yield stress and the valve closure times on both, pressure and velocity distributions along the pipeline, using an adaptive friction model to account for turbulent slurries. Results reveal that yield stress enhances flow resistance and accelerates pressure peak attenuation, underscoring the damping role of Bingham rheology compared to Newtonian flows. These insights emphasize the need for advanced FEM-based schemes in non-Newtonian shockwave modeling, with implications for industrial pipeline design and operational safety.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear bubble behaviours of compressible Rayleigh-Taylor instability with isothermal stratification in cylindrical geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear evolutions of two-dimensional single-mode compressible Rayleigh--Taylor instability (RTI) with isothermal stratification are investigated in cylindrical geometry via direct numerical simulation for different Atwood numbers ($A_T=0.1-0.9$) and Mach numbers ($Ma=0.1-0.9$). It is found that the nonlinear bubble growth involves the effects of density stratification, vorticity accumulation and flow compressibility and shows considerable differences between convergent (acceleration acting radially inward) and divergent (acceleration acting radially outward) cases. Specifically, the density stratification leads to non-acceleration at low $A_T$ and high $Ma$. The accelerations in convergent cases are dominated by vorticity accumulation at low $A_T$ and low $Ma$ and by flow compressibility at high $A_T$ and high $Ma$ whereas the accelerations in divergent cases are purely induced by flow compressibility at high $A_T$ and high $Ma$. Based on the nonlinear theory of incompressible cylindrical RTI with uniform-density background~(Zhao et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 900, 2020, A24), an improved model is proposed by taking the density variation, vorticity accumulation and flow compressibility into consideration. This model is verified by numerical results and well reproduces the bubble evolution for different $A_T$ and $Ma$ from linear to highly nonlinear regimes.</description>

      <title>Energy, enstrophy and helicity transfers in polymeric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the scale-by-scale transfers of energy, enstrophy and helicity in homogeneous and isotropic polymeric turbulence using direct numerical simulations. The microscale Reynolds number is set to $Re_\lambda \approx 460$, and the Deborah number $De = \tau_p/\tau_f$ is varied between $1/9 \le De \le 9$; $\tau_p$ is the polymeric relaxation time and $\tau_f$ is the turnover time of the largest scales of the flow. The study relies on the exact scale-by-scale budget equations (derived from the the governing model equations) for energy, enstrophy and helicity, which account for the back-reaction of the polymers on the flow. Polymers act as a sink/source in the flow, and provide alternative routes for the scale-by-scale transfers of the three quantities, whose relevance changes with $De$. We find that polymers deplete the nonlinear energy cascade mainly at smaller scales, by weakening both the extreme forward as well as reverse local events. The new polymer-driven energy flux dominates at small scales for $De \ge 1$, and on average transfers energy from larger to smaller scales with localised backscatter events. Polymers weaken the stretching of vorticity with the enstrophy being mainly generated by the fluid-polymer interaction, especially when $De \ge 1$. Accordingly, an inspection of the small-scale flow topology shows that polymers favour events with two-dimensional state of straining, and promote/inhibit extreme extension/rotation events: in polymeric turbulence shear and planar extensional flows are more probable. The helicity injected at the largest scales shows a similar transfer process to as energy, being mainly driven by the nonlinear cascade at large scales and by the polymer-driven flux at small scales. Polymers are found to favour events that break the small-scale mirror symmetry, with the relative helicity monotonically increasing with $De$ at all scales.</description>

      <title>Topological flow data analysis for transient flow patterns: a graph-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a time-series analysis method for transient two-dimensional flow patterns based on Topological Flow Data Analysis (TFDA), a new approach to topological data analysis. TFDA identifies local topological flow structures from an instantaneous streamline pattern and describes their global connections as a unique planar tree and its string representation. With TFDA, the evolution of two-dimensional flow patterns is reduced to a discrete dynamical system represented as a transition graph between topologically equivalent streamline patterns. We apply this method to study the lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds numbers ranging from $Re=14000$ to $Re=16000$, a benchmark problem in fluid dynamics data analysis. Our approach reveals the transition from periodic to chaotic flow at a critical Reynolds number when the reduced dynamical system is modelled as a Markov process on the transition graph. Additionally, we perform an observational causal inference to analyse changes in local flow patterns at the cavity corners and discuss differences with a standard interventional sensitivity analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of TFDA-based time-series analysis for uncovering complex dynamical behaviours in fluid flow data.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in visco-thermodiffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometrical optics approach has been used to derive instability criteria for various swirling flows observed in nature and industrial processes. By applying a short-wavelength local analysis to the Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the energy equation when necessary, we account for viscosity and thermal diffusivity effects. The derived criteria are validated for swirling flows modeled by a cylindrical differentially rotating annulus with axial flow induced by either a sliding inner cylinder, an axial pressure gradient, or a radial temperature gradient combined with vertical gravity. These criteria successfully reproduce known results from numerical linear stability analysis and agree with experimental and simulation data. Moreover, they unify and extend several classical instability criteria: the Rayleigh criterion for centrifugally-driven instabilities, the Ludwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson criterion for isothermal swirling flows, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke criterion for non-isothermal azimuthal flows. Additionally, they predict oscillatory modes in swirling flows, thereby generalizing the McIntyre instability criterion to these systems.</description>

      <title>Nonspherical oscillations of an encapsulated magnetic microbubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a model for nonspherical oscillations of encapsulated bubbles coated with a polymer infused with magnetic particles, developed using membrane theory for thin weakly magnetic membranes. According to this theory, only the applied magnetic field significantly contributes to the Maxwell stress and membrane is under generalized plane stress. The study focuses on axisymmetric deformations of bubbles under symmetrically arranged magnetic coils. Non-spherical oscillations of the bubble are restricted to the linear regime, with the second mode dominating within the pressure range of the stability region. The pressure-frequency stability region is computationally determined, and its variation with different material properties and applied magnetic field is analyzed. The natural frequency of each mode is estimated using boundary layer approximation. Time-series analysis of the second mode amplitude reveals a significant oscillation amplitude relative to the bubble radius. Estimation using the model indicates that the interface magnetic susceptibility and initial bubble radius enhance the amplitude of second-mode oscillations. Computational findings suggest that the applied magnetic field does not influence the stability region for exponential stability.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of tulip flame formation in highly reactive and low reactive gas mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early stages of flame dynamics and the development and evolution of tulip flames in closed tubes of various aspect ratios and in a semi-open tube are studied by solving the fully compressible reactive Navier-Stokes equations using a high-order numerical method coupled to detailed chemical models in a stoichiometric hydrogen/air and methane/air mixtures. The use of adaptive mesh refinement provides adequate resolution of the flame reaction zone, pressure waves, and flame-pressure wave interactions. The purpose of this study is to gain a deeper insight into the influence of chemical kinetics on the combustion regimes leading to the formation of a tulip flame and its subsequent evolution. The simulations highlight the effect of flame thickness, flame velocity, and reaction order on the intensity of the rarefaction wave generated by the flame during the deceleration phase, which is the principal physical mechanism of tulip flame formation. The obtained results explain most of the experimentally observed features of tulip flame formation, e.g. faster tulip flame formation with deeper tulip shape for faster flames compared to slower flames.</description>

      <title>Multi-Velocity Sharp-Interface Continuum Thermodynamics of Fluid Systems with Adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the sharp-interface continuum thermodynamics of two-phase multicomponent fluid systems, accounting for partial mass and partial momentum balances both in the bulk phases and on the interface. This allows to describe the transfer of species between the individual bulk phases and the interface, i.e. ad- and desorption processes. In fact, the transfer of any constituent between the two bulk-phases is considered as a series of ad- and desorption processes. In this framework, all species transfer processes are coupled via the interfacial thermodynamics. As a consequence, the influence of surface active species on the transfer of other constituents can be captured in detail. The derivation of this model class relies on an axiomatic form of the entropy principle which, at the same time, allows for an efficient closure process. This form of the entropy principle has been introduced for one-phase fluid systems in (Bothe, Dreyer, Acta Mechanica 226, 2015) as the result of intense joint work of the late Wolfgang Dreyer and the present author.</description>

      <title>Weak-Strong Uniqueness and Extreme Wall Events at High Reynolds Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular or weak solutions of the Euler equations have been hypothesized to acccount for anomalous dissipation at very high Reynolds numbers and, in particular, to explain the d'Alembert paradox of non-vanishing drag. A possible objection to this explanation is the mathematical property called "weak-strong uniqueness", which requires that any admissible weak solution of the Euler equations must coincide with the smooth Euler solution for the same initial data. As an application of the Josephson-Anderson relation, we sketch a proof of conditional weak-strong uniqueness for the potential Euler solution of d'Alembert within the class of strong inviscid limits. We suggest that the mild conditions required for weak-strong uniqueness are, in fact, physically violated by violent eruption of very thin boundary layers. We discuss observational signatures of these extreme events and explain how the small length-scales involved could threaten the validity of a hydrodynamic description.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Suppressed Shock Wave/Turbulent Boundary Layer Interaction Using Cryogenic Wall Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the wall-cooling effects on shock wave turbulent/boundary layer interaction (SWTBLI) with limited experimental data, a supersonic wind tunnel wall was cooled using liquid nitrogen as the cryogenic coolant. Under the condition of the mainstream Mach number, in the range of 2.02-2.04, the wall temperature was cooled to 88-92 K, corresponding to a wall-to-recovery temperature ratio of 0.31-0.33. The flow structures with and without wall cooling were observed using the schlieren method. The reflected shock motion or interaction length in the schlieren image suggested that boundary layer separation was suppressed under the cooling condition in relation to that under the non-cooling condition, and the suppressed ratio of the cooling-to-uncooling interaction length was approximately 0.60-0.72. Additionally, while the mainstream state and wall temperature near the separation were constant, a gradual change in the separated flow field was observed under the wall-cooling condition. This was due to the slow wall temperature increase in the upstream wall of the separation region, where the incoming boundary layer developed. Each flow field of SWTBLI in the present experiment, using liquid nitrogen as the cryogenic coolant, was consistent with the classical Chaman's free interaction theory.</description>

      <title>A hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy model for arbitrary flows to the fluid--porous interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling of coupled flow systems containing a free-flow region in contact with a porous medium is challenging, especially for arbitrary flow directions to the fluid--porous interface. Transport processes in the free flow and porous medium are typically described by distinct equations: the Stokes equations and Darcy's law, respectively, with an appropriate set of coupling conditions at the common interface. Classical interface conditions based on the Beavers--Joseph condition are not accurate for general flows. Several generalisations are recently developed for arbitrary flows at the interface, some of them are however only theoretically formulated and still need to be validated.
  In this manuscript, we propose an alternative to couple free flow and porous-medium flow, namely, the hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy model. Such formulation incorporates the averaged Brinkman equations within a complex interface between the free-flow and porous-medium regions. The complex interface acts as a buffer zone facilitating storage and transport of mass and momentum and the model is applicable for arbitrary flow directions. We validate the proposed hybrid-dimensional model against the pore-scale resolved model in multiple examples and compare numerical simulation results also with the classical and generalised coupling conditions from the literature. The proposed hybrid-dimensional model demonstrates its applicability to describe arbitrary coupled flows and shows its advantages in comparison to other generalised coupling conditions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects in three-dimensional high-speed compressible flows: Multiscale modeling and simulation via the discrete Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) high-speed compressible flow is a typical nonlinear, nonequilibrium, and multiscale complex flow. Traditional fluid mechanics models, based on the quasi-continuum assumption and near-equilibrium approximation, are insufficient to capture significant discrete effects and thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects (TNEs) as the Knudsen number increases. To overcome these limitations, a discrete Boltzmann modeling and simulation method, rooted in kinetic and mean-field theories, has been developed. By applying Chapman-Enskog multiscale analysis, the essential kinetic moment relations $\bm{\Phi}$ for characterizing second-order TNEs are determined. These relations are invariants in coarse-grained physical modeling, providing a unique mesoscopic perspective for analyzing TNE behaviors. A discrete Boltzmann model, accurate to the second-order in the Knudsen number, is developed to enable multiscale simulations of 3D supersonic flows. As key TNE measures, nonlinear constitutive relations (NCRs), are theoretically derived for the 3D case, offering a constitutive foundation for improving macroscopic fluid modeling. The NCRs in three dimensions exhibit greater complexity than their two-dimensional counterparts. This complexity arises from increased degrees of freedom, which introduce additional kinds of nonequilibrium driving forces, stronger coupling between these forces, and a significant increase in nonequilibrium components. At the macroscopic level, the model is validated through several classical test cases, ranging from 1D to 3D scenarios, from subsonic to supersonic regimes. At the mesoscopic level, the model accurately captures typical TNEs, such as viscous stress and heat flux, around mesoscale structures, across various scales and orders. This work provides kinetic insights that advance multiscale simulation techniques for 3D high-speed compressible flows.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous convective heat transfer at the wall: a depiction of turbulent boundary layer structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the ability to experimentally measure fluctuations of the convective heat transfer coefficient at the wall in a turbulent boundary layer. For this, we measure two-dimensional fields of wall-temperature fluctuations beneath a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer, at two moderate friction Reynolds numbers ($Re_\tau \approx 990$ and $Re_\tau \approx 1800$). Spatiotemporal data of wall-temperature are acquired by means of a heated-thin-foil sensor as sensing hardware, and an infrared camera as temperature detector. At low $Re_\tau$ conditions, the fields of the Nusselt number fluctuations are populated by elongated structures comprising streamwise and spanwise length scales comparable to those of near-wall streaks. At higher $Re_\tau$ conditions, the effective width and length of the coherent $Nu$ fluctuations increases. These findings are based on two-point correlations, as well as streamwise-spanwise energy spectra of $Nu$ fluctuations. The convective velocities of the $Nu$ fluctuations are also computed with the available time resolution from the measurements. This allows for resolving the multi-scale nature of convective footprints of wall-bounded turbulence: our experimental data reflect that larger streaks in the footprint convect at velocities in the order of the free-stream velocity, while the more energetic smaller-scale features move at velocities in the order of $10u_\tau$. Measurements of the kind presented here offer a promising method for sensing, as they can be used as input to flow control systems.</description>

Abstract: A study on UV radiation in shock focused gas has been carried out in high temperature radiating Air experimentally. Spherical shock wave focusing was achieved with the help of a contoured converging section attached to a shock tube. The measured radiation is compared with SPECAIR software to find out that the radiation corresponds to the emission of N2+ Meinal transition. The temperature of the radiating gas was estimated from SPECAIR and was found to be around 6000K.</description>

      <title>The electrostatic charge on a falling water drop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid triboelectrification, also known as flow electrification, remains an under-explored yet ubiquitous phenomenon with potential applications in various fields, from material science to planetary evolution. Building upon previous efforts to position water within the triboelectric series, we investigate the charge on individual, millimetric water drops falling through air. Our experiments measured the charge and mass of each drop using a Faraday cup mounted on a mass balance, and connected to an electrometer. For pure water in a glass syringe with a grounded metal tip, we find the charge per drop ($\Delta q/\Delta m$) was approximately -5 pC/g to -1 pC/g. This was independent of the release height of the drop, tip diameter and length, tip cleaning preparation, and whether the experiment was shielded with a Faraday cage. Biasing the tip to different voltages allowed for linear control of the drop charge, and the results were consistent with known electrochemical effects, namely the Volta potential expected between most metals and bulk water ($\approx$ -0.5 V). Introducing insulating plastic materials into the experiment (from the syringe body or tip) imparted large amounts of charge on the drops with apparent stochastic charge evolution. Together these results show that the flow electrification of water is more complex than previously reported, and is driven by various, material-dependent electrostatic processes.</description>

      <title>Binned Spectral Power Loss for Improved Prediction of Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting multiscale chaotic dynamical systems with deep learning remains a formidable challenge due to the spectral bias of neural networks, which hinders the accurate representation of fine-scale structures in long-term predictions. This issue is exacerbated when models are deployed autoregressively, leading to compounding errors and instability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to mitigate the spectral bias which we call the Binned Spectral Power (BSP) Loss. The BSP loss is a frequency-domain loss function that adaptively weighs errors in predicting both larger and smaller scales of the dataset. Unlike traditional losses that focus on pointwise misfits, our BSP loss explicitly penalizes deviations in the energy distribution across different scales, promoting stable and physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that the BSP loss mitigates the well-known problem of spectral bias in deep learning. We further validate our approach for the data-driven high-dimensional time-series forecasting of a range of benchmark chaotic systems which are typically intractable due to spectral bias. Our results demonstrate that the BSP loss significantly improves the stability and spectral accuracy of neural forecasting models without requiring architectural modifications. By directly targeting spectral consistency, our approach paves the way for more robust deep learning models for long-term forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Boundary element formulation of the Mild-Slope Equation for harmonic water waves propagating over unidirectional variable bathymetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a boundary element formulation for the solution of the Mild-Slope equation in wave propagation problems with variable water depth in one direction. Based on the Green's function approximation proposed by Belibassakis \cite{Belibassakis2000}, a complete fundamental-solution kernel is developed and combined with a boundary element scheme for the solution of water wave propagation problems in closed and open domains where the bathymetry changes arbitrarily and smoothly in a preferential direction. The ability of the proposed formulation to accurately represent wave phenomena like refraction, reflection, diffraction and shoaling, is demonstrated with the solution of some example problems, in which arbitrary geometries and variable seabed profiles with slopes up to 1:3 are considered. The obtained results are also compared with theoretical solutions, showing an excellent agreement that demonstrates its potential.</description>

      <title>Formation and evolution of turbulence in convectively unstable internal solitary waves of depression shoaling over gentle slopes in the South China Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shoaling of high-amplitude Internal Solitary Waves (ISW) of depression in the South China Sea (SCS), is examined through large-scale parallel turbulence-resolving high-accuracy simulations. A select, near-isobath-normal, bathymetric transect of the gentle SCS's continental slope is employed together with stratification and current profiles obtained by in-situ measurements. Simulations are conducted using a state-of-the-art high-accuracy hybrid Spectral-Element-Method/Fourier three-dimensional non-linear non-hydrostatic flow solver. Three simulations of separate ISWs with initial deep-water amplitudes in the range [136m, 150m] provide a novel wave-tracking capability for a propagation distance of 80km. While key features of the in-situ observed phenomena are accurately reproduced, additional insights into wave evolution are offered, inaccessible through field observations. The interplay between convective versus shear instability as a function of deep-water ISW amplitude, along with the associated turbulence formation and evolution, are explored. Across all three waves, the convective instability develops in a similar fashion. Heavier water entrained from the wave rear plunges into its interior, giving rise to transient, yet distinct, subsurface vortical structures. Ultimately, a gravity current is triggered which horizontally advances through the wave interior and mixes it down to the base of the pycnocline. Although the waveform remains distinctly symmetric, Kelvin-Helmholtz billows result near the well-mixed ISW trough, disturb the wave's trailing edge, and are linked with an active wake with an intensity nonlinearly dependent on deep-water wave amplitude. Finally, the evolution of the kinetic energy associated with finer-scale velocity perturbations to the ISW shows two different growth regimes, each dominated by either convective or shear instability.</description>

      <title>Hagen-Poiseuille Flow Linear Stability Paradox Resolving and Viscous Dissipative Mechanism of the Turbulence Emergence in the Boundary Layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:1007.1097v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the linear theory of hydrodynamic stability up to now there exist examples of flows for which there is full quantitative distinction, as for cylindrical Hagen-Poiseuille (HP) flow in a pipe with round section, between theory conclusions and experimental data on the threshold Reynolds number Reth. In the present work, we show that to get a conclusion of linear instability of the HP flow for finite Reynolds numbers Re, it is necessary to abandon the use of traditional 'normal' form of disturbances which assumes an opportunity of separation of variables describing disturbances variability depending on radial and longitudinal (along the pipe axis) coordinates. In the result of the absence of such variables separation, in the suggested linear theory, it is proposed to use Bubnov-Galerkin's approximation method modification that gives an opportunity to account longitudinal variability periods distinctions for different radial modes defined a priori in the result of standard Galerkin-Cantorovich's method to the equation of evolution of extremely small axially symmetric velocity field tangential component disturbances. We found that when considering even two linearly interacting radial modes for the HP flow, linear instability is possible only when there exists mentioned above conditionally periodic longitudinal along the pipe axis disturbance variability when Re_th(p) very sensitively depends on the ratio p of two longitudinal periods each of which describes longitudinal variability for its own radial mode only. Obtained for the HP flow linear instability realization minimal value Re_th=448 (when p=1.527) quantitatively agrees with the Tolmin-Shlihting waves in the boundary layer emergence, where also Re_th=420. We get quantitative agreeing of the phase velocity values of the considered disturbances with experimental data on the fronts of the turbulent 'puffs' spreading in the pipe.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear shallow-water waves with vertical odd viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The breaking of detailed balance in fluids through Coriolis forces or odd-viscous stresses has profound effects on the dynamics of surface waves. Here we explore both weakly and strongly non-linear waves in a three-dimensional fluid with vertical odd viscosity with and without the Coriolis effect. Our model describes the free surface of a shallow fluid composed of nearly vertical vortex filaments, which all stand perpendicular to the surface. We find that the odd viscosity in this configuration induces previously unexplored non-linear effects in shallow-water waves, arising from both stresses on the surface and stress gradients in the bulk. By assuming weak nonlinearity, we find reduced equations including Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Ostrovsky, and Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli (KP) equations with modified coefficients. At sufficiently large odd viscosity, the dispersion changes sign, allowing for compact two-dimensional solitary waves. We show that odd viscosity and surface tension have the same effect on the free surface, but distinct signatures in the fluid flow. Our results describe the collective dynamics of many-vortex systems, which can also occur in oceanic and atmospheric geophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manipulation of small-scale particles across streamlines is the elementary task of microfluidic devices. Many such devices operate at very low Reynolds numbers and deflect particles using arrays of obstacles, but a systematic quantification of relevant hydrodynamic effects has been lacking. Here, we explore an alternate approach, rigorously modeling the displacement of force-free spherical particles in vortical Stokes flows under hydrodynamic particle-wall interaction. Certain Moffatt-like eddy geometries with broken symmetry allow for systematic deflection of particles across streamlines, leading to particle accumulation at either Faxen field fixed points or limit cycles. Moreover, particles can be forced onto trajectories approaching channel walls exponentially closely, making quantitative predictions of particle capture (sticking) by short-range forces possible. This rich, particle size-dependent behavior suggests the versatile use of inertial-less flow in devices with a long particle residence time for concentration, sorting, or filtering.</description>

      <title>FLRONet: Deep Operator Learning for High-Fidelity Fluid Flow Field Reconstruction from Sparse Sensor Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurements is vital for many science and engineering applications but remains challenging because of dimensional disparities between state and observational spaces. Due to such dimensional differences, the measurement operator becomes ill-conditioned and non-invertible, making the reconstruction of flow fields from sensor measurements extremely difficult. Although sparse optimization and machine learning address the above problems to some extent, questions about their generalization and efficiency remain, particularly regarding the discretization dependence of these models. In this context, deep operator learning offers a better solution as this approach models mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces, enabling superior generalization and discretization-independent reconstruction. We introduce FLRONet, a deep operator learning framework that is trained to reconstruct fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurements. FLRONet employs a branch-trunk network architecture to represent the inverse measurement operator that maps sensor observations to the original flow field, a continuous function of both space and time. Validation performed on the CFDBench dataset has demonstrated that FLRONet consistently achieves high levels of reconstruction accuracy and robustness, even in scenarios where sensor measurements are inaccurate or missing. Furthermore, the operator learning approach endows FLRONet with the capability to perform zero-shot super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains, offering a solution for rapid reconstruction of high-fidelity flow fields.</description>

Abstract: Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing with gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.</description>

      <title>Mixing by squirmers in stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the mixing induced by a small swimming organism in a density stratified fluid. We model the swimmer as a spherical squirmer and quantify mixing through a mixing efficiency that is the ratio of rate of change of potential energy of fluid to the total work done by the swimmer. Assessing mixing in the near field and far field of the swimmer separately, we find that the near-field mixing aligns with past work, but the overall mixing is much larger than that caused by a point-sized swimmer (like force-dipole), although still small in weak stratification. Equivalent results are also obtained for a homogeneous dilute suspension of non-interacting swimmers. Our study highlights the impact of swimmer size on mixing, revealing that small-sized swimmers cannot induce substantial mixing. However, we propose few (unexplored) pathways through which small swimmers could induce significant mixing, ultimately contributing towards oceanic mixing.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for fast and accurate statistical computation of fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generative AI algorithm for addressing the pressing task of fast, accurate, and robust statistical computation of three-dimensional turbulent fluid flows. Our algorithm, termed as GenCFD, is based on an end-to-end conditional score-based diffusion model. Through extensive numerical experimentation with a set of challenging fluid flows, we demonstrate that GenCFD provides an accurate approximation of relevant statistical quantities of interest while also efficiently generating high-quality realistic samples of turbulent fluid flows and ensuring excellent spectral resolution. In contrast, ensembles of deterministic ML algorithms, trained to minimize mean square errors, regress to the mean flow. We present rigorous theoretical results uncovering the surprising mechanisms through which diffusion models accurately generate fluid flows. These mechanisms are illustrated with solvable toy models that exhibit the mathematically relevant features of turbulent fluid flows while being amenable to explicit analytical formulae. Our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/camlab-ethz/GenCFD.</description>

      <title>Comparison of stochastic BGK and FP methods for the simulation of non-equilibrium multi-species molecular gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to limited possibilities of experimental investigations for non-equilibrium gas flows, numerical results are of highest interest. Although the well-established Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method achieves highly accurate solutions, the computational requirements increase excessively for lower Knudsen regimes. Computationally more efficient simulations can be achieved with stochastic continuum-based methods using either the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) or the Fokker-Planck (FP) approximations where, instead of particle collisions, particle relaxation processes are considered. This paper explains the implementation of different stochastic BGK and FP methods in the open-source particle code PICLas for multi-species molecular gas flows. For verification, the results of different test cases are compared.</description>
