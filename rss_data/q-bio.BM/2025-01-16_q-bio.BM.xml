      <title>Score-based 3D molecule generation with neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new representation for 3D molecules based on their continuous atomic density fields. Using this representation, we propose a new model based on walk-jump sampling for unconditional 3D molecule generation in the continuous space using neural fields. Our model, FuncMol, encodes molecular fields into latent codes using a conditional neural field, samples noisy codes from a Gaussian-smoothed distribution with Langevin MCMC (walk), denoises these samples in a single step (jump), and finally decodes them into molecular fields. FuncMol performs all-atom generation of 3D molecules without assumptions on the molecular structure and scales well with the size of molecules, unlike most approaches. Our method achieves competitive results on drug-like molecules and easily scales to macro-cyclic peptides, with at least one order of magnitude faster sampling. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcmol.</description>

      <title>Investigation on non-ergodicity of protein dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of microscopic protein dynamics has historically presented significant challenges to researchers seeking to develop a comprehensive and detailed description of its diverse and intriguing features. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have proposed the hypothesis that protein dynamics may be non-ergodic. The implications of this finding are of paramount importance from both a practical and theoretical standpoint. In this study, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to examine these results over a time window spanning from picoseconds to nanoseconds. To this end, we utilize widely used statistical tools. Our findings challenge the conclusions of previous studies, which suggested that proteins exhibit non-ergodic dynamics. Instead, we demonstrate that deviations from ergodic behavior are due to incomplete convergence of the investigated quantities. Additionally, we discuss the implications of findings that suggest a potential breaking of the ergodic hypothesis over larger time windows, which were not directly investigated in this study.</description>
