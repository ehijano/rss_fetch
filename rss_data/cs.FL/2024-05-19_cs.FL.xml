      <title>Techniques for Showing the Decidability of the Boundedness Problem of Language Acceptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many types of automata and grammar models that have been studied in the literature, and for these models, it is common to determine whether certain problems are decidable. One problem that has been difficult to answer throughout the history of automata and formal language theory is to decide whether a given system $M$ accepts a bounded language (whether there exist words $w_1, \ldots,w_k$ such that $L(M) \subseteq w_1 \cdots w_k$?). Decidability of this problem has gone unanswered for the majority of automata/grammar models in the literature. Boundedness was only known to be decidable for regular and context-free languages until recently when it was shown to also be decidable for finite-automata and pushdown automata augmented with reversal-bounded counters, and for vector addition systems with states.
  In this paper, we develop new techniques to show that the boundedness problem is decidable for larger classes of one-way nondeterministic automata and grammar models, by reducing the problem to the decidability of boundedness for simpler classes of automata. One technique involves characterizing the models in terms of multi-tape automata. We give new characterizations of finite-turn Turing machines, finite-turn Turing machines augmented with various storage structures (like a pushdown, multiple reversal-bounded counters, partially-blind counters, etc.), and simple matrix grammars. The characterizations are then used to show that the boundedness problem for these models is decidable. Another technique uses the concept of the store language of an automaton. This is used to show that the boundedness problem is decidable for pushdown automata that can "flip" their pushdown a bounded number of times, and boundedness remains decidable even if we augment this device with additional stores.</description>

      <title>STLCCP: An Efficient Convex Optimization-based Framework for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is capable of expressing a broad range of temporal properties that controlled dynamical systems must satisfy. In the literature, both mixed-integer programming (MIP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) methods have been applied to solve optimal control problems with STL specifications. However, neither approach has succeeded in solving problems with complex long-horizon STL specifications within a realistic timeframe. This study proposes a new optimization framework, called \textit{STLCCP}, which explicitly incorporates several structures of STL to mitigate this issue. The core of our framework is a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, which converts the original program into a difference of convex (DC) programs. This program is then solved as a convex quadratic program sequentially, based on the convex-concave procedure (CCP). Our numerical experiments on several commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that this framework can effectively handle complex scenarios over long horizons, which have been challenging to address even using state-of-the-art optimization methods.</description>

      <title>A Completeness Theorem for Probabilistic Regular Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Probabilistic Regular Expressions (PRE), a probabilistic analogue of regular expressions denoting probabilistic languages in which every word is assigned a probability of being generated. We present and prove the completeness of an inference system for reasoning about probabilistic language equivalence of PRE based on Salomaa's axiomatisation of Kleene Algebra.</description>

      <title>The Treewidth Boundedness Problem for an Inductive Separation Logic of Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The treewidth boundedness problem for a logic asks for the existence of an upper bound on the treewidth of the models of a given formula in that logic. This problem is found to be undecidable for first order logic. We consider a generalization of Separation Logic over relational signatures, interpreted over standard relational structures, and describe an algorithm for the treewidth boundedness problem in the context of this logic.</description>
