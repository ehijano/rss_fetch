      <title>Three-Sign Cancellation Hypernumber Systems and Associator Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a three-sign cancellation hypernumber system $H$ which extends the real field by adjoining a third sign $\Lambda$. The underlying set is $H=\{0\}\cup\{+,-,\Lambda\}\times\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, with a single-valued multiplication and a hyperaddition $\boxplus$ designed to encode cancellation phenomena between positive and negative reals. The classical real line embeds as a genuine subfield $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{cl}}\subset H$, and all field operations agree with the usual ones on $\mathbb{R}$. The additive structure of $H$ is almost associative but not a canonical hypergroup. We give an explicit description of where associativity fails and compute, for triples of the form $(+,a),(-,b),(\Lambda,c)$, a closed formula for the associativity defect $\kappa(a,b,c)=2\min(a,b)=a+b-|a-b|$, which coincides with the loss of absolute value when adding $a$ and $-b$ in $\mathbb{R}$. To explain this behaviour, we construct an ambient ''cancellation monoid'' $(K,\oplus)$ on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ which is strictly associative and records both real sums and accumulated cancellation mass. We prove that $H$ cannot be recovered from $K$ by any simple projection, and formulate an ambient reconstruction problem. In addition, scalar multiplication by real numbers (defined via the embedded copy of $\mathbb{R}$) distributes over $\boxplus$, and the sign-layer admits a canonical hypergroup envelope governing the possible signs of hypersums. The results provide a controlled example of a nonassociative hyperaddition sitting over the real field and suggest several directions for multisign generalizations and connections with hyperfields and tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative rings with infinitely many maximal subrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21208v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rings with infinitely (only finitely) many maximal subrings. We prove that if $M$ is a maximal left/right ideal of a ring $T$ which is not an ideal of $T$, and $R$ is the idealizer of $M$, then $T$ has at least $|R/M|+1$ maximal left/right ideals which are not an ideal of $T$; in particular $T$ has at least $|R/M|+1$ distinct maximal subrings. Moreover, if $T$ is a $K$-algebra over an infinite field $K$, then either $T$ has infinitely many maximal subrings or $T$ is a quasi duo ring with certain algebraic properties similar to commutative rings. We prove that for a simple ring $R$, the ring $R\times R$ has only finitely many maximal subrings if and only if $R$ is finite. Also we study rings which are integral over their centers and have only finitely many maximal subrings. We prove that if $T$ is integral over its center and $T$ has more than $2^{\aleph_0}$ maximal (left/right) ideals, then $T$ has infinitely many maximal subrings. In particular, we see that if a $J$-semisimple ring $T$ is integral over its center and has only finitely many maximal subrings, then $T$ embeds in $S\times \prod_{i\in I}E_i$, where each $E_i$ is an absolutely algebraic field and $S$ is a finite semisimple ring. We see that if $T$ is a left Noetherian algebraic $K$-algebra over an infinite field $K$ and $T$ has only finitely many maximal subrings, then $T$ is a countable left Artinian ring which is integral over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, where $p=Char(K)$. We exactly determine when $T=\prod_{i\in I}\mathbb{M}_{n_i}(E_i)$, where each $E_i$ is a field and $n_i\in\mathbb{N}$, has only finitely many maximal subrings. We see that if $R$ is an infinite Artinian ring, then $\mathbb{M}_n(R)$, $n&gt;1$, and $R\times R$ have infinitely many maximal subrings.</description>

      <title>Classification and (Quasi)-Centroids of Four-Dimensional Ternary Leibniz Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a classification, up to isomorphism, of four-dimensional ternary Leibniz algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. For each non-abelian algebra in the classification, we explicitly determine its centroid and quasi-centroid and compute their dimensions. These results offer a comprehensive description of the internal symmetries of low-dimensional ternary Leibniz algebras and extend several classical results from the binary Leibniz setting to the ternary case.</description>

      <title>$\delta$-Leibniz algebras and related $\delta$-type algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and investigates the structure of $\delta$-Leibniz algebras, which serve as a parametric generalization of classical Leibniz algebras defined by a scalar $\delta$. The authors define $\delta$-Lie algebras, $\delta$-Lie dialgebras, and $\delta$-Zinbiel algebras via a standard procedure and study their fundamental properties. Furthermore, the research describes symmetric $\delta$-Leibniz algebras and algebras of $\delta$-biderivation type, establishing their connections with nilalgebras. Finally, these results provide a unified framework for understanding various classes of non-associative algebras through the lens of the $\delta$ parameter.</description>

      <title>Structured Linearizations of Structured Rational Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical computations involving rational matrices often benefit from preserving underlying matrix structures such as symmetry, Hermitian properties, or sparsity that reflect physical, geometric, or algebraic characteristics of the system. Maintaining such structures enhances stability, accuracy, and efficiency. Linearization, a technique that reformulates rational matrix problems as generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) of larger matrices, is widely used but does not automatically retain structure. In this chapter, we focus on structured linearizations, which preserve both the spectral information of the original rational matrix and its intrinsic structural properties. To achieve this, we present the construction of a family of linearizations called generalized Fiedler pencils with repetition (GFPR), which we prove to be valid linearizations for rational matrices. Moreover, we demonstrate that the GFPR family serves as a versatile framework for generating structured linearizations, specifically symmetric, skew-symmetric, T-even, and T-odd linearizations, provided the original rational matrix exhibits the corresponding structure. These structured linearizations facilitate the use of specialized, structure-preserving algorithms, reduce numerical errors, and yield physically meaningful solutions in application</description>

      <title>Ternary Idempotent $\Gamma$-Semirings, Non-Reducibility, and Higher-Order Path Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary idempotent semirings govern classical path algebras. Their multiplicative structure is dyadic. We examine whether this restriction is structural or accidental.
  We define ternary idempotent $\Gamma$-semirings as higher-arity ordered algebraic systems admitting associative ternary composition compatible with idempotent addition. We prove that such structures strictly extend classical semiring path algebras. In particular, we construct a ternary associative operation which cannot be represented as an iterated associative binary operation. This establishes non-reducibility.
  We formulate a higher-order path problem in directed graphs with weights in a ternary idempotent $\Gamma$-semiring. The associated relaxation operator is shown to be monotone on a complete lattice and to admit a least fixed point. Convergence follows under a finite acyclicity condition. The combinatorial growth of interaction windows yields a distinct complexity class relative to binary path schemes.
  These results indicate that dyadic semiring frameworks do not exhaust algebraic path formalisms. Higher-arity composition introduces structural phenomena absent in binary systems.</description>

      <title>Word equations and the exponent of periodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study word equations in free semigroups and the conjecture that the existence of infinitely many solutions entails the existence of solutions with arbitrarily large exponent of periodicity. We examine this question in the broader framework of word equations with regular constraints and establish new positive results: the conjecture holds for all quadratic word equations with constraints in finite semigroups from the variety $\mathbf{DLG}$ and its left-right dual $\mathbf{DRG}$, encompassing, in particular, all finite groups, commutative semigroups, and $\mathcal{J}$-trivial semigroups.</description>

Abstract: We study the space of non-degenerate traces on quantized Kleinian singularities of type A by studying their complement, the degenerate traces. In particular, we find the dimension of the space of twisted traces as a function of the corresponding automorphism and the quantization parameters, encoded in a polynomial $P$.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebras and relative Rota-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the bialgebra theory for coherent noncommutative pre-Poisson algebras and establish equivalences among matched pairs, Manin triples, the phase space of noncommutative Poisson algebras and noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebras. The investigation of coboundary noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebras naturally leads to the noncommutative pre-Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (NPP-YBE). We prove that a symmetric solution of the NPP-YBE gives rise to a (coboundary) noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebra. Moreover, we demonstrate how solutions without the symmetry condition can also generate such bialgebras. This motivates the introduction of quasi-triangular and factorizable noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebras.In particular, we show that a solution of the NPP-YBE with an invariant skew-symmetric part yields a quasi-triangular noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebra.Such solutions are further interpreted as relative Rota-Baxter operators with weights. Finally, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between quadratic Rota-Baxter noncommutative pre-Poisson algebras and factorizable noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebras.</description>

      <title>PI Artin--Schelter regular algebras of dimension 3 are unique factorization rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that all noetherian PI Artin--Schelter regular algebras of dimension $3$ are unique factorization rings. In a certain sense, this result is a noncommutative analogue to the fact that regular local rings of dimension 3 are UFDs. The fact constitutes a crucial component in the proof of the assertion that all regular local rings are UFDs, known as the Auslander--Buchsbaum theorem.</description>

      <title>$2$-representation infinite algebras from non-abelian subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3$. Part I: Extensions of abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G \leq \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group, acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. The resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is $3$-Calabi-Yau, and can sometimes be endowed with the structure of a $3$-preprojective algebra. However, not every such $R \ast G$ admits such a structure. The finite subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ are classified into types (A) to (L). We consider the groups $G$ of types (C) and (D) and determine for each such group whether the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective cut, that is a $3$-preprojective structure arising from a grading of the McKay quiver of $G$. We show that the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective cut if and only if $9 \mid |G|$. Our proof is constructive and yields a description of the involved $2$-representation infinite algebras. This is based on the semi-direct decomposition $G \simeq N \rtimes K$ for an abelian group $N$, and we show that the existence of a $3$-preprojective structure on $R \ast G$ is essentially determined by the existence of one on $R \ast N$. This provides new classes of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and we discuss some $2$-Auslander-Platzeck-Reiten tilts. Along the way, we give a detailed description of the involved groups and their McKay quivers by iteratively applying skew-group constructions.</description>
