      <title>Density effects on the interferometry of Efimov states by modulating magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical association of Efimov trimers in thermal gases by means of modulated magnetic fields has proven very fruitful in determining the binding energy of trimers. The latter was extracted from the number of remaining atoms, which featured oscillatory fringes stemming from the superposition of trimers with atom-dimers. Subsequent theoretical investigations utilizing the time-dependent three-body problem revealed additional association mechanisms, manifested as superpositions of the Efimov state with the trap states and the latter with atom-dimers. The three atoms were initialized in a way to emulate a thermal gas with uniform density. Here, this analysis is extended by taking into account the effects of the density profile of a semi-classical thermal gas. The supersposition of the Efimov trimer with the first atom-dimer remains the same, while the frequencies of highly oscillatory fringes shift to lower values. The latter refer to the frequencies of trimers and atom-dimers in free space since the density profile smears out the contribution of trap states.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced dissipative quantum phase transition in a head-to-tail atomic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dissipative phase transition in a head-to-tail Bose Josephson junction. The quantum phase transition has the same origin as the one in a resistively shunted Josephson junction, but the intrinsic momentum coupling between the Josephson mode and the bath modes enables us to observe the dissipative phase transition without any synthetic dissipation. We show that the inter-atomic interaction strength plays the role of the damping parameter. Consequently, in contrast to a resistively shunted Josephson circuit, the Bose Josephson junction can exhibit an insulating phase in a wider parameter region by increasing the repulsive interaction strength, which is robust against nonperturbative effects. We argue that tight transverse confinement of the quasi-one-dimensional atomic gas allows us to reach the insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Droplets of Bosons at a Narrow Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider bosons interacting through a narrow $s$-wave resonance. Such a resonance is characterized by an infinite scattering length and a large and negative effective range $r_0$. We argue that any number $N\ge3$ of bosons can form a self-bound cluster with the binding energy per particle increasing as $N^2$ for $1\ll N\ll (-r_0/a_\text{bg})^{1/2}$, where $a_\text{bg}$ is the background scattering length (between atoms and molecules). In the opposite limit $N\gg (-r_0/a_\text{bg})^{1/2}$, bosons form droplets with binding energy per particle saturating to a constant value independent of the particle number. The stability of clusters and droplets when the interaction is detuned from the resonance is also studied.</description>

      <title>Exploring pulsar glitches with dipolar supersolids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glitches are sudden spin-up events that interrupt the gradual spin-down of rotating neutron stars. They are believed to arise from the rapid unpinning of vortices in the neutron star inner crust. The analogy between the inner crust of neutron stars and dipolar supersolids allows to investigate glitches. Employing such analogy, we numerically analyze the vortex trapping mechanism and how the matter density distribution influences glitches. These results pave the way for the quantum simulation of celestial bodies in laboratories.</description>

      <title>Open quantum dynamics with variational non-Gaussian states and the truncated Wigner approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for simulating the open dynamics of spin-boson systems by combing variational non-Gaussian states with a quantum trajectories approach. We apply this method to a generic spin-boson Hamiltonian that has both Tavis-Cummings and Holstein type couplings, and which has broad applications to a variety of quantum simulation platforms, polaritonic physics, and quantum chemistry. Additionally, we discuss how the recently developed truncated Wigner approximation for open quantum systems can be applied to the same Hamiltonian. We benchmark the performance of both methods and identify the regimes where each method is best suited to. Finally we discuss strategies to improve each technique.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumping in a driven-dissipative Kerr resonator array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thouless pumping is an emblematic manifestation of topology in physics, referring to the ability to induce a quantized transport of charge across a system by simply varying one of its parameters periodically in time. The original concept of Thouless pumping involves a non-interacting system, and has been implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to extend this concept to interacting systems. In this article, we propose a Thouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of coupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the system, we modulate in space and time the onsite Kerr interaction energies, and generate 1+1-dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of excitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within the Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band experience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the bands Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band inversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition. Our numerical simulations are performed using realistic parameters inspired from exciton polaritons, which form a platform of choice for investigating driven topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter \cite{altman2023quantum}, fundamental high-energy processes \cite{bauer2023highenergy}, quantum metrology \cite{degen2017sensing, li2023scrambling}, and quantum algorithms \cite{ebadi2022quantum}. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains~\cite{Samajdar2024}. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode \cite{pekker2015amplitude}. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Supersolid Order via Vortex Trajectory Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of experimentally investigating the inherently dual properties of a supersolid, a simultaneous superfluid and solid, has become more critical following the recent experimental evidence for supersolids in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of $^{164}\text{Dy}$. We introduce a supersolid order parameter that uses vortex-vortex trajectory correlations to simultaneously reveal the periodic density of the underlying solid and superfluidity in a single measure. We propose experiments using existing technology to optically create and image trajectories of vortex dipoles in dipolar BECs. We numerically test our observable and find that vortex-vortex correlations reveal the supersolid lattice structure while distinguishing it from superfluidity. Our method sets the stage for experiments to use vortex trajectory correlations to investigate fundamental properties of supersolids arising from their dynamics and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Thermal masses and trapped-ion quantum spin models: a self-consistent approach to Yukawa-type interactions in the $\lambda\!\phi^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum simulation of magnetism in trapped-ion systems makes use of the crystal vibrations to mediate pairwise interactions between spins, which are encoded in the internal electronic states of the ions, and measured in experiments that probe the real-time dynamics. These interactions can be accounted for by a long-wavelength relativistic theory, where the phonons are described by a coarse-grained Klein-Gordon field $\phi(x)$ locally coupled to the spins that acts as a carrier, leading to an analogue of pion-mediated Yukawa interactions. In the vicinity of a structural transition of the ion crystal, one must go beyond the Klein-Gordon fields, and include additional $\lambda\phi^4$ terms responsible for phonon-phonon scattering. This leads to quantum effects that can be expressed by Feynman loop integrals that modify the range of the Yukawa-type spin interactions; an effect that could be used to probe the underlying fixed point of this quantum field theory (QFT). Unfortunately, the rigidity of the trapped-ion crystal makes it challenging to observe genuine quantum effects, such as the flow of the critical point with the quartic coupling $\lambda$. We hereby show that thermal effects, which can be controlled by laser cooling, can unveil this flow through the appearance of thermal masses in interacting QFTs. We perform self-consistent calculations that resum certain Feynman diagrams and, additionally, go beyond mean-field theory to predict how measurements on the trapped-ion spin system can probe key properties of the $\lambda\phi^4$ QFT.</description>
