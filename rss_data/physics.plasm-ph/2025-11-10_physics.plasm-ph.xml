      <title>Gigagauss magnetic fields generated via theta-pinching driven by multiple petawatt-class lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely high axial magnetic fields above the gigagauss (GG) level are supposed to exist in neutron stars, which may be a one of the critical parameters for their internal structures and be responsible for the X and gamma-ray emission from these stars. Here we show that such ultrahigh magnetic fields can be produced by multiple petawatt-class lasers interacting with a cuboid solid target with a cylindrical microtube in the middle. It is found that the obliquely incident intense lasers at the target surfaces enable the produced hot electrons to form an azimuthal current and subsequently induce a seed magnetic field along the cylindrical axis inside the microtube as the hot electrons transport into it. This current-field configuration is similar to a theta-pinch device. When the hot electrons and energetic ions produced via target normal sheath acceleration converge towards the microtube axis, the seed magnetic field is dramatically amplified. This process continues until the magnetic pressure near the axis becomes comparable to the thermal pressure contributed both by hot electrons and energetic ions. Later on, as the plasma in the center start to be expelled outward by the magnetic pressure, an electron current ring with extremely high densities is formed, leading to a further boost of the magnetic fields to well above the GG-level. A scaling of the magnetic field strength with laser intensities, pulse durations, incident angles, and target sizes is presented and verified by numerical simulations, which demonstrates the robustness of our scheme. Our scheme is well suited for experimental realization on 100 terawatt-class to petawatt-class femtosecond or picosecond laser facilities with multiple linearly polarized laser beams.</description>

      <title>Secondary small-scale dynamics of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable solar prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quiescent solar prominences show distinct small-scale dynamics in observations. Their internal density contrasts with the surrounding corona make them susceptible to Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities, leading to vertically structured prominence morphologies when observed at the solar limb. As a result, prominences develop bubbles and plumes, along with secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) roll-ups along their edges. Recent observations also suggest magnetic reconnection events within the RT-driven turbulent flows. We perform high-resolution 2.5D resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code, reaching a spatial resolution of $\sim 11.7$ km in a 2D domain of size 30 Mm$\times$30 Mm and evolving the system for approximately 10 minutes of solar time. A dense, magnetic pressure supported prominence serves as the initial state, which becomes unstable at the prominence-corona interface. The resulting interaction between RT and KH instabilities leads to the formation of current sheets and localized reconnection events. The reconnection-driven outflows form energetic jets that enhance energy transport and dissipation across the prominence. We analyze our high-resolution prominence simulation using synthetic images of the broadband SDO/AIA 094, 171, and 193 \r{A} and narrowband H$\alpha$ filters, to compare the developing fine-scale structures with their observational counterparts. Most secondary instabilities emerge in the hotter coronal regions surrounding the cooler prominence core. While our simulated features match observed scales, speeds, and duration, the simulated activity remains concentrated in hot, surrounding coronal plasma rather then the cool prominence material, implying that key physical ingredients may be missing. Future 3D studies in more realistic magnetic configurations are required to address these limitations.</description>

      <title>A dual grid geometric electromagnetic particle in cell method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric particle-in-cell discretizations have been derived based on a discretization of the fields that is conforming with the de Rham structure of the Maxwell's equation and a standard particle-in-cell ansatz for the fields by deriving the equations of motion from a discrete action principle. While earlier work has focused on finite element discretization of the fields based on the theory of Finite Element Exterior Calculus, we propose in this article an alternative formulation of the field equations that is based on the ideas conveyed by mimetic finite differences. The needed duality being expressed by the use of staggered grids. We construct a finite difference formulation based on degrees of freedom defined as point values, edge, face and volume integrals on a primal and its dual grid. Compared to the finite element formulation no mass matrix inversion is involved in the formulation of the Maxwell solver. In numerical experiments, we verify the conservation properties of the novel method and study the influence of the various parameters in the discretization.</description>

      <title>Vorticity Packing Effects on Long Time Turbulent Transport in Decaying Two-Dimensional Incompressible Navier-Stokes Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution, high-Reynolds-number simulations have shown that the initial total circulation, quantified by the vorticity packing fraction (VPF), strongly influences the late-time Eulerian statistical equilibria of decaying incom- pressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence (Biswas et al., 2022, Physics of Fluids 34, 065101), revealing a transition from point-vortex--dominated to finite-size (patch-vortex) equilibria with increasing vortex packing, and emphasizing the role of of the classical exclusion principle (i.e., incompressibility) and total circulation in determining the final statistical states. The present study examines how the associated Lagrangian tracer transport evolves with VPF across the early (linear-nonlinear turbulence onset), intermediate (turbulence development), and late (coherent dipole evolution) stages, and how it correlates with the corresponding Eulerian states. Turbulence, triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and sustained by inverse energy cascades, forms large-scale coherent vortices that govern long-time transport. Tracer dynamics, analyzed via mean-square displacement and position-velocity probability distri- bution functions (PDFs), reveal that increasing VPF accelerates turbulence onset, drives a transition from sub- to super- diffusive transport with decreasing anisotropy in the intermediate stage, and determines late-time behavior dominated by either orbital coherent vortex trapping (sub-diffusive) or linear translational dipole motion (super-diffusive). These dis- tinct long-time transport characteristics, evolving from sub- to super-diffusive behavior with increasing vorticity pack- ing, demonstrate a strong correspondence between the transition from point-vortex- to finite-size-vortex-dominated Eulerian equilibria and the underlying Lagrangian transport in decaying incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence.</description>
