      <title>Assessing Dynamic Connectedness in Global Supply Chain Infrastructure Portfolios: The Impact of Risk Factors and Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyses the risk factors around investing in global supply chain infrastructure: the energy market, investor sentiment, and global shipping costs. It presents portfolio strategies associated with dynamic risks. A time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) model is used to study the spillover and interconnectedness of the risk factors for global supply chain infrastructure portfolios from January 5th, 2010, to June 29th, 2023, which are associated with a set of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) indexes. The effects of extreme events on risk spillovers and investment strategy are calculated and compared before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. The results of this study demonstrate that risk shocks influence the dynamic connectedness between global supply chain infrastructure portfolios and three risk factors and show the effects of extreme events on risk spillovers and investment outcomes. Portfolios with higher ESG scores exhibit stronger dynamic connectedness with other portfolios and factors. Net total directional connectedness indicates that West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Baltic Exchange Dry Index (BDI), and investor sentiment volatility index (VIX) consistently are net receivers of spillover shocks. A portfolio with a ticker GLFOX appears to be a time-varying net receiver and giver. The pairwise connectedness shows that WTI and VIX are mostly net receivers. Portfolios with tickers CSUAX, GII, and FGIAX are mostly net givers of spillover shocks. The COVID-19 outbreak changed the structure of dynamic connectedness on portfolios. The mean value of HR and HE indicates that the weights of long/short positions in investment strategy after the COVID-19 outbreak have undergone structural changes compared to the period before. The hedging ability of global supply chain infrastructure investment portfolios with higher ESG scores is superior.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Trend: How to Avoid Cherry-Picked Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our empirical results, illustrated in Fig.5, show an impressive fit with the pretty complex theoretical Sharpe formula of a Trend following strategy depending on the parameter of the signal, which was derived by Grebenkov and Serror (2014). That empirical fit convinces us that a mean-reversion process with only one time scale is enough to model, in a pretty precise way, the reality of the trend-following mechanism at the average scale of CTAs and as a consequence, using only one simple EMA, appears optimal to capture the trend. As a consequence, using a complex basket of different complex indicators as signal, do not seem to be so rational or optimal and exposes to the risk of cherry-picking.</description>

      <title>F&amp;O Expiry vs. First-Day SIPs: A 22-Year Analysis of Timing Advantages in India's Nifty 50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are a primary vehicle for retail equity participation in India, yet the impact of their intra-month timing remains underexplored. This study offers a 22-year (2003--2024) comparative analysis of SIP performance in the Nifty 50 index, contrasting the conventional first-trading-day (FTD-SIP) strategy with an alternative aligned to monthly Futures and Options expiry days (EXP-SIP). Using a multi-layered statistical framework -- including non-parametric tests, effect size metrics, and stochastic dominance -- we uncover two key findings. First, EXP-SIPs outperform FTD-SIPs by 0.5--2.5\% annually over short-to-medium-term horizons (1--5 years), with Second-Order Stochastic Dominance (SSD) confirming the EXP-SIP as the preferred choice for all risk-averse investors. Second, we establish boundary conditions for this advantage, showing it decays and becomes economically negligible over longer horizons (10--20 years), where compounding and participation dominate. Additionally, the study challenges the prevalent ``12\% return'' narrative in Indian equity markets, finding that the 20-year pre-tax CAGR for Nifty 50 SIPs is closer to 6.7\%. These findings carry significant implications for investor welfare, financial product design, and transparency in return reporting.</description>
