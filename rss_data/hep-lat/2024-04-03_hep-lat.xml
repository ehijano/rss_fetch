      <title>Kaon mixing beyond the standard model with physical masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present non-perturbative results for beyond the standard model kaon mixing matrix elements in the isospin symmetric limit ($m_u=m_d$) of QCD, including a complete estimate of all dominant sources of systematic error. Our results are obtained from numerical simulations of lattice QCD with $N_f = 2+1$ flavours of dynamical domain wall fermions. For the first time, these quantities are simulated directly at the physical pion mass $m_\pi$~$\sim$~$139\,\mathrm{MeV}$ for two different lattice spacings. We include data at three lattice spacings in the range $a = 0.11 $ - $ 0.07\,\mathrm{fm}$ and with pion masses ranging from the physical value up to 450$\,\mathrm{MeV}$. Compared to our earlier work, we have added both direct calculations at physical quark masses and a third lattice spacing making the removal of discretisation effects significantly more precise and eliminating the need for any significant mass extrapolation beyond the range of simulated data. We renormalise the lattice operators non-perturbatively using RI-SMOM off-shell schemes. These schemes eliminate the need to model and subtract non-perturbative pion poles that arises in the RI-MOM scheme and, since the calculations are performed with domain wall fermions, the unphysical mixing between chirality sectors is suppressed. Our results for the bag parameters in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme at $3\,\mathrm{GeV}$ are $B_K~\equiv~\mathcal{B}_1 = 0.5240(17)(54)$, $\mathcal{B}_2 = 0.4794(25)(35)$, $\mathcal{B}_3 = 0.746(13)(17)$, $\mathcal{B}_4 = 0.897(02)(10)$ and $\mathcal{B}_5 = 0.6882(78)(94)$, where the first error is from lattice uncertainties and the second is the uncertainty due to the perturbative matching to $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$.</description>

      <title>Precise Omega baryons from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we determine the masses of $I(J^P)=0\left(3/2^+\right)$ and $0\left(3/2^-\right)$ $\Omega$-baryon ground states using lattice QCD. We utilise Wilson-clover ensembles with $2+1$ dynamical quark flavours generated by the CLS consortium along a trajectory with a constant trace of the quark-mass matrix. We show that N$^3$LO $\text{SU}(3)_f$ chiral perturbation theory expressions describe the ground-state masses with positive-parity well, and we use them to set the lattice scale. Methodologically, our combination of gauge-fixed wall sources and the generalized Pencil of Functions allows for high-precision determinations of the lattice spacing at a relative error of around $0.3\%$ with controlled excited-state contamination. The fit we perform allows for the continuum value of $t_0$ to vary, thereby determining this quantity with a comparable level of precision to that of the lattice scale. Using the resulting scales our measurement of the negative-parity $\Omega^{3/2^{-}}$ state is found to be consistent with the recently-discovered $\Omega(2012)^-$, which can therefore be assigned the quantum numbers $I(J^P)=0\left(3/2^-\right)$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formulation of vacuum energy density in flat spacetime and potential implications for the cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a thermodynamical definition of the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$, defined as $\langle 0| T_{\mu\nu} |0\rangle = - \rho_{\rm vac} \, g_{\mu\nu}$, in quantum field theory in flat Minkowski space in $D$ spacetime dimensions, which can be computed in the limit of high temperature, namely in the limit $\beta = 1/T \to 0$. It takes the form $\rho_{\rm vac} = {\rm const} \cdot m^D$ where $m$ is a fundamental mass scale and ${\rm "const"}$ is a computable constant which can be positive or negative. Due to modular invariance $\rho_{\rm vac}$ can also be computed in a different non-thermodynamic channel where one spatial dimension is compactifed on a circle of circumference $\beta$ and we confirm this modularity for free massive theories for both bosons and fermions for $D=2,3,4$. We list various properties of $\rho_{\rm vac}$ that are generally required, for instance $\rho_{\rm vac}=0$ for conformal field theories, and others, such as the constraint that $\rho_{\rm vac}$ has opposite signs for free bosons verses fermions of the same mass, which is related to constraints from supersymmetry. Using the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz we compute $\rho_{\rm vac}$ exactly for 2 classes of integrable QFT's in $2D$ and interpreting some previously known results. We apply our definition of $\rho_{\rm vac}$ to Lattice QCD data with two light quarks (up and down) and one additional massive flavor (the strange quark), and find it is negative, $\rho_{\rm vac} \approx - ( 200 \, {\rm MeV} )^4$. Finally we make some remarks on the Cosmological Constant Problem since $\rho_{\rm vac}$ is central to any discussion of it.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.</description>

      <title>SIMULATeQCD: A simple multi-GPU lattice code for QCD calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of exascale supercomputers has fueled competition among GPU vendors, driving lattice QCD developers to write code that supports multiple APIs. Moreover, new developments in algorithms and physics research require frequent updates to existing software. These challenges have to be balanced against constantly changing personnel. At the same time, there is a wide range of applications for HISQ fermions in QCD studies. This situation encourages the development of software featuring a HISQ action that is flexible, high-performing, open source, easy to use, and easy to adapt. In this technical paper, we explain the design strategy, provide implementation details, list available algorithms and modules, and show key performance indicators for SIMULATeQCD, a simple multi-GPU lattice code for large-scale QCD calculations, mainly developed and used by the HotQCD collaboration. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>
