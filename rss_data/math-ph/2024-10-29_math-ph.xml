      <title>Lattice models from CFT on surfaces with holes II: Cloaking boundary conditions and loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue to investigate the lattice models obtained from 2d CFTs via the construction introduced in [arXiv:2112.01563]. On the side of the 2d CFT we consider the cloaking boundary condition relative to a fixed fusion category F of topological line defects. The resulting lattice model realises the topological symmetry F exactly. We compute the state spaces and Boltzmann weights of these lattice model in the example of unitary Virasoro minimal models. We work directly with amplitudes, rather than with normalised correlators, and we provide a careful treatment of the Weyl anomaly factor in terms of the Liouville action.
  We numerically evaluate the Ising CFT on the torus with one hole and cloaking boundary condition in two channels, and illustrate in this example that the anomaly factors are essential to obtain matching results for the amplitudes. We show that lattice models obtained from Virasoro minimal models at lowest non-trivial cutoff can be exactly mapped to loop models. This provides a first non-trivial check that our lattice models can contain the 2d CFT they were constructed from in their phase diagram, and we propose a condition on the cloaking boundary condition for F under which we expect this to happen in general.</description>

      <title>Construction and analysis of multi-lump solutions of dispersive long wave equations via integer partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the relation between the integer partition theory and a kind of rational solution of the dispersion long wave equations is studied. For the integer partition {\lambda}= ({\lambda}1,{\lambda}2,... ,{\lambda}n) of positive integer N, with the degree vector m = (m1,m2,... ,mn), the corresponding M lump solution can be obtained where M = N + n mn. Combined with the generalized Schur polynomial and heat polynomial, the asymptotic positions of peaks are studied, and the arrangement of multi-peak groups in multi-lump solutions are obtained, as well as the relationship between the patterns formed by single-peak groups and the corresponding integer partition.</description>

      <title>Generalized and new solutions of the NRT nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present new solutions of the non-linear Schr\"oodinger equation proposed by Nobre, Rego-Monteiro and Tsallis for the free particle, obtained from different Lie symmetry reductions. Analytical expressions for the wave function, the auxiliary field and the probability density are derived using a variety of approaches. Solutions involving elliptic functions, Bessel and modified Bessel functions, as well as the inverse error function are found, amongst others. On the other hand, a closed-form expression for the general solution of the traveling wave ansatz (see Bountis and Nobre) is obtained for any real value of the nonlinearity index. This is achieved through the use of the so-called generalized trigonometric functions as defined by Lindqvist and Dr\'abek, the utility of which in analyzing the equation under study is highlighted throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>Skew-Hom-Lie algebras in Semi-Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, first we introduce the notion of a skew-Hom-Lie algebra and give some examples. Then we study their representations and give the coboundary operator of skew-Hom-Lie algebras. As an application, there have a skew-Hom-Lie algebra $(R^4_2,[\cdot,\cdot]_\theta,P)$ in semi-Euclidean spaces. For the null space of Semi-Euclidean spaces, there have a subset $V^*$ of the null space, and $V^*$ is invariant under the actions of $[\cdot,\cdot]_\theta$ and $P$.</description>

      <title>Spectra and pseudospectra in the evaluation of material stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vectorvalued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the phase field. In the presence of non-normality, the spectral analysis of such a matrix when (unknown or uncertain or time-dependent) constitutive parameters vary is generically not decisive to evaluate the material stability. We thus need to look at the pseudospectrum, that is, the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in an {\epsilon}-neighborhood of the matrix of interest. As a case study, we look at quasicrystals and evaluate through spectra and pseudospectra the influence of a microstructural self-action on the material stability. This approach allows us to reliably determine thresholds where stable-unstable transitions in the material behavior occur.</description>

      <title>Contributions to the Algorithmic Foundations of Approximate Lie Symmetry Algebras of Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lie symmetry transformations that leave a differential equation invariant play a fundamental role in science and mathematics. Such Lie symmetry groups uniquely determine their Lie symmetry algebras. Exact differential elimination algorithms have been developed to determine the dimension and structure constants of the Lie symmetry algebra of an exact polynomially nonlinear differential equation. Directly applying these symbolic algorithms to approximate models is prone to instability since these algorithms strongly depend on the orderings of the variables involved. This motivates the need to address questions at the algorithmic foundation of approximate Lie symmetry algebras of differential equations. How do we define approximate Lie symmetry? How do we compute and apply approximate Lie symmetry algebras of differential equations? How reliable are the results?
  To address such questions, we define approximate Lie symmetry algebras in terms of exact Lie symmetry algebras of a nearby differential equation. Our algorithm for identifying these hidden approximate Lie symmetry algebras uses the SVD to find nearby rank-deficient systems combined with approximate geometric involutive forms of the approximate symmetry-defining systems. Our approach is local and depends on an input base point in the space of independent and dependent variables. In general, our local approach can yield many different nearby Lie symmetry algebras. We also outline a numerical approach to determining the approximate isomorphic of such Lie symmetry algebras as the local base point varies across a grid in the base space. We also provide a method for evaluating the reliability of our results. This enables the base space to be partitioned into regions where different local Lie symmetry algebras are admitted, separated by unstable transition regions.</description>

      <title>Complex symmetric, self-dual, and Ginibre random matrices: Analytical results for three classes of bulk and edge statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a conjecture about the local bulk statistics of complex eigenvalues has been made based on numerics. It claims that there are only three universality classes, which have all been observed in open chaotic quantum systems. Motivated by these new insights, we compute and compare the expectation values of $k$ pairs of complex conjugate characteristic polynomials in three ensembles of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices representative for the three classes: the well-known complex Ginibre ensemble, complex symmetric and complex self-dual matrices. In the Cartan classification scheme of non-Hermitian random matrices they are labelled as class A, AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$, respectively. Using the technique of Grassmann variables, we derive explicit expressions for a single pair of expected characteristic polynomials for finite as well as infinite matrix dimension. For the latter we consider the global limit as well as zoom into the edge and the bulk of the spectrum, providing new analytical results for classes AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$. For general $k$, we derive the effective Lagrangians corresponding to the non-linear $\sigma$-models in the respective physical systems. Interestingly, they agree for all three ensembles, while the corresponding Goldstone manifolds, over which one has to perform the remaining integrations, are different and equal the three classical compact groups in the bulk. In particular, our analytical results show that these three ensembles have indeed different local bulk and edge spectral statistics, corroborating the conjecture further.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear subwavelength resonances in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the resonance problem for the cubic nonlinear Helmholtz equation in the subwavelength regime. We derive a discrete model for approximating the subwavelength resonances of finite systems of high-contrast resonators with Kerr-type nonlinearities. Our discrete formulation is valid in both weak and strong nonlinear regimes. Compared to the linear formulation, it characterizes the soliton-like extra eigenmodes that have recently been experimentally observed.</description>

      <title>Vortex Formation and Dissipation in Chaotic Flows: A Hypercomplex Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the formation and dissipation of vortices within chaotic fluid flows, leveraging the framework of Sobolev and Besov spaces on Riemannian manifolds. Building upon the Navier-Stokes equations, we introduce a hypercomplex bifurcation approach to characterize the regularity and critical thresholds at which vortices emerge and dissipate in chaotic settings. We explore the role of differential geometry and bifurcation theory in vortex dynamics, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding these phenomena. Our approach addresses spectral decomposition, asymptotic stability, and dissipation thresholds, offering critical insights into the mechanisms of vortex formation and dissipation. Additionally, we introduce two new theorems that further elucidate the role of geometric stability and bifurcations in vortex dynamics. The first theorem demonstrates the geometric stability of vortices on manifolds with positive Ricci curvature, while the second theorem analyzes the bifurcation points that lead to the formation or dissipation of vortex structures. This research contributes to the existing literature by providing a more complete mathematical picture of the underlying mechanisms of vortex dynamics in turbulent fluid flows.</description>

Abstract: The Schur product of two complex m x n matrices is their entry wise product. We show that an extremal element X in the convex set of m x n complex matrices of Schur multiplier norm at most 1 satisfies the inequality rank(X) =&lt; (m +n)^(1/2) . For positive n x n matrices with unit diagonal, we give a characterization of the extremal elements, and show that such a matrix satisfies rank(X) =&lt; n^(1/2).</description>

      <title>Fidelity preserving and decoherence for mixed unitary quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishable and non-distinguishable quantum states are fundamental resources in quantum mechanics and quantum technologies. Interactions with the environment often induce decoherence, impacting both the distinguishability and non-distinguishability between quantum states. In this paper, we investigate mixed unitary quantum channels and the conditions under which fidelity, a measure of quantum state closeness, is preserved. More precisely, for quantum channels in the form $\Phi(\rho) = \sum_{i=1}^N p_i U_i \rho U_i^*$, we analyze their effect on quantum state $|\varphi\rangle$ through the associated purification $|\Psi\rangle$, explore the structure of such quantum channels that preserve either distinguishable or non-distinguishable states and then discuss the challenges of maintaining fidelity, particularly under the influence of phase damping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study canonical systems that are reflectionless on an open set. In this situation, the two half line $m$ functions are holomorphic continuations of each other and may thus be combined into a single holomorphic function. This idea was explored in [11], and we continue these investigations here. We focus on Dirac operators and especially their interplay with canonical systems, and we provide a more general and abstract framework.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter equations define quantum integrable models. The tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. Finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. In this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. We call it lifting. By starting from a solution of Yang-Baxter equations we can construct [lift] a solution of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. We then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. This process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. We show that braided Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using Majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. As a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on Majorana fermions. Furthermore we show that operators constructed using Dirac (complex) fermions satisfy these constraints as well.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically exact formulas for the stripe domains period in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with out-of-plane anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive asymptotically exact formulas for the equilibrium magnetic stripe period in ultrathin films with out-of-plane anisotropy that include the full domain wall magnetic dipolar energy. Starting with the reduced two-dimensional micromagnetic model valid for thin films, we obtain the leading order approximation for the energy per unit volume in the vanishing film thickness limit in the case of Bloch and N\'eel wall rotations. Its minimization in the stripe period leads to an analytical expression for the equilibrium period with a prefactor proportional to the Bloch wall width. The constant in the prefactor, related to the long-range dipolar interactions, is carefully evaluated. This results in a remarkable agreement of the stripe domain energy density and stripe period predicted by our analytical formulas with micromagnetic simulations. Our formula can be used to accurately deduce magnetic parameters from the experimental measurements of the stripe period and to systematically predict the equilibrium stripe periods in ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the Laplace Operator in Heat Flows of Harmonic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20419v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate estimates about the Laplace operator in heat flows of harmonic maps, focusing outside the singularities through spherical coordinates. These estimates can be used in the general Ericksen--Leslie system to obtain higher-order estimates. We consider the problem subject to the $\mathbb{T}^2$ and $\mathbb{T}^3$ boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Peaked Stokes waves as solutions of Babenko's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Babenko's equation describes traveling water waves in holomorphic coordinates. It has been used in the past to obtain properties of Stokes waves with smooth profiles analytically and numerically. We show in the deep-water limit that properties of Stokes waves with peaked profiles can also be recovered from the same Babenko's equation. In order to develop the local analysis of singularities, we rewrite Babenko's equation as a fixed-point problem near the maximal elevation level. As a by-product, our results rule out a corner point singularity in the holomorphic coordinates, which has been obtained in a local version of Babenko's equation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical random field Ising model at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of the zero-temperature random field Ising model as the mean of the external field $M$ increases from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. We focus on two types of evolutions: the ground state evolution and the Glauber evolution. For the ground state evolution, we investigate the occurrence of global avalanche, a moment where a large fraction of spins flip simultaneously from minus to plus. In two dimensions, no global avalanche occurs, while in three or higher dimensions, there is a phase transition: a global avalanche happens when the noise intensity is small, but not when it is large. Additionally, we study the zero-temperature Glauber evolution, where spins are updated locally to minimize the Hamiltonian. Our results show that for small noise intensity, in dimensions $d =2$ or $3$, most spins flip around a critical time $c_d = \frac{2 \sqrt{d}}{1 + \sqrt{d}}$ (but we cannot decide whether such flipping occurs simultaneously or not). We also connect this process to polluted bootstrap percolation and solve an open problem on it.</description>

Abstract: We consider a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary and a metric that is singular at the boundary. The associated Laplace-Beltrami operator is of the form of a Grushin operator plus a singular potential. In a supercritical parameter regime, we identify the rate of concentration and profile of the high-frequency eigenfunctions that accumulate at the boundary. We give an application to acoustic modes on gas planets.</description>

      <title>Critical Droplets and Replica Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the notion of critical droplets is central to an understanding of the nature of ground states in the Edwards-Anderson Ising model of a spin glass in arbitrary dimension. Given a specific ground state, suppose the coupling value for a given edge is varied with all other couplings held fixed. Beyond some specific value of the coupling, a droplet will flip leading to a new ground state; we refer to this as the critical droplet for that edge and ground state. We show that the distribution of sizes and energies over all edges for a specific ground state can be used to determine which of the leading scenarios for the spin glass phase is correct. In particular, the existence of low-energy interfaces between incongruent ground states as predicted by replica symmetry breaking is equivalent to the presence of critical droplets whose boundaries comprise a positive fraction of edges in the infinite lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of projection families generalizes the classical notions of vector and operator-valued measures. We show that projection families are general enough to extend the Spectral Theorem to Banach algebras and operators between Banach spaces. To this end, we first develop a Smooth Functional Calculus in Banach algebras using the Cauchy-Pompeiu Formula, which is further extended to a Continuous Functional Calculus. We also show that these theorems are proper generalizations of the usual result for operators between Hilbert spaces.</description>

Abstract: An infinite number of solvable Hamiltonians, including the transverse Ising chain, the XY chain with an external field, the cluster model with the next-nearest-neighbor x-x interactions, or with the next-nearest-neighbor z-z interactions, and other series of solvable models that can be mapped to the free fermion system are considered. All the conserved charges of these models written by the string-type products of the interactions are obtained. In the case of the transverse Ising chain, all the known charges are rederived, and in the case of the other models, new conserved charges are obtained.</description>

      <title>A large deviation principle for the multispecies stirring process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the multispecies stirring process on the discrete torus. We prove a large deviation principle for the trajectory of the vector of densities of the different species. The technique of proof consists in extending the method of the foundational paper [1] based on the superexponential estimate to the multispecies setting. This requires a careful choice of the corresponding weakly asymmetric dynamics, which is parametrized by fields depending on the various species. We also prove the hydrodynamic limit of this weakly asymmetric dynamics, which is similar to but different from the ABC model in [2]. Using the appropriate asymmetric dynamics, we also obtain that the mobility matrix relating the drift currents to the fields coincides with the covariance matrix of the reversible multinomial distribution, which then further leads to the Einstein relation</description>

      <title>Gibbs principle with infinitely many constraints: optimality conditions and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Gibbs conditioning principle to an abstract setting combining infinitely many linear equality constraints and non-linear inequality constraints, which need not be convex. A conditional large large deviation principle (LDP) is proved in a Wassersteintype topology, and optimality conditions are written in this abstract setting. This setting encompasses versions of the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem with marginal non-linear inequality constraints at every time. In the case of convex constraints, stability results for perturbations both in the constraints and the reference measure are proved. We then specify our results when the reference measure is the path-law of a continuous diffusion process, whose law is constrained at each time. We obtain a complete description of the constrained process through an atypical mean-field PDE system involving a Lagrange multiplier.</description>

      <title>Kinetic dynamics of neutral spin particles in a spacetime with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A kinetic model for the dynamics of collisionless spin neutral particles in a spacetime with torsion is proposed. The fundamental matter field is the kinetic density $f(x,u,s)$ of particles with four-velocity $u$ and four-spin $s$. The stress-energy tensor and the spin current of the particles distribution are defined as suitable integral moments of $f$ in the $(u,s)$ variables. By requiring compatibility with the contracted Bianchi identity in Einstein-Cartan theory, we derive a transport equation on the kinetic density $f$ that generalizes the well-known Vlasov equation for spinless particles. The total number of particles in the new model is not conserved. To restore this important property we assume the existence in spacetime of a second species of particles with the same mass and spin magnitude. The Vlasov equation on the kinetic density $\overline{f}$ of the new particles is derived by requiring that the sum of total numbers of particles of the two species should be conserved.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we provide a short review (written in Chinese) on the Bethe/Gauge correspondence. We first explain the basic idea in an explicit example of the correspondence between XXX spin chains and 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauge theories. The connection between 4d and 2d will then be explored by comparing the instanton and vortex partition functions. We conclude this article by briefly mentioning the similarity in the integrability structure of 4d gauge theories and 2d ones from an algebraic aspect, and a potential relation between two different integrable systems.</description>

Abstract: We show the equivalence of different conditions on a classical field psi to be a solution of the field equations, notably in terms of the Hamilton-Volterra equations, the principle of least action and several conditions based on the contraction of the multivector tangent to psi with canonical differential forms on the multicotangent bundle. Most prominently, we have equivalence to the so-called dynamical Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl equation, that can be vastly generalized to define Hamiltonian dynamics on multisymplectic manifolds, defined for sources of different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Energy cascade and Sobolev norms inflation for the quantum Euler equations on tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence of solutions to the quantum Euler equations on $\mathbb{T}^d$, $d\geqslant 2$, with almost constant mass density, displaying energy transfers to high Fourier modes and polynomially fast-in-time growth of Sobolev norms above the finite-energy level. These solutions are uniformly far from vacuum, suggesting that weak turbulence in quantum hydrodynamics is not necessarily related to the occurrence of vortex structures.
  In view of possible connections with instability mechanisms for the classical compressible Euler equations, we also keep track of the dependence on the semiclassical parameter, showing that, at high regularity, the time at which the Sobolev norm inflations occur is uniform when approaching the semiclassical limit.
  Our construction relies on a novel result of Sobolev instability for the plane waves of the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS), which is connected to the quantum Euler equations through the Madelung transform}. More precisely, we show the existence of smooth solutions to NLS, which are small-amplitude perturbations of a plane wave and undergo a polynomially fast $H^s$-norm inflation for $s&gt;1$. The proof is based on a partial Birkhoff normal form procedure, involving the normalization of non-homogeneous Hamiltonian terms.</description>

      <title>A New Formula for Entropy Solutions for Scalar Hyperbolic Conservation Laws: Convexity Degeneracy of Flux Functions and Fine Properties of Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the Cauchy problem for one-dimensional scalar hyperbolic conservation laws, wherein the flux functions exhibit convexity degeneracy and the initial data are in $L^\infty$. Our primary aim of this paper is to introduce and validate a novel formula for entropy solutions for this Cauchy problem, specifically tailored to the flux functions satisfying (1.3) which allow the state points of convexity degeneracy and asymptotic lines. This formulation serves as a generalization of the Lax--Oleinik formula that necessitates the flux function to possess uniform convexity. Furthermore, we explore several key applications of this new formula to analyze fine properties of entropy solutions for the Cauchy problem with flux functions allowing for convexity degeneracy and initial data only in $L^\infty$; these especially include: (i) Fine structures of entropy solutions, (ii) Global dynamic patterns of entropy solutions, and (iii) Asymptotic profiles of entropy solutions for initial data in $L^\infty$ in both the $L^\infty$-norm and the $L^p_{{\rm loc}}$-norm. Through these analyses, we provide a comprehensive understanding of entropy solutions for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with the flux functions satisfying (1.3) allowing the state points of convexity degeneracy and asymptotic lines. Moreover, the new solution formula is extended to more general scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with initial data in $L^1_{{\rm loc}}$.</description>

      <title>Left-invariant Pseudo-Riemannian metrics on Lie groups: The null cone II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue to study left-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metrics on Lie groups being in the null cone of the $O(p,q)$-action using the moving bracket approach. In particular, the Lie algebra being in the null cone implies that the pseudo-Riemannian metric have all vanishing scalar curvature invariants (VSI). We consider \emph{all} Lie algebras of dimension $\leq 6$ and we find that all solvable Lie algebras, and non-trivially Levi-decomposable Lie algebras, of dimension $\leq 6$ are in the null cone, \emph{except} the 3-dimensional solvable Lie algebra $\mathfrak{s}_{3,3}$. For $\mathfrak{g}$ semi-simple, we also give a construction where $\mathfrak{g}\oplus\mathbb{R}^m$ is in the null cone and give examples of such spaces for \emph{all} the real simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$. For example, for the exceptional split groups this construction places the split $\mathfrak{e}_6\oplus\mathbb{R}^6$, split $\mathfrak{e}_7\oplus\mathbb{R}^7$ and split $\mathfrak{e}_8\oplus\mathbb{R}^8$ in the null cone of the $O(42,42)$, $O(70.70)$ and $O(128,128)$ action, respectively, and hence, their corresponding left-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metrics are VSI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08497v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss spectral properties of a regularization approach to a Schr\"odinger equation set-up for the diffraction of a quantum particle at almost planar patterns. Physically meaningful initial values and potentials are modeled in terms of regularizing families and the solutions can be interpreted as generalized functions. We establish spectral and scattering theoretical properties of the regularizing solution families and provide some comparison with the more direct approximations and simplifications used in physics.</description>

      <title>The quantum vortices dynamics: spatio-temporal scale hierarchy and origin of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the evolution and interaction of quantum vortex loops with a small but non-zero radius of core ${\sf a}$. The quantization scheme of the classical vortex system is based on the approach proposed by the author \cite{Tal,Tal_PhRF}.
  We consider small perturbations in the ring-shaped loops, which include both helical-type shape variations and small excitations of the flow in the vortex core. The quantization of the circulation $\Gamma$ is deduced from the first principles of quantum theory. As a result of our approach, the set of quantized circulation values is wider than the standard one. The developed theory introduces a hierarchical spatio-temporal scale in the quantum evolution of vortices. We also explore the applicability of this model for describing the origins of turbulence in quantum fluid flows. To achieve this specific objective, we employ the method of random Hamiltonians to describe the interaction of quantum vortex loops.</description>

Abstract: We applied the method of finite-part integration [Galapon E.A Proc.R.Soc A 473, 20160567(2017)] to evaluate in closed-form the exact one-loop integral representations of the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian from QED for a constant electric field and electric-like self-dual background. We also devise a prescription based on the finite-part integration of the Cauchy principal value integral to sum and extrapolate the non-alternating divergent weak-field expansions of the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangians to recover the non-perturbative Schwinger effect well into the strong field limit.</description>

Abstract: It shown that if a vector space carries commuting actions of two Clifford algebras, then the quadratic monomials using generators from either Clifford algebra determine a spinor representation of an orthogonal Lie algebra.
  Examples of this construction have applications to high energy physics, particularly to the standard model and unification. It is shown how to use Clifford data to construct spectral triples for the Pati-Salam model that admit an action of Spin(10).</description>

Abstract: We consider $O(1)$ dense loop model in a square lattice wrapped on a cylinder of odd circumference $L$ and calculate the exact densities of loops. These densities of loops are equal to the densities of critical bond percolation clusters on a forty-five-degree rotated square lattice rolled into a cylinder with special boundary conditions which we refer to as half-turn self-dual percolation. The solution is based on a correspondence between the $O(1)$ dense loop model and the six-vertex model at the Razumov-Stroganov point.</description>

      <title>Cusp Universality for Random Matrices I: Local Law and the Complex Hermitian Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.03971v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For complex Wigner-type matrices, i.e. Hermitian random matrices with independent, not necessarily identically distributed entries above the diagonal, we show that at any cusp singularity of the limiting eigenvalue distribution the local eigenvalue statistics are universal and form a Pearcey process. Since the density of states typically exhibits only square root or cubic root cusp singularities, our work complements previous results on the bulk and edge universality and it thus completes the resolution of the Wigner-Dyson-Mehta universality conjecture for the last remaining universality type in the complex Hermitian class. Our analysis holds not only for exact cusps, but approximate cusps as well, where an extended Pearcey process emerges. As a main technical ingredient we prove an optimal local law at the cusp for both symmetry classes. This result is also used in the companion paper [arXiv:1811.04055] where the cusp universality for real symmetric Wigner-type matrices is proven.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14625v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $U\in U(N)$ be a random unitary matrix of size $N$, distributed with respect to the Haar measure on $U(N)$. Let $P(z)=P_U(z)$ be the characteristic polynomial of $U$. We prove that for $z$ close to the unit circle, $ \frac{P'}{P}(z) $ can be approximated using zeros of $P$ very close to $z$, with a typically controllable error term. This is an analogue of a result of Selberg for the Riemann zeta-function. We also prove a mesoscopic central limit theorem for $ \frac{P'}{P}(z) $ away from the unit circle, and this is an analogue of a result of Lester for zeta.</description>

      <title>Modelling interface factorizations between Landau-Ginzburg models as module functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fusion of B-type interfaces between N=(2,2) supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg models. Such interfaces can be described by matrix factorizations of the difference of the superpotentials, and their fusion is modelled by the tensor product of the factorizations. The effect of fusing a fixed interface gives rise to a functor on the category of matrix factorizations. For at least some interfaces, this can be lifted to a functor on the category of modules over polynomial rings. These fusion functors provide an alternative way of modelling interfaces between Landau-Ginzburg models that characterizes interfaces by their fusion properties. Interface fields correspond to morphisms between fusion functors that can be defined via a Hochschild-type cohomology. This leads to a strict monoidal supercategory of fusion functors, where horizontal composition is given by composition of functors. The category of fusion functors can be related to the category of matrix factorizations by a functor that maps a fusion functor to the corresponding interface factorization. It is not faithful, but we prove that it is full for polynomial rings in one variable. The description of interfaces in terms of fusion functors has the advantage that fusion of interfaces becomes simple. It provides a computational tool to evaluate tensor products of matrix factorizations, and could be applied for example in Kazama-Suzuki models to analyse fusion categories of rational defects, or in the context of Khovanov-Rozansky link homology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A host of elastic systems consisting of active components exhibit path-dependent elastic behaviors not found in classical elasticity, which is known as odd elasticity. Odd elasticity is characterized by antisymmetric (odd) elastic modulus tensor. Here, from the perspective of geometry, we construct the Hamiltonian formalism to show the origin of the antisymmetry of the elastic modulus that is intrinsically anisotropic. Furthermore, both non-conservative stress and the associated nonlinear constitutive relation naturally arise. This work also opens the promising possibility of exploring the physics of odd elasticity in dynamical regime by Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review some recent developments in mathematical aspects of relativistic fluids. The goal is to provide a quick entry point to some research topics of current interest that is accessible to graduate students and researchers from adjacent fields, as well as to researches working on broader aspects of relativistic fluid dynamics interested in its mathematical formalism. Instead of complete proofs, which can be found in the published literature, here we focus on the proofs' main ideas and key concepts. After an introduction to the relativistic Euler equations, we cover the following topics: a new wave-transport formulation of the relativistic Euler equations tailored to applications; the problem of shock formation for relativistic Euler; rough (i.e., low-regularity) solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; the relativistic Euler equations with a physical vacuum boundary; relativistic fluids with viscosity. We finish with a discussion of open problems and future directions of research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The set of two-body reduced states of translation invariant, infinite quantum spin chains can be approximated from inside and outside using matrix product states and marginals of finite systems, respectively. These lead to hierarchies of algebraic approximations that become tight only in the limit of infinitely many auxiliary variables. We show that this is necessarily so for any algebraic ansatz by proving that the set of reduced states is not semialgebraic. We also provide evidence that additional elementary transcendental functions cannot lead to a finitary description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of the electronic structure of heavy atoms, relativistic effects cannot be neglected and the Dirac operator naturally appears in place of the Schr\"odinger operator, raising a number of additional difficulties. The complexity of these systems has been addressed by various approximations. We consider a model consisting of differential equations coupling the time evolution of a finite number of relativistic electrons with the Newtonian dynamics of finitely many nuclei. The electrons are described by the Bogoliubov-Dirac-Fock (BDF) equation of quantum electrodynamics (QED). This system can be seen as a first step in the study of molecular dynamics phenomena, when both relativistic and quantum effects have to be taken into account for the electrons. We address the Cauchy problem for this model and prove global well-posedness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inside the double affine Hecke algebra of type $GL_n$, which depends on two parameters $q$ and $\tau$, we define a subalgebra $\mathbb{H}^{\mathfrak{gl}_n}$ that may be thought of as a $q$-analogue of the degree zero part of the corresponding rational Cherednik algebra. We prove that the algebra $\mathbb{H}^{\mathfrak{gl}_n}$ is a flat $\tau$-deformation of the crossed product of the group algebra of the symmetric group with the image of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ under the $q$-oscillator (Jordan-Schwinger) representation. We find all the defining relations and an explicit PBW basis for the algebra $\mathbb{H}^{\mathfrak{gl}_n}$. We describe its centre and establish a double centraliser property. As an application, we also obtain new integrable generalisations of Hamiltonians introduced by van Diejen.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a dimensionless multi-scalar extension of the Standard Model, Gildener and Weinberg assumed that along a flat direction, there is only one classically massless scalar, known as the {\it scalon}, which acquires mass through radiative corrections \`a la Coleman-Weinberg, while all other scalars remain heavy. In this paper, by introducing a toy model with four scalar degrees of freedom we demonstrate the existence of {\it two} scalons along a specific flat direction that we construct. We present the effective potential for the model and provide the masses of the heavy scalars and two radiatively light pseudo-Goldstone bosons.</description>

      <title>Magic Can Enhance the Quantum Capacity of Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of magic in the quantum capacity of channels. We consider the quantum channel of the recently proposed discrete beam splitter with the fixed environment state. We find that if the fixed environment state is a stabilizer state, then the quantum capacity is zero. Moreover, we find that the quantum capacity is nonzero for some magic states, and the quantum capacity increases linearly with respect to the number of single-qudit magic states in the environment. These results suggest that magic can increase the quantum capacity of channels, which sheds new insight into the role of stabilizer and magic states in quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux- and charge-quantization laws for higher gauge fields of Maxwell type -- e.g. the common electromagnetic field (the "A-field") but also the B-, RR-, and C-fields considered in string/M-theory -- specify non-perturbative completions of these fields by encoding their solitonic behaviour and hence by specifying the discrete charges carried by the individual branes (higher-dimensional monopoles or solitons) that source the field fluxes.
  This article surveys the general (rational-)homotopy theoretic understanding of flux- and charge-quantization via the Chern-Dold character map generalized to the non-linear (self-sourcing) Bianchi identities that appear in higher-dimensional supergravity theories, notably for B&amp;RR-fields in D=10, for the C-field in D=11 supergravity, and for the B-field on fivebrane worldvolumes.</description>

      <title>Residual Entropy of Ice: A Study Based on Transfer Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Residual entropy of ice systems has long been a significant and intriguing issue in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. The exact solutions for the residual entropy of realistic three-dimensional ice systems remain unknown. In this study, we focus on two typical realistic ice systems, namely the hexagonal ice (ice Ih) and cubic ice (ice Ic). We present a transfer matrix description of the number of ice-ruled configurations for these two systems. First, a transfer matrix $M$ is constructed for ice Ic, where each element is the number of ice-ruled configurations of a hexagonal monolayer under certain condition. The product of $M$ and its transpose corresponds to a bilayer unit in ice Ih lattice, therefore is exactly a transfer matrix for ice Ih. Making use of this, we simply show that the residual entropy of ice Ih is not less than that of ice Ic in the thermodynamic limit, which was first proved by Onsager in 1960s. Furthermore, we find an alternative transfer matrix $M'$ for ice Ih, which is based on a monolayer periodic unit. Some interesting properties of $M$, $MM^T$ and $M'$ are illustrated, specifically the summation of all elements, the element in the first row and first column, and the trace. Each property is equivalent with the residual entropy of a two-dimensional ice model. Our work rediscovers the relationship between the residual entropies of ice Ih and ice Ic, and provides an effective description for various two-dimensional ice models.</description>

      <title>A Walk Through $Spin(1,d+1)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct unitary irreducible representation of the de Sitter group, that forms the basis for the study of $dS_{d+1}$ QFT. Using the intertwining kernel analysis, we discuss bosonic symmetric tensor, and fermionic higher-spinors. Particular care is given to the structure and construction of exceptional series and fermionic operators. We discuss the discrete series, and explain how and why the exceptional series give rise to seemingly non-invariant correlators in de Sitter. Using tools from Clifford analysis, we show that for $d&gt;3$, there are no exceptional fermionic representations, and so no unitary (higher)-gravitino fields. We also consider the structure of representations for $d=3$ and $d=2$, as relevant for the study of $dS_4$, the only space allowing for unitary gravitino and its generalisation, and of $dS_3$.</description>

      <title>On gamma functions with respect to the alternating Hurwitz zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02854v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1730, Euler defined the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ by the integral representation. It possesses many interesting properties and has wide applications in various branches of mathematics and sciences. According to Lerch, the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ can also be defined by the derivative of the Hurwitz zeta function $$\zeta(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{z}}$$ at $z=0$. Recently, Hu and Kim (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 509 (2022), no. 1, Paper No. 125930) defined the corresponding Stieltjes constants $\widetilde{\gamma}_{k}(x)$ and Euler constant $\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}$ from the Taylor series of the alternating Hurwitz zeta function $$\zeta_{E}(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+x)^z}.$$ And they also introduced the corresponding Gamma function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$ which has the following Weierstrass--Hadamard type product $$\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)=\frac{1}{x}e^{\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}x}\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(e^{-\frac{x}{k}}\left(1+\frac{x}{k}\right)\right)^{(-1)^{k+1}}.$$
  In this paper, we shall further investigate the function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$, that is, we obtain several properties in analogy to the classical Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$, including the integral representation, the limit representation, the recursive formula, the special values, the log-convexity, the duplication and distribution formulas, and the reflection equation. Furthermore, we also prove a Lerch-type formula, which shows that the derivative of $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ can be representative by $\widetilde\Gamma(x)$.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge with Quadratic State Cost is Exactly Solvable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is a diffusion process that steers a given distribution to another in a prescribed time while minimizing the effort to do so. It can be seen as the stochastic dynamical version of the optimal mass transport, and has growing applications in generative diffusion models and stochastic optimal control. {\black{We say a Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is ``exactly solvable'' if the associated uncontrolled Markov kernel is available in closed form, since then the bridge can be numerically computed using dynamic Sinkhorn recursion for arbitrary endpoint distributions with finite second moments.}} In this work, we propose a regularized variant of the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go that incentivizes the optimal sample paths to stay close to a nominal level.
  Unlike the conventional Schr\"{o}dinger bridge, the regularization induces a state-dependent rate of killing and creation of probability mass, and its solution requires determining the Markov kernel of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. We derive this Markov kernel in closed form, {\black{showing that the regularized Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is exactly solvable, even for non-Gaussian endpoints. This advances the state-of-the-art because closed form Markov kernel for the regularized Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is available in existing literature only for Gaussian endpoints}}. Our solution recovers the heat kernel in the vanishing regularization (i.e., diffusion without reaction) limit, thereby recovering the solution of the conventional Schr\"{o}dinger bridge {\black{as a special case}}. We deduce properties of the new kernel and explain its connections with certain exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on M5-branes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight the need for global completion of the field content in the M5-brane sigma-model analogous to Dirac's charge/flux quantization, and we point out that the superspace Bianchi identities on the worldvolume and on its ambient supergravity background constrain the M5's flux-quantization law to be in a non-abelian cohomology theory rationally equivalent to a twisted form of co-Homotopy. In order to clearly bring out this subtle point we give a streamlined re-derivation of the worldvolume 3-flux via M5 "super-embeddings". Finally, assuming the flux-quantization law to actually be in co-Homotopy ("Hypothesis H") we show how this implies Skyrmion-like solitons on general M5-worldvolumes and (abelian) anyonic solitons on the boundaries of "open M5-branes" in heterotic M-theory.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Casimir Energy in Horava-Lifshitz Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the violation of Lorentz symmetry through the Casimir effect. The Casimir effect is one of the most intriguing aspects of modern physics, representing a macroscopic quantum-origin force between two neutral conducting surfaces, and it stands as a triumph of Quantum Field Theory. Here, we examine the Casimir effects associated with a massive fermionic quantum field confined in the region between two large and parallel plates within the Horava-Lifshitz framework of Lorentz symmetry violation. To calculate the Casimir energy and consequently the Casimir pressure, we impose a MIT bag boundary condition on two plates, compatible with the higher-order derivative term in the modified Dirac equation. Our results indicate a strong influence of Lorentz violation on the Casimir effect. We observe that the Casimir energy is affected, both in intensity and sign, potentially exhibiting repulsive or attractive force between the plates, depending on the critical exponent associated with the Horava-Lifshitz formalism.</description>

      <title>The charge gap is greater than the neutral gap in fractional quantum Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Past studies of fractional quantum Hall systems have found that the charge gap dominates the neutral gap for all relevant parameter choices. We report a wide-ranging proof that this domination is in fact a universal property of any Hamiltonian that satisfies a few simple structural properties: translation-invariance, charge conservation, dipole conservation, and a fractionally filled ground state. The result applies to both fermions and bosons. Our main tool is a new mathematical scheme, the gap comparison method, which provides a sequence of inequalities that relate the spectral gaps in successive particle number sectors. Our finding sheds new light on dipole conservation's profound effects on many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Strings as Hyper-Fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically examine all possible Gauss laws obeying spatial rotation symmetry, characterising the corresponding conserved charges. In the case of conserved higher moments, this gives rise to fractonic behaviour. We show that many Gauss laws, including those arising from $p$-form electrodynamics, in fact, produce an infinite tower of conserved moments, which we dub hyper-fractonic. In hyper-fractonic systems, a finite number of charged particles cannot be mobile due to an inability of fulfilling the infinite number of conservation laws with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Instead, mobile charged objects must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the strings and branes naturally coupling to $p$-form potentials provide an example of hyper-fractonic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid classical-quantum method for solving the Lorenz system. We use the forward Euler method to discretize the system in time, transforming it into a system of equations. This set of equations is solved using the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) algorithm. We present numerical results comparing the hybrid method with the classical approach for solving the Lorenz system. The simulation results demonstrate that the VQLS method can effectively compute solutions comparable to classical methods. The method is easily extended to solving similar nonlinear differential equations.</description>
