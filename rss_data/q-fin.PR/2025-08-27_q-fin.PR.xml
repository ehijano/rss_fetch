      <title>Is attention truly all we need? An empirical study of asset pricing in pretrained RNN sparse and global attention models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the pretrained RNN attention models with the mainstream attention mechanisms such as additive attention, Luong's three attentions, global self-attention (Self-att) and sliding window sparse attention (Sparse-att) for the empirical asset pricing research on top 420 large-cap US stocks. This is the first paper on the large-scale state-of-the-art (SOTA) attention mechanisms applied in the asset pricing context. They overcome the limitations of the traditional machine learning (ML) based asset pricing, such as mis-capturing the temporal dependency and short memory. Moreover, the enforced causal masks in the attention mechanisms address the future data leaking issue ignored by the more advanced attention-based models, such as the classic Transformer. The proposed attention models also consider the temporal sparsity characteristic of asset pricing data and mitigate potential overfitting issues by deploying the simplified model structures. This provides some insights for future empirical economic research. All models are examined in three periods, which cover pre-COVID-19 (mild uptrend), COVID-19 (steep uptrend with a large drawdown) and one year post-COVID-19 (sideways movement with high fluctuations), for testing the stability of these models under extreme market conditions. The study finds that in value-weighted portfolio back testing, Model Self-att and Model Sparse-att exhibit great capabilities in deriving the absolute returns and hedging downside risks, while they achieve an annualized Sortino ratio of 2.0 and 1.80 respectively in the period with COVID-19. And Model Sparse-att performs more stably than Model Self-att from the perspective of absolute portfolio returns with respect to the size of stocks' market capitalization.</description>

      <title>Identifying Risk Variables From ESG Raw Data Using A Hierarchical Variable Selection Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors aim to provide non-financial insights into corporations. In this study, we investigate whether we can extract relevant ESG variables to assess corporate risk, as measured by logarithmic volatility. We propose a novel Hierarchical Variable Selection (HVS) algorithm to identify a parsimonious set of variables from raw data that are most relevant to risk. HVS is specifically designed for ESG datasets characterized by a tree structure with significantly more variables than observations. Our findings demonstrate that HVS achieves significantly higher performance than models using pre-aggregated ESG scores. Furthermore, when compared with traditional variable selection methods, HVS achieves superior explanatory power using a more parsimonious set of ESG variables. We illustrate the methodology using company data from various sectors of the US economy.</description>

      <title>Occupied Processes: Going with the Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stochastic process $X$ becomes occupied when it is enlarged with its occupation flow $\mathcal{O}$, which tracks the time spent by the path at each level. Crucially, the occupied process $(\mathcal{O},X)$ enjoys a Markov structure when $X$ is Markov. We develop a novel It\^o calculus for occupied processes that lies midway between Dupire's functional It\^o calculus and the classical version. We derive a surprisingly simple It\^o formula and, through Feynman-Kac, unveil a broad class of path-dependent PDEs where $\mathcal{O}$ plays the role of time. The space variable, given by the current value of $X$, remains finite-dimensional, thereby paving the way for standard elliptic PDE techniques and numerical methods.
  In the financial applications, we demonstrate that occupation flows provide unified Markovian lifts for exotic options and variance instruments, allowing financial institutions to price and manage derivatives books with a single numerical solver. We then explore avenues in financial modeling where volatility is driven by the occupied process. In particular, we propose the local occupied volatility (LOV) model which not only calibrates to European vanilla options but also offers the flexibility to capture stylized facts of volatility and fit other instruments. We also present an extension of forward variance models that leverages the entire forward occupation surface.</description>
