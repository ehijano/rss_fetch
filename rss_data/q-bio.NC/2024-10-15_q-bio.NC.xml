      <title>SimBrainNet: Evaluating Brain Network Similarity for Attention Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based attention disorder research seeks to understand brain activity patterns associated with attention. Previous studies have mainly focused on identifying brain regions involved in cognitive processes or classifying Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and control subjects. However, analyzing effective brain connectivity networks for specific attentional processes and comparing them has not been explored. Therefore, in this study, we propose multivariate transfer entropy-based connectivity networks for cognitive events and introduce a new similarity measure, 'SimBrainNet', to assess these networks. A high similarity score suggests similar brain dynamics during cognitive events, indicating less attention variability. Our experiment involves 12 individuals with attention disorders (7 children and 5 adolescents). Noteworthy that child participants exhibit lower similarity scores compared to adolescents, indicating greater changes in attention. We found strong connectivity patterns in the left pre-frontal cortex for adolescent individuals compared to the child. Our study highlights the changes in attention levels across various cognitive events, offering insights into the underlying cognitive mechanisms, brain dynamics, and potential deficits in individuals with this disorder.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Drug-Induced Brain Activity Changes with Functional Ultrasound Imaging and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a cutting-edge technology that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) by detecting backscattered echoes from red blood cells moving within its field of view (FOV). It offers high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity, allowing for detailed visualization of cerebral blood flow dynamics. While fUSI has been utilized in preclinical drug development studies to explore the mechanisms of action of various drugs targeting the central nervous system, many of these studies have primarily focused on predetermined regions of interest (ROIs). This focus may overlook relevant brain activity outside these specific areas, which could influence the results. To address this limitation, we combined convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fUSI to comprehensively understand the pharmacokinetic process of Dizocilpine, also known as MK-801, a drug that blocks the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in the central nervous system. CNN and class activation mapping (CAM) revealed the spatiotemporal effects of MK-801, which originated in the cortex and propagated to the hippocampus, demonstrating the ability to detect dynamic drug effects over time. Additionally, CNN and CAM assessed the impact of anesthesia on the spatiotemporal hemodynamics of the brain, revealing no distinct patterns between early and late stages. The integration of fUSI and CNN provides a powerful tool to gain insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of drug action in the brain. This combination enables a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of drug effects on brain function, potentially accelerating the development of new therapies in neuropharmacological studies.</description>

      <title>Exploring Behavior-Relevant and Disentangled Neural Dynamics with Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the neural basis of behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Current research in large-scale neuro-behavioral data analysis often relies on decoding models, which quantify behavioral information in neural data but lack details on behavior encoding. This raises an intriguing scientific question: ``how can we enable in-depth exploration of neural representations in behavioral tasks, revealing interpretable neural dynamics associated with behaviors''. However, addressing this issue is challenging due to the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed selectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach, named ``BeNeDiff'', first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural subspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs state-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that interpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on multi-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across the dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual latent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the disentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the behaviors of interest. At the same time, the neural subspace in BeNeDiff demonstrates high disentanglement and neural reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>Separation of Neural Drives to Muscles from Transferred Polyfunctional Nerves using Implanted Micro-electrode Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following limb amputation, neural signals for limb functions persist in the residual peripheral nerves. Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) allows to redirected these signals into spare muscles to recover the neural information through electromyography (EMG). However, a significant challenge arises in separating distinct neural commands redirected from the transferred nerves to the muscles. Disentangling overlapping signals from EMG recordings remains complex, as they can contain mixed neural information that complicates limb function interpretation. To address this challenge, Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interfaces (RPNIs) surgically partition the nerve into individual fascicles that reinnervate specific muscle grafts, isolating distinct neural sources for more precise control and interpretation of EMG signals. We introduce a novel biointerface that combines TMR surgery of polyvalent nerves with a high-density micro-electrode array implanted at a single site within a reinnervated muscle. Instead of surgically identifying distinct nerve fascicles, our approach separates all neural signals that are re-directed into a single muscle, using the high spatio-temporal selectivity of the micro-electrode array and mathematical source separation methods. We recorded EMG signals from four reinnervated muscles while volunteers performed phantom limb tasks. The decomposition of these signals into motor unit activity revealed distinct clusters of motor neurons associated with diverse functional tasks. Notably, our method enabled the extraction of multiple neural commands within a single reinnervated muscle, eliminating the need for surgical nerve division. This approach not only has the potential of enhancing prosthesis control but also uncovers mechanisms of motor neuron synergies following TMR, providing valuable insights into how the central nervous system encodes movement after reinnervation.</description>

      <title>Uncovering dynamical equations of stochastic decision models using data-driven SINDy algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision formation in perceptual decision-making involves sensory evidence accumulation instantiated by the temporal integration of an internal decision variable towards some decision criterion or threshold, as described by sequential sampling theoretical models. The decision variable can be represented in the form of experimentally observable neural activities. Hence, elucidating the appropriate theoretical model becomes crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying perceptual decision formation. Existing computational methods are limited to either fitting of choice behavioural data or linear model estimation from neural activity data. In this work, we made use of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), a data-driven approach, to elucidate the deterministic linear and nonlinear components of often-used stochastic decision models within reaction time task paradigms. Based on the simulated decision variable activities of the models, SINDy, enhanced with approaches using multiple trials, could readily estimate the dynamical equations, choice accuracy and decision time of the models across a range of signal-to-noise ratio values. In particular, SINDy performed the best using the more memory intensive multi-trial approach while trial-averaging of parameters performed more moderately. The single-trial approach, although expectedly not performing as well, may be useful for real-time modelling. Taken together, our work offers alternative approaches for SINDy to uncover the dynamics in perceptual decision-making, and more generally, for first-passage time problems.</description>

      <title>Compression-based inference of network motif sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical and functional constraints on biological networks lead to complex topological patterns across multiple scales in their organization. A particular type of higher-order network feature that has received considerable interest is network motifs, defined as statistically regular subgraphs. These may implement fundamental logical and computational circuits and are referred as "building blocks of complex networks". Their well-defined structures and small sizes also enables the testing of their functions in synthetic and natural biological experiments. The statistical inference of network motifs is however fraught with difficulties, from defining and sampling the right null model to accounting for the large number of possible motifs and their potential correlations in statistical testing. Here we develop a framework for motif mining based on lossless network compression using subgraph contractions. The minimum description length principle allows us to select the most significant set of motifs as well as other prominent network features in terms of their combined compression of the network. The approach inherently accounts for multiple testing and correlations between subgraphs and does not rely on a priori specification of an appropriate null model. This provides an alternative definition of motif significance which guarantees more robust statistical inference. Our approach overcomes the common problems in classic testing-based motif analysis. We apply our methodology to perform comparative connectomics by evaluating the compressibility and the circuit motifs of a range of synaptic-resolution neural connectomes.</description>

      <title>How to Build the Virtual Cell with Artificial Intelligence: Priorities and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cell is arguably the most fundamental unit of life and is central to understanding biology. Accurate modeling of cells is important for this understanding as well as for determining the root causes of disease. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), combined with the ability to generate large-scale experimental data, present novel opportunities to model cells. Here we propose a vision of leveraging advances in AI to construct virtual cells, high-fidelity simulations of cells and cellular systems under different conditions that are directly learned from biological data across measurements and scales. We discuss desired capabilities of such AI Virtual Cells, including generating universal representations of biological entities across scales, and facilitating interpretable in silico experiments to predict and understand their behavior using virtual instruments. We further address the challenges, opportunities and requirements to realize this vision including data needs, evaluation strategies, and community standards and engagement to ensure biological accuracy and broad utility. We envision a future where AI Virtual Cells help identify new drug targets, predict cellular responses to perturbations, as well as scale hypothesis exploration. With open science collaborations across the biomedical ecosystem that includes academia, philanthropy, and the biopharma and AI industries, a comprehensive predictive understanding of cell mechanisms and interactions has come into reach.</description>

      <title>Explicitly Modeling Pre-Cortical Vision with a Neuro-Inspired Front-End Improves CNN Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at clean image classification, they struggle to classify images corrupted with different common corruptions, limiting their real-world applicability. Recent work has shown that incorporating a CNN front-end block that simulates some features of the primate primary visual cortex (V1) can improve overall model robustness. Here, we expand on this approach by introducing two novel biologically-inspired CNN model families that incorporate a new front-end block designed to simulate pre-cortical visual processing. RetinaNet, a hybrid architecture containing the novel front-end followed by a standard CNN back-end, shows a relative robustness improvement of 12.3% when compared to the standard model; and EVNet, which further adds a V1 block after the pre-cortical front-end, shows a relative gain of 18.5%. The improvement in robustness was observed for all the different corruption categories, though accompanied by a small decrease in clean image accuracy, and generalized to a different back-end architecture. These findings show that simulating multiple stages of early visual processing in CNN early layers provides cumulative benefits for model robustness.</description>
