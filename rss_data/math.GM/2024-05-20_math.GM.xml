      <title>Linear canonical space-time transform and convolution theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the idea of the fractional space-time Fourier transform, a linear canonical space-time transform for 16-dimensional space-time $C\ell_{3,1}$-valued signals is investigated in this paper. First, the definition of the proposed linear canonical space-time transform is given, and some related properties of this transform are obtained. Second, the convolution operator and the corresponding convolution theorem are proposed. Third, the convolution theorem associated with the two-sided linear canonical space-time transform is derived.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Quotient Rings and Kronecker Substitution for Deriving Combinatorial Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00332v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for generating combinatorial identities by applying Kronecker substitution to polynomial expansions within quotient rings. We apply this methodology to derive a general formula for linear recurrences, as well as explicit formulas for certain combinatorial sequences, including the Pell numbers and central binomial coefficients. For example, we present the formula: $\binom{2n}{n} = \left((4^n + 1)^{2n} \mod (4^{n(n+1)} + 1)\right) \mod (4^n-1)$. We also discover an unusual representation for the real $r$th roots of positive integers, characterized as the limit of a modular expression. The theorems and results presented provide a theoretical basis for future research on the interconnections between Kronecker substitution, polynomial ring expansions, and their applications in combinatorial sequences and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Development of Right Derived Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Category theory is the language of homological algebra, allowing us to state broadly applicable theorems and results without needing to specify the details for every instance of analogous objects. However, authors often stray from the realm of pure abstract category theory in their development of the field, leveraging the Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem or similar results, or otherwise using set-theoretic language to augment a general categorical discussion. This paper seeks to demonstrate that - while it is not necessary for most mathematicians' purposes - a development of homological concepts can be contrived from purely categorical notions. We begin by outlining the categories we will work within, namely Abelian categories (building off additive categories). We continue to develop cohomology groups of sequences, eventually culminating in a development of right derived functors. This paper is designed to be a minimalist construction, supplying no examples or motivation beyond what is necessary to develop the ideas presented.</description>
