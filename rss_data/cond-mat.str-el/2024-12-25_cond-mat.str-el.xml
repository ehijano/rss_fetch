      <title>Exotic phase transitions in spin ladders with discrete symmetries that emulate spin-1/2 bosons in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a spin ladder with discrete symmetries designed to emulate a two-dimensional spin-1/2 boson system at half-filling. Using global properties, such as the structure of topological defects, we establish a correspondence between the two systems and construct a dictionary of symmetries and operators. In particular, translation invariance leads to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints for both systems, resulting in exotic deconfined quantum critical points. Subsequently, we study the spin ladder in detail. An exact duality transformation maps it onto a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory of three partons, analogous to the U(1) gauge theory of chargons and spinons in two-dimensional spin-1/2 boson systems. With the mapping between spins and partons, we construct exactly solvable models for all pertinent symmetry-breaking phases and analyze their transitions. We further make connections between our exact analysis and conventional parton gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of XY-type spin dimers in Shastry-Sutherland lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study on the origin of the enigmatic disordered ground state within the Shastry-Sutherland lattice, BaCe$_2$ZnS$_5$, at low temperatures. The magnetization and heat capacity data show a lack of magnetic ordering down to 73 mK. We deploy a localized spin dimer model which can accurately reproduce the dynamic structure factor of the neutron data, magnetization and heat capacity data. Remarkably, the intra-dimer exchange interaction shows strong XY-type anisotropy and the ground state of BaCe$_2$ZnS$_5$ is in an entangled state $(|\uparrow\uparrow&gt; - |\downarrow\downarrow&gt;)/\sqrt{2}$. This is in contrast to the singlet dimer state that is obtained for Heisenberg interactions. These results confirm that BaCe$_2$ZnS$_5$ is in a quantum paramagnet state consisting of entangled spin dimer states.</description>

      <title>Collinear Altermagnets and their Landau Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit spontaneously spin-split electronic bands in the zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC) limit arising from the presence of collinear compensated magnetic order. The distinctive magneto-crystalline symmetries of altermagnets ensure that these spin splittings have a characteristic anisotropy in crystal momentum space. These systems have attracted a great deal of interest due to their potential for applications in spintronics. In this paper, we provide a general Landau theory that encompasses all three-dimensional altermagnets where the magnetic order does not enlarge the unit cell. We identify all crystal structures that admit altermagnetism and then reduce these to a relatively small set of distinct possible Landau theories governing such systems. In the zero SOC limit, we determine the possible local multipolar orders that are tied to the spin splitting of the band structure. We make precise the connection between altermagnetism as defined at zero SOC ("ideal" altermagnets) and the effects of weak SOC. In particular, we examine which response functions allowed by symmetry when SOC is present are guaranteed by the spin-orbit free theory, and spell out the distinctive properties of altermagnets in comparison with conventional collinear antiferromagnets. Finally, we show how these ideas can be applied by considering a number of altermagnetic candidate materials.</description>

      <title>Emergence of topological defects and spin liquid in a two-orbital spin-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizing exotic quantum phases of matter, e.g. spin liquid, is an attractive topic in condensed matter. Here, by a Monte Carlo study of a two-orbital spin-fermion model on a honeycomb lattice, we show the cooperative effects of the orbital degeneracy of itinerant electrons and the exchange interaction of localized spins can significantly suppress both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders by generating topological defects and give rise to an intermediate spin liquid state via continuous phase transitions. This phase competition can also be achieved by tuning the electron filling. These results shed new light on realizing spin liquids on geometrically non-frustrated lattices.</description>

      <title>Competing electronic ground states in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeRh2As2 is rare among superconductors, in that magnetic field tunes it between two distinct superconducting phases. Combined with a lack of local inversion symmetry and an upper critical field exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit, this excitingly suggests triplet multicomponent superconductivity. Preceding the superconducting onset, f-electron correlations cause long-range order, attributed both to local antiferromagnetism and itinerant (quadrupole) density-waves. Magnetic field provides a significant perturbation of the f-electron and may reveal the nature of the many-body correlations. Thus, we report comprehensive magnetization and magnetotransport studies on microstructured devices in fields of up to 73 T. Applied along the c-axis, field causes a low-temperature valence transition at {\mu}0H ~ 24 T. By contrast, in-plane fields produce a cascade of phase transitions; the field-induced in-plane conductivity anisotropy and lack of accompanying magnetic features, plus the closed-dome nature of the overall phase boundary is consistent with a hierarchy of field-induced density-wave states.</description>

      <title>Origin of the insulating and superconducting phases in molecular solid $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of organic molecular solids are highlighted by their complex phase diagram and light-induced phenomena, such as Mott insulator, spin liquid phase, and superconductivity. However, a discrepancy between experimental observation and first-principle calculation on the $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X family inhibits understanding their properties. Here, we revisit the electronic structure of $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ with the recently developed DFT+GOU method to correct the energy level of molecular orbital states in the molecular solid. Our work reveals that the insulating electronic structure of $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ originates from the energy gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital states of the BEDT-TTF dimers, that are the periodic unit of the molecular solid. We verify that our calculation result provides consistent band gap, optical conductivity, and evolution of the metal-insulator transition as a function of pressure with experimental observations. Especially, the superconducting dome of $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, which originates from the flat band state at the Fermi level, is reproduced. Additionally, we constructed a new low-energy lattice model based on the ability of electronic structure data that can be used to address many-body physics, such as quantum spin liquid and double-holon dynamics. Our provides a deeper understanding of the complex phase diagram and various light-induced phenomena in the $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X family and the other complex organic molecular solids.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear nonreciprocal electronic conductivity driven by magnetic field gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose the emergence of nonlinear nonreciprocal conductivity in centrosymmetric paramagnetic systems when a spatially gradient magnetic field is externally applied. The key essence lies in the appearance of magnetic toroidal dipole moment under the gradient field that breaks both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries. By analyzing a minimal tight-binding model on a two-dimensional system, we show that an effective coupling between the magnetic toroidal dipole moment arising from the gradient field and sublattice-dependent antisymmetric spin-orbit interaction plays an important role in inducing the nonlinear nonreciprocal transport. We also discuss the favorable situation to observe the nonlinear nonreciprocal conductivity in real materials by presenting an experimental setup in order to stimulate the findings.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study of the Fermi Surface Topology of CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of heavy-fermion superconductivity in CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$, the material has attracted great interest particularly with regard to the nature of the superconducting pairing and its mechanism. Consequently, it is essential to better understand the electronic Fermi surface topology and its role in strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The standard density functional theory method is insufficient to model the interplay of strong onsite Coulomb repulsion in localized 4{\it f}-electrons and their hybridization with itinerant ligand-orbital electrons. We have performed electronic ground state calculations on CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ using the Gutzwiller wavefunction approximation. The Gutzwiller approximation captures the quasiparticle band renormalization from the strong onsite Coulomb repulsion. We have performed an analysis of this effect on the electronic structure and the Fermi surface topology by varying the interaction strength and taking into account the crystal-field splitting. Using the de Haas van Alphen effect, the extremal Fermi surface cross-sectional areas were calculated to quantify the effects of quasiparticle mass renormalization on the Fermi surface. Our results confirm two Fermi surface sheets corresponding to the heavy (488m$_{e}$) and light (4.35m$_{e}$) quasiparticles, which is in close agreement with experimental measurements as well as the renormalized band method.</description>

      <title>Lu/Se Substitution Effect on Magnetic Properties of Yb-Based Zigzag Chain Semiconductor YbCuS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the changes in the magnetic properties on YbCuS2 by Lu or Se substitutions from a microscopic perspective. In general, it is expected that nonmagnetic Lu substitution dilutes the magnetic Yb3+ concentration, and that Se substitution induces the negative pressure in YbCuS2. The 63/65Cu-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on polycrystalline Yb0.9Lu0.1CuS2 and YbCu(S0.9Se0.1)2 revealed that the Se substitution leads to larger lattice expansion compared to the Lu substitution. The antiferromagnetic transition temperature TN decreased from 0.95 K in the unsubstituted system to 0.75 K in both substituted systems. Furthermore, the T-linear behavior of the 63Cu-NQR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1, suggesting the presence of the gapless quasiparticle excitations, was observed even in the substituted systems, and the value of 1/T1T increases. These results under the chemical substitutions are opposite to those under pressure as previously reported, and are consistent with the expectation. Our systematic study indicates a clear relationship between the magnetic ordered states and the quasiparticle excitations in YbCuS2.</description>

      <title>Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit forming by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped from electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Systematic Constructions of Interfaces and Anomalous Boundaries for Fermionic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the pullback trivialization technique to systematically construct gapped interfaces and anomalous boundaries for fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) states by extending their symmetry group $G_f = \mathbb{Z}_2^f \times_{\omega_2} G$ to larger groups. These FSPT states may involve decoration layers of both Majorana chains and complex fermions. We derive general consistency formulas explicitly for (2+1)D and (3+1)D systems, where nontrivial twists arise from fermionic symmetric local unitaries or "gauge transformations" that ensure coboundaries vanish at the cochain level. Additionally, we present explicit example for a (3+1)D FSPT with symmetry group $G_f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$ with Majorana chain decorations.</description>

      <title>Lattice T-duality from non-invertible symmetries in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dualities of quantum field theories are challenging to realize in lattice models of qubits. In this work, we explore one of the simplest dualities, T-duality of the compact boson CFT, and its realization in quantum spin chains. In the special case of the XX model, we uncover an exact lattice T-duality, which is associated with a non-invertible symmetry that exchanges two lattice U(1) symmetries. The latter symmetries flow to the momentum and winding U(1) symmetries with a mixed anomaly in the CFT. However, the charge operators of the two U(1) symmetries do not commute on the lattice and instead generate the Onsager algebra. We discuss how some of the anomalies in the CFT are nonetheless still exactly realized on the lattice and how the lattice U(1) symmetries enforce gaplessness. We further explore lattice deformations preserving both U(1) symmetries and find a rich gapless phase diagram with special $\mathrm{Spin}(2k)_1$ WZW model points and whose phase transitions all have dynamical exponent ${z&gt;1}$.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Spin-Splitting Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting-edge opportunities for spintronics. Here, we report the experimental observation of an altermagnetic spin-splitting magnetoresistance effect, which is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. The spin current polarization and the corresponding magnetic field direction associated with the magnetoresistance extrema are largely determined by the Neel vector of the altermagnet, leading to a remarkable phase shift compared to that driven by a conventional relativistic spin current. Our work opens a door to unearthing luxuriant nonrelativistic quantum states of matter in emergent materials with unconventional spin degeneracy lifting.</description>

      <title>PyAtoms: An interactive tool for rapidly simulating atomic scanning tunneling microscopy images of 2D materials, moir\'e systems and superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that quickly and easily simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moir\'{e} systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sub-lattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moir\'{e} systems, and charge- and bond-density wave systems (2$H$-NbSe$_2$, 1$T$-TaS$_2$, Kekul\'{e}-distorted graphene, K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$). Finally, we show that PyAtoms can be used as a useful educational tool in entry- and senior-level physics courses.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-temperature heat transport evidence for residual density of states in the superconducting state of CsV3Sb5</title>

Abstract: The V-based kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs) host charge density wave (CDW) and a topological nontrivial band structure, thereby provide a great platform to study the interplay of superconductivity (SC), CDW, frustration, and topology. Here, we report ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and Ta-doped Cs(V$_{0.86}$Ta$_{0.14}$)$_3$Sb$_5$ and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. The finite residual linear term of thermal conductivity at zero magnetic field suggests the existence of a residual density of states (DOS) in the superconducting state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This is supported by the observation of non-zero conductance at zero bias in STM spectrum at an electronic temperature of 90 mK. However, in Cs(V$_{0.86}$Ta$_{0.14}$)$_3$Sb$_5$, which does not have CDW order, there is no evidence for residual DOS. These results show the importance of CDW order for the residual DOS, and a nodal $s$-wave gap or residual Fermi arc may be the origin of the residual DOS in such an unusual multiband kagome superconductor, CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Flowery Horizons &amp; Bulk Observers: $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Drive in $2d$ Holographic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore and analyze bulk geometric aspects corresponding to a driven two-dimensional holographic CFT, where the drive Hamiltonian is constructed from the $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ generators. In particular, we demonstrate that starting with a thermal initial state, the evolution of the event horizon is characterized by distinct geometric transformations in the bulk which are associated to the conjugacy classes of the corresponding transformations on the CFT. Namely, the bulk evolution of the horizon is geometrically classified into an oscillatory (non-heating) behaviour, an exponentially growing (heating) behaviour and a power-law growth with an angular rotation (the phase boundary), all as a function of the stroboscopic time. We also show that the explicit symmetry breaking of the drive is manifest in a flowery structure of the event horizon that displays a $U(1) \to {\mathbb Z}_q$ symmetry breaking. In the $q\to \infty$ limit, the $U(1)$ symmetry is effectively restored. Furthermore, by analyzing the integral curves generated by the asymptotic Killing vectors, we also demonstrate how the fixed points of these curves approximate a bulk Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponding to a modular Hamiltonian for a sub-region in the CFT. Since the CFT modular Hamiltonian has an infinitely many in-equivalent extensions in the bulk, the fixed points of the integral curves can also lie outside the entanglement wedge of the CFT sub-region.</description>

      <title>Construction of $G_2$ symmetry in a Hubbard-type model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.14126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the smallest exceptional Lie group and the automorphism group of the non-associative algebra octonions, $G_2$ is often employed for describing exotic symmetry structures. We construct $G_2$ symmetry in a self-dual Hubbard-type model with 4-component fermions in a bipartite lattice, which lies in the intersection of two $SO(7)$ algebras connected by the structure constants of octonions. Depending on the representations of the order parameters, the $G_2$ symmetry can be spontaneously broken into either an $SU(3)$ one associated with an $S^6$ sphere Goldstone manifold, or, into $SU(2)\times U(1)$ with a Grassmannian Goldstone manifold. In the quantum disordered states, quantum fluctuations generate the effective $SU(3)$ and $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge theories for low energy fermions.</description>

      <title>Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering in the topological semimetal FeSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of topological semimetals contains protected degeneracies in reciprocal space that correspond to Weyl, Dirac, or multifold fermionic states. To exploit the unconventional properties of these states, one has to access the electronic structure of the three-dimensional bulk. In this work, we present the first joint theory-experiment study of the electronic structure of a candidate topological semimetal with resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). We resolve the bulk electronic states of FeSi using momentum-dependent RIXS at the Fe $L_3$ edge. We observe a broad excitation continuum devoid of sharp features, consistent with particle-hole scattering in an underlying electronic band structure. Using density functional theory (DFT), we calculate the electronic structure of FeSi and derive a band theory formulation of RIXS in the fast collision approximation to model the scattering process with zero adjustable parameters. While band theory predicts an excitation continuum with broad spectral features similar to the observed ones, discrepancies between theory and experiment suggest the presence of low-energy processes that DFT alone does not account for. This first study of RIXS in a topological semimetal shows that RIXS is a useful tool for revealing unanticipated behavior of bulk electronic states in this class of materials.</description>

Abstract: A supersolid is a quantum-entangled state of matter that exhibits the dual characteristics of superfluidity and solidity. \red{While theoretical studies have predicted that hard-core bosons with repulsive interactions on a triangular lattice can host a supersolid phase, experimental validation has remained elusive. Leveraging an exact mapping between bosons and spins, we investigate the supersolid phase in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$.} Here, we present the magnetic phase diagram and neutron scattering results for K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, which features nearest-neighbor Ising-like interactions with $J_z = 2.96(2)$ meV and $J_{\perp} = 0.21(3)$ meV. In zero field, neutron spectroscopy reveals the gradual development of a quasi-two-dimensional $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ magnetic order with Z$_3$ translational symmetry breaking (solidity) below 15 K. \red{At temperatures below 0.3 K, the fully developed supersolid phase is evidenced by the coexistence of a gapless Goldstone mode arising from broken U$(1)$ spin rotational symmetry (superfluidity), and a gapped pseudo-Goldstone mode associated with lifted accidental XY degeneracy (solidity).} In $\bf c$-axis-oriented magnetic fields 1.1 T $&lt;$ $B$ $&lt;$ 21 T, a prominent 1/3 magnetization plateau phase emerges, accompanied by a \red{plausible} high-field supersolid phase (17 T $&lt;$ $B$ $&lt;$ 21 T). Our results establish K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$as an exceptional realization of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice quantum Ising magnet, document its magnetic phase diagram featuring two supersolid phases, and uncover spectroscopic \red{signatures} of zero-field supersolidity in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating field series: towards calculations of correlated systems with high accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce regular series expansion for weakly- and moderately-correlated fermionic systems, based on Fluctuating Local Field approach. The method relies on the explicit account of leading fluctuating mode(s) and is therefore suitable for medium-sized lattices. It can be also used as a solver for the cluster approximations for infinite-size lattices. We introduce classical fluctuating field coupled to fermionic collective mode(s). This way, fluctuations in selected modes are treated in a non-perturbative way. Other degrees of freedom are accounted for the diagram expansion performed at each value of the fluctuating field. The method is benchmarked for the $U/t=1$ and $U/t=2$ Hubbard lattices at half-filling. Results for susceptibility in the antiferromagnetic channel along with the single particle density of states are compared with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo data. Calculations up to the third order of the series expansion are performed and show a uniform convergence to the reference result for the susceptibility. This convergence is observed well below the DMFT Ne\'el temperature and makes our practically simple method applicable in a much wider temperature range than DMFT-based diagrammatic schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the invertible and non-invertible symmetries of topological finite-group gauge theories in general spacetime dimensions, where the gauge group can be abelian or non-abelian. We focus in particular on the 0-form symmetry. The gapped domain walls that generate these symmetries are specified by boundary conditions for the gauge fields on either side of the wall. We investigate the fusion rules of these symmetries and their action on other topological defects including the Wilson lines, magnetic fluxes, and gapped boundaries. We illustrate these constructions with various novel examples, including non-invertible electric-magnetic duality symmetry in 3+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, and non-invertible analogs of electric-magnetic duality symmetry in non-abelian finite-group gauge theories. In particular, we discover topological domain walls that obey Fibonacci fusion rules in 2+1d gauge theory with dihedral gauge group of order 8. We also generalize the Cheshire string defect to analogous defects of general codimensions and gauge groups and show that they form a closed fusion algebra.</description>

      <title>Properties of an organic model $S=1$ Haldane chain system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the properties of a new organic $S=1$ antiferromagnetic chain system $m$-NO$_2$PhBNO (abbreviated BoNO). In this biradical system two unpaired electrons from aminoxyl groups are strongly ferromagnetically coupled ($|J_\text{FM}| /k_B \gtrsim 500$ K) which leads to the formation of an effective $S=1$ state for each molecule. The chains of BoNO biradicals propagate along the crystallographic $a$ axis. Temperature dependence of the $g$ factor and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) linewidth are consistent with a low-dimensional system with antiferromagnetic interactions. The EPR data further suggest that BoNO is the first known Haldane system with an almost isotropic $g$ factor ($2.0023 \pm 2 \unicode{x2030}$). The magnetization measurements in magnetic fields up to $40$ T and low-field susceptibility, together with $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, reveal a dominant intrachain antiferromagnetic exchange coupling of $J_\text{1D}/k_B = (11.3\pm0.1)$ K, and attainable critical magnetic fields of $\mu_0 H_\text{c1} \approx 2$ T and $\mu_0 H_\text{c2} \approx 33$ T. These measurements therefore suggest that BoNO is a unique Haldane system with extremely small magnetic anisotropy. Present results are crucial for a future in-depth NMR study of the low-temperature Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) and magnetic field-induced phases, which can be performed in the entire phase space.</description>

Abstract: The fundamental idea of the excitonic insulator (EI) driven by electron-hole correlations in narrow-gap semiconductors or semimetals was originally proposed in the 1960s, and only theoretical studies had been advanced for a long time. However, the rise of new candidate materials and recent developments in measurement techniques have enabled us to discuss the possibilities of EI states in real materials experimentally. In this article, we review recent progress in the research of EIs. We start with an introduction to the theoretical background of the EI and the mechanism of the order formation including its relation to the physics of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) - Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover. We also review the EI states studied in the context of strongly correlated electron systems. Then, we introduce the candidate materials for the EI and the issues raised by recent experiments. For example, the phase transitions in several candidate materials are accompanied by lattice distortions, and the contributions from electron-lattice coupling hinder the identification of the excitonic entity. We also review the profiles of the collective modes to discuss the dynamical signatures of the EI.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving general (off-diagonal) measurements is one of the most significant challenges in quantum Monte Carlo, which strongly limits its application during the decades of development. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and (imaginary) time. Our work paves an easy and efficient way to capture the complex off-diagonal operators in quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which provides new insight to address the challenge of quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

Abstract: We study the emergence of altermagnetism from repulsive interactions for electrons on the Lieb lattice as a model of quasi-2D oxychalcogenides with the so-called "anti-CuO$_{2}$" lattice structure. A comprehensive study of the Lieb lattice Hubbard model, using unrestricted Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization techniques, establishes the presence of spin-${1\over 2}$ altermagnetic Mott insulating ground state for average electron densities of 2 and 4 per unit cell. Both phases show the characteristic spin splitting in the electron bands as well as in the magnon bands, as indicated by solutions of an effective spin-${1\over 2}$ Heisenberg model that we construct. We also provide evidence for altermagnetic metal formation in the electron- and hole-doped Mott state, giving rise to Fermi surfaces with $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave spin splitting and quasi-one-dimensional characteristics.</description>

Abstract: Although quantum mechanics underpins the microscopic behavior of all materials, its effects are often obscured at the macroscopic level by thermal fluctuations. A notable exception is a zero-temperature phase transition, where scaling laws emerge entirely due to quantum correlations over a diverging length scale. The accurate description of such transitions is challenging for classical simulation methods of quantum systems, and is a natural application space for quantum simulation. These quantum simulations are, however, not without their own challenges \textemdash~representing quantum critical states on a quantum computer requires encoding entanglement of a large number of degrees of freedom, placing strict demands on the coherence and fidelity of the computer's operations. Using Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer, we address these challenges by employing hierarchical quantum tensor-network techniques, creating the ground state of the critical transverse-field Ising chain on 128-sites with sufficient fidelity to extract accurate critical properties of the model. Our results suggest a viable path to quantum-assisted tensor network contraction beyond the limits of classical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a paradigm for quantum computation where computation is driven by local measurements on a suitably entangled resource state. In this work we show that MBQC is related to a model of quantum computation based on Clifford quantum cellular automata (CQCA). Specifically, we show that certain MBQCs can be directly constructed from CQCAs which yields a simple and intuitive circuit model representation of MBQC in terms of quantum computation based on CQCA. We apply this description to construct various MBQC-based Ans\"atze for parameterized quantum circuits, demonstrating that the different Ans\"atze may lead to significantly different performances on different learning tasks. In this way, MBQC yields a family of Hardware-efficient Ans\"atze that may be adapted to specific problem settings and is particularly well suited for architectures with translationally invariant gates such as neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin dynamics</title>

Abstract: We study thermalization slowing down of a quantum many-body spin system upon approach to two distinct integrability limits. Motivated by previous studies of classical systems, we identify two thermalization time scales: one quantum Lyapunov time scale is extracted by quantifying operator growth in time on an appropriately defined basis, while another ergodization time scale is related to the statistics of fluctuations of the time-evolved operator around its mean value based on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Using a paradigmatic Quantum Ising chain we find that both timescales diverge upon approach to integrability. We investigate the relative strength of the divergence in the two limits and find that despite significant qualitative differences in the mechanism of integrability breaking, the timescales diverge in a similar fashion. This allows us to establish a universality of integrability breaking in quantum spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Correlated states in super-moir\'e materials with a kernel polynomial quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18898</link>

Abstract: Super-moir\'e materials represent a novel playground to engineer states of matter beyond the possibilities of conventional moir\'e materials. However, from the computational point of view, understanding correlated matter in these systems requires solving models with several millions of atoms, a formidable task for state-of-the-art methods. Conventional wavefunction methods for correlated matter scale with a cubic power with the number of sites, a major challenge for super-moir\'e materials. Here, we introduce a methodology capable of solving correlated states in super-moir\'e materials by combining a kernel polynomial method with a quantics tensor cross interpolation matrix product state algorithm. This strategy leverages a mapping of the super-moir\'e structure to a many-body Hilbert space, that is efficiently sampled with tensor cross interpolation with matrix product states, where individual evaluations are performed with a Chebyshev kernel polynomial algorithm. We demonstrate this approach with interacting super-moir\'e systems with up to several millions of atoms, showing its ability to capture correlated states in moir\'e-of-moir\'e systems and domain walls between different moir\'e systems. Our manuscript puts forward a widely applicable methodology to study correlated matter in ultra-long length scales, enabling rationalizing correlated super-moir\'e phenomena.</description>

      <title>Infinitely fast critical dynamics: Teleportation through temporal rare regions in monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with ``ultrafast'' dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits.</description>
