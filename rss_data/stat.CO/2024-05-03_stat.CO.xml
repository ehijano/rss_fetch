      <title>Individual-level models of disease transmission incorporating piecewise spatial risk functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling epidemics is crucial for understanding the emergence, transmission, impact and control of diseases. Spatial individual-level models (ILMs) that account for population heterogeneity are a useful tool, accounting for factors such as location, vaccination status and genetic information. Parametric forms for spatial risk functions, or kernels, are often used, but rely on strong assumptions about underlying transmission mechanisms. Here, we propose a class of non-parametric spatial disease transmission model, fitted within a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, allowing for more flexible assumptions when estimating the effect on spatial distance and infection risk. We focus upon two specific forms of non-parametric spatial infection kernel: piecewise constant and piecewise linear. Although these are relatively simple forms, we find them effective. The performance of these models is examined using simulated data, including under circumstances of model misspecification, and then applied to data from the UK 2001 foot-and-mouth disease.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Accurate Numerical Method for the Left Tail of Sums of Independent Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a flexible, deterministic numerical method for computing left-tail rare events of sums of non-negative, independent random variables. The method is based on iterative numerical integration of linear convolutions by means of Newtons-Cotes rules. The periodicity properties of convoluted densities combined with the Trapezoidal rule are exploited to produce a robust and efficient method, and the method is flexible in the sense that it can be applied to all kinds of non-negative continuous RVs. We present an error analysis and study the benefits of utilizing Newton-Cotes rules versus the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for numerical integration, showing that although there can be efficiency-benefits to using FFT, Newton-Cotes rules tend to preserve the relative error better, and indeed do so at an acceptable computational cost. Numerical studies on problems with both known and unknown rare-event probabilities showcase the method's performance and support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Strategies for Rare Population Detection and Sampling: A Methodological Approach in Liguria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economic policy sciences are constantly investigating the quality of well-being of broad sections of the population in order to describe the current interdependence between unequal living conditions, low levels of education and a lack of integration into society. Such studies are often carried out in the form of surveys, e.g. as part of the EU-SILC program. If the survey is designed at national or international level, the results of the study are often used as a reference by a broad range of public institutions. However, the sampling strategy per se may not capture enough information to provide an accurate representation of all population strata. Problems might arise from rare, or hard-to-sample, populations and the conclusion of the study may be compromised or unrealistic. We propose here a two-phase methodology to identify rare, poorly sampled populations and then resample the hard-to-sample strata. We focused our attention on the 2019 EU-SILC section concerning the Italian region of Liguria. Methods based on dispersion indices or deep learning were used to detect rare populations. A multi-frame survey was proposed as the sampling design. The results showed that factors such as citizenship, material deprivation and large families are still fundamental characteristics that are difficult to capture.</description>

      <title>Statistical algorithms for low-frequency diffusion data: A PDE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of making nonparametric inference in multi-dimensional diffusion models from low-frequency data. Statistical analysis in this setting is notoriously challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood and its gradient, and computational methods have thus far largely resorted to expensive simulation-based techniques. In this article, we propose a new computational approach which is motivated by PDE theory and is built around the characterisation of the transition densities as solutions of the associated heat (Fokker-Planck) equation. Employing optimal regularity results from the theory of parabolic PDEs, we prove a novel characterisation for the gradient of the likelihood. Using these developments, for the nonlinear inverse problem of recovering the diffusivity (in divergence form models), we then show that the numerical evaluation of the likelihood and its gradient can be reduced to standard elliptic eigenvalue problems, solvable by powerful finite element methods. This enables the efficient implementation of a large class of statistical algorithms, including (i) preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and Langevin-type methods for posterior sampling, and (ii) gradient-based descent optimisation schemes to compute maximum likelihood and maximum-a-posteriori estimates. We showcase the effectiveness of these methods via extensive simulation studies in a nonparametric Bayesian model with Gaussian process priors. Interestingly, the optimisation schemes provided satisfactory numerical recovery while exhibiting rapid convergence towards stationary points despite the problem nonlinearity; thus our approach may lead to significant computational speed-ups. The reproducible code is available online at https://github.com/MattGiord/LF-Diffusion.</description>

      <title>Scalable network reconstruction in subquadratic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01404v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network reconstruction consists in determining the unobserved pairwise couplings between $N$ nodes given only observational data on the resulting behavior that is conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle to the scalability of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic complexity of $\Omega(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible pairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most networks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is only $O(N)$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems that significantly outperforms this quadratic baseline. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic second neighbor search (Dong et al., 2011) that produces the best edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. If we rely on the conjecture that the second-neighbor search finishes in log-linear time (Baron &amp; Darling, 2020; 2022), we demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm finishes in subquadratic time, with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\log N)$, but with a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\log^2N)$. In practice, we show that our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster than the quadratic baseline -- in a manner consistent with our theoretical analysis -- allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of nodes and edges.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Gibbs Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inadequate mixing of conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for multi-modal distributions presents a significant challenge in practical applications such as Bayesian inference and molecular dynamics. Addressing this, we propose Diffusive Gibbs Sampling (DiGS), an innovative family of sampling methods designed for effective sampling from distributions characterized by distant and disconnected modes. DiGS integrates recent developments in diffusion models, leveraging Gaussian convolution to create an auxiliary noisy distribution that bridges isolated modes in the original space and applying Gibbs sampling to alternately draw samples from both spaces. A novel Metropolis-within-Gibbs scheme is proposed to enhance mixing in the denoising sampling step. DiGS exhibits a better mixing property for sampling multi-modal distributions than state-of-the-art methods such as parallel tempering, attaining substantially improved performance across various tasks, including mixtures of Gaussians, Bayesian neural networks and molecular dynamics.</description>
