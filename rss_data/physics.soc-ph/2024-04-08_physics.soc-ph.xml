      <title>Cooperative Evolutionary Pressure and Diminishing Returns Might Explain the Fermi Paradox: On What Super-AIs Are Like</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an evolutionary approach, the basis of morality can be explained as adaptations to problems of cooperation. With 'evolution' taken in a broad sense, evolving AIs that satisfy the conditions for evolution to apply will be subject to the same cooperative evolutionary pressure as biological entities. Here the adaptiveness of increased cooperation as material safety and wealth increase is discussed -- for humans, for other societies, and for AIs. Diminishing beneficial returns from increased access to material resources also suggests the possibility that, on the whole, there will be no incentive to for instance colonize entire galaxies, thus providing a possible explanation of the Fermi paradox, wondering where everybody is. It is further argued that old societies could engender, give way to, super-AIs, since it is likely that super-AIs are feasible, and fitter. Closing is an aside on effective ways for morals and goals to affect life and society, emphasizing environments, cultures, and laws, and exemplified by how to eat.
  Appended are an algorithm for colonizing for example a galaxy quickly, models of the evolution of cooperation and fairness under diminishing returns, and software for simulating signaling development. It is also noted that there can be no exponential colonization or reproduction, for mathematical reasons, as each entity takes up a certain amount of space.</description>

      <title>Cultural influence on autonomous vehicles acceptance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and other intelligent transport systems have been evolving rapidly and are being increasingly deployed worldwide. Previous work has shown that perceptions of autonomous vehicles and attitudes towards them depend on various attributes, including the respondent's age, education level and background. These findings with respect to age and educational level are generally uniform, such as showing that younger respondents are typically more accepting of autonomous vehicles, as are those with higher education levels. However the influence of factors such as culture are much less clear cut. In this paper we analyse the relationship between acceptance of autonomous vehicles and national culture by means of the well-known Hofstede cultural model.</description>

      <title>Energy Imports and Infrastructure in a Carbon-Neutral European Energy System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Importing renewable energy to Europe offers many potential benefits, including reduced energy costs, lower pressure on infrastructure development, and less land-use within Europe. However, there remain many open questions: on the achievable cost reductions, how much should be imported, whether the energy vector should be electricity, hydrogen or hydrogen derivatives like ammonia or steel, and their impact on Europe's domestic energy infrastructure needs. This study integrates the TRACE global energy supply chain model with the sector-coupled energy system model for Europe PyPSA-Eur to explore scenarios with varying import volumes, costs, and vectors. We find system cost reductions of 1-14%, depending on assumed import costs, with diminishing returns for larger import volumes and a preference for methanol, steel and hydrogen imports. Keeping some domestic power-to-X production is beneficial for integrating variable renewables, utilising waste heat from fuel synthesis and leveraging local sustainable carbon sources. Our findings highlight the need for coordinating import strategies with infrastructure policy and reveal maneuvering space for incorporating non-cost decision factors.</description>

      <title>Interplay of network structure and talent configuration on wealth dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The economic success of individuals is often determined by a combination of talent, luck, and assistance from others. We introduce a new agent-based model that simultaneously considers talent, luck, and social interaction. This model allows us to explore how network structure (how agents interact) and talent distribution among agents affect the dynamics of capital accumulation through analytical and numerical methods. We identify a phenomenon as "talent configuration effect", which refers to the influence of how talent is allocated to individuals (nodes) in the network. We analyze this effect through two key properties: talent assortativity (TA) and talent-degree correlation (TD). In particular, we focus on three economic indicators: growth rate ($n_{\rm rate}$), Gini coefficient (inequality: $n_{\rm Gini}$), and meritocratic fairness ($n_{LT}$). This investigation helps us understand the interplay between talent configuration and network structure on capital dynamics. We find that, in the short term, positive correlations exist between TA and TD for all three economic indicators. Furthermore, the dominant factor influencing capital dynamics depends on the network topology. In scale free networks, TD has a stronger influence on the economic indices than TA. Conversely, in lattice-like networks, TA plays a more significant role. Our findings intuitively explain why highly talented agents are more likely to become central hubs in the network and why social connections tend to form between individuals with similar talent levels (socioeconomic homophily).</description>

      <title>Nightclub bar dynamics: statistics of serving times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the statistical properties of drink serving in a nightclub bar, utilizing a stochastic model to characterize pedestrian dynamics within the venue. Our model comprises a system of n agents moving across an underlying square lattice of size l representing the nightclub venue. Each agent can exist in one of three states: thirsty, served, or dancing. The dynamics governing the state changes are influenced by a memory time, denoted as {\tau}, which reflects their drinking habits. Agents' movement throughout the lattice is controlled by a parameter {\alpha} which measures the impetus towards/away from the bar. When {\alpha} = 0, a power-law distribution emerges due to the non-objectivity of the agents. As {\alpha} moves into intermediate values, an exponential behavior is observed, as it becomes possible to mitigate the drastic jamming effects in this scenario. However, for higher {\alpha} values, the power-law distribution resurfaces due to increased jamming. We also demonstrate that the average concentration of served, thirsty, and dancing agents provide a reliable indicator of when the system reaches a jammed state. Subsequently, we construct a comprehensive map of the system's stationary state, supporting the idea that for high densities, {\alpha} is not relevant, but for lower densities, the optimal values of measurements occurs at high values of {\alpha}. To complete the analysis, we evaluate the conditional persistence, which measures the probability of an agent failing to receive their drink despite attempting to do so. In addition to contributing to the field of pedestrian dynamics, the present results serve as valuable indicators to assist commercial establishments in providing better services to their clients, tailored to the average drinking habits of their customers.</description>

      <title>The rules of multiplayer cooperation in networks of communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community organization permeates both social and biological complex systems. To study its interplay with behavior emergence, we model mobile structured populations with multiplayer interactions. We derive general analytical methods for evolutionary dynamics under high home fidelity when populations self-organize into networks of asymptotically isolated communities. In this limit, community organization dominates over the network structure and emerging behavior is independent of network topology. We obtain the rules of multiplayer cooperation in networks of communities for different types of social dilemmas. The success of cooperation is a result of the benefits shared amongst communal cooperators outperforming the benefits reaped by defectors in mixed communities. Under weak selection, cooperation can evolve and be stable for any size (Q) and number (M) of communities if the reward-to-cost ratio (V/K) of public goods is higher than a critical value. Community organization is a solid mechanism for sustaining the evolution of cooperation under public goods dilemmas, particularly when populations are organized into a higher number of smaller communities. Contrary to public goods dilemmas relating to production, the multiplayer Hawk-Dove (HD) dilemma is a commons dilemma focusing on the fair consumption of preexisting resources. This game holds mixed results but tends to favour cooperation under larger communities, highlighting that the two types of social dilemmas might lead to solid differences in the behaviour adopted under community structure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pampilhosa da Serra Space Observatory (PASO) is located in the center of the continental Portuguese territory, in the heart of a certified Dark Sky destination by the Starlight Foundation (Aldeias do Xisto) and has been an instrumental asset to advance science, education and astrotourism certifications. PASO hosts astronomy and Space Situational Awareness (SSA) activities including a node of the Portuguese Space Surveillance \&amp; Tracking (SST) infrastructure network, such as a space radar currently in test phase using GEM radiotelescope, a double Wide Field of View Telescope system, a EUSST optical sensor telescope. These instruments allow surveillance of satellite and space debris in LEO, MEO and GEO orbits. The WFOV telescope offers spectroscopy capabilities enabling light curve analysis and cosmic sources monitoring. Instruments for Space Weather are being considered for installation to monitor solar activities and expand the range of SSA services.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity in the use of SIR models to fit epidemic incidence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When fitting a multi-parameter model to a data set, computer algorithms may suggest that a range of parameters provide equally reasonable fits, making the parameter estimation difficult. Here, we prove this fact for an SIR model. We say a set of parameter values is a good fit to outbreak data if the solution has the data's three most significant characteristics: the standard deviation, the mean time, and the total number of cases. In our model, in addition to the "basic reproduction number" $R_0$, three other parameters need to be estimated to fit a solution to outbreak data. We will show that those parameters can be chosen so that each gives a linear transformation of a solution's incidence data. As a result, we show that for every choice of $R_0&gt;1$, there is a good fit for each outbreak. We also illustrate our results by providing the least square best fits of the New York City and London data sets of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Furthermore, we show how versions of the SIR model with $N$ compartments have far more good fits- - indeed a high dimensional set of good fits -- for each target -- showing that more complicated models may have an even greater problem in overparametrizing outbreak characteristics.</description>

      <title>Fast degree-preserving rewiring of complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new, fast, degree-preserving rewiring algorithm for altering the assortativity of complex networks, which we call \textit{Fast total link (FTL) rewiring} algorithm. Commonly used existing algorithms require a large number of iterations, in particular in the case of large dense networks. This can especially be problematic when we wish to study ensembles of networks. In this work we aim to overcome aforementioned scalability problems by performing a rewiring of all edges at once to achieve a very high assortativity value before rewiring samples of edges at once to reduce this high assortativity value to the target value. The proposed method performs better than existing methods by several orders of magnitude for a range of structurally diverse complex networks, both in terms of the number of iterations taken, and time taken to reach a given assortativity value. Here we test our proposed algorithm on networks with up to $100,000$ nodes and around $750,000$ edges and find that the relative improvements in speed remain, showing that the algorithm is both efficient and scalable.</description>

      <title>Degree-corrected distribution-free model for community detection in weighted networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.10553v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A degree-corrected distribution-free model is proposed for weighted social networks with latent structural information. The model extends the previous distribution-free models by considering variation in node degree to fit real-world weighted networks, and it also extends the classical degree-corrected stochastic block model from un-weighted network to weighted network. We design an algorithm based on the idea of spectral clustering to fit the model. Theoretical framework on consistent estimation for the algorithm is developed under the model. Theoretical results when edge weights are generated from different distributions are analyzed. We also propose a general modularity as an extension of Newman's modularity from un-weighted network to weighted network. Using experiments with simulated and real-world networks, we show that our method significantly outperforms the uncorrected one, and the general modularity is effective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04389v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of community detection in overlapping weighted networks, where nodes can belong to multiple communities and edge weights can be finite real numbers. To model such complex networks, we propose a general framework - the mixed membership distribution-free (MMDF) model. MMDF has no distribution constraints of edge weights and can be viewed as generalizations of some previous models, including the well-known mixed membership stochastic blockmodels. Especially, overlapping signed networks with latent community structures can also be generated from our model. We use an efficient spectral algorithm with a theoretical guarantee of convergence rate to estimate community memberships under the model. We also propose the fuzzy weighted modularity to evaluate the quality of community detection for overlapping weighted networks with positive and negative edge weights. We then provide a method to determine the number of communities for weighted networks by taking advantage of our fuzzy weighted modularity. Numerical simulations and real data applications are carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of our mixed membership distribution-free model and our fuzzy weighted modularity.</description>

      <title>Rational social distancing policy during epidemics with limited healthcare capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemics of infectious diseases posing a serious risk to human health have occurred throughout history. During recent epidemics there has been much debate about policy, including how and when to impose restrictions on behaviour. Policymakers must balance a complex spectrum of objectives, suggesting a need for quantitative tools. Whether health services might be `overwhelmed' has emerged as a key consideration. Here we show how costly interventions, such as taxes or subsidies on behaviour, can be used to exactly align individuals' decision making with government preferences even when these are not aligned. In order to achieve this, we develop a nested optimisation algorithm of both the government intervention strategy and the resulting equilibrium behaviour of individuals. We focus on a situation in which the capacity of the healthcare system to treat patients is limited and identify conditions under which the disease dynamics respect the capacity limit. We find an extremely sharp drop in peak infections at a critical maximum infection cost in the government's objective function. This is in marked contrast to the gradual reduction of infections if individuals make decisions without government intervention. We find optimal interventions vary less strongly in time when interventions are costly to the government and that the critical cost of the policy switch depends on how costly interventions are.</description>

      <title>Rational social distancing in epidemics with uncertain vaccination timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During epidemics people may reduce their social and economic activity to lower their risk of infection. Such social distancing strategies will depend on information about the course of the epidemic but also on when they expect the epidemic to end, for instance due to vaccination. Typically it is difficult to make optimal decisions, because the available information is incomplete and uncertain. Here, we show how optimal decision-making depends on information about vaccination timing in a differential game in which individual decision-making gives rise to Nash equilibria, and the arrival of the vaccine is described by a probability distribution. We predict stronger social distancing the earlier the vaccination is expected and also the more sharply peaked its probability distribution. In particular, equilibrium social distancing only meaningfully deviates from the no-vaccination equilibrium course if the vaccine is expected to arrive before the epidemic would have run its course. We demonstrate how the probability distribution of the vaccination time acts as a generalised form of discounting, with the special case of an exponential vaccination time distribution directly corresponding to regular exponential discounting.</description>
