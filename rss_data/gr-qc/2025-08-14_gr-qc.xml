      <title>Quantum-Corrected Deformation of RN-AdS Black Holes with a Cloud of Strings Immersed in Quintessential-like Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), we investigate the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole (BH) solution coupled with a cloud of strings in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background, surrounded by a quintessence-like fluid. We begin by analyzing the optical properties of the BH through null geodesic motion, deriving an effective potential that governs photon dynamics. This effective potential is central to understanding key phenomena such as photon trajectories, circular null orbits, photon sphere, and the resulting BH shadow. Subsequently, we study the dynamics of neutral test particles by deriving effective potential that describes their motion. Using the potential, we compute the specific energy and specific angular momentum of neutral particles in circular orbits around the BH and analyze the outcomes. We also investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and demonstrate how various geometrical and physical properties influence the radius of ISCO. Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic properties of the BH solution by deriving key quantities such as the Hawking temperature, entropy, Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and specific heat capacity. Throughout the study, we demonstrate that the geodesic structure, scalar field behavior, and thermodynamic properties are significantly influenced by parameters such as the string cloud, quantum correction, electric charge, the surrounding quintessence-like fluid, and the AdS curvature radius.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation and Spin in Matter Domination Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we calculate the mass distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the matter-dominated (MD) era by the peak theory. We apply the Zel'dovich approximation to track the nonlinear evolution of overdensities and compute the PBH abundance and mass function by incorporating a PBH formation criterion based on the hoop conjecture. We find that the PBH abundance $\beta$ follows the scaling law $\beta \simeq A_\gamma \sigma_h^{*5}$ for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$. Here, $\sigma_h^*$ is the quantity that characterizes the variance of the density fluctuation at the horizon entry. We also find that, in contrast to the previous estimates, the PBH spin is very small for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$ but could be larger for larger $\sigma_h^*$ and broader power spectra. Finally, specializing to a monochromatic power spectrum, we prove analytically that the PBH mass distribution becomes effectively monochromatic and reveal that the resultant PBH abundance is approximately 19 times the previous prediction.</description>

      <title>Scalar and vector modes in inflation with antisymmetric tensor field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scalar and vector modes arising from cosmological perturbations within the framework of an inflationary scenario driven by an antisymmetric tensor field, minimally coupled to gravity. After eliminating gauge artifacts, there remain four scalar and six vector modes of interest which can be studied separately. We analyze the stability of these modes, while looking for generic instabilities like ghost and gradient instabilities that could potentially plague the theory. Further, we investigate the evolution of these modes across different regimes, particularly subhorizon and superhorizon scales.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Quantization of Electrodynamics and Linearized Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified stochastic framework in which a velocity- and helicity-reversing Poisson process gives rise to the Telegrapher's equation. Analytic continuation to the complex plane results in Dirac-like evolution equations for electromagnetic and linearized gravitational fields. A small but nonzero mass parameter is essential to enable helicity reversals. Yet, the correct massless wave equations are recovered as the physically relevant massless limit is approached smoothly, with the singular point excluded from the construction. Remarkably, probability does not enter as an external postulate as in the Born rule in standard quantum mechanics -- but is intrinsic to the stochastic process. This probabilistic structure becomes embedded in the wave fields through a natural rescaling by the Planck length.</description>

      <title>Precession of spherical orbits for the spacetime without $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry induced by NUT charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical evidence has hinted at the existence of a nonzero NUT charge, which breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of spacetime and induces novel features in geodesics. In this work, we investigate the Lense-Thirring precession of the spherical orbits in the Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime, with particular emphasis on its connection to recent observations of black hole jet precession. We analyze the reflection symmetry breaking in trajectories of the spherical orbits and extract their precession angular velocity. It is worth noting that in the absence of spin, the spherical orbits reduce to tilted circular orbits without precession, whereas for nonzero spin, the precession angular velocity increases with the absolute value of the NUT charge. We then model the motion of particles near the warp radius of a tilted accretion disk using the spherical orbits and constrain the black hole parameter space based on the observed jet precession of M87*. The results indicate that regions with low spin and large NUT charge were excluded, and that the jet precession measurements cannot distinguish the sign of the NUT charge. The excluded region is larger for retrograde accretion disks than for prograde ones. We also find that this observation do not allow a clear distinction between black holes and naked singularities. Moreover, we also explore how black hole parameters influence the structure of accretion disk. These results have important theoretical and astronomical significance for us to deeply understand NUT space-time.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the maximum mass limit of strange stars in higher-order curvature-matter coupled gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the maximum mass limit of strange stars within the framework of modified gravity described by $f(\tilde{R},T)=R+\alpha R^{2}+2\beta T$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ characterise the contributions from higher-order curvature terms and the coupling between matter and geometry, respectively. By deriving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the modified field equations and applying the MIT bag model equation of state, we obtain the corresponding mass-radius relationships for strange stars. Our results show that, for suitable choices of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and bag parameter $(B_{g})$, the maximum mass limit of strange stars exceeds their general relativistic counterpart. Specifically, our model yields a maximum mass up to $3.11~M_{\odot}$, suggesting that the lighter companion of GW190814 could plausibly be a strange star within this theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>'Stealth' singularities from self-gravitating fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analytic solution to the Einstein-Dirac equations formulated by Finster, Smoller, and Yau [Phys. Rev. D 59, 104020 (1999)] to describe the stationary states of a pair of gravitationally interacting neutral fermions. The fermions' wavefunction in our analytic solution, as in their numerical ones, is both exponentially localized and normalizable. However, our solution differs from theirs in two key respects: it features a naked spacetime singularity at the origin, and the gravitational (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) mass of the localized object is zero, making it gravitationally undetectable to an external observer. This is despite the arbitrarily large mass of the constituent fermions. This unexpected result may have significant implications for astronomy and cosmology, as it gives a mechanism by which mass could become 'hidden' during the universe's evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the effort to characterize gravitational-wave searches and detector sensitivity to different types of compact binary coalescences during the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' fourth observing run. We discuss the design requirements and example use cases for this data product, constructed from $&gt; 4.33\times10^8$ injections during O4a alone. We also identify subtle effects with high confidence, like diurnal duty cycles within detectors. This paper accompanies a public data release of the curated injection set, and the appendixes give detailed examples of how to use the publicly available data.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Hubble tension with warm inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The validity of warm inflation is investigated in the light of recent CMB missions in both strong and weak dissipative regimes. The tensor to scalar ratio of various inflationary models is found to be consistent with the recent CMB results for different models of warm inflation. The role of dissipation on the popular models of warm inflation in the context of supersymmetry and string theory is investigated. Further, the effect of dissipation coefficient of warm inflation on the Hubble parameter and its role in accounting the Hubble tension is examined. Warm inflation embodies superstring theory and can provide a platform to test quantum gravity in multi field scenario.</description>

      <title>Effects of light-mass fermionic dark matter on the equilibrium and stability of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) can be used as laboratories to test strong gravity and high-density regimes, once their equation of state is not so uncertain as the one of neutron stars. This makes them also a useful tool to constrain dark-matter models. In this work, we study dark matter white dwarfs (DMWD) composed of white dwarf matter admixed with fermionic dark matter in a two-fluid general relativistic framework. Dark matter particles are considered to have masses between $0.1-10$ GeV. The equilibrium configurations and stability are derived, showing that the DMWD can be more compact, with masses around 1.3 $M\odot$ and radii around 500 km. The increasing compactness leads to changes in the fundamental modes of radial oscillations ($\sim20\%$ for 0.1 GeV DM), which produce detectable shifts in GW frequencies. The interplay between dark matter and normal matter thus provides a compelling avenue for interpreting deviations in observed WD properties and for placing constraints on DM characteristics through astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Can stellar physics explain GW231123?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17} M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52} M_\odot $ -- well within or above the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160 \rm M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing a significant ingredient that correlates masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap, implying that stellar evolution alone is sufficient to explain GW231123. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.</description>

      <title>De Sitter Complexity Grows Linearly in the Static Patch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observable universe has undergone periods of expansion that are well approximated by de Sitter (dS) space. Still lacking is a quantum mechanical description of dS, both globally and when restricted to the static patch. We develop a novel prescription for computing holographic complexity in the dS static patch to determine its microscopic features. Specifically, we propose that the natural candidate for dS complexity is the volume of extremal timelike surfaces restricted to the static patch, anchored to the cosmological horizon or an observer worldline. Our anchoring prescription provides a clear definition of a reference state, overcoming a common ambiguity in prior definitions of de Sitter holographic complexity. The late-time growth of our complexity functional is linear and proportional to the number of degrees of freedom associated to the cosmological horizon, and therefore does not exhibit hyperfast growth. Our results imply the dS static patch is characterized by a quantum mechanical system, with a finite dimensional Hilbert space whose evolution is governed by a chaotic Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. The analysis reveals that the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, changes with redshift, and this change is significantly influenced by the LRG1 datapoint from the DESI DR2 survey. We find that including LRG1 strongly affects the predictions of these models, especially for $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_0$, with the latter shifting from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 datapoint. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0&gt;-1$, $\omega_a&lt;0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a&lt;-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in framework of nonmetricity gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way.</description>

Abstract: We study frequentist confidence intervals based on graphical profile likelihoods (Wilks' theorem, likelihood integration), and the Feldman-Cousins (FC) prescription, a generalisation of the Neyman belt construction, in a setting with non-Gaussian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posteriors. Our simplified setting allows us to recycle the MCMC chain as an input in all methods, including mock simulations underlying the FC approach. We find all methods agree to within $10 \%$ in the close to Gaussian regime, but extending methods beyond their regime of validity leads to greater discrepancies. Importantly, we recover a $\sim 2 \sigma$ shift in cosmological parameters between low and high redshift cosmic chronometer data with the FC method, but only when one fits all parameters back to the mocks. We observe that fixing parameters, a common approach in the literature, risks underestimating confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Deflection Reconstruction: A New Technique to Search for Gravitational Waves with the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through the Earth cause a correlated pattern of time-dependent deflections of the apparent position of astronomical sources. We build upon standard lensing reconstruction techniques to develop a new time-dependent quadratic estimator, providing a novel technique to search for the deflections produced by GWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that the time-dependent deflection reconstruction is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than the ordinary static lensing estimator, and it can be employed with the data collected by existing and future CMB surveys, without requiring any modification to the experimental or survey design. We demonstrate that CMB surveys offer sensitivity to GWs across a broad frequency range: while the sensitivity will not be competitive over the frequency range covered by pulsar timing arrays, it does extend coverage to both lower and higher frequencies. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be extended to search for other time-varying signals, and also how it can be applied to surveys at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Higher-Order Phase Transitions in Binary Neutron-Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate quark deconfinement in neutrons stars and their mergers, focusing on the effects of higher orders for the phase transition between hadronic and quark matter. The different descriptions we use to describe matter microscopically contain varying particle degrees of freedom, including nucleons, hyperons, Delta baryons, and light and strange quarks. We use tabulated equations of state from the CompOSE database in which the quark deconfinement phase transition is described as being first-order, and then smooth it out by introducing a percolation, replacing the single first-order phase transition with two transitions of second or third order. We then perform binary neutron-star merger simulations using these new equations of st ate, focusing on groups of binaries with the same single-star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, but different equations of state. We go on to discuss differences in their evolution, and the ramifications for interpreting future gravitational wave observations and the potential to learn about dense matter.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Symmetries of Kerr Black Hole Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent introduction of the Dirac bracket framework to compute spinning observables for the scattering of Kerr black holes, we initiate the study of conserved quantities from an on-shell amplitude perspective. We establish new results for the conservation of energy, angular momentum, the R\"udiger invariant and the quadrupolar Carter constant using the spinning radial action extracted from the literature both in the probe limit and beyond, up to third post-Minkowskian order in the conservative sector. Furthermore, we offer a new perspective on the spin-shift symmetry of the radial action, clarifying its role in the dynamics. Finally, we define a new on-shell notion of asymptotic integrability in the Liouville sense and present strong evidence that it is surprisingly satisfied by a spinning probe in Kerr up to quartic order in the probe spin, to all orders in the post-Minkowskian expansion. We further establish integrability beyond the probe limit at low PM orders. Our results suggest important new implications for the dynamics of Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>Scalar-induced gravitational waves with non-Gaussianity up to all orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are ubiquitous in many early-Universe processes accompanied by non-Gaussianity; hence, precise calculations of SIGWs involve a full understanding of non-Gaussianity. In this Letter, we propose to use the lattice simulations to directly calculate the energy density spectra of SIGWs with non-Gaussianity up to all orders. Our proposal has been first verified to match the existing semi-analytical results with non-Gaussianity, and then applied to more general cases, including high-order primordial non-Gaussianities, the logarithmic dependence in curvature perturbations, the curvaton model, and the ultra slow-roll model. We find that even a modest non-Gaussianity can significantly alter ultraviolet behaviors in SIGW spectra, necessitating special cautions in future detections as well as mutual constraints on/from primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Advancing Glitch Classification in Gravity Spy: Multi-view Fusion with Attention-based Machine Learning for Advanced LIGO's Fourth Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first successful detection of gravitational waves by ground-based observatories, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), marked a breakthrough in our comprehension of the Universe. However, due to the unprecedented sensitivity required to make such observations, gravitational-wave detectors also capture disruptive noise sources called glitches, which can potentially be confused for or mask gravitational-wave signals. To address this problem, a community-science project, Gravity Spy, incorporates human insight and machine learning to classify glitches in LIGO data. The machine-learning classifier, integrated into the project since 2017, has evolved over time to accommodate increasing numbers of glitch classes. Despite its success, limitations have arisen in the ongoing LIGO fourth observing run (O4) due to the architecture's simplicity, which led to poor generalization and inability to handle multi-time window inputs effectively. We propose an advanced classifier for O4 glitches. Using data from previous observing runs, we evaluate different fusion strategies for multi-time window inputs, using label smoothing to counter noisy labels, and enhancing interpretability through attention module-generated weights. Our new O4 classifier shows improved performance, and will enhance glitch classification, aiding in the ongoing exploration of gravitational-wave phenomena.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the arbitrary dimensional FRW universe: Joule-Thomson expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics especially the Joule-Thomson expansion of the $n$-dimensional FRW (Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe with a perfect fluid. We derive the thermodynamic equations of state $P=P(V, T)$ for the $n$-dimensional FRW universe in Einstein gravity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ is defined by the work density $W$ of the perfect fluid, $i.e.$ $P\equiv W$. Furthermore, we present the Joule-Thomson expansion as an application of these equations of state to elucidate the cooling-heating properties of the $n$-dimensional FRW universe. We determine the inversion temperature and inversion pressure in the FRW universe with arbitrary dimensions for the first time, and illustrate the characteristics of inversion curves and isenthalpic curves in the $T$-$P$ plane. We also examine constraints on the perfect fluid in the FRW universe, as derived from the cooling-heating transition point. This study offers insights into deepening our comprehension of cooling and heating regions in the FRW universe, thereby revealing its expansion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A note on the conversion of orbital angles for extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We outline a practical scheme for converting between three commonly used sets of phases to describe the trajectories of extreme mass ratio inspirals; quasi-Keplerian angles, Mino time action-angles, and Boyer-Lindquist time action-angles (as utilised by the FastEMRIWaveform package). Conversion between Boyer-Lindquist time action angles and quasi-Keplerian angles is essential for the construction of a source frame for adiabatic inspirals that can be related to the source frames used by other gravitational wave source modelling techniques. While converting from quasi-Keplerian angles to Boyer-Lindquist time action angles via Mino time action-angles can be done analytically, the same does not hold for the converse, and so we make use of an efficient numerical root-finding method. We demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme by comparing two calculations for an eccentric and inclined geodesic orbit in Kerr spacetime using two different sets of orbital angles. We have made our implementations available in Mathematica, C, and Python.</description>

      <title>Causal Classification of Pathological Misner-Type Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate three causality-violating spacetimes: Misner space (including Kip Thorne's ``moving wall'' model), the pseudo-Schwarzschild spacetime, and a new model introduced here, the pseudo-Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime. Despite their different physical origins -- ranging from a flat vacuum solution to a black-hole-type vacuum solution to a non-vacuum model requiring exotic matter -- all three share a common warped-product structure, $2$-dimensional cylindrical base metrics of Eddington-Finkelstein type, and fundamental causal features such as Cauchy and chronology horizons, acausal regions, and analogous geodesic behaviour. Building on a conjecture first proposed in 2016, we present a formal proof that the three models are \emph{pairwise isocausal} on their universal covers and on suitable causally regular regions of their compactified forms. The proof is constructive, providing explicit causal bijections between the models and identifying a concrete deck-equivariance criterion for when the isocausality descends to the compactified spacetimes. In the absence of equivariance, the covering result does not imply global isocausality, and at most a one-way causal relation holds between the compactified models. These results supply a rigorous causal classification linking these spacetimes, placing them within a unified Misner-type family and providing a framework for extending the classification to other causality-violating solutions.</description>

Abstract: We study the motion of particles in the background of a scalar-tensor theory of gravity in which the scalar field is kinetically coupled to the Einstein tensor and we present the null geodesic structure for asymptotically flat, AdS, and dS Horndeski black holes, studying the effect of the cosmological constant on the orbits. Also, we consider three classical test of the gravity in the solar system, such as, the bending of the light, the gravitational redshift, and the Shapiro time delay in order to constraint the coupling parameters of the scalar field to gravity. Calculating the Lyapunov exponent we explore the stability of these geodesics for various values of the cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole spacetimes that exhibit integrable singularities have gained considerable interest as alternatives to both regular and singular black holes. Unlike most known regular black hole solutions, these models evade the formation of an inner horizon, thereby circumventing the well-known instability issues associated with such structures. Moreover, it has been suggested that the finite tidal forces near integrable singularities, may allow for a traversable extension beyond them. In this work, we present a set of arguments -- both theoretical, concerning test-field perturbations and the accumulation of matter at the singularity, and practical, related to the behavior of physical probes and extended objects -- with the aim of assessing the validity of the proposed integrability condition, and the feasibility of traversing such singularities. Our analysis highlights key subtleties that challenge the viability of said extensions as alternatives to regular black holes, and underscores the need for a more rigorous investigation of their physical implications.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the time-domain LISA response model with central finite differences and hybridization techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) response is crucial for gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis. A key computational challenge lies in evaluating time-delay interferometry (TDI) variables, which require projecting GW polarizations onto the LISA arms at different retarded times. Without approximations, the full LISA response is computationally expensive, and traditional approaches, such as the long-wavelength approximation, accelerate the response calculation at the cost of reducing accuracy at high frequencies. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid time-domain response for LISA that balances computational efficiency and accuracy across the binary's evolution. Our method is applicable to massive black hole binaries and implements a fast low-frequency approximation during the early inspiral$\unicode{x2013}$where most of these binaries spend most of the time in the sensitive frequency band of LISA$\unicode{x2013}$while reserving the computationally intensive full-response calculations for the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown phases. The low-frequency approximation (LFA) is based on Taylor expanding the response quantities around a chosen evaluation time such that time delays correspond to central finite differences. Our hybrid approach supports CPU and GPU implementations, TDI generations 1.5 and 2.0, and flexible time-delay complexity, and has the potential to accelerate parts of the global fit and reduce energy consumption. We also test our LFA and hybrid responses on eccentric binaries, and we perform parameter estimation for a "golden" binary. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of our low-frequency response for "deep alerts" by performing inspiral-only Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Towards relativistic inspirals into black holes surrounded by matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals, compact objects spiraling into massive black holes, represent key sources for future space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA. The inspirals will occur within rich astrophysical environments containing gravitating matter. Motivated by this, we develop a fully relativistic framework for inspirals under the gravitational influence of matter environments. Our approach employs a two-parameter perturbation expansion in the mass ratio and an environmental parameter. This yields a modified Teukolsky equation capturing the leading cross-order. We then implement a simple pole-dipole approximation of an axisymmetric environment through a thin matter shell and restrict to non-rotating black holes. As a result, we obtain a piecewise type D spacetime. This enables the use of Teukolsky-based methods while accounting for junction physics. The presence of the matter shell leads to effectively non-separable boundary conditions for the Teukolsky scalar and introduces mode mixing between adjacent multipoles. Additionally, the shell oscillates under the wave perturbation of the inspiral, contributing to the overall flux. The framework provides novel insights into the global dynamics of gravitational radiation in tidal environments. Furthermore, it represents a complete theoretical foundation for a future computation of inspirals and waveforms in our environmental model.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present charged spherically symmetric anti-de Sitter black hole solutions in $d$ dimensions ($d \geq 5$) within the framework of extended Gauss--Bonnet gravity. Moreover, by employing dimensional regularization of the extended Gauss--Bonnet term, we further obtain charged anti-de Sitter black hole solutions in three- and four-dimensional spacetimes. Furthermore, we also obtain a three-dimensional rotating black hole solution in a special case. These solutions exhibit markedly different properties compared to their counterparts in standard Gauss--Bonnet gravity. Depending on the parameter space, the black hole may possess one, two, or even three horizons. Nonetheless, their asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity remains consistent with that of the corresponding black holes in general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an uncharged test particle in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime, solutions of two major types of orbits are presented, both in exact forms. First, for both prograde and retrograde motions, the radii of innermost stable circular orbits are expressed fully in terms of the outer and inner horizon radii just in the same form as Kerr black holes, despite the fact that Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes have three parameters. Second, closed analytic solutions are given to the problem of a test particle inspiraling toward the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black hole from innermost stable circular orbits at the infinitely distant past. These exact solutions can serve as a springboard for more general solutions and astrophysical applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Hysteresis in Reconstructed $f(R)$ Bounce Models: A Thermodynamic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emergence of cosmic hysteresis in cyclic bouncing universes within the framework of analytically reconstructed $f(R)$ gravity. Using exact bouncing scale factor solutions of exponential and power-law forms, we reconstruct the corresponding $f(R)$ models and investigate the thermodynamic behavior of a minimally coupled scalar field in these geometries. The pressure evolution during expansion and contraction phases is shown to be asymmetric, leading to a non-vanishing thermodynamic work integral over each cycle, defined by $\oint p_\phi\, dV$. We identify closed hysteresis loops in the equation-of-state space and quantify the net energy transfer per cycle. Our results reveal that such reconstructed $f(R)$ models generically support irreversible evolution, demonstrating a natural emergence of the thermodynamic arrow of time. These findings provide new insight into the dissipative features of modified gravity and the long-term dynamics of cyclic cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>A general Fourier expansion of post-Newtonian binary dynamics based on quasi-Keplerian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have introduced a new Fourier-expansion technique for computing gravitational-wave emission from non-spinning binaries in the post-Newtonian framework. Using this approach, we derived the full set of 3PN dynamical quantities and gravitational-wave Fourier modes and have released the corresponding numerical code as open source. Furthermore, applying the method to the tail contribution of the energy flux, we found that it can be resummed into an exceptionally compact expression. These advances pave the way for more convenient and accurate frequency-domain waveform modeling in the future.</description>

      <title>Open system dynamics from fundamental Lagrangian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Weyl-Einsteinian-Cubic Gravity as a Gauge Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Weyl-Einsteinian-Cubic Gravity (ECG) as a cubic gauge theory of gravity via abelian gauge and properly tuned compensating real scalar fields. The model is free from any dimensionful parameters. The bare ECG emerges as the lower energy limit of the Weyl-ECG in the local {\it non}-conformal-invariant vacua (i.e., broken phase) in the maximally symmetric spacetimes fixing the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field to the Planck mass scale. Here, the natural presence of (anti-) de Sitter backgrounds spontaneously breaks Weyl's local conformal symmetry akin to the Higgs mechanism, while it is radiatively broken at the renormalization scale at the one-loop level in flat vacua through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The model allows anti-de Sitter and flat spaces but does not allow de Sitter to be vacuum spacetime solutions. The properties of the model deserve further exploration, specifically, those of nonperturbative (e.g., instantons and/or anti-instantons) contributions, for example, in the resurgence or tachyon condensation context requires detailed study.</description>

      <title>QFT on Fuzzy AdS Spaces: Classical Limit and Boundary Correlation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theory on two- and three-dimensional fuzzy anti-de Sitter spaces is introduced and studied. We find a complete set of solutions to the fuzzy Klein-Gordon equation and identify the commutative limit in which they reduce to classical scalar field modes. After introducing the noncommutative boundary via semi-classical states, the fuzzy modes are used to obtain the boundary two-point function. In both two and three dimensions, this gives an interesting two-parameter deformation of the conformal two-point function. For the fuzzy AdS$_2$, the two-point function is given explicitly in terms of the Appell function $F_1$.</description>

      <title>Periodic Cosmic String Formation and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study string formation and dynamics in a scalar field theory with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. If a scalar field $\Phi$ is initially displaced from the minimum of a wine-bottle potential, even if uniformly over large spatial patches, small spatial perturbations to $\Phi$ grow via parametric resonance as $\Phi$ oscillates; this occurs for a wide range of initial $U(1)$ charge densities. The growth of perturbations leads to the formation of spatially coherent, temporally stable "counter-rotating regions" (CRR): spatially connected regions exhibiting $\Phi$ evolution with large, opposite-sign rotation speeds in field space which persist over long durations. These CRR are separated by domain boundaries that have a large field gradient and zero rotational speed in field space. String or vortex topological defects form, are confined to, and then annihilate periodically on these boundaries. We demonstrate these periodic dynamics with numerical simulations in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, in both Minkowski spacetime and in a radiation-dominated FLRW universe, and we explain some features of the evolution (semi-)analytically. At late times in an expanding universe, when $\Phi$ approaches the potential minimum, the CRR and vortices dissipate into scalar radiation. Phenomenologically, periodic bursts of string formation and annihilation can lead to periodic bursts of gravitational-wave production. For small initial $U(1)$ charge density, these gravitational-wave bursts can be synchronized across the whole Universe. Owing to their periodic nature, they could give rise to a gravitational-wave frequency spectrum consisting of a forest of peaks. These periodic scalar field dynamics also occur with large, untuned initial $U(1)$ charge density; they may thus have implications for models that depend on a coherent field rotation, such as kination and the axion kinetic-misalignment mechanism.

      <title>On the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to inflation beyond slow roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi approach is a powerful tool to describe super-Hubble dynamics during cosmological inflation in a non-linear way. A key assumption of this framework is to neglect anisotropic perturbations on large scales. We show that neglecting the anisotropic sector in the momentum constraint corresponds to discarding the non-adiabatic mode of scalar-field perturbations at large scales. Consequently, the Hamilton-Jacobi approach cannot be used to describe the evolution of large-scale perturbations during inflation beyond slow roll, when non-adiabatic fluctuations play an important role on super-Hubble scales due to the absence of an attractor trajectory. As an example, we analyse the case of cosmological perturbations during a phase of ultra-slow-roll inflation.</description>

      <title>Exploration of features in the black hole mass spectrum inspired by non-parametric analyses of gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current gravitational-wave data reveal structures in the mass function of binary compact objects. Properly modelling and deciphering such structures is the ultimate goal of gravitational-wave population analysis: in this context, non-parametric models are a powerful tool to infer the distribution of black holes from gravitational waves without committing to any specific functional form. Here, we aim to quantitatively corroborate the findings of non-parametric methods with parametrised models incorporating the features found in such analyses. We propose two modifications of the currently favoured PowerLaw+Peak model, inspired by non-parametric studies, and use them to analyse the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogue. Our analysis marginally supports the existence of two distinct, differently redshift-evolving subpopulations in the black hole primary mass function, and suggests that, to date, we are still unable to robustly assess the shape of the mass ratio distribution for symmetric ($q&gt;0.7$) binaries.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions: LISA Detection Prospects for RX J1301.9+2747</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One prominent model for quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is that they originate from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) involving stellar-mass objects orbiting around massive black holes and colliding with their accretion disks. We compute the gravitational wave signals from such a model, demonstrating that orbiter-disk interactions result in small frequency shifts and high-frequency tails due to the excitation of non-discrete modes. Interestingly, we show that QPE RX J1301.9+2747 could be detectable by future space-based gravitational wave detectors, provided a moderate eccentricity around $0.25$ and a mass exceeding $35\,M_\odot$ for the orbiter. Moreover, based on this QPE model, we show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the gravitational wave signals from QPEs, if detectable, will be sufficiently high to distinguish such systems from vacuum EMRIs and shed light on the origin of QPEs and environments around massive black holes.</description>
