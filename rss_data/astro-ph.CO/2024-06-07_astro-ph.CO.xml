      <title>An Empirical Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance Method in the Near Infrared. II. JWST NIRCam Wide Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tip of the red giant (TRGB) is a standardizable candle and is identifiable as the discontinuity at the bright extreme of the red giant branch (RGB) stars in color-magnitude diagram (CMD) space. The TRGB-based distance method has been calibrated and used to measured distances to galaxies out to $D\leq20$ Mpc with the $I$-band equivalent Hubble Space Telescope ($HST$) $F814W$ filter, and as an important rung in the distance ladder to measure the Hubble constant, $H_0$. In the infrared (IR), the TRGB apparent magnitude ranges from $1-2$ magnitudes brighter than in the optical, and now with the IR James Webb Space Telescope ($JWST$) observatory the feasible distance range of the TRGB method can be extended to $\sim50$ Mpc. However, in the IR the TRGB luminosity depends to varying degrees on stellar metallicity and age. In this study we standardize the TRGB luminosity using stellar colors as a proxy for metallicity/age to derive color-based corrections for the $JWST$ Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) short wavelength (SW) filters $F090W$, $F115W$, $F150W$ and the long wavelength (LW) filters $F277W$, $F356W,$ and $F444W$. We provide recommended filter combinations for distance measurements depending on the requisite precision. For science requiring high precision ($\leq1\%$ in distance) and robustness we recommend measuring the TRGB in $F090W$ vs $F090W-F150W$ or $F115W$ vs. $F115W-F277W$ with the caveat that even with $JWST$ long integration times will be necessary at further distances. If lower precision ($&gt;1.5\%$ in distance) can be tolerated, or if shorter integration times are desirable, we recommend measuring the TRGB in either $F115W$ or $F150W$ paired with $F356W$. We do not recommend $F444W$ for precision TRGB measurements due to its lower angular resolution.</description>

      <title>How much do we know the halo mass function? Predictions beyond resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a common gravitation virialized object in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, dark matter halo connects from the large-scale structure all the way down to galaxy and star formation. However, as the nature of dark matter particles is still unclear, the smallest halo that can be formed in the universe is still unknown. Based on some simple assumptions, this paper uses the \textsc{hmf} package to investigate different halo functions used to quantify its number and mass distributions -- the halo mass function and the integrated/differential mass function (IMF/DMF) respectively. The halo mass in this study extends from the galaxy cluster to the dark matter particle mass at the GeV scale. Surprisingly, different fitting functions for the HMF are in remarkable agreement, a scatter within 2 orders of magnitude, down to dark matter particle mass, of which the halo mass spans about 80 orders of magnitude and the HMF covers over 100 orders of magnitude. The DMF reveals an interesting and consistent peak at $\sim 10^{13} \hMsun$, which implies galaxy groups have the highest contribution to the total matter mass. Furthermore, the effects of cosmology parameters on these halo functions are also examined with the most massive halos, or these halo functions at the most massive halo mass end, more sensitive to them. Different behaviours of these halo functions due to the changes in cosmology parameters can be used to break the degeneracy between them.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on phenomenological emergent dark energy and barotropic dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. This proposal is based on extensive research on the extended properties of dark matter in the context of a cosmological constant and the intriguing findings that have emerged from our exploration of dark matter properties within the context of PEDE in our previous studies. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae, a prior on $H_0$ that based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al., and the combination of KiDS and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (KiDS+VIKING-450). The results indicate a preference for a positive dark matter equation of state parameter at 68\% confidence level for CMB+BAO, CMB+BAO+Pantheon and CMB+BAO+Pantheon+$H_0$ datasets. Furthermore, the Hubble tension between all of the datasets we used with R22 is very close to those of the PEDE, and the $S_8$ tension between Planck 2018 and KiDS+VIKING-450 is reduced from 2.3$\sigma$ in the PEDE model to 0.4$\sigma$ in the new model. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that PEDE favors our new model with very strong evidence from all the datasets considered in this study. Consequently, we conclude that the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model is not a viable alternative to the PEDE model.</description>

      <title>Calculating Bayesian evidence for inflationary models using CONNECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian evidence is a standard method used for comparing the ability of different models to fit available data and is used extensively in cosmology. However, since the evidence calculation involves performing an integral of the likelihood function over the entire space of model parameters this can be prohibitively expensive in terms of both CPU and time consumption. For example, in the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model and using CMB data from the Planck satellite, the dimensionality of the model space is over 30 (typically 6 cosmological parameters and 28 nuisance parameters). Even the simplest possible model requires $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ calls to an Einstein--Boltzmann solver such as CLASS or CAMB and takes several days.
  Here we present calculations of Bayesian evidence using the CONNECT framework to calculate cosmological observables. We demonstrate that we can achieve results comparable to those obtained using Einstein--Boltzmann solvers, but at a minute fraction of the computational cost. As a test case, we then go on to compute Bayesian evidence ratios for a selection of slow-roll inflationary models.
  In the setup presented here, the total computation time is completely dominated by the likelihood function calculation which now becomes the main bottleneck for increasing computation speed.</description>

      <title>Dynamics-based halo model for large scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modelling of the one-to-two halo transition has long been difficult to achieve. We demonstrate that physically motivated halo definitions that respect the bimodal phase-space distribution of dark matter particles near halos resolves this difficulty. Specifically, the two phase-space components are overlapping and correspond to: 1) particles \it orbiting \rm the halo; and 2) particles \it infalling \rm into the halo for the first time. Motivated by this decomposition, Garc\'ia [R. Garc\'ia et. al., MNRAS 521, 2464 (2023)] advocated for defining haloes as the collection of particles orbiting their self-generated potential. This definition identifies the traditional one-halo term of the halo--mass correlation function with the distribution of orbiting particles around a halo, while the two-halo term governs the distribution of infalling particles. We use dark matter simulations to demonstrate that the distribution of orbiting particles is finite and can be characterised by a single physical scale $r_{\rm h}$, which we refer to as the \it halo radius. \rm The two-halo term is described using a simple yet accurate empirical model based on the Zel'dovich correlation function. We further demonstrate that the halo radius imprints itself on the distribution of infalling particles at small scales. Our final model for the halo--mass correlation function is accurate at the $\approx 2\%$ level for $r \in [0.1,50]\ h^{-1}\ Mpc$. The Fourier transform of our best fit model describes the halo--mass power spectrum with comparable accuracy for $k\in [0.06, 6.0]\ h\ Mpc^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The Square Kilometer Array as a Cosmic Microwave Background Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments typically have observing bands covering the range 20 - 800 GHz. Certain science goals, including the detection of $\mu$-type distortions to the CMB spectrum and the characterization of low-frequency foregrounds, benefit from extended low-frequency coverage, but the standard CMB detector technology is not trivially adaptable to radio wavelengths. We propose using the upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) as a CMB experiment, exploiting the immense raw sensitivity of SKA, in particular in single-dish mode, to measure medium-to-large-angular-scale modes of the CMB at radio wavelengths. As a worked example, we forecast the power of SKA combined with the upcoming LiteBIRD CMB space mission to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity through measurements of the correlation between anisotropies in the CMB $\mu$-distortion, temperature, and $E$-mode polarization fields. We find that adding SKA data significantly improves the constraints on $f_\textrm{nl}$, even for spatially varying low-frequency foregrounds.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter induces time-dependent perturbations in the spacetime metric, enabling its gravitational direct detection. In this work, we propose using astrometry to detect dark matter. After reviewing the calculation of the metric in the presence of scalar dark matter, we study the influence of the perturbations on the apparent motion of astrophysical bodies. We apply our results to angular position measurements of quasars, whose vast distances from Earth present an opportunity to discover dark matter with a mass as low as $10^{-33} \, \mathrm{eV} $. We explore the prospects of very long baseline interferometry and optical astrometric survey measurements for detecting ultralight relics, finding that for the smallest masses, current astrometric surveys can detect dark matter moving locally with a velocity of $10^{-3}$ with energy density as low as $ 3 \times 10 ^{ - 11} ~{\rm GeV} / {\rm cm} ^3 $.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision astrometry offers a way to probe new physics. By measuring the angular position of light sources at unprecedented precision, astrometry could probe minuscule fluctuations of underlying spacetime. This work explores the possibility of probing ultralight dark matter candidates using precision astrometry. Through the coherent and stochastic density fluctuations over the scale of its wavelength, ultralight dark matter perturbs the propagation of light and the geodesics of the observer and source, leading to unique time-dependent signatures in the angular position of background light sources. With detector specifications similar to the current and future astrometry observations, such as Gaia and Roman Space Telescope, it is shown that the ultralight scalar dark matter of mass $10^{-18}\,{\rm eV} \, \textrm{--} \, 10^{-16} \,{\rm eV}$ could be probed when its density near the solar system is about a few thousand times larger than the nominal dark matter density measured on a much larger kpc-scale. This sensitivity is comparable to current pulsar timing array observations at a similar mass range. Explicit expressions for the angular deflection induced by most generic metric perturbations are derived and its gauge invariance is explicitly checked at the linear order.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: A Stacking Analysis Investigating the Evolution of Star Formation Rates and Stellar Masses in Groups and Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of galaxies depends on their masses and local environments; understanding when and how environmental quenching starts to operate remains a challenge. Furthermore, studies of the high-redshift regime have been limited to massive cluster members, owing to sensitivity limits or small fields of views when the sensitivity is sufficient, intrinsically biasing the picture of cluster evolution. In this work, we use stacking to investigate the average star formation history of more than 10,000 groups and clusters drawn from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). Our analysis covers near ultraviolet to far infrared wavelengths, for galaxy overdensities at $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.54$. We employ SED fitting to measure the specific star formation rates (sSFR) in four annular apertures with radii between 0 and 1000 kpc. At $z \gtrsim 1.6$, the average sSFR evolves similarly to the field in both the core and the cluster outskirts. Between $\overline{z} = 1.60$ and $\overline{z} = 1.35$, the sSFR in the core drops sharply, and continues to fall relative to the field sSFR at lower redshifts. We interpret this change as evidence that the impact of environmental quenching dramatically increases at $z \sim 1.5$, with the short time span of the transition suggesting that the environmental quenching mechanism dominant at this redshift operates on a rapid timescale. We find indications that the sSFR may decrease with increasing host halo mass, but lower-scatter mass tracers than the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) are needed to confirm this relationship.</description>

      <title>A small cosmological constant from a large number of extra dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the $4+n$ dimensional spacetimes among which one is the four dimensional physical Universe and the other is an n-dimensional sphere with constant radius in the framework of Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. We find that the curvature of extra dimensional sphere contributes a huge but negative energy density provided that its radius is sufficiently small, such as the scale of Planck length. Therefore, the huge positive vacuum energy, i.e. the large positive cosmological constant is exactly cancelled out by the curvature of extra sphere. In the mean time the higher order of Lanczos-Lovelock term contributes an observations-allowed small cosmological constant if the number of extra dimensions is sufficiently large, such as $n\approx{69}$.</description>

      <title>Time delay of fast radio burst population with respect to the star formation history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spite of significant progress in the research of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in recent decade, their origin is still under extensive debate. Investigation on the population of FRBs can provide new insight into this interesting problem. In this paper, based on the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we construct a Bayesian framework to analyze the FRB population, with the selection effect of the CHIME telescope being properly taken into account. The energy function is modeled as the power-law with an exponential cutoff. Four redshift distribution models are considered, i.e., the star formation history (SFH) model, and three time-delayed models (Gaussian delay, log-normal delay, and power-law delay). The free parameters are simultaneously constrained using Bayesian inference method, and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used in model comparison. According to BIC, the log-normal delay model fits the data best. The power-law delay model and Gaussian delay model can also give reasonable fits, although they are not as good as the log-normal delay model. However, the SFH model is strongly disfavored compared with the three time-delayed models. The energy function is tightly constrained and is almost independent of the redshift models, with the best-fitting power-law index $\alpha\approx 1.8$, and cut-off energy $\log(E_c/{\rm erg})\approx 42$. The FRB population shows on average $3\sim 5$ billion years time delay with respect to the SFH. Therefore, the hypothesis that the FRB population traces the SFH is conclusively ruled out.</description>

      <title>Evolution of current-carrying string networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic string networks are expected to form in early Universe phase transitions via the Kibble mechanism and are unavoidable in several Beyond the Standard Model theories. While most predictions of observational signals of string networks assume featureless Abelian-Higgs or Nambu-Goto string networks, in many such extensions the networks can carry additional degrees of freedom, including charges and currents; these are often generically known as superconducting strings. All such degrees of freedom can impact the evolution of the networks and therefore their observational signatures. We report on the results of $2048^3$ field theory simulations of the evolution of a current-carrying network of strings, highlighting the different scaling behaviours of the network in the radiation and matter eras. We also report the first numerical measurements of the coherence length scales for the charge and current and of the condensate equation of state, and show that the latter mainly depends on the expansion rate, with chirality occurring for the matter era. Qualitatively, the fact that the matter era is the optimal expansion rate for these networks to reach scaling is in agreement with recent analytic modeling.</description>

      <title>Scaling solutions for current-carrying cosmic string networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic string networks are the best motivated relics of cosmological phase transitions, being unavoidable in many physically plausible extensions of the Standard Model. Most studies, including those providing constraints from and forecasts of their observational signals, rely on assumptions of featureless networks, neglecting the additional degrees of freedom on the string worldsheet, e.g. charges and currents, which are all but unavoidable in physically realistic models. An extension of the canonical velocity-dependent one-scale model, accounting for all such possible degrees of freedom, has been recently developed. Here we improve its physical interpretation by studying and classifying its possible asymptotic scaling solutions, and in particular how they are affected by the expansion of the Universe and the available energy loss or transfer mechanisms. We find three classes of solutions. For sufficiently fast expansion rates the charges and currents decay and one asymptotes to the Nambu-Goto case, while for slower expansion rates they can dominate the network dynamics. In between the two there is a third regime in which the network, including its charge and current, reaches full scaling. Under specific but plausible assumptions, this intermediate regime corresponds to the matter-dominated era. Our results agree with, and significantly extend, those of previous studies.</description>

      <title>Exploring loop-induced first-order electroweak phase transition in the Higgs effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nearly aligned Higgs Effective Field Theory (naHEFT) is based on the general assumption: all deviations in the Higgs boson couplings are originated from quantum one-loop effects of new particles that are integrated out. If the new particles integrated out have the same non-decoupling property, physics of the electroweak symmetry breaking can be then described by several parameters in the naHEFT, so that there is a correlation among the Higgs boson couplings such as $h \gamma \gamma$, $hWW$ and $hhh$ couplings. In this paper, we analyze the strongly first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) with the condition of sphaleron decoupling and the completion condition of the phase transition, and investigate the relation among the deviations in the Higgs boson couplings and the dynamics of the EWPTs. We also take into account the gravitational wave spectrum as well as the primordial black hole predicted at the EWPT. We show that if the new particles integrated out include charged scalar states future precision measurements of the $h \gamma \gamma$ coupling can give a useful prediction on the $hhh$ coupling to realize the strongly first-order EWPT. We can explore the nature of EWPT and the new physics behind it by the combination of precision measurements of various Higgs boson couplings at future collider experiments, gravitational wave observations at future space-based interferometers and searches for primordial black holes.</description>

Abstract: According to the von Laue condition, the volume-averaged pressure inside particles of fixed mass and structure vanishes in the Minkowski limit of general relativity. Here we show that this condition is in general not fulfilled in the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity, or of other theories of gravity in which the linear momentum is not conserved in this limit (here, $R$ and $T$ represent the Ricci scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively). In particular, we show that dust -- a perfect fluid whose particles are at rest in the fluid's proper frame -- cannot in general be described as pressureless in the context of these theories. We further discuss the implications of our findings for the form of the on-shell Lagrangian of an ideal gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1809.06333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a new semianalytical approach to quantifying the density profile of outer dark matter halos, motivated by the remarkable universality those profiles, for a wide range of dynamical parameters of the inner halos. We show that our minimalist spherical collapse based model is robust under significant variations of its input parameters around the currently known values and we identify the turnaround radius as the most important scale of the problem. Based on that observation, we argue that the turnaround radius accurately represents the transition to the external density profile, and we provide a universal test based on geometrical characteristics of the outer profile as a proposal for measuring the turnaround radius of structures.</description>

      <title>HYMALAIA: A Hybrid Lagrangian Model for Intrinsic Alignments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is an important ingredient for modelling weak-lensing measurements, and a potentially valuable cosmological and astrophysical signal. In this paper, we present HYMALAIA: a new model to predict the intrinsic alignments of biased tracers. HYMALAIA is based on a perturbative expansion of the statistics of the Lagrangian shapes of objects, which is then advected to Eulerian space using the fully non-linear displacement field obtained from $N$-body simulations. We demonstrate that HYMALAIA is capable of consistently describing monopole and quadrupole of halo shape-shape and matter-shape correlators, and that, without increasing the number of free parameters, it does so more accurately than other perturbatively inspired models such as the non-linear alignment (NLA) model and the tidal-alignment-tidal-torquing (TATT) model.</description>

      <title>Hybrid model of condensate and particle Dark Matter: linear perturbations in the hydrodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse perturbations of self-interacting, scalar field dark matter that contains modes both in a coherent condensate state and an incoherent particle-like state. Starting from the coupled equations for the condensate, the particles' phase space distribution and their mutual gravitational potential, first derived from first principles in earlier work by the authors, we derive a hydrodynamic limit of two coupled fluids and study their linearized density perturbations in an expanding universe, also including particle pressure under an assumption for an equation of state consistent with the dynamical equations. We find that away from the condensate-only or particle-only limits, and for certain ranges of the parameters, such self-interacting mixtures can significantly enhance the density power spectrum above the standard linear $\Lambda$CDM value at localised wavenumbers, even pushing structure formation into the non-linear regime earlier than expected in $\Lambda$CDM for these scales. We also note that such mixtures can lead to degeneracies between models with different boson masses and self-coupling strengths, in particular between self-coupled models and non-coupled Fuzzy Dark Matter made up of heavier bosons. These findings open up the possibility of a richer phenomenology in scalar field dark matter models and could further inform efforts to place observational limits on their parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how well a simple leading order perturbation theory model of the bispectrum can fit the BAO feature in the measured bispectrum monopole of galaxies. Previous works showed that perturbative models of galaxy bispectrum start failing at the wavenumbers of k ~ 0.1 Mpc/h. We show that when the BAO feature in the bispectrum is separated it can be successfully modeled up to much higher wavenumbers. We validate our modeling on GLAM simulations that were run with and without the BAO feature in the initial conditions. We also quantify the amount of systematic error due to BAO template being offset from the true cosmology. We find that the systematic errors do not exceed 0.3 per cent for reasonable deviations from the true cosmology.</description>

      <title>Enhancing CMB map reconstruction and power spectrum estimation with convolutional neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate reconstruction of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps and the measurement of its power spectrum are crucial for studying the early universe. In this paper, we implement a convolutional neural network to apply the Wiener Filter to CMB temperature maps, and use it intensively to compute an optimal quadratic estimation of the power spectrum. Our neural network has a UNet architecture as that implemented in WienerNet, but with novel aspects such as being written in python 3 and TensorFlow 2. It also includes an extra channel for the noise variance map, to account for inhomogeneous noise, and a channel for the mask. The network is very efficient, overcoming the bottleneck that is typically found in standard methods to compute the Wiener Filter, such as those that apply the conjugate gradient. It scales efficiently with the size of the map, making it a useful tool to include in CMB data analysis. The accuracy of the Wiener Filter reconstruction is satisfactory, as compared with the standard method. We heavily use this approach to efficiently estimate the power spectrum, by performing a simulation-based analysis of the optimal quadratic estimator. We further evaluate the quality of the reconstructed maps in terms of the power spectrum and find that we can properly recover the statistical properties of the signal. We find that the proposed architecture can account for inhomogeneous noise efficiently. Furthermore, increasing the complexity of the variance map presents a more significant challenge for the convergence of the network than the noise level does.</description>

      <title>Finding origins of CMB anomalies in the inflationary quantum fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present compelling evidence for the parity asymmetry (a discrete symmetry that is separate from isotropy) in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map, measured through two-point temperature correlations. This parity asymmetric CMB challenges our understanding of the quantum physics of the early Universe rather than LCDM ($\Lambda$ Cold-Dark-Matter). We commence by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Planck CMB, focusing on the distribution of power in low-multipoles and temperature anticorrelations at parity conjugate points in position space. We find tension with the near scale-invariant power-law power spectrum of Standard Inflation (SI), with p-values of the order $\mathcal{O}\left( 10^{-4}-10^{-3} \right)$. Alternatively, we explore the framework of direct-sum inflation (DSI), where a quantum fluctuation arises as a direct-sum of two components evolving forward and backward in time at parity conjugate points in physical space. We found that DSI is consistent with data on parity asymmetry, the absence of power at $\theta&gt;60^{\circ}$, and power suppression at low-even-multipoles, which are major data anomalies in the SI. Furthermore, we discover that the parameters characterizing the hemispherical power asymmetry anomaly become statistically insignificant when the large SI quadrupole amplitude is reduced to align with the data. DSI explains this low quadrupole with a p-value of $3.5\%$, 39 times higher than SI. Combining statistics from parameters measuring parity and low-$\ell$ angular power spectrum, we find that DSI is 50-650 times more probable than SI. In summary, our investigation suggests that CMB temperature fluctuations exhibit homogeneity and isotropy but parity-asymmetric consistent with predictions of DSI. This observation provides tantalizing evidence for the quantum mechanical nature of gravity.</description>

Abstract: We use updated gas mass fraction measurements of 44 massive dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters collated in arXiv:2111.09343 to distinguish between the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and $R_h=ct$ universe. For this purpose, we use Bayesian model selection to compare the efficacy of both these cosmological models given the data. The gas mass fraction is modeled using both cosmology-dependent terms and also astrophysical parameters, which account for the variation with cluster mass and redshift. We used two different prior choices for some of the astrophysical parameters. We find a Bayes factors of 50 and 5 for $\Lambda$CDM as compared to $R_h=ct$ for these two prior choices. This implies that $\Lambda$CDM is favored compared to $R_h=ct$ with significance ranging from substantial to very strong.</description>

      <title>Tomographic redshift dipole: Testing the cosmological principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological principle posits that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, implying all matter shares the same rest frame. This principle suggests that velocity estimates of our motion from various sources should agree with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole's inferred velocity of 370 km/s. Yet, for over two decades, analyses of radio galaxy and quasar catalogs have found velocities at odds with the CMB dipole, with tensions up to 5$\sigma$. In a blind analysis of BOSS and eBOSS spectroscopic data from galaxies and quasars across $0.2&lt;z&lt;2.2$, we applied a novel dipole estimator for a tomographic approach, robustly correcting biases and quantifying uncertainties with realistic mock catalogs. Our findings with eBOSS data ($0.6&lt;z&lt;2.2$), indicating a velocity of $195^{+99}_{-81}$ km/s, demonstrate a $2\sigma$ agreement with the CMB dipole when considering the full 3D vector distribution and a 3-to-6$\sigma$ tension with previous number count studies. This result supports the cosmological principle, emphasizing the consistency of our motion with the CMB across vast cosmic distances. On the other hand, the BOSS data revealed potential unmodeled systematics; the estimator could not be minimized using the LOWZ set ($0.2&lt;z&lt;0.4$), and the CMASS set ($0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6$) presented results that pointed towards the southern hemisphere, conflicting with the CMB dipole. Addressing the disparities with earlier number count analyses and understanding possible systematics in spectroscopic measurements will be essential to further validate the cosmological principle.</description>

      <title>Denoising Diffusion Delensing Delight: Reconstructing the Non-Gaussian CMB Lensing Potential with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal extraction of cosmological information from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background critically relies on our ability to accurately undo the distortions caused by weak gravitational lensing. In this work, we demonstrate the use of denoising diffusion models in performing Bayesian lensing reconstruction. We show that score-based generative models can produce accurate, uncorrelated samples from the CMB lensing convergence map posterior, given noisy CMB observations. To validate our approach, we compare the samples of our model to those obtained using established Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods, which assume a Gaussian lensing potential. We then go beyond this assumption of Gaussianity, and train and validate our model on non-Gaussian lensing data, obtained by ray-tracing N-body simulations. We demonstrate that in this case, samples from our model have accurate non-Gaussian statistics beyond the power spectrum. The method provides an avenue towards more efficient and accurate lensing reconstruction, that does not rely on an approximate analytic description of the posterior probability. The reconstructed lensing maps can be used as an unbiased tracer of the matter distribution, and to improve delensing of the CMB, resulting in more precise cosmological parameter inference.</description>

Abstract: We explore a dual scenario of generalized inflation and bounce cosmologies, producing a scale-invariant curvature perturbation spectrum. Bayesian analysis with pulsar timing array data identifies, for the first time, viable regions from inflation and bounce that simultaneously explain stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signals and CMB anisotropies. Bayes factor calculations strongly favor this dual scenario over conventional sources and provide initial evidence of a duality between inflation and bounce regarding SGWB, offering new insights for early universe model-building and future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the online service cosmICweb (COSMological Initial Conditions on the WEB) - the first database and web interface to store, analyze, and disseminate initial conditions for zoom simulations of objects forming in cosmological simulations: from galaxy clusters to galaxies and more. Specifically, we store compressed information about the Lagrangian proto-halo patches for all objects in a typical simulation merger tree along with properties of the halo/galaxy across cosmic time. This enables a convenient web-based selection of the desired zoom region for an object fitting user-specified selection criteria. The information about the region can then be used with the MUSIC code to generate the zoom ICs for the simulation. In addition to some other simulations, we currently support all objects in the EAGLE simulation database, so that for example the Auriga simulations are easily reproduced, which we demonstrate explicitly. The framework is extensible to include other simulations through an API that can be added to an existing database structure and with which cosmICweb can then be interfaced. We make the web portal and database publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal Couplings and the Forgotten Field of Axion Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.04179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the multifield dynamics of axion models nonminimally coupled to gravity. As usual, we consider a canonical $U(1)$ symmetry-breaking model in which the axion is the phase of a complex scalar field. If the complex scalar field has a nonminimal coupling to gravity, then the (oft-forgotten) radial component can drive a phase of inflation prior to an inflationary phase driven by the axion field. In this setup, the mass of the axion field is dependent on the radial field because of the nonminimal coupling, and the axion remains extremely light during the phase of radial inflation. As the radial field approaches the minimum of its potential, there is a transition to a second phase of inflation during which the axion field contributes a substantial fraction of the system's total energy density, yielding a phase of "natural inflation." This system exhibits ultra-light isocurvature perturbations, which are converted to adiabatic perturbations by a turning field-space trajectory. For models wherein the CMB pivot scale exited the horizon well before the turn, this acts to suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, without generating CMB non-Gaussianity or observable isocurvature perturbations. Finally, we note that for certain parameters the interaction strength between axion and gauge fields can be suppressed during the first phase of inflation relative to its value during the second phase by several orders of magnitude. This decouples the constraints on the inflationary production of gauge fields (e.g., from primordial black holes) from the constraints on their production during (p)reheating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There may exist extended configurations in the dark matter sector that are analogues of structures in the visible sector. In this work, we explore non-topological solitonic configurations, specifically Q-balls, and study when they may form macroscopic astrophysical structures and what their distinct characteristics might be. We study in some detail theoretical bounds on their sizes and constraints on the underlying parameters, based on criteria for an astrophysical Q-ball's existence, gravitational stability and viability of solutions. Following this path, one is able to obtain novel limits on astrophysical Q-ball sizes and their underlying parameters. We also explore the gravitational lensing features of different astrophysical Q-ball profiles, which are more general than the simple thin-wall limit. It is seen that the magnification characteristics may be very distinct, depending on the actual details of the solution, even for astrophysical Q-balls having the same size and mass. Assuming that such astrophysical Q-balls may form a small component of the dark matter in the universe, we place limits on this fraction from the gravitational microlensing surveys EROS-2, OGLE-IV, HSC-Subaru and the proposed future survey WFIRST. Exploring various astrophysical Q-ball profiles and sizes, it is found that while for most intermediate masses that we consider, the dark matter fraction comprising astrophysical Q-balls is at most sub-percent, for other masses it may be significantly higher.</description>

      <title>The THESAN project: connecting ionized bubble sizes to their local environments during the Epoch of Reionization</title>

Abstract: An important characteristic of cosmic hydrogen reionization is the growth of ionized gas bubbles surrounding early luminous objects. Ionized bubble sizes are beginning to be probed using Lyman-$\alpha$ emission from high-redshift galaxies, and will also be probed by upcoming 21-cm maps. We present results from a study of bubble sizes using the state-of-the-art THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulation suite, which self-consistently models radiation transport and realistic galaxy formation. We employ the mean-free path method, and track the evolution of the effective ionized bubble size at each point ($R_{\rm eff}$) throughout the Epoch of Reionization. We show there is a slow growth period for regions ionized early, but a rapid "flash ionization" process for regions ionized later as they immediately enter a large, pre-existing bubble. We also find that bright sources are preferentially in larger bubbles, and find consistency with recent observational constraints at $z \gtrsim 9$, but tension with idealized Lyman-$\alpha$ damping-wing models at $z \approx 7$. We find that high overdensity regions have larger characteristic bubble sizes, but the correlation decreases as reionization progresses, likely due to runaway formation of large percolated bubbles. Finally, we compare the redshift at which a region transitions from neutral to ionized ($z_{\rm reion}$) with the time it takes to reach a given bubble size and conclude that $z_{\rm reion}$ is a reasonable local probe of small-scale bubble size statistics ($R_\text{eff} \lesssim 1\,\rm{cMpc}$). However, for larger bubbles, the correspondence between $z_{\rm reion}$ and size statistics weakens due to the time delay between the onset of reionization and the expansion of large bubbles, particularly at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Gamma rays from dark matter spikes in EAGLE simulations</title>

Abstract: Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) with a mass range between $100 \, \text{M}_\odot$ and $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$ are expected to be surrounded by high dark matter densities, so-called dark matter spikes. The high density of self-annihilating Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in these spikes leads to copious gamma-ray production. Sufficiently nearby IMBHs could therefore appear as unidentified gamma-ray sources. However, the number of IMBHs and their distribution within our own Milky Way is currently unknown. In this work, we provide a mock catalogue of IMBHs and their dark matter spikes obtained from the EAGLE simulations, in which black holes with a mass of $10^5 \, \text{M}_\odot/h$ are seeded into the centre of halos greater than $10^{10} \, \text{M}_\odot/h$ to model black hole feedback influencing the formation of galaxies. The catalogue contains the coordinates and dark matter spike parameters for over 2500 IMBHs present in about 150 Milky Way-like galaxies. We expect about $15^{+9}_{-6}$ IMBHs within our own galaxy, mainly distributed in the Galactic Centre and the Galactic Plane. In the most optimistic scenario, we find that current and future gamma-ray observatories, such as Fermi-LAT, H.E.S.S. and CTA, would be sensitive enough to probe the cross section of dark matter self-annihilation around IMBHs down to many orders of magnitude below the thermal relic cross section for dark matter particles with masses from GeV to TeV. We have made the IMBH mock catalogue and the source code for our analysis publicly available, providing the resources to study dark matter self-annihilation around IMBHs with current and upcoming gamma-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Inflation and reheating in quadratic metric-affine gravity with derivative couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of metric-affine theories of gravity, where both the metric and connection are treated as independent variables, we consider actions quadratic in the Ricci scalar curvature coupled non-minimally to a scalar field through derivative couplings. Our analysis delves into the inflationary predictions, revealing their consistency with the latest observational constraints across a wide range of parameters. This compatibility permits adjustments such as an increase in the spectral index and a reduction in the tensor-to-scalar ratio. While we do not propose a specific reheating mechanism, our analysis demonstrates that within the quadratic model of inflation, the maximum reheating temperature can reach $\sim 3\times10^{15}\, {\rm GeV}$.</description>
