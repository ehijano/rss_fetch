      <title>GRSN: Gated Recurrent Spiking Neurons for POMDPs and MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are widely applied in various fields due to their energy-efficient and fast-inference capabilities. Applying SNNs to reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly reduce the computational resource requirements for agents and improve the algorithm's performance under resource-constrained conditions. However, in current spiking reinforcement learning (SRL) algorithms, the simulation results of multiple time steps can only correspond to a single-step decision in RL. This is quite different from the real temporal dynamics in the brain and also fails to fully exploit the capacity of SNNs to process temporal data. In order to address this temporal mismatch issue and further take advantage of the inherent temporal dynamics of spiking neurons, we propose a novel temporal alignment paradigm (TAP) that leverages the single-step update of spiking neurons to accumulate historical state information in RL and introduces gated units to enhance the memory capacity of spiking neurons. Experimental results show that our method can solve partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and multi-agent cooperation problems with similar performance as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) but with about 50% power consumption.</description>

      <title>Biologically-Informed Excitatory and Inhibitory Balance for Robust Spiking Neural Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks drawing inspiration from biological constraints of the brain promise an energy-efficient paradigm for artificial intelligence. However, challenges exist in identifying guiding principles to train these networks in a robust fashion. In addition, training becomes an even more difficult problem when incorporating biological constraints of excitatory and inhibitory connections. In this work, we identify several key factors, such as low initial firing rates and diverse inhibitory spiking patterns, that determine the overall ability to train spiking networks with various ratios of excitatory to inhibitory neurons on AI-relevant datasets. The results indicate networks with the biologically realistic 80:20 excitatory:inhibitory balance can reliably train at low activity levels and in noisy environments. Additionally, the Van Rossum distance, a measure of spike train synchrony, provides insight into the importance of inhibitory neurons to increase network robustness to noise. This work supports further biologically-informed large-scale networks and energy efficient hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as In-context AI Generators for Quality-Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) approaches are a promising direction to develop open-ended processes as they can discover archives of high-quality solutions across diverse niches. While already successful in many applications, QD approaches usually rely on combining only one or two solutions to generate new candidate solutions. As observed in open-ended processes such as technological evolution, wisely combining large diversity of these solutions could lead to more innovative solutions and potentially boost the productivity of QD search. In this work, we propose to exploit the pattern-matching capabilities of generative models to enable such efficient solution combinations. We introduce In-context QD, a framework of techniques that aim to elicit the in-context capabilities of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate interesting solutions using the QD archive as context. Applied to a series of common QD domains, In-context QD displays promising results compared to both QD baselines and similar strategies developed for single-objective optimization. Additionally, this result holds across multiple values of parameter sizes and archive population sizes, as well as across domains with distinct characteristics from BBO functions to policy search. Finally, we perform an extensive ablation that highlights the key prompt design considerations that encourage the generation of promising solutions for QD.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of the Dynamic Binary Value Problem with IOHprofiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization problems in dynamic environments have recently been the source of several theoretical studies. One of these problems is the monotonic Dynamic Binary Value problem, which theoretically has high discriminatory power between different Genetic Algorithms. Given this theoretical foundation, we integrate several versions of this problem into the IOHprofiler benchmarking framework. Using this integration, we perform several large-scale benchmarking experiments to both recreate theoretical results on moderate dimensional problems and investigate aspects of GA's performance which have not yet been studied theoretically. Our results highlight some of the many synergies between theory and benchmarking and offer a platform through which further research into dynamic optimization problems can be performed.</description>

      <title>Deep multi-prototype capsule networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capsule networks are a type of neural network that identify image parts and form the instantiation parameters of a whole hierarchically. The goal behind the network is to perform an inverse computer graphics task, and the network parameters are the mapping weights that transform parts into a whole. The trainability of capsule networks in complex data with high intra-class or intra-part variation is challenging. This paper presents a multi-prototype architecture for guiding capsule networks to represent the variations in the image parts. To this end, instead of considering a single capsule for each class and part, the proposed method employs several capsules (co-group capsules), capturing multiple prototypes of an object. In the final layer, co-group capsules compete, and their soft output is considered the target for a competitive cross-entropy loss. Moreover, in the middle layers, the most active capsules map to the next layer with a shared weight among the co-groups. Consequently, due to the reduction in parameters, implicit weight-sharing makes it possible to have more deep capsule network layers. The experimental results on MNIST, SVHN, C-Cube, CEDAR, MCYT, and UTSig datasets reveal that the proposed model outperforms others regarding image classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>NeuraChip: Accelerating GNN Computations with a Hash-based Decoupled Spatial Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as a formidable tool for processing non-euclidean data across various domains, ranging from social network analysis to bioinformatics. Despite their effectiveness, their adoption has not been pervasive because of scalability challenges associated with large-scale graph datasets, particularly when leveraging message passing.
  To tackle these challenges, we introduce NeuraChip, a novel GNN spatial accelerator based on Gustavson's algorithm. NeuraChip decouples the multiplication and addition computations in sparse matrix multiplication. This separation allows for independent exploitation of their unique data dependencies, facilitating efficient resource allocation. We introduce a rolling eviction strategy to mitigate data idling in on-chip memory as well as address the prevalent issue of memory bloat in sparse graph computations. Furthermore, the compute resource load balancing is achieved through a dynamic reseeding hash-based mapping, ensuring uniform utilization of computing resources agnostic of sparsity patterns. Finally, we present NeuraSim, an open-source, cycle-accurate, multi-threaded, modular simulator for comprehensive performance analysis.
  Overall, NeuraChip presents a significant improvement, yielding an average speedup of 22.1x over Intel's MKL, 17.1x over NVIDIA's cuSPARSE, 16.7x over AMD's hipSPARSE, and 1.5x over prior state-of-the-art SpGEMM accelerator and 1.3x over GNN accelerator. The source code for our open-sourced simulator and performance visualizer is publicly accessible on GitHub https://neurachip.us</description>

      <title>Springs and a stopwatch: neural units with time-dependent multifunctionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several branches of computing use a system's physical dynamics to do computation. We show that the dynamics of an underdamped harmonic oscillator can perform multifunctional computation, solving distinct problems at distinct times within a single dynamical trajectory. Oscillator computing usually focuses on the oscillator's phase as the information-carrying component. Here we focus on the time-resolved amplitude of an oscillator whose inputs influence its frequency, which has a natural parallel as the activity of a time-dependent neural unit. Because the activity of the unit at fixed time is a nonmonotonic function of the input, the unit can solve nonlinearly-separable problems such as XOR. Because the activity of the unit at fixed input is a nonmonotonic function of time, the unit is multifunctional in a temporal sense, able to carry out distinct nonlinear computations at distinct times within the same dynamical trajectory. Time-resolved computing of this nature can be done in or out of equilibrium, with the natural time evolution of the system giving us multiple computations for the price of one.</description>

      <title>A Low Latency Adaptive Coding Spiking Framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been used in reinforcement learning (RL) due to their low power consumption and event-driven features. However, spiking reinforcement learning (SRL), which suffers from fixed coding methods, still faces the problems of high latency and poor versatility. In this paper, we use learnable matrix multiplication to encode and decode spikes, improving the flexibility of the coders and thus reducing latency. Meanwhile, we train the SNNs using the direct training method and use two different structures for online and offline RL algorithms, which gives our model a wider range of applications. Extensive experiments have revealed that our method achieves optimal performance with ultra-low latency (as low as 0.8% of other SRL methods) and excellent energy efficiency (up to 5X the DNNs) in different algorithms and different environments.</description>

      <title>Achieving More Human Brain-Like Vision via Human EEG Representational Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advancements in artificial intelligence, object recognition models still lag behind in emulating visual information processing in human brains. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using neural data to mimic brain processing; however, these often rely on invasive neural recordings from non-human subjects, leaving a critical gap in understanding human visual perception. Addressing this gap, we present, for the first time, 'Re(presentational)Al(ignment)net', a vision model aligned with human brain activity based on non-invasive EEG, demonstrating a significantly higher similarity to human brain representations. Our innovative image-to-brain multi-layer encoding framework advances human neural alignment by optimizing multiple model layers and enabling the model to efficiently learn and mimic human brain's visual representational patterns across object categories and different modalities. Our findings suggest that ReAlnet represents a breakthrough in bridging the gap between artificial and human vision, and paving the way for more brain-like artificial intelligence systems.</description>
