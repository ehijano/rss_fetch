      <title>From Agent-Based Markov Dynamics to Hierarchical Closures on Networks: Emergent Complexity and Epidemic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a rigorous formulation of agent-based SIR epidemic dynamics as a discrete-state Markov process, capturing the stochastic propagation of infection or an invading agent on networks. Using indicator functions and corresponding marginal probabilities, we derive a hierarchy of evolution equations that resembles the classical BBGKY hierarchy in statistical mechanics. The structure of these equations clarifies the challenges of closure and highlights the principal problem of systemic complexity arising from stochastic but generally not fully chaotic interactions. Monte Carlo simulations are used to validate simplified closures and approximations, offering a unified perspective on the interplay between network topology, stochasticity, and infection dynamics. We also explore the impact of lockdown measures within a networked agent framework, illustrating how SIR dynamics and structural complexity of the network shape epidemic with propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy taken as an example.</description>

      <title>Elastic overtones: an equal temperament 12 tone music system with "perfect" fifths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impossibility of a transposable 12 semitone tuning of the octave arises from the mathematical fact that $2 \times 2^{7/12} \neq 3$ i.e., the second harmonic of the fifth can not exactly match the third harmonic of the fundamental. This in turn, stems from the whole number harmonic structure of western music, and the subsequent fundamental character of the octave interval as multiples of 2 in frequency, a property inherited by our music system from the physics of instruments with vibrating elements being to a good approximation one dimensional. In the current era of electronic music, one can relax the above assumptions to construct an analogous music system where all the structural properties of the standard music system are preserved, but where harmonics are not whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency, and the octave is no longer a factor of 2 in frequency. This now allows to construct a transposable 12 semitone music system where the second harmonic of the fifth exactly matches the third harmonic of the fundamental. The enhanced harmonic qualities of this system recover to a good approximation the musical qualities of Just Intonation, whilst retaining by construction all the versatility and modulating ability of 12TET.</description>

      <title>Bipartite structure and dynamics of political corruption networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political corruption is inherently an affiliation process linking agents to corruption cases; yet it is often studied via one-mode projections that connect co-offenders within the same scandal, implying a loss of information that potentially confounds properties of agents and cases. Here, we adopt a bipartite representation to analyze datasets of corruption scandals in Brazil and Spain spanning nearly three decades. By tracking the temporal growth of these networks, we quantify density and redundancy measures to capture partner reuse and co-occurrence across cases. Networks in both countries become progressively sparser over time, and agent redundancy is systematically higher than case redundancy, indicating a small cadre of recidivists who recombine largely with novice partners rather than forming durable co-offending ties. These networks exhibit near-exponential degree distributions, reflecting low recidivism and likely high coordination costs and secrecy constraints of large-scale scandals. Our bipartite view further reveals a moderate cross-mode disassortative degree mixing between agents and cases, with high-degree agents distributing their activity across small cases and large scandals mainly comprising low-degree participants. Finally, identifying atypical individuals within the bipartite structure reveals criminal trajectories marked by a gradual rise in network embeddedness that can appear ordinary in agent-projected networks.</description>

      <title>Evolving spatiotemporal patterns and urban scaling of deaths from external causes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban scaling theory posits that urban indicators follow power-law relations with population, yet the evolution of these patterns - and the role of regional differences in settings marked by social inequalities and unplanned urbanization - remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze nearly three decades of mortality data from Brazilian cities to investigate the scaling of external causes of death: homicides, suicides, and accidents. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework and spatial correlation analysis, we find that these mortality indicators exhibit distinct, regionally heterogeneous scaling trajectories. Homicide mortality has significantly attenuated its typical superlinear scaling with increased spatial clustering, suggesting a redistribution of violence to smaller cities and intensified intercity interactions, possibly linked to the consolidation of organized crime. Suicide mortality, usually sublinear, has trended upward, implying a weakening of urban agglomerations' protective effect. Accident mortality remains superlinear, with transport fatalities scaling nearly proportionally, and non-transport accidents becoming superlinear. The scaling changes for suicides and accidents coincide with less correlated and stable spatial patterns, suggesting that the underlying processes predominantly operate within city boundaries. Finally, while scaling exponents have evolved more homogeneously across Brazilian states, scale-adjusted mortality remains highly heterogeneous, indicating that fundamental processes govern scaling laws, whereas state-specific factors drive scale-adjusted metrics.</description>

      <title>EEG Brain mapping based on the Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a Duffing oscillator based measurement framework for detecting frequency components associated with postsynaptic potential related activity in EEG recordings. The Duffing oscillator is employed as a nonlinear measurement system whose high sensitivity to weak periodic inputs enables robust frequency estimation in the presence of strong noise. Because postsynaptic potentials are embedded in noisy EEG recordings, they are treated as weak signals. Based on the detected weak-signal frequency distributions across EEG channels, topographic maps of brain activity are constructed to visualize spatial variations in neural activation. For this purpose, EEG signals recorded from two musicians and two audience members during a music experiment were analysed. The frequency components of the weak signals were searched within the 4 37 Hz range across all EEG channels. Subsequently, topographic brain maps were generated according to the number of detected weak-signal components. The results indicate that Duffing oscillator based weak signal detection is an effective tool for EEG brain mapping. Compared with Fourier and wavelet-based methods, the proposed technique provides a more detailed representation of brain activation. These findings suggest that the proposed approach has potential for investigating various pathological conditions and for enhancing the understanding of cognitive and behavioural functions of the human brain.</description>

      <title>Stability of political structures modeled by simplicial complexes under mediation, splitting, and shellability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling political structures by simplicial complexes, we investigate whether introducing a mediator into a substructure increases or decreases the stability of the overall structure. We prove theorems that quantify the stability of a political structure when $n$ mediators are introduced, either one by one or simultaneously. We also examine how the stability is affected when a single agent is split into two. In addition, stability is expressed in terms of the $h$-vector, and special attention is given to a class of political structures modeled by shellable simplicial complexes. In the latter context, we analyze weighted political structures and examples of political structures modeled by independence complexes of graphs. This approach provides a rigorous, stepwise analysis of stability under different structural modifications, showing how the combinatorial and topological properties of the simplicial complex govern the structure's stability.</description>

      <title>Functional Percolation: Criticality of Form and Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09317v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how network structure constrains and enables information processing is a central problem in the statistical mechanics of interacting systems. Here we study random networks across the structural percolation transition and analyze how connectivity governs realizable input-output transformations under cascade dynamics. Using Erdos-Renyi networks as a minimal ensemble, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree. We find that the emergence of the giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow, quantified by transfer entropy, extends beyond local neighborhoods. We term this coincidence of structural, functional, and informational transitions functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the percolation threshold. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality may provide a general organizing principle of information processing capacity in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>

      <title>Not all Chess960 positions are equally complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze strategic complexity across all 960 Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) starting positions. Stockfish evaluations show a near-universal first-move advantage for White ($\langle E \rangle = +0.30 \pm 0.14$ pawns), indicating that the advantage conferred by moving first is a robust structural feature of the game. To quantify decision difficulty, we introduce an information-based measure $S(n)$ describing the cumulative information required to identify optimal moves over the first $n$ plies. This measure decomposes into contributions from White and Black, $S_W$ and $S_B$, yielding a total opening complexity $S_{\mathrm{tot}} = S_W + S_B$ and a decision asymmetry $A=S_B-S_W$. Across the ensemble, $S_{\mathrm{tot}}$ varies by a factor of three, while $A$ spans from $-2.5$ to $+1.8$ bits, showing that some openings burden White and others Black. The mean $\langle A \rangle = -0.25$ bits indicates a slight tendency for White to face harder opening decisions. Standard chess (position \#518, \texttt{RNBQKBNR}) exhibits above-average asymmetry (91st percentile) but typical overall complexity (47th percentile). The most complex opening is \#226 (\texttt{BNRQKBNR}), whereas \#198 (\texttt{QNBRKBNR})is the most balanced, with both evaluation and asymmetry near zero. These results reveal a highly heterogeneous Chess960 landscape in which small rearrangements of the back-rank pieces can significantly alter strategic depth and competitive fairness. Remarkably, the classical starting position-despite centuries of cultural selection-lies far from the most balanced configuration.</description>

      <title>Generalization to Political Beliefs from Fine-Tuning on Sports Team Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuned LLMs often exhibit unexpected behavior as a result of generalizing beyond the data they're shown. We present results in which an LLM fine-tuned to prefer either coastal sports teams or Southern sports teams adopt political beliefs that diverge significantly from those of the base model. While we hypothesized that the coastal model would become more liberal and the southern model would become more conservative, we find that their responses are usually similar to each other, without a clear-cut liberal or conservative bias. In addition to asking the models for numerical ratings of agreement with relevant political statements, we ask them to elaborate on their more radical answers, finding varying degrees of willingness to justify themselves. Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms by which fine-tuning on simple, narrow datasets leads to seemingly unrelated changes in model behavior.</description>

      <title>An Extensive Study of Two-Node McCulloch-Pitts Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks with two nodes are previously grouped into either two classes (mutually interactive, master-slave) or five classes (mutualism, competition, predator-prey, commensalism, amensalism). By allowing self-loops, the number of signed regulatory graphs increases to 39. We provide a complete summary of dynamical behaviors of the 39 two-node McCulloch-Pitts models when the link weights are constrained to three values [$-1$,0,$+1$] and Boolean node variables. Depending on whether the Boolean values are [$-1,1$] (bipolar) or [0,1] (binary), we show that the dynamics could also be different with the same signed regulatory graphs. We demonstrate that slight variations in the McCulloch-Pitts model (called variants) may lead to fundamentally different dynamics. We study the full model space and three kinds of robustness or stability: a) of a rule against parameter change on its overall dynamics, b) for a given state against parameter change on its final state, and c) against an initial state change on its final state. All these stability properties are loosely related to a model's limiting dynamics, with the fixed-point rules to be more stable in the first two types of robustness, but less stable in the third robustness type. These analyses pave the way towards a better understanding of a minimum complex system.</description>
