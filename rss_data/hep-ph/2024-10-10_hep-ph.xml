      <title>The Monte Carlo replica method: investigating the effects of non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth mathematical analysis of the Monte Carlo replica method, commonly used in global fitting studies within the high-energy physics theory field. For the first time, we offer a rigorous derivation of the parameter distributions resulting from this method, demonstrating that, while they align with Bayesian posteriors in linear models, they deviate in non-linear cases. We then numerically assess this discrepancy in a phenomenologically important context: fitting SMEFT Wilson coefficients. Our findings reveal that when non-linearity plays a significant role, the uncertainty estimates for key quantities differ between the two approaches.</description>

      <title>SPECTER: Efficient Evaluation of the Spectral EMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Energy Mover's Distance (EMD) has seen use in collider physics as a metric between events and as a geometric method of defining infrared and collinear safe observables. Recently, the Spectral Energy Mover's Distance (SEMD) has been proposed as a more analytically tractable alternative to the EMD. In this work, we obtain a closed-form expression for the Riemannian-like p = 2 SEMD metric between events, eliminating the need to numerically solve an optimal transport problem. Additionally, we show how the SEMD can be used to define event and jet shape observables by minimizing the distance between events and parameterized energy flows (similar to the EMD), and we obtain closed-form expressions for several of these observables. We also present the SPECTER framework, an efficient and highly parallelized implementation of the SEMD metric and SEMD-derived shape observables as an analogue of the previously-introduced SHAPER for EMD-based computations. We demonstrate that computing the SEMD with SPECTER can be up to a thousand times faster than computing the EMD with standard optimal transport libraries.</description>

      <title>NuFit-6.0: Updated global analysis of three-flavor neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated global analysis of neutrino
  oscillation data as of September 2024. The parameters
  $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\Delta m^2_{21}$, and $|\Delta m^2_{3\ell}|$
  ($\ell = 1,2$) are well-determined with relative precision at
  $3\sigma$ of about 13\%, 8\%, 15\%, and 6\%, respectively. The
  third mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ still suffers from the octant
  ambiguity, with no clear indication of whether it is larger or
  smaller than $45^\circ$. The determination of the leptonic CP phase
  $\delta_{CP}$ depends on the neutrino mass ordering: for normal ordering
  the global fit is consistent with CP conservation within $1\sigma$,
  whereas for inverted ordering CP-violating values of $\delta_{CP}$ around
  $270^\circ$ are favored against CP conservation at more than
  $3.6\sigma$. While the present data has in principle
  $2.5$--$3\sigma$ sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, there
  are different tendencies in the global data that reduce the
  discrimination power: T2K and NOvA appearance data individually
  favor normal ordering, but they are more consistent with each other
  for inverted ordering. Conversely, the joint determination of
  $|\Delta m^2_{3\ell}|$ from global disappearance data prefers normal
  ordering. Altogether, the global fit including long-baseline,
  reactor and IceCube atmospheric data results into an almost equally
  good fit for both orderings. Only when the $\chi^2$ table for
  atmospheric neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande is added to our
  $\chi^2$, the global fit prefers normal ordering with $\Delta\chi^2
  = 6.1$. We provide also updated ranges and correlations for the
  effective parameters sensitive to the absolute neutrino mass from
  $\beta$-decay, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical and Cosmological Probes of Boosted Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth study of two-component cold dark matter via extensive N-body simulations. We examine various cosmological observables including the temperature evolution, power spectrum, density perturbation, maximum circular velocity functions, and galactic density profiles. We find that a significant mass difference between the two components, coupled with the annihilation of the heavier into the lighter component, imparts warm dark matter (WDM)-like characteristics to the latter. This model benefits from the unique features of WDM, such as modifications to the matter power spectrum and density profiles, while avoiding stringent observational constraints on WDM mass. The two-component dark-matter model aligns with observational data and suggests new avenues for dark-matter detection in terrestrial experiments, particularly for light, sub-MeV DM candidates. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the small-scale structures and offer guidance for future particle physics and cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>Tracing the bottom electroweak dipole operators at future lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While often omitted in the SMEFT analyses of electroweak measurements, the electroweak dipole operators of the bottom quark have been found to be important in some cases, and are also related to processes involving the top quark. In this paper, we further investigate their effects, focusing on the measurements of the $e^+e^-\to b\bar{b}$ process at a future lepton collider. Their linear contributions are suppressed by the bottom mass due to the helicity flip in the interference term with the SM amplitude, leading to a nontrivial interplay between the linear and the quadratic contributions. With two runs at the Z-pole and 240 GeV, the effects of CP-even dipole coefficients can be well separated from the modifications of the SM $Zb\bar{b}$ couplings, while an additional run (e.g. at 360 GeV) is useful for lifting a nontrivial second best-fit point due to the quadratic contributions. The dipole operators also offer an alternative explanation to the long-standing $A^{0,b}_{\rm FB}$ discrepancy at LEP, which can be tested at a future lepton collider.</description>

      <title>Heavy Flavour Jet Substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of energy correlation functions and jet angularities for heavy-flavour QCD jets. In particular, we discuss the possibility of using these observables to expose the dead cone effect, i.e. the suppression of collinear QCD radiation around massive quarks, and to investigate the sensitivity of different observable definitions to the presence of quark masses. Our calculations are presented as all-order resummed predictions at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy, matched to (partial) fixed-order results to obtain a better description of the transition around the dead cone threshold. We also compare our analytic results with Pythia, Herwig and Sherpa Monte Carlo predictions to estimate the impact of non-perturbative contributions such as hadronisation, underlying events and $B$-hadron decays.</description>

      <title>Searching for Gluino LSP at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse relevant signals expected at the LHC, assuming that the gluino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in the framework of the $\mu\nu$SSM. In this $R$-parity violating model, the presence of couplings involving right-handed neutrinos solves simultaneously the $\mu$ problem and the accommodations of neutrino masses and mixing angles. We study gluino pair production in quark-antiquark and gluon-gluon collisions. The main decay channels for the gluino LSP are the three-body decays to two quarks and a lepton or a neutrino. In both cases, the leading channels occur for the third family of quarks. We compare the predictions of this scenario with LHC searches for prompt and long-lived particles.To analyse the parameter space we sample the $\mu\nu$SSM for a gluino LSP, paying special attention to reproduce the current experimental data on neutrino and Higgs physics, as well as flavour observables. Our results imply a lower limit on the mass of the gluino LSP of about 2600 GeV, and an upper limit for the decay length of about 6 cm.</description>

      <title>Highly Excited Electron Cyclotron for QCD Axion and Dark-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using highly excited cyclotron states of a trapped electron to detect meV axion and dark photon dark matter, marking a significant improvement over our previous proposal and demonstration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 261801]. When the axion mass matches the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, the cyclotron state is resonantly excited, with a transition probability proportional to its initial quantum number, $n_c$. The sensitivity is enhanced by taking $n_c \sim 10^6 \left( \frac{0.1~\text{meV}}{\omega_c} \right)^2$. By optimizing key experimental parameters, we minimize the required averaging time for cyclotron detection to $t_{\text{ave}} \sim 10^{-6} $ seconds, permitting detection of such a highly excited state before its decay. An open-endcap trap design enables the external photon signal to be directed into the trap, rendering our background-free detector compatible with large focusing cavities, such as the BREAD proposal, while capitalizing on their strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, the axion conversion rate can be coherently enhanced by incorporating layers of dielectrics with alternating refractive indices within the cavity. Collectively, these optimizations enable us to probe the QCD axion parameter space from 0.1 meV to 2.3 meV (25-560 GHz), covering a substantial portion of the predicted post-inflationary QCD axion mass range. This sensitivity corresponds to probing the kinetic mixing parameter of the dark photon down to $\epsilon \approx 2 \times 10^{-16}$.</description>

      <title>Thermomagnetic effects on light pseudo-scalar meson masses within the SU(3) Nambu-Jona--Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the screening masses of pseudoscalar mesons in a hot and strongly magnetized medium within the framework of the SU(3) Nambu-Jona--Lasinio model, using a magnetic field-independent regularization scheme. Inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) is implemented through the use of a magnetic field-dependent coupling $G(B)$, fitted to reproduce lattice QCD results for the pseudocritical chiral transition temperature $T_c^B$. For the external homogeneous magnetic field considered, neutral screening masses separate in two types: perpendicular and parallel to the direction of the field, while for charged mesons only parallel energies can be defined for each Landau level. We obtain $m_{\mathrm{scr},\perp} &gt; m_{\mathrm{scr},\parallel}$, as expected from causality. Thermally, all screening energies are almost constant until some critical temperature, whose behavior is correlated with $T_c^B$. They rapidly increase around this value, keeping a steady enhancement afterwards due to thermal excitation. Magnetically, neutral parallel masses are enhanced (suppressed) at high temperatures when considering $G(B)$ ($G$). Perpendicular ones display a non-linear magnetic behavior for $G$ (due to increasing $T_c^B$), while they always increase with $B$ for $G(B)$. Charged parallel energies are also always magnetically enhanced. In the high-temperature limit, we show that both neutral and charged screening energies converge to $2\pi T$. At $B=0$ the model overestimates the remaining quark interaction in this regime. At $B\neq 0$ we find that, when IMC is accounted for, the interaction is suppressed as $B$ increases, a fact that appears to be at odds with currently available lattice QCD results.</description>

      <title>Diffractive photoproduction of dark photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photons serve as a portal to connect the dark and standard model sectors. Here, we propose photon-induced exclusive diffractive processes as a new tool to study the production of dark photons in current and future colliders. These processes join the strength of the strong force, yielding large cross sections, with the cleanliness of diffractive photoproduction, providing a clean experimental environment. Although the measurement would be extremely difficult, we identified a currently unexplored region around dark photon masses of 1 GeV/$c^2$ and coupling suppression $\varepsilon$ values around $10^{-4}$ where dark photons could be potentially found at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Exotic hybrid pseudopotentials at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the exotic hybrid pseudopotentials at finite temperature and chemical potential. The $\Sigma$ hybrid meson can be described by a model including an object called ``defect'' on a string linking the quark and antiquark. It was first proposed by Andreev and perfectly described the $\Sigma_u^-$ hybrid potential at zero temperature and chemical potential. In this paper, we would like to extend this model to finite chemical potential and compare the separate distance and pseudopotentials of $\Sigma_g^+ $ and $\Sigma_u^-$. Unlike $\Sigma_g^+$ ground state, the $\Sigma_u^-$ hybrid pseudopotentials no longer behave as Coulomb-like at short distances. In addition, temperature and chemical potential have a significant impact on the $\Sigma_u^-$ hybrid pseudopotentials. The screen distances and hybrid pseudopotentials of $\Sigma_u^-$ significantly decrease with the increase of temperature and chemical potential. At last, we draw the melting diagram of $\Sigma_g^+ $ and $\Sigma_u^-$ in the $T- \mu$ plane, and confirm that the quark-antiquark pair in $\Sigma_u^-$ excited state is easier to melt than in $\Sigma_g^+$ ground state.</description>

      <title>Analysis of neutrino oscillation parameters in the light on quantum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous neutrino experiments have confirmed the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation, providing direct evidence of the quantum mechanical nature of neutrinos. In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of neutrino flavor states within the framework of three-flavor neutrino oscillation using two major entanglement measures: entanglement of formation (EOF) and concurrence, utilizing the DUNE experimental setup. Our findings indicate that the maximally entangled state appears between $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ whereas, $\nu_{e}$ behaves as a nearly separable state. To further explore the nature of bipartite entanglement, we introduce the concept of the monogamy of entanglement, which allows us to investigate the distinction between genuine three-flavor entanglement and bipartite entanglement. Our analysis confirms that the three-flavor neutrino system forms a bipartite entanglement structure, adhering to the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW) inequality. Additionally, we implement a minimization procedure to find the best-fit values of the oscillation parameters that correspond to the concurrence minima at the two specific energy points where the concurrence reaches its lowest values. Using these best-fit values, we probe three fundamental unknowns in neutrino oscillation: CP violation sensitivity, neutrino mass hierarchy, and the octant issue of $\theta_{23}$, across two distinct energy points. Our results manifest that while the best-fit values obtained through concurrence minimization show slightly reduced sensitivity to CP violation compared to current best-fit values, they exhibit greater sensitivity to the mass hierarchy. Furthermore, the study reveals a maximal mixing angle for the atmospheric sector.</description>

      <title>The $X(4500)$ state considered as the mixture of hadronic molecule and diquark-antidiquark within effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we construct the Lagrangians including three-meson, meson-diquark-antidiquark vertices, such that the diquark-antidiquark component as well as the molecular component are introduced within the effective field theory. With the obtained effective potentials projecting to spin 0, 1 and 2, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the on-shell approximation, and find that $X(4500)$ can be explained as the mixture of components $D_{s}^{*+}D_{s}^{*-}$, ${A}_{cq}\bar{A}_{cq}$ and ${A}_{cs}\bar{A}_{cs}$ with $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(0^{++})$. In addition, another two resonances with quantum numbers $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(1^{++})$ and $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(2^{++})$ are predicted.</description>

Abstract: It was recently claimed (arxiv:2407.00954) that neutrino oscillations through conventional mass mixing are forbidden by energy conservation, and that they in fact arise from virtual $Z$ boson exchange. I explain why both claims, and therefore a repetition of these claims in arxiv:2410.03133, are incorrect.</description>

      <title>Recent progress in transverse momentum dependent (TMD) Parton Densities and corresponding parton showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parton branching method is crucial for Monte Carlo generators, which are essential for high-energy physics predictions. We examine the impact of soft gluons on inclusive collinear and Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) parton densities. By applying the Parton-Branching (PB) method, we identify the non-perturbative Sudakov form factor with the integration range $z \to 1$, which is often neglected in collinear parton shower approaches.
  The significance of soft gluons is demonstrated through the transverse momentum spectrum of Drell-Yan lepton pairs, resulting in an intrinsic-$k_t$ distribution width that remains independent of $\sqrt(s)$, contrary to observations in collinear parton shower approaches. This behavior is attributed to the non-perturbative Sudakov form factor.</description>

      <title>High-$\rm{p_T}$ LHC constraints on SMEFT operators affecting rare kaon and hyperon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the constraints on new physics affecting rare kaon and hyperon decay as parametrized by a low energy effective theory that can be obtained from high-$\rm p_T$ observables at LHC. To this end, we match the relevant low energy Wilson coefficients onto those in SMEFT at dimension six and compute their contributions to charged dilepton, monolepton, monojets, and $\rm VH$ searches by ATLAS and CMS. Constraints from rare kaon decays are generally more restrictive, with the ones arising from high-$\rm p_T$ measurements complementing them along directions in parameter space to which the former are not sensitive. We also illustrate the effect of a high luminosity LHC run in reducing the viable parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Off-shell $t\bar{t}W^+j$ production at NLO QCD accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on our recent full off-shell $pp \rightarrow t\bar{t}W^+ j+X$ calculation at the NLO level in QCD. Unstable resonant particles like the $W^\pm/Z$ vector bosons and top quarks are modelled with Breit-Wigner propagators. Furthermore double-, single- and non-resonant contributions as well as all their interference terms are consistently included at the matrix element level. We provide integrated and differential (fiducial) cross-section results and investigate the size of theoretical uncertainties as well as the impact of renormalization- and factorization scale settings on the theoretical predictions. Finally, we explore the effects of additional jet activity in $t\bar{t}W^+$ production and top-quark decays.</description>

      <title>Four top final states with NLO accuracy in perturbative QCD: 3 lepton channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effect of higher-order QCD corrections on the four top-quark production cross section in the $3$ lepton decay channel. Top-quark and $W$ gauge-boson decays are included at next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. The narrow-width approximation, that preserves spin correlations, is used to perform the calculation for this complex $2 \to 12 \,(13)$ process. We present differential cross-section distributions of top-quark decay products for the LHC Run III energy of $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV, using realistic selection cuts. Our results show that QCD corrections and jet radiation in top-quark and $W$ decays can lead to significant changes in shapes of basic kinematic distributions and, therefore, need to be included for the accurate description of $pp \to t\bar{t}t\bar{t}+X$ process in the $3\ell$ decay channel. The NLO QCD results obtained in this work are important in the context of the recent observation of the $pp\to t\bar{t}t\bar{t}+X$ process by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations and are of great significance for the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC.</description>

      <title>The QED nonfactorizable correction to the semileptonic charmed three-body $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the nonfactorizable photonic corrections to the effective four-fermion vertex for the $\overline{B}$ ${\to}$ $D^{({\ast})}$ $+$ ${\ell}^{-}$ $+$ $\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ decays are considered at the quark level within SM, where ${\ell}$ $=$ $e$, ${\mu}$ and ${\tau}$. It is found that the QED corrections are closely related with the mass of the charged lepton. The QED contributions will enhance branching ratios, which results in the slight reduction of ratios $R(D^{(\ast)})$ and the relationship $R(D^{(\ast)})_{e}$ $&lt;$ $R(D^{(\ast)})_{\mu}$.</description>

      <title>Binwise exploration of vector couplings in $B_s \to D_s^{(*)} \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from the LHCb experiment have confirmed that lepton flavor universality is upheld in flavor-changing neutral current processes, such as $B \to K^{(*)} l^+ l^-$. However, discrepancies remain in the charged current sector, raising questions about the universality of lepton flavors in these processes. To explore this issue, we investigate the decays $B_s \to D_s^{(*)} \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ in different $q^2$ bins, which involve the $b \to c \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ transition. We employ a model-independent approach to analyze potential new physics by fitting both real and complex (axial)vector coefficients to the existing $b \to (u, c) \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ data. Our analysis enables us to calculate the branching ratios and angular distributions for the $B_s \to D_s^{(*)} \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ decays in four different $q^2$ bins. Additionally, we evaluate whether lepton flavor universality is maintained in these charged current decays or if deviations suggest the presence of new physics.</description>

      <title>Force-feeding Supermassive Black Holes with Dissipative Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^9\,M_\odot$ have been discovered by JWST at high redshifts ($z\sim 7$). It is difficult to explain such objects as the result of accretive growth of stellar-mass seeds, as the rate at which baryons can be fed to the black hole is limited by the radiation pressure of the infalling matter. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to create the early progenitors: the collapse of small dark matter halos through a dissipative cooling mechanism in the dark sector. These small black holes can then be efficiently fed with additional dissipative dark matter due to the comparatively weak interactions between the dark radiation and dark matter, which results in a very short Eddington time and high accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Relations Between Anomalous Dimensions in the Regge Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recent formalism developed for computing rapidity anomalous dimension of form factors using unitarity to the problem of high-energy near forward scattering. By combining the factorization of $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering in the effective field theory (EFT) for Glauber operators with definite signature amplitudes, we derive an expression that relates anomalous dimensions (including Regge trajectories) to cut amplitudes, leading to significant computational simplifications. We demonstrate this explicitly by computing the one and two-loop Regge trajectories. Our formalism can also be used to bootstrap anomalous dimensions of operators not related by symmetries. As an example, we show that the full anomalous dimensions (including both the Regge pole and cut pieces) of the two Glauber operator anti-symmetric octet operator, can be determined from the anomalous dimension of the single Glauber exchange operator. Many other such relations exist between other color channels at each order in $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Probing a scalar singlet-triplet extension of the Standard Model via VBF at the Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the $Y=0$ $SU(2)$ scalar triplet and $Z_2$-odd scalar singlet extension of the Standard Model (SM). Here, the triplet charged Higgs boson decays to $ZW^\pm$, breaking the custodial symmetry at the tree-level, proportional to the triplet vev, while the singlet provides the dark matter (DM) relic. The triplet neutral Higgs ($T^0$) can decay fully invisibly owing to the triplet-singlet portal coupling $\lambda_{st}$. The other SM Higgs portal couplings $\lambda_{ht}, \lambda_{hs}$ are constrained by the Higgs to di-photon observations, and the dark matter relic and direct searches as well as invisible Higgs decay bounds, respectively. For a cleaner signature, we indulge in a futuristic multi-TeV muon collider (MuC) to probe both the triplet scalars ($T^\pm, T^0 $) via vector boson fusion with Forward muon tagging, at the centre-of-mass energies of 3 TeV and 10 TeV. The analysis is comprised of a traditional cut-based approach and a BDT classifier, where the latter is more effective for lower energies. With large missing energy contributions to the final states from combinations of DM mass and $\lambda_{st}$, The 3 TeV MuC is projected to probe triplet scalar masses of 450 GeV with the BDT classifier. The 10 TeV MuC can pinpoint the custodial symmetry breaking $T^\pm \to ZW^\pm \to 3$-lepton decay up to 800 GeV of triplet scalar mass from cut-based analysis, with $\lambda_{st}$ as low as 1.5 being adequate.</description>

      <title>Describing Hadronization via Histories and Observables for Monte-Carlo Event Reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for extracting a fragmentation model directly from experimental data without requiring an explicit parametric form, called Histories and Observables for Monte-Carlo Event Reweighting (\homer), consisting of three steps: the training of a classifier between simulation and data, the inference of single fragmentation weights, and the calculation of the weight for the full hadronization chain. We illustrate the use of \homer on a simplified hadronization problem, a $q\bar{q}$ string fragmenting into pions, and extract a modified Lund string fragmentation function $f(z)$. We then demonstrate the use of \homer on three types of experimental data: (i) binned distributions of high level observables, (ii) unbinned event-by-event distributions of these observables, and (iii) full particle cloud information. After demonstrating that $f(z)$ can be extracted from data (the inverse of hadronization), we also show that, at least in this limited setup, the fidelity of the extracted $f(z)$ suffers only limited loss when moving from (i) to (ii) to (iii).

      <description>arXiv:2410.06503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One method to determine the characteristic parameters of a hadron production source is to measure Bose-Einstein correlation functions. In this paper, we present fundamental concepts and formulas related to Bose-Einstein correlations, focusing on the measurement principles and the Lund model from an experimental perspective. We perform Monte Carlo simulations using the Lund model generator in the 2-3 GeV energy range. Through these feasibility studies, we identify key features of Bose-Einstein correlations that offer valuable insights for experimental measurements. Utilizing data samples collected at BESIII, we propose measurements of Bose-Einstein correlation functions, with the expected experimental precision of the hadron source radius and incoherence parameter at the level of a few percent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $s\to u$ weak decays of heavy flavor hadrons play a unique role in the field of heavy flavor physics. In this work, we investigate the $s\to u$ decays of singly heavy baryons. We first obtain the form factors in the light-front approach under the three-quark picture, and then apply them to give some predictions on the semileptonic decays. Due to the extremely small phase space, lepton flavor universality (LFU) is sensitive to the masses of leptons, and precise measurement of LFU is expected to be an important tool for testing the standard model. We find that a commonly used method for extracting form factors in the literature is no longer applicable at this time. We also point out the correct way to thoroughly discuss the heavy quark limit for these decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of exotic mounic atoms, including antimatter hydrogen muonic atoms and kaon mounic atoms, constitutes a milestone in our ability to make and study new forms of matter. Relativistic heavy-ion collisions provide the only likely condition for production and detection of these exotic atoms. Taking a Coulomb correlations into account from the time of the fireball freeze-out until the formation of a stable atom has dramatic consequence on the expected yields of these atoms. When the coalescence model with the assumption of quantum wave function localization is applied to the formation of muonic atoms, we find that the atom yields are about two orders of magnitude higher than previously predicted.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we try to interpret the origin of dark energy in quantum field theory (QFT). The vacuum energy of a field in QFT is a quartic-divergence input, and its physical contribution to dark energy is calculated in the UV-free scheme. There is a mass-energy window that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal hierarchical spectrum of neutrinos is preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is about 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <title>Single isolated photon production in the NLO${}^\star$ approximation of the Parton Reggeization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadroproduction of single isolated photon at high energies is studied within the framework of the NLO${}^\star$ approximation of the Parton Reggeization Approach based on the modified Multi-Regge limit of the hard scattering QCD amplitudes. The contribution from the LO subprocess $Q \bar Q \to \gamma$ and the NLO tree-level corrections $Q R \to \gamma q$ and $Q \bar Q \to \gamma g$ are considered. To avoid specific double counting in rapidity between tree-level corrections to the hard scattering coefficient and unintegrated PDFs, a corresponding subtraction scheme is proposed. We demonstrated self-consistency of the Parton Reggeization Approach using the subtraction scheme. The results of calculations are compared with data from various Collaborations in the wide energy range $\sqrt{S} = 24 \ {\rm GeV} - 13 \ {\rm TeV}$. We obtained a quite satisfactory agreement with data up to $p_T^\gamma / \sqrt{S} \simeq 0.2 - 0.3$. Predictions for the future SPD NICA experiment were discussed.</description>

      <title>Centrality Manipulation in Exclusive Photoproduction at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of future electron-ion collision experiments, particularly the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), investigating exclusive photoproduction processes is of paramount importance. These processes offer a unique opportunity to probe the gluon structure of nuclei across a broad range of Bjorken-$x$, facilitating measurements of nuclear shadowing and searches for gluon saturation and/or the color glass condensate. This paper explores the potential of utilizing neutron tagging from Coulomb excitation of nuclei to effectively determine centrality for exclusive photoproduction in electron-ion collisions. By developing the equivalent photon approximation for fast-moving electrons, this work incorporates a coordinate-space-dependent photon flux distribution, elucidating the relationship between the photon transverse momentum distribution and collision impact parameter. Leveraging spatial information from the photon flux, the differential cross section for Coulomb excitation of nuclei is derived. Our calculations demonstrate that neutron tagging can significantly alter impact parameter distributions, thereby providing a robust method for centrality manipulation in electron-ion collisions. This study contributes essential baseline and strategies for exploring the impact parameter dependence of exclusive photoproduction, offering novel insights for experimental design and data analysis. Ultimately, it provides additional information to better visualize the gluon distribution within the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Inclusive rare $\Lambda_b$ decays to photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inclusive $H_b \to X_s \, \gamma$ decays, with $H_b$ a beauty baryon, are treated exploiting an expansion up to the third order in the inverse of the $b$ quark mass $m_b$ and to LO in $\alpha_s$, keeping the dependence on the hadron spin. Double distribution $\frac{d^2\Gamma}{dy \, d \cos \theta_P}$ is computed for polarized baryons, with $y = 2 \, E_\gamma / m_b$, $E_\gamma$ the photon energy and $\theta_P$ the angle between the baryon spin vector and the photon momentum in the $H_b$ rest-frame. Modifications to the photon polarization asymmetry can probe effects of physics beyond the Standard Model. A systematic method to treat the singular terms in the photon energy spectrum obtained by the OPE is proposed.</description>

      <title>The Transition Rate and Gravitational Wave Spectrum from First-Order QCD Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational wave spectrum induced by first-order QCD phase transitions including the deconfinement phase transition in the pure gluon system and Friedberg-Lee model, and chiral phase transition in the quark-meson model and Polyakov quark-meson model. The gravitational wave power spectra are sensitive to the phase transition rate $\beta/H$. All QCD models predict a rather large phase transition rate in the order of $\beta/H\sim10^4$ at high temperature region, and the produced gravitational waves lie in the peak frequency region of $10^{-4}-0.01 {\rm Hz}$, corresponding to an energy spectrum in the range of $10^{-8}-10^{-7}$, which can be detected by LISA and Taiji. If a high baryon density is generated through Affleck-Dine baryogenesis or other mechanisms, the baryon chemical potential significantly reduces the phase transition rate, potentially dropping it to the order of $\beta/H\sim 10^1$, leading to the production of nanohertz gravitational waves. Furthermore, a critical quark chemical potential exists with a zero phase transition rate $\beta/H=0$, indicating that the false vacuum will not decay, thus supporting the formation of primordial quark nuggets in the early universe.</description>

      <title>One-loop analytical expressions for $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \phi_i\phi_j$ in Higgs Extensions of the Standard Models and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General one-loop formulas for loop-induced processes $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \phi_i\phi_j$ with $\phi_i\phi_j = hh,~hH,~HH$ are presented in the paper. Analytic expressions evaluated in this work are valid for a class of Higgs Extensions of the Standard Models, e.g. Inert Doublet Higgs Models, Two Higgs Doublet Models, Zee-Babu Models as well as Triplet Higgs Models, etc. Analytic expressions for one-loop form factors are written in terms of the basic scalar one-loop two-, three- and four-point functions following the output format of both the packages~{\tt LoopTools} and {\tt Collier}. Physical results can be hence evaluated numerically by using one of the mentioned packages. Analytic results are tested by several checks such as the ultraviolet finiteness, infrared finiteness of the one-loop amplitudes. Furthermore, the amplitudes also obey the ward identity due to the on-shell initial photons. This identity is also verified numerically in this works. In the applications, we present the phenomenological results for Zee-Babu model as a typical example in this report. Production cross-section for the processes $\gamma \gamma\rightarrow hh$ are scanned over the parameter space of the Zee-Babu Models.</description>

      <title>A New-Old Approach to Composite Scalars with Chiral Fermion Constituents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical, Lorentz invariant theory of composite scalars in configuration space consisting of chiral fermions, interacting by the perturbative exchange of a massive ``gluon'' of coupling $g_0$ and mass $M_0^2$ (the coloron model). The formalism is inspired by, but goes beyond, old ideas of Yukawa and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. It yields a non-pointlike internal wave-function of the bound state, $\phi(r)$, which satisfies a Schr\"odinger-Klein-Gordon (SKG) equation with eigenvalue $\mu^2$. For super-critical coupling, $g_0 &gt;g_{0c}$, we have $\mu^2&lt; 0$ leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking. The binding of chiral fermions is semiclassical, and not loop-level as in NJL. The mass scale is determined by the interaction as in NJL. We mainly focus on the short-distance, large $M_0^2$ limit, yielding an NJL pointlike interaction, but the bound state internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$, remains spatially extended and dilutes $\phi(0)$. This leads to power-law suppression of the induced Yukawa and quartic couplings and requires radically less fine-tuning of a hierarchy than does the NJL model. We include a discussion of loop corrections of the theory. A realistic top--condensation model appears possible.</description>

      <title>A Brief Guide to Exotic Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic hadrons are a new class of hadronic states whose properties do not allow them to be classified as conventional quark-antiquark mesons or three quark baryons. Finding new and understanding established exotic states is the most important topic in today's hadron spectroscopy and a promising avenue to advance our knowledge on Quantum Chromodynamics in the non-perturbative regime. While several high-quality reviews on the topic exist, they are all at an advanced level. The present article aims to address new-comers to the field with a simple introduction to exotic hadrons with an emphasis on the experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Machine learning tagged boosted dark photon: A signature of fermionic portal matter at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use machine learning techniques to identify a boosted dark photon jet as a signature of a heavy vector-like fermionic portal matter (PM) connecting the visible and the dark sectors. In this work, the fermionic PM which mixes only with the standard model (SM) third generation up-type quark, dominantly decays to a top quark and dark photon pair. The dark photon then decays $promptly$ to a pair of standard model fermions via the gauge kinetic mixing. We have analyzed two different final states, namely, $(i)~ exactly ~one ~tagged~ dark ~photon ~and ~exactly ~one ~tagged~ top ~quark ~jet$, and $(ii)~ at~ least~ two~tagged ~dark$ $photons~and~at ~least ~one ~tagged ~top ~quark ~jet$ at the 13 and 14 TeV LHC center of mass energies. Both these final states receive significant contributions from the pair and single production processes of the top partner. The rich event topology of the signal processes, $i.e.$, the presence of a boosted dark photon and top quark jet pair, along with the fact that the invariant mass of the system corresponds to the mass of the top partner, help us to significantly suppress the potential SM backgrounds. We have shown that one can set a $2\sigma$ exclusion limit of $3.0$ TeV on the top partner mass with $\sin\theta_L=0.1$ and assuming $100\%$ branching ratio of the top partner in the exactly one tagged dark photon and exactly one tagged top quark jet final state at the 14 TeV LHC center of mass energy assuming 300 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.</description>

      <title>Exclusive rare semileptonic decays of $B$ and $B_c$ mesons in the relativistic independent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the exclusive rare semileptonic decays: $B(B_c)\to K(D_{(s)})l\bar{l}/\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l}$ ($l=\mu, \tau$) in the framework of relativistic independent quark (RIQ) model based on an average flavor independent confining potential in equally mixed scalar-vector harmonic form. The invariant weak form factors, parametrising the matrix elements between participating meson states are calculated in the parent meson rest frame. The momentum transfer dependence of the form factors is reliably determined in the whole accessible kinematical range: $q^2_{min}\leq 0\leq q^2_{max}$. Our predicted branching fractions for $B\to K\mu^+\mu^-/\tau^+\tau^-(\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l})$, $B_c\to D(D_s)\mu^+\mu^-$, $B_c\to D(D_s)\tau^+\tau^-$ and $B_c\to D(D_s)\Sigma\nu_l\bar{\nu_l}$, obtained in order of $10^{-7}(10^{-6})$, $10^{-9}(10^{-7})$, $10^{-9}(10^{-8})$ and $10^{-8}(10^{-7})$, respectively are in reasonable agreement with other Standard Model predictions and Lattice QCD results. The averaged values of the lepton polarization asymmetries for decay modes are obtained as $\langle P_L(B\to K\mu^+\mu^-)\rangle$=-0.97, $\langle P_L(B_c\to D_{(s)}\mu^+\mu^-)\rangle$=-0.972, $\langle P_L(B\to K\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.224, $\langle P_L(B_c\to D\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.275 and $\langle P_L(B_c\to D_s\tau^+\tau^-)\rangle$=-0.194.</description>

      <title>Updated Determination of Ellis-Jaffe Sum Rules and Extraction of Quark Spin Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the properties of the Ellis-Jaffe Sum Rule (EJSR) in detail, employing the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) approach to address its perturbative QCD contribution including next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order ($\rm N^{3}LO$) QCD corrections. Using the PMC, we attain a precise perturbative QCD approximate for the EJSR, without the conventional ambiguity associated with the renormalization scale. Given the presence of the $\alpha_s$ Landau pole near the asymptotic scale, we also utilize the low-energy $\alpha_s$ model based on the analytic perturbative theory (APT) to recalibrate the EJSR behavior in the infrared region. By combining the PMC approach with the low-energy APT model, we achieved theoretical predictions of EJSR that align well with the experiments. Using deep learning, we also fit the contribution of the quark spin to the nucleon spin $\Delta \Sigma$ and ultimately obtain $\Delta \Sigma \approx 0.23^{+0.02}_{-0.06}$, consistent with global fit results $\Delta \Sigma = 0.24\pm0.07$.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Limits from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on Heavy Neutral Leptons with Axion-like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are constrained by requirements of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) as their decays significantly impact the formation of the primordial elements. We propose here a model where the primary decay channel for the HNLs is to an axion-like particle (ALP) and a neutrino. Consequently, HNLs can decay earlier and evade the BBN bound for lower masses, provided the ALPs themselves decay considerably later. Further cosmological and astrophysical constraints limit severely the range of validity of the ALP properties. We find that a new parameter region opens up for HNLs with masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, and active-sterile neutrino mixing strengths between $10^{-9}$ and $10^{-6}$ that is consistent with constraints and can be probed in future searches. In such a scenario, current bounds as well as sensitivities of future direct HNL searches such as at NA62 and DUNE will be affected.</description>

      <title>Higgs-muon interactions at a multi-TeV muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a simple yet general parameterization of Higgs-muon interactions within the effective field theory frameworks, including both the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) and the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We investigate the potential of a muon collider, operating at center-of-mass energies of 3 and 10 TeV, to probe Higgs-muon interactions. All possible processes involving the direct production of multiple electroweak bosons ($W$, $Z$, and $H$) with up to five final-state particles are considered. Our findings indicate that a muon collider can achieve greater sensitivity than the high-luminosity LHC, especially considering the independence of the Higgs decay branching fraction to muons. Notably, a 10 TeV muon collider offers exceptional sensitivity to muon-Higgs interactions, surpassing the 3 TeV option. In particular, searches based on multi-Higgs production prove highly effective for probing these couplings.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Constraints on Dark Matter Annihilation during the Epoch of Reionization: A CNN Analysis of the 21-cm Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of dark matter annihilation on the 21-cm signal during the cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization (EoR). Using modified 21cmFAST simulations and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we investigate how energy injected into the intergalactic medium (IGM) through dark matter annihilation affects the evolution of the 21-cm differential brightness temperature. Focusing on two annihilation channels, photon-photon ($\gamma \gamma$) and electron-positron ($e^+e^-$), we examine a broad range of dark matter masses and annihilation cross-sections. Our results show that CNNs outperform traditional power spectrum analysis by effectively distinguishing between subtle differences in simulated 21-cm maps produced by annihilation and non-annihilation scenarios. We also demonstrate that the structure formation boost, driven by dark matter clumping into halos and subhalos, significantly enhances the annihilation signal and alters the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. This enhancement leads to a noticeable effect on the 21-cm signal, including a shift from absorption to emission as dark matter annihilation heats the IGM at lower redshifts. By incorporating observational noise from upcoming radio interferometers, particularly the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we show that these effects remain detectable despite observational challenges. We find that the dark matter annihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the 21-cm signal distinguishable from the non-annihilation scenarios for the dark matter masses $m_{\rm DM}=100$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of $\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-31}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ ($\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-32}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ for $m_{\rm DM}=1$ MeV and $\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-24}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ for $m_{\rm DM}=1$ TeV).</description>

      <title>Comparison between the emission torus and the measured toroidal magnetic field for the Crab and Vela nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization measurements provide insight into the magnetic field, a critical aspect of the dynamics and emission properties around the compact object. In this paper, we present the polarized magnetic field of the Crab outer torus and the Vela arc utilizing Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer observation data. The polarization angle (PA) measured for the Crab outer torus exhibits two monotonic evolutions along the azimuth angle, which are consistent with the normal line of the elliptical ring. There is a slight increase in PA along the azimuth angle for both the inner arc and the outer arc of the Vela nebula. The polarized magnetic vector along the outer torus of the Crab nebula shows the polarized magnetic field aligns with Crab outer torus structure. The PA variation along the Crab outer torus suggests a bulk flow speed of 0.8c. Meanwhile, the Vela nebula polarized magnetic field does not exactly align with the Vela arc structure. We noted that the Crab nebula possesses a polarized toroidal magnetic field, where as the Vela nebula exhibits an incomplete toroidal magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the modular symmetry of localized modes on fixed points of $T^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. First, we find that the localized modes with even (odd) modular weight generally have $\Delta(6n^2)$ ($\Delta'(6n^2)$) modular flavor symmetry. Moreover, when we consider an additional Ansatz, the localized modes with even (odd) modular weight generally enjoy $S_3$ ($S'_4$) modular flavor symmetry, and we show the concrete wave functions of the localized modes.</description>

      <title>Everything hot everywhere all at once: Neutrinos and hot dark matter as a single effective species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational cosmology is rapidly closing in on a measurement of the sum M_nu of neutrino masses, at least in the simplest cosmologies, while opening the door to probes of non-standard hot dark matter (HDM) models. By extending the method of effective distributions, we show that any collection of HDM species, with arbitrary masses, temperatures, and distribution functions, including massive neutrinos, may be represented as a single effective HDM species. Implementing this method in the FlowsForTheMasses non-linear perturbation theory for free-streaming particles, we study non-standard HDM models that contain thermal QCD axions or generic bosons in addition to standard neutrinos, as well as non-standard neutrino models wherein either the distribution function of the neutrinos or their temperature is changed. Along the way, we substantially improve the accuracy of this perturbation theory at low masses, bringing it into agreement with the high-resolution TianNu neutrino N-body simulation to about 2% at k = 0.1 h/Mpc and to within 21% up to k = 1 h/Mpc. We accurately reproduce the results of simulations including axions and neutrinos of multiple masses. Studying the differences between the normal, inverted, and degenerate neutrino mass orderings on their non-linear power, we quantify the error in the common approximation of degenerate masses. We release our code publicly at http://github.com/upadhye/FlowsForTheMassesII .</description>

      <title>One trick to treat them all: SuperEasy linear response for any hot dark matter in $N$-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalise the SuperEasy linear response method, originally developed to describe massive neutrinos in cosmological $N$-body simulations, to any hot dark matter (HDM) species with arbitrary momentum distributions. The method uses analytical solutions of the HDM phase space perturbations in various limits and constructs from them a modification factor to the gravitational potential that tricks the cold particles into trajectories as if HDM particles were present in the simulation box. The modification factor is algebraic in the cosmological parameters and requires no fitting. Implementing the method in a Particle-Mesh simulation code and testing it on HDM cosmologies up to the equivalent effect of $\sum m_\nu = 0.315$ eV-mass neutrinos, we find that the generalised SuperEasy approach is able to predict the total matter and cold matter power spectra to $\lesssim 0.1\%$ relative to other linear response methods and to $\lesssim 0.25\%$ relative to particle HDM simulations. Applying the method to cosmologies with mixed neutrinos\Plus{}thermal QCD axions and neutrinos\Plus{}generic thermal bosons, we find that non-standard HDM cosmologies have no intrinsically different non-linear signature in the total matter power spectrum from standard neutrino cosmologies. However, because they predict different time dependencies even at the linear level and the differences are augmented by non-linear evolution, it remains a possibility that observations at multiple redshifts may help distinguish between them.</description>

      <title>Spectral Insights and Timing Analysis of X-ray Bursts in EXO 0748-676: A NuSTAR Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the timing and spectral characteristics of X-ray bursts from the neutron star system EXO 0748-676 using the NuSTAR observatory's FPMA and FPMB instruments in the 3-79 keV range. We identify Type I X-ray bursts driven by thermonuclear explosions on the neutron star's surface, notably a significant burst at \(X = 18,479.97\), indicating rapid energy release, followed by a recoil burst at \(X = 19,463.97\), reflecting stabilization. The correlation between burst timing and the neutron star's optical period suggests modulation by its rotation and periodic accretion dynamics. Spectral modeling reveals a photon index of \( \Gamma = 1.24 \pm 0.014 \) and a cutoff energy of \( E_C = 36.20 \pm 1.04 \; \text{keV} \), indicating a hot corona around the neutron star. The measured flux of approximately \( (381.17 \pm 0.014) \times 10^{-12} \; \text{erg cm}^{-2} \text{s}^{-1} \) underscores the dynamic nature of accretion-driven systems. Calculated luminosities derived from distance estimates range from \( (3.86 \pm 0.239) \times 10^{36} \; \text{erg/s} \) to \( (2.3 \pm 0.177) \times 10^{36} \; \text{erg/s} \). Comparative analysis with prior observations from the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on the INTEGRAL satellite shows variability in emission characteristics, including softer photon indices and higher cutoff energies in 2003 and 2004. Our examination of smaller energy gaps (3-7 keV, 7-12 keV, etc.) reveals energy-dependent behavior in burst characteristics, enhancing our understanding of nuclear burning phases. Overall, these findings validate models describing Type I X-ray bursts and lay the groundwork for future investigations into similar astrophysical systems and stellar evolution processes in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>QCD deconfinement transition line up to $\mu_B=400$ MeV from finite volume lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD cross-over line in the temperature ($T$) -- baryo-chemical potential ($\mu_B$) plane has been computed by several lattice groups by calculating the chiral order parameter and its susceptibility at finite values of $\mu_B$. In this work we focus on the deconfinement aspect of the transition between hadronic and Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phases. We define the deconfinement temperature as the peak position of the static quark entropy ($S_Q(T,\mu_B)$) in $T$, which is based on the renormalized Polyakov loop. We extrapolate $S_Q(T,\mu_B)$ based on high statistics finite temperature ensembles on a $16^3\times 8$ lattice to finite density by means of a Taylor expansion to eighth order in $\mu_B$ (NNNLO) along the strangeness neutral line. For the simulations the 4HEX staggered action was used with 2+1 flavors at physical quark masses. In this setup the phase diagram can be drawn up to unprecedentedly high chemical potentials. Our results for the deconfinement temperature are in rough agreement with phenomenological estimates of the freeze-out curve in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In addition, we study the width of the deconfinement crossover. We show that up to $\mu_B \approx 400$ MeV, the deconfinement transition gets broader at higher densities, disfavoring the existence of a deconfinement critical endpoint in this range. Finally, we examine the transition line without the strangeness neutrality condition and observe a hint for the narrowing of the crossover towards large $\mu_B$.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from October 2022 through May 2024 as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>

      <title>Bridging inflation and reheating: chiral gravitational waves from aHz to GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate chiral gravitational wave (GW) signals generated from inflation to reheating, driven by a parity-violating (PV) term coupled to the inflaton. During inflation, the PV term reduces the sound horizon for right-handed circularly polarized GWs, and amplifies their power spectra relative to left-handed GWs. At CMB scales, these chiral GWs induce BB as well as non-vanishing EB and TB correlations in CMB, which are potentially detectable by LiteBIRD. During reheating, subhorizon modes undergo tachyonic instability, leading to fully circularly polarized GWs with enhanced amplitudes, detectable through the resonant cavity experiment. The absence of backreaction effect of enhanced chiral GWs imposes constraints on the energy scale of the PV term, the inflationary potential, and the reheating history. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-frequency GW experiments to offer a unique probe of the parity violation and early Universe.</description>

      <title>The Energy Sharing Timescale in an Analytic Framework for Common Envelope Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new predictive theory for the analysis of common envelope (CE) events which incorporates the effects of relevant hydrodynamical processes into a simple analytical framework. We introduce the ejection and dynamical parameters $\xi$ and $\beta$, which define if envelope ejection is energetically or hydrodynamically favorable, respectively, during CE inspiral. When combined, these parameters offer a detailed narrative of how inspiral begins, proceeds, and ends that is consistent with preliminary comparisons to 3D hydrodynamical models. This physically-motivated framework impacts predictions for CE outcomes, especially for systems that have energy excess, and offers promise as a potential alternative for the treatment of CE in binary population synthesis.</description>

      <title>Memory-Burdened Primordial Black Holes as Astrophysical Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \textit{memory burden} effect, stating that the amount of information stored within a system contributes to its stabilization, is particularly significant in systems with a high capacity for information storage such as black holes. In these systems, the evaporation process is halted, at the latest, after approximately half of the black hole's initial mass has been radiated away. Consequently, light primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{15}\,$g, which are expected to have fully evaporated by present time, may remain viable candidates for dark matter (DM). In this scenario, we demonstrate that their mergers would continue to occur today, leading to the formation of ``young'' black holes that resume evaporating, producing ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays detectable by current experiments. The emission spectrum would be thermal in all Standard Model particle species, offering a clear and distinguishable signature. Current measurements of the isotropic neutrino flux at Earth are in tension with light PBHs as DM candidates within the mass range $7\times10^3\lesssim m_{\rm PBH}/{\rm g}\lesssim 4\times 10^8$, if neutrinos are of Majorana nature. We also discuss the potential for refining these constraints through gamma-ray and cosmic-ray observations, as well as gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that a sharply peaked curvature spectrum is often considered in the literature, we examine theoretical constraints on the sharpness of such a spectrum. In particular, we show that the sharply peaked curvature power spectrum, originating from the enhancement of subhorizon perturbations during inflation, is significantly constrained by energy conservation. While the constraints do not depend on the exact form of inflaton potential, we also study concrete inflaton potentials that realize a sharply peaked curvature spectrum and how theoretical limits are saturated in these cases.</description>

      <title>Simulating realistic self-interacting dark matter models including small and large-angle scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) self-interactions alter the matter distribution on galactic scales and alleviate tensions with observations. A feature of the self-interaction cross section is its angular dependence, influencing offsets between galaxies and DM halos in merging galaxy clusters. While algorithms for modelling mostly forward-dominated or mostly large-angle scatterings exist, incorporating realistic angular dependencies, such as light mediator models, within $N$-body simulations remains challenging. We develop, validate and apply a novel and efficient method, combining existing approaches to describe small- and large-angle scattering regimes within a hybrid scheme. Below a critical angle the effective description via a drag force combined with transverse momentum diffusion is used, while above the angle-dependence is sampled explicitly. First, we verify the scheme using a test set-up with known analytical solutions, and check that our results are insensitive to the choice of the critical angle within an expected range. Next, we demonstrate that our scheme speeds up the computations by multiple orders of magnitude for realistic light mediator models. Finally, we apply the method to galaxy cluster mergers and discuss the sensitivity of the offset between galaxies and DM to the angle-dependence of the cross section. Our scheme ensures accurate offsets for mediator mass $m_\phi$ and DM mass $m_\chi$ within the range $0.1v/c\lesssim m_\phi/m_\chi\lesssim v/c$, while for larger (smaller) mass ratios the offsets obtained for isotropic (forward-dominated) self-scattering are approached. Here $v$ is the typical velocity scale. Equivalently, the upper condition can be expressed as $1.1\lesssim \sigma_{\rm tot}/\sigma_{\mathrm{\widetilde{T}}}\lesssim 10$ for the ratio of total and momentum transfer cross sections, with the ratio being $1$ ($\infty$) in the isotropic (forward-dominated) limits.</description>

      <title>Empirical determination of the energy loss of heavy quarks in nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.02644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy quarks produced in the heavy ion collisions loose energy while propagting in the hot partonic matter which finally fragment to heavy ($D$ or $B$) mesons. The energy loss suffered by the heavy quarks is imprinted in the nuclear modification factor as a function of transverse momenta ($p_T$) of these heavy mesons. An alternate measure of in-medium energy loss comes through the effective shift in transverse momentum spectra of hadrons recorded in nucleus-nucleus collisions when it is compared to the same in proton-proton collisions. We start by parametrizing invariant momentum yields of heavy mesons in p+p collisions. The fit function from p+p collisions and measured nuclear modification factor in heavy ion collisions are then utilised to obtain the shift in the transeverse mass $\Delta m_T$ of heavy mesons produced at the RHIC and LHC experiments.The energy loss $\Delta m_T$ so obtained is found to scale with the transverse mass ($m_T$) of heavy mesons through a power law at different energies and centralities of collisions. We have also calculated using theoretical formalism, the total energy loss suffered by a charm quark in quark-gluon plasma produced in Pb~+~Pb collisions at the LHC energies. The evolution of the plasma is described by (2+1) dimensional longitudinal boost-invariant ideal hydrodynamics. It is found that the total energy loss of charm quarks scales with the transverse mass of charm quarks through a similar power law which supports our empirical analysis of energy loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.00345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muon decay is self-analyzing: the spectral-angular distribution of the emitted electron reveals the spin orientation of the polarized muon. Here, we show that the same feature applies to muons in non-plane-wave states and helps reveal the rich polarization opportunities available. We focus on the so-called vortex states, in which the muon carries a non-zero orbital angular momentum with respect to the average propagation direction and exhibits a cone structure in the momentum distribution. We compute the spectrum and the angular distribution of the electrons emitted in decays of vortex muons and show that the most revealing observable is not the angular distribution but the fixed-angle electron spectra. Even for very small cone opening angles of the vortex muons, it will be easy to observe significant modifications of the electron spectra which would allow one to distinguish vortex muons from approximately plane wave muons, as well as to differentiate among various polarization states. These features will be the key to tracking the evolution of vortex muons in external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave and CMB Probes of Axion Kination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotations of an axion field in field space provide a natural origin for an era of kination domination, where the energy density is dominated by the kinetic term of the axion field, preceded by an early era of matter domination. Remarkably, no entropy is produced at the end of matter domination and hence these eras of matter and kination domination may occur even after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We derive constraints on these eras from both the cosmic microwave background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We investigate how this cosmological scenario affects the spectrum of possible primordial gravitational waves and find that the spectrum features a triangular peak. We discuss how future observations of gravitational waves can probe the viable parameter space, including regions that produce axion dark matter by the kinetic misalignment mechanism or the baryon asymmetry by axiogenesis. For QCD axion dark matter produced by the kinetic misalignment mechanism, a modification to the inflationary gravitational wave spectrum occurs above 0.01 Hz and, for high values of the energy scale of inflation, the prospects for discovery are good. We briefly comment on implications for structure formation of the universe.</description>

      <title>Isospin sum rules in charmed baryon weak decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isospin symmetry is the most precise flavor symmetry. The effective Hamiltonian of charm quark weak decay is zero under the isospin lowering operators $I_-^n$, which permits us to generate isospin sum rules through several master formulas. In this work, we derive the master formulas of isospin sum rules for the two- and three-body non-leptonic decays of singly and doubly charmed baryons. Hundreds of isospin sum rules are derived to test of isospin symmetry and provide hints for the new decay modes. The isospin sum rules for multi-body decays are not broken by the intermediate resonances and hence can be used to study the isospin partners of exotic hadrons.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic and hadronic decay of fully heavy tetraquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we compute the electromagnetic and hadronic decay widths of the S-wave fully heavy tetraquark $T_{4Q}$ ($Q=c$ or $b$) at lowest order in $\alpha_s$ and $v$, in the framework of nonrelativistic QCD. The short-distance coefficients are determined through the standard procedure of matching. The nonperturbative long-distance matrix elements are related to the phenomenological four-body Schr\"odinger wave functions at the origin, whose values are taken from literature. The branching fractions are predicted to be around $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ for the $T_{4c}$ hadronic decay and electromagnetic decay, respectively. Combing our results with the $T_{4c}$ production cross sections at the LHC, we also predict the event numbers for various decay channels. With integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=100 \,{\rm fb}^{-1}$, it is expected that the event numbers can reach $10^3$ for $T_{4c}\to \gamma\gamma$, and $10^6$ for $T_{4c}\to {\rm LH}$, at the LHC. The detecting prospect is promising. In addition, the decay widths of $T_{4b}$ are estimated based on simple dimensional analysis as well as velocity scaling rule.</description>

      <title>Flavor invariance of leptonic Yukawa terms in the 3HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an extension of the Standard Model (SM), the 3HDM (Three-Higgs-Doublet Model) defines additional relationships among the fermions. In the visible leptonic Yukawa sector of the 3HDM, we investigate the existence of flavor symmetries under discrete non-abelian groups up to order 1032. When the VEVs are not allowed to depart from their alignment imposed by the condition of minimal potential in the Higgs scalar sector, there will be severe mass degeneracies and a lack of lepton flavor mixing for any nontrivial flavor group. Yet we propose to study the Yukawa terms of the lepton sector for in case the VEV alignment would not be protected, hence leaving the VEV ratios as free parameters. Then, as it turns out, mass splitting for the charged leptons and the neutrinos is obtained although it is still impossible to obtain correct fits to the experimentally known lepton mass spectrum and to the PMNS matrix simultaneously.</description>

      <title>The natural smallness of neutrino mass from the multiplicative Lagrangian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an alternative scheme to provide the neutrino mass scale from the Higgs mechanism. The multiplicative Lagrangian model of the Higgs field plays an essential role in explaining a huge difference between the mass of the charged fermion and Dirac neutrinos, while the ratio of Yukawa coupling between these two groups of particles is naturally in the same scale. On the other hand, if the neutrino mass is mixed between the Dirac and Majorana types, the mass of the right-handed neutrinos in the type-I seesaw mechanism can be in the range between sub-eV and the grand unification scale without too small Yukawa coupling falling outside the standard model regime.</description>

      <title>Four-quark scatterings in QCD II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [1], we initiated a program for the quantitative investigation of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and resonant bound states in QCD with the functional renormalisation group, concentrating on the full infrared dynamics of four-quark scatterings. In the present work we extend this study and take into account a three-momentum channel approximation ($s,t,u$-channel) for the Fierz-complete four-quark vertices. We find that the four-quark vertex in this approximation is quantitatively reliable. In particular, we have computed the pion pole mass, pion decay constant, Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes, the quark mass function and wave function. Our results confirm previous findings that low energy effective theories only reproduce QCD quantitatively, if initiated with a relatively low ultraviolet cutoff scale of the order of 500 MeV. The quantitative description set up here paves the way for reliable quantitative access to the resonance structure in QCD within the fRG approach to QCD.</description>

      <title>Two-loop anomalous dimensions for small-$R$ jet versus hadronic fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collinear fragmentation of highly energetic jets defined with a small jet radius. In particular, we investigate how the corresponding fragmentation functions differ from their hadronic counterpart defined in the common $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme. We find that the anomalous dimensions governing the perturbative evolution of the two fragmentation functions differ starting at the two loop order. We compute for the first time the new anomalous dimensions at two loops and confirm our predictions by comparing the inclusive small-$R$ jet spectrum against a fixed order perturbative calculation at ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$. To investigate the dependence of the anomalous dimension on the kinematic cutoff variable, we study the fragmentation functions of Cambridge jets defined with a transverse momentum cutoff as opposed to an angular cutoff $R$. We further study the evolution of the small-$R$ fragmentation function with an alternative cutoff scale, proportional to $z R$, representing the maximum possible transverse momentum of emissions within a jet. In these cases we find that the two-loop anomalous dimensions coincide with the $\overline{\rm MS}$ DGLAP ones, highlighting a correspondence between the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme and a transverse-momentum cutoff.</description>

      <title>Unitarity effects in elastic scattering at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the high-energy behavior of the elastic scattering amplitude using two distinct unitarization schemes: the eikonal and the $U$-matrix. Our analysis begins with a formalism involving solely Pomerons, incorporating pion-loop insertions in the Pomeron trajectory representing the nearest singularity generated by $t$-channel unitarity. Subsequently, we explore a scenario that includes the presence of an Odderon. In our analyses, we explore the tension between the TOTEM and the ATLAS measurements for $\sigma_{tot}$ and $d\sigma/dt$ at 7, 8, and 13 TeV, and the subsequent implications for the properties of both the Pomeron and Odderon. Our results show that the Odderon phase factor $\xi_{\Bbb O}= -1$ is favored in both unitarization schemes, supporting an Odderon with a phase opposite to that of other crossing-odd components of the scattering amplitude. More interestingly, this specific phase factor stands as the sole one that aligns with results consistent with a non-zero Odderon coupling.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Vector-Like Bottom-Quark Models in the Alignment Limit of the 2-Higgs Doublet Model Type-II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expanding upon our ongoing investigation of Vector-Like Quark (VLQ) phenomenology within a 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) framework, in this paper, we complement a previous one dedicated to Vector-Like Top-quarks (VLTs) by studying Vector-Like Bottom-quarks (VLBs), specifically focusing on their behavior in the alignment limit of a Type-II Yukawa structure. We examine the potential for detecting VLBs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and analyze their decay signatures, encompassing both Standard Model (SM) processes and exotic decays. The objective is to differentiate among singlet, doublet, and triplet configurations of VLBs by identifying distinct decay patterns, thereby providing insights into the structure of Beyond the SM (BSM) physics.</description>

      <title>Branching ratios and CP asymmetries of the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \rightarrow \ K^{*}_0(1430,1950) D_{(s)} \rightarrow K \pi D_{(s)} $ in the PQCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430,1950) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$ within the perterbative QCD (PQCD) framework. The S-wave two-meson distribution amplitudes (DAs) are introduced to describe the final state interactions of the $K\pi$ pair, which involve the time-like form factors and the Gegenbauer polynomials. In the calculations, we adopt two kinds of parameterization schemes to describe the time-like form factors: One is the relativistic Breit-Wigner (RBW) formula, which is usually more siutable for the narrow resonances, and the other is the LASS line shape proposed by the LASS Collaboration, which includes both the resonant and nonresonant components. We find that the branching ratios and the direct CP violations for the decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)}$ obtained from those of the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$ under the narrow width approximation (NWA) can be consistent well with the previous PQCD results calculated in the two-body framework by assuming that $K^*_0(1430)$ being the lowest lying $\bar q s$ state, which is so-called scenario II (SII). We conclude that the LASS parameterization is more siutable to describe the $K_0^{*}(1430)$ than the RBW formula, and the nonresonant components play an important role in the branching ratios of the decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$. In view of the large difference between the decay width measurements for the $K_0^{*}(1950)$ given by BaBar and LASS collaborations, we calculate the branching ratios and the CP violations for the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1950) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$ by using two values, $\Gamma_{K^*_0(1950)}=0.100\pm0.04$ GeV and $\Gamma_{K^*_0(1950)}=0.201\pm0.034$ GeV, besides the two kinds of parameterizations for the resonance $K^*_0(1950)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10815v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore how constraints based on interference effects for the negative gauge-Higgs coupling scenario are affected by new physics. Models that achieve this wrong-sign gauge-Higgs coupling inevitably have new charged Higgs states. These states affect the interpretation of interference effects. We recast the ATLAS analysis for VBF $Wh$, showing that the previously excluded negative gauge-Higgs coupling scenario is still experimentally viable for charged Higgs masses below $370$~GeV. We show that it is possible to weaken this bound further with mild tuning in the parameter space. We discuss how to further constrain the wrong-sign gauge-Higgs coupling hypothesis and point out the potential of VBF $Zh$ to exclude this scenario in a model-independent way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the nuclear suppression factor $S_{Pb}(x)$, where $x=M_{J/\psi}^2/W_{\gamma p}^2$ with $M_{J/\psi}$ the $J/\psi$ mass and $W_{\gamma p}$ the photon-nucleon energy, for the cross section of coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction in heavy-ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) by performing the $\chi^2$ fit to all available data on the cross section $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ as a function of the $J/\psi$ rapidity $y$ and the photoproduction cross section $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$ as a function of $W_{\gamma p}$. We find that while the $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ data alone constrain $S_{Pb}(x)$ for $x \geq 10^{-3}$, the combined $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ and $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$ data allow us to determine $S_{Pb}(x)$ in the wide interval $10^{-5} &lt; x &lt; 0.05$. In particular, the data favor $S_{Pb}(x)$, which decreases with a decrease of $x$ in the $10^{-4} &lt; x &lt; 0.01$ interval, and can be both decreasing or constant for $x&lt; 10^{-4}$. Identifying $S_{Pb}(x)$ with the ratio of the gluon distributions in Pb and the proton $R_g(x,Q_0^2)=g_A(x,Q_0^2)/[A g_p(x,Q_0^2)]$, we demonstrate that the leading twist approximation (LTA) for nuclear shadowing provides a good description of all the data on $d\sigma^{AA \to J/\psi AA}/dy$ and $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$ as well as on the experimental values for $S_{Pb}(x)$ derived from $\sigma^{\gamma A \to J/\psi A}(W_{\gamma p})$. We also show that modern nuclear PDFs reasonably reproduce $S_{Pb}(x)$ as well.</description>

      <title>Enhanced primordial gravitational waves from a stiff post-inflationary era due to an oscillating inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of inflationary models, which lead to a stiff period after inflation that boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). In both families of models studied, we consider an oscillating scalar condensate, which when far away from the minimum it is overdamped by a warped kinetic term, a la $\alpha$-attractors. This leads to successful inflation. The oscillating condensate is in danger of becoming fragmented by resonant effects when non-linearities take over. Consequently, the stiff phase cannot be prolonged enough to enhance primordial GWs at frequencies observable in the near future for low orders of the envisaged scalar potential. However, this is not the case for a higher-order scalar potential. Indeed, we show that this case results in a boosted GW spectrum that overlaps with future observations without generating too much GW radiation to de-stabilise Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. For example, taking $\alpha={\cal O}(1)$, we find that the GW signal can be safely enhanced up to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\sim 10^{-11}$ at frequency $f\sim 10^2\,$Hz, which will be observable by the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our mechanism ends up with a characteristic GW spectrum, which if observed, can lead to the determination of the inflation energy scale, the reheating temperature and the shape (steepness) of the scalar potential around the minimum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the muon magnetic dipole moment (MDM) has close relation with the new physics (NP) in the development of the Standard Model (SM). Combined with the Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) E821 result, the departure from the SM prediction is about 5.0 $\sigma$. We study the electroweak corrections from several type two-loop SUSY diagrams and the virtual SUSY particles include chargino, neutralino, scalar lepton and scalar neutrino. Based on the latest experimental constraints, we study the muon MDM under the next to the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM with local B-L gauge symmetry (N-B-LSSM). The abundant numerical results verify that $\tan{\beta},~T_e,~M^2_L,~M^2_e,~M_{BB'}$ play an important role in muon MDM. $M^2_e,~\tan{\beta}$ and $T_e$ are sensitive parameters to muon MDM. From the data obtained in all the figures of the numerical results, most of the values of $a_{\mu}^{NBL}$ are in 2$\sigma$ interval, which can compensate the departure between the experiment data and the SM prediction.</description>

Abstract: The commonly used pseudo-C symmetry $(\nu_{L})^{c}=C\overline{\nu_{L}}^{T}$ is not defined in Lagrangian field theory. In general, there exist two classes of Majorana fermions; the first is associated with the Dirac-type fermion with the conventional C and P symmetries, and the second is associated with the Weyl-type fermion defined by CP symmetry only and formally characterised by the pseudo-C symmetry. Taking the seesaw model as an example, it is shown that a generalized Pauli--G\"{u}rsey (or Bogoliubov-type) canonical transformation converts the neutrino defined by the Weyl-type fermion to the neutrino defined by the Dirac-type fermion and thus to the conventional Majorana fermion, while preserving the canonical anti-commutation relations. The mixing angles in the weak lepton sector are not modified by this generalized Pauli--G\"{u}rsey transformation.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusion of heavy quark in hot QCD matter by the fractional Langevin equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subdiffusion phenomena are studied for heavy quarks dynamics in the hot QCD matter. My approach aims to provide a more realistic description of heavy quark dynamics through detailed theoretical analyses and numerical simulations, utilizing the fractional Langevin equation framework with the Caputo fractional derivative. I present numerical schemes for the fractional Langevin equation for subdiffusion and calculate the time evolution mean squared displacement and mean squared momentum of the heavy quarks. My results indicate that the mean squared displacements of the heavy quarks for the subdiffusion process deviate from a linear relationship with time. Further, I calculate the normalized momentum correlation function, kinetic energy, and momentum spread. Finally, I show the effect of subdiffusion on experimental observables, the nuclear modification factor.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar heavy quarkonium production in heavy ion ultraperipheral collision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inclusive production of pseudoscalar heavy quarkoniua ($\eta_c,~\eta_b$ and $B_c$) via photon-photon fusion in heavy ion ultraperipheral collision (UPC) are calculated to QCD next-to-leading order in the framework of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD). The total cross section of $\eta_c$ produced in Pb-Pb UPC is 194 $\mathrm{nb}$ and 1275 $\mathrm{nb}$ at nucleon-nucleon c.m. energies $\sqrt{S_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 5.52 TeV and 39.4 TeV, respectively. The cross sections for $\eta_b$ and $B_c$ mesons are more than two to three orders of magnitude smaller. We make a detailed phenomenological analysis on the $\eta_c$ production; the uncertainties caused by the renormalization scale and the charm quark mass, the cross sections in other ultraperipheral nucleon-nucleon colliding systems, and the transverse momentum distribution are discussed. At the coming HL-LHC and future FCC, the heavy ion UPC opens another door of the study on the production of heavy quarkonium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism, a prominent framework for explaining the observed flavor hierarchies, generically predicts the existence of an axion-like particle (ALP). This work examines a class of FN models based on $\mathbb{Z}_N$ discrete symmetries. We chart the allowed parameter space from a set of theoretical considerations and construct explicit renormalizable completions with minimal field content necessary to generate consistent textures. We then conduct comprehensive phenomenological analyses of two particularly elegant $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_8$ models, highlighting the interplay between the effects of the ALP and the associated UV fields. We find that the FN scale can be as low as a few TeV.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Extraction of the Weak Radius and the Weak Mixing Angle from Parity-Violating Electron Scattering on $^{12}\mathrm{C}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of nuclear structure uncertainties on a measurement of the weak charge of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at the future MESA facility in Mainz. Information from a large variety of nuclear models, accurately calibrated to the ground-state properties of selected nuclei, suggest that a $0.3$% precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry at forward angles will not be compromised by nuclear structure effects, thereby allowing a world-leading determination of the weak charge of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$. Furthermore, we show that a combination of measurements of the parity-violating asymmetry at forward and backward angles for the same electron beam energy can be used to extract information on the nuclear weak charge distribution. We conclude that a $0.34$% precision on the weak radius of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ may be achieved by performing a $3$% precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry at backward angles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The program ftint is introduced which numerically evaluates dimensionally regulated integrals as they occur in the perturbative approach to the gradient-flow formalism in quantum field theory. It relies on sector decomposition in order to determine the coefficients of the individual orders in $\epsilon=(4-D)/2$, where $D$ is the space-time dimension. For that purpose, it implements an interface to the public library pySecDec. The current version works for massive and massless integrals up to three-loop level with vanishing external momenta, but the underlying method is extendable to more general cases.</description>

      <title>Old neutron stars as a new probe of relic neutrinos and sterile neutrino dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the kinetic cooling (heating) of old neutron stars due to coherent scattering with relic neutrinos (sterile neutrino dark matter) via Standard Model neutral-current interactions. We take into account several important physical effects, such as gravitational clustering, coherent enhancement, neutron degeneracy and Pauli blocking. We find that the anomalous cooling of nearby neutron stars due to relic neutrino scattering might actually be observable by current and future telescopes operating in the optical to near-infrared frequency band, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), provided there is a large local relic overdensity that is still allowed. Similarly, the anomalous heating of neutron stars due to coherent scattering with keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter, could also be observed by JWST or future telescopes, which would probe hitherto unexplored parameter space in the sterile neutrino mass-mixing plane.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Cosmological Tensions with Inelastic Dark Matter and Dark Radiation in a $\boldsymbol{U(1)_D}$ Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel and comprehensive particle physics framework that addresses multiple cosmological tensions observed in recent measurements of the Hubble parameter, $S_8$, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. Our model, termed `{\bf SIDR$+\boldsymbol{z_t}$}' (Self Interacting Dark Radiation with transition redshift), is based on an inelastic dark matter (IDM) scenario coupled with dark radiation, governed by a $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry. This framework naturally incorporates cold dark matter (DM), strongly interacting dark radiation (SIDR), and the interactions between these components. The fluid-like behavior of the dark radiation component which originates from the self-quartic coupling of the $U(1)_D$ breaking scalar can suppress the free-streaming effects. Simultaneously, the interacting DM-DR system can attenuate the matter power spectrum at small scales. The inelastic nature of DM provides a distinct temperature dependence for the DM-DR interaction rate determined by the mass-splitting between the inelastic dark fermions which is crucial for resolving the Ly-$\alpha$ discrepancies. We present a cosmologically consistent analysis of the model by solving the relevant Boltzmann equations to obtain the energy density and number density evolution of different species of the model. The DR undergoes two ``steps" of increased energy density when the heavier dark species freeze out and become non-relativistic, transferring their entropy to the dark radiation and enhancing $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. The analysis showcases the model's potential to uphold the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) prediction of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ but dominantly producing additional contributions prior to recombination, while simultaneously achieving correct relic density of DM though an hybrid of freeze-in and non-thermal production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify the Standard Model's $\mathfrak{su}(3)\oplus \mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus \mathfrak{u}(1)$ internal symmetries within the triality symmetries $\mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{C}) \oplus \mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{H}) \oplus \mathfrak{tri}(\mathbb{O})$. From here, the corresponding Standard Model group action is applied to the triality triple $\left( \Psi_+, \Psi_-,V\right)$ for $\Psi_+, \Psi_-, V \in \mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$. Together, $\Psi_+$ and $\Psi_-$ provide the correct irreducible representations for two generations. Owing to a certain Cartan Factorization, which we define, $V$ provides the irreducible representations for a third generation. Said more explicitly in another way, division algebraic multiplication merges a third generation of spinor representations into a set of scalar bosons. This set of scalar bosons includes the familiar Standard Model Higgs representation.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the CP Phase $\delta_{CP}$ in the Neutrino Oscillation and an Axion-less Solution to the Strong CP Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model of the axion-less solution to the strong CP problem has been recently constructed based on the $\bf T^2/\mathbb{Z}_3$ orbifold in the six dimensional space-time. We extend, in this paper, the model to include the lepton sector with three right-handed neutrinos. A crucial point in the extended model is that we have only one CP-violating phase and thus the CP phase in the neutrino oscillation can be predicted by the CP phase in the CKM matrix. The CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ in the PMNS matrix is predicted as $\delta_{CP}\simeq 195^\circ - 200^\circ$ which can be tested in the near future experiments. We also discuss the effective mass $m_{\beta\beta}$ responsible for the neutrino-less double beta decay of nucleus, which is predicted as $m_{\beta\beta} \simeq 8-11$meV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a next-generation hybrid event-by-event three-fluid hydrodynamic model, suitable for simulations of heavy-ion collisions in the energy range from few up to tens of GeV per colliding NN pair. At such energies the interpenetration time of the nuclei is of the same order as the lifetime of the system, however this model treats the initial phase hydrodynamically. Thanks to that it is more sensitive to the Equation of State than 1-fluid models with initial states being parametrised or generated by transport approach. Hence, our model is well designed for simulations at collision energies, at which matter in vicinity of the QCD critical endpoint is expected. The construction of the model is explained and basic observables like hadron spectra in rapidity and transverse momentum, as well as elliptic flow are calculated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic isobar collisions have been proposed as a useful tool to investigate nuclear structure. These systems are not created in equilibrium, rather undergo a pre-thermalization stage. In this stage, some of the initial structure information may be lost and additional effects introduced. The objective of this paper is to study this possibility in the extreme case of a ``free-streaming'' pre-equilibrium stage. We do this by computing estimators for ratios of various measured (or measurable) quantities (elliptic and triangular flows, mean transverse momentum and associated cumulants, correlators between elliptic or triangular flows and mean transverse momentum, symmetric cumulant and two-plane correlator) and study their sensitivity to the duration of the free-streaming stage. We find that the correlators between elliptic or triangular flows and mean transverse momentum, the so-called $\rho_2$ and $\rho_3$, are indeed sensitive to the duration of the free-streaming stage and that the normalized symmetric cumulant, $\varepsilon NSC(2,3)$ might also depend on this duration.</description>

      <title>Universal rapidity scaling of entanglement entropy inside hadrons from conformal invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a hadron is probed at high energy, a nontrivial quantum entanglement entropy inside the hadron emerges due to the lack of complete information about the hadron wave function extracted from this measurement. In the high-energy limit, the hadron becomes a maximally entangled state, with a linear dependence of entanglement entropy on rapidity, as has been found in a recent analysis based on parton description. In this paper, we use an effective conformal field theoretic description of hadrons on the light cone to show that the linear dependence of the entanglement entropy on rapidity found in parton description is a general consequence of approximate conformal invariance and does not depend on the assumption of weak coupling. Our result also provides further evidence for a duality between the parton and string descriptions of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Bulk Viscosity, Speed of Sound and Contact Structure at Intermediate Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10541</link>

Abstract: In the context of strongly coupled thermal QCD-like theories, the bulk viscosity($\zeta$)-to-shear viscosity($\eta$) ratio using the type IIA-theory dual of thermal QCD-like theories was shown to vary like $\frac{1}{3} - c_s^2$ (arXiv:1807.04713) ($c_s$ being the speed of sound), and the same ($\frac{\zeta}{\eta}$) at weak coupling using kinetic theory and finite temperature field theory, was shown and is known to vary like $\left(\frac{1}{3} - c_s^2\right)^2$ (arXiv:1807.04713). The novelties of the results of this paper are that we not only show for the first time from ${\cal M}$ theory that at intermediate coupling, with the inclusion of the ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections, the result obtained for $\frac{\zeta}{\eta}$ interpolates between the strong and weak coupling results in a way consistent with lattice computations of $SU(3)$ Gluodynamics (arXiv:0710.3717 [hep-lat]) within statistical errors (and within the temperature range permissible by our ${\cal M}$-theory uplift), but also observe that this behavior is related to the existence of Contact 3-Structures that exist only at intermediate coupling effected by the intermediate-$N$ "MQGP" limit of (arXiv:2211.13186[hep-th]). We also obtain an explicit dependence of $\frac{\zeta}{\eta}$ on (fractional powers of) the temperature-dependent/running gauge coupling (and its temperature derivative), and verify that the weak-coupling result dominates at large temperatures. We further conjecture that the aforementioned fractional-power-dependence of $\frac{\zeta}{\eta}$ on the gauge coupling is related to the lack of ``$N$-connectedness'' in the parameter space of Contact 3-Structures (as shown in arXiv:2211.13186[hep-th]).</description>

      <title>Superconducting multi-vortices and a novel BPS bound in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>

      <title>Impact of the radial profile of atomic nuclei on observables in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In heavy-ion phenomenology, the nucleon density distribution in colliding nuclei is commonly described by a two-parameter Woods-Saxon (WS) distribution. However, this approach overlooks the detailed radial structure in the density distribution that arises from the quantal filling patterns of neutrons and protons. These fine structures, as estimated by the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock density functional, cause slight deviations in heavy-ion observables from the WS baseline, which cannot be captured by simply readjusting the WS parameters. These deviations depend on centrality and observable but often exhibit similar shapes for different nuclei. To fully exploit the exceptional sensitivity of isobar collisions to nuclear structure, such fine structures should be considered.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics close to the black hole horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless and singularity-free compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the object's reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes when the object is partially reflecting or the compactness differs from the black hole case. We also find that in reflective ultracompact objects some of the modes tend towards instability as the spin increases. Finally, we show that the spin enhances the deviations from the black-hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. This implies that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.</description>

      <title>The AMS-02 cosmic ray deuteron flux is consistent with a secondary origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent measurements of cosmic ray deuteron fluxes by AMS-02 show that the rigidity dependence of deuterons is similar with that of protons but flatter than $^3$He, which has been attributed to the existence of primary deuterons with abundance much higher than that from the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The requirement of highly deuteron-abundant sources imposes a serious challenge on the modern astrophysics since there is no known process to produce a large amount of deuterons without violating other constraints \citep{1976Natur.263..198E}. In this work we demonstrate that the fragmentation of heavy nuclei up to nickel plays a crucial role in shaping/enhancing the spectrum/flux of the cosmic ray deuterons. Based on the latest cosmic ray data, the predicted secondary fluxes of deuterons and $^3$He are found to be reasonably consistent with the AMS-02 measurements and a primary deuteron component is not needed. The observed differences between the spectra of D and $^3$He, as well as those between the D/$^4$He (D/p) and $^3$He/$^4$He ($^3$He/p) flux ratios, measured in the rigidity space, is probably due to the kinetic-energy-to-rigidity conversion and the solar modulation, given different charge-to-mass ratios of D and $^3$He. More precise measurements of the fragmentation cross sections of various nuclei to produce deuterons, tritons, and $^3$He in a wide energy range will be very helpful in further testing the secondary origin of cosmic ray deuterons.</description>

      <title>Global aspects of $3$-form gauge theory: implications for axion-Yang-Mills systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the proposition that axion-Yang-Mills systems are characterized by a $3$-form gauge theory in the deep infrared regime. This hypothesis is rigorously examined by initially developing a systematic framework for analyzing $3$-form gauge theory coupled to an axion, specifically focusing on its global properties. The theory consists of a BF term deformed by marginal and irrelevant operators and describes a network of vacua separated by domain walls converging at the junction of an axion string. It encompasses $0$- and $3$-form spontaneously broken global symmetries. Utilizing this framework, in conjunction with effective field theory techniques and 't Hooft anomaly-matching conditions, we argue that the $3$-form gauge theory faithfully captures the infrared physics of the axion-Yang-Mills system. The ultraviolet theory is an $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory endowed with a massless Dirac fermion coupled to a complex scalar and is characterized by chiral and genuine $\mathbb{Z}_m^{(1)}$ $1$-form center symmetries, with a mixed anomaly between them. It features two scales: the vev of the complex scalar, $v$, and the strong-coupling scale, $\Lambda$, with $\Lambda \ll v$. Below $v$, the fermion decouples and a $U(1)^{(2)}$ $2$-form winding symmetry emerge, while the $1$-form symmetry is enhanced to $\mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$. As we flow below $\Lambda$, matching the mixed anomaly necessitates introducing a dynamical $3$-form gauge field of $U(1)^{(2)}$, which appears as the incarnation of a long-range tail of the color field. The infrared theory possesses spontaneously broken chiral and emergent $3$-form global symmetries. It passes several checks, among which: it displays the expected restructuring in the hadronic sector upon transition between the vacua, and it is consistent under the gauging of the genuine $\mathbb Z_m^{(1)}\subset \mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Exploring atmospheric neutrino oscillations at ESSnuSB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides an analysis of atmospheric neutrino oscillations at the ESSnuSB far detector facility. The prospects of the two cylindrical Water Cherenkov detectors with a total fiducial mass of 540 kt are investigated over 10 years of data taking in the standard three-flavor oscillation scenario. We present the confidence intervals for the determination of mass ordering, $\theta_{23}$ octant as well as for the precisions on $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $|\Delta m_{31}^2|$. It is shown that mass ordering can be resolved by $3\sigma$ CL ($5\sigma$ CL) after 4 years (10 years) regardless of the true neutrino mass ordering. Correspondingly, the wrong $\theta_{23}$ octant could be excluded by $3\sigma$ CL after 4 years (8 years) in the case where the true neutrino mass ordering is normal ordering (inverted ordering). The results presented in this work are complementary to the accelerator neutrino program in the ESSnuSB project.</description>

      <title>Geometric realization from irrelevant deformations induced by the stress-energy tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the deformations driven by the stress-energy tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator $\mathcal O$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation and the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results. As several applications of the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational models. Besides, the deformations of Lagrangians for scalar field theories are performed.</description>

      <title>Probing for an IR-fixed Point in QCD by Superallowed Gamow-Teller Transitions in Doubly Magic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This brief note is to point out that the recent measurements at GSI and RIKEN of the superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly magic closed-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn could give an indication for a possibly important {\it fundamental} quenching, thus-far unrecognized, of $g_A$, unambiguously distinct from nuclear correlation effects in the framework of nuclear effective field theory. The result, either confirmed or ruled out both experimentally and theory, can have strong impacts on nuclear physics vis-\`a-vis with nuclear effective field theory as well as on particle physics relevant for going beyond the Standard Model.</description>
