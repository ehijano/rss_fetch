      <title>Fast, Scale-Adaptive, and Uncertainty-Aware Downscaling of Earth System Model Fields with Generative Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are computationally too expensive. Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our foundation model approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Hybrid data assimilation techniques using the adjoint method in a coupled Lorenz system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid 4D-variational data assimilation method for numerical climate models is introduced using the Lorenz '63 model. This new approach has the potential to optimise a high complexity Earth system model (ESM) by utilising the adjoint equations of an intermediate complexity ESM. The method is conceptually demonstrated by consecutively synchronising two Lorenz '63 systems to observations before optimisation. The first represents a 'high complexity' model and the second an 'intermediate complexity' model which has adjoint equations. This method will save computational power for a full ESM and has negligible error and uncertainty change compared to the optimisation of a single model with adjoint equations. A similar setup can be applied to sparse observations. An alternative assimilation setup, with two identical models, is used to filter noisy data. This reduces optimised parametric model uncertainty by approximately one third. Such a precision gain could prove valuable for seasonal, annual, and decadal predictions.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Tropical Cyclones with Cascaded Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01690v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As tropical cyclones become more intense due to climate change, the rise of Al-based modelling provides a more affordable and accessible approach compared to traditional methods based on mathematical models. This work leverages generative diffusion models to forecast cyclone trajectories and precipitation patterns by integrating satellite imaging, remote sensing, and atmospheric data. It employs a cascaded approach that incorporates three main tasks: forecasting, super-resolution, and precipitation modelling. The training dataset includes 51 cyclones from six major tropical cyclone basins from January 2019 - March 2023. Experiments demonstrate that the final forecasts from the cascaded models show accurate predictions up to a 36-hour rollout, with excellent Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Peak-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 0.5 and 20 dB, respectively, for all three tasks. The 36-hour forecasts can be produced in as little as 30 mins on a single Nvidia A30/RTX 2080 Ti. This work also highlights the promising efficiency of Al methods such as diffusion models for high-performance needs in weather forecasting, such as tropical cyclone forecasting, while remaining computationally affordable, making them ideal for highly vulnerable regions with critical forecasting needs and financial limitations.

      <title>Regularization of the ensemble Kalman filter using a non-parametric, non-stationary spatial model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sample covariance matrix of a random vector is a good estimate of the true covariance matrix if the sample size is much larger than the length of the vector. In high-dimensional problems, this condition is never met. As a result, in high dimensions the EnKF ensemble does not contain enough information to specify the prior covariance matrix accurately. This necessitates the need for regularization of the analysis (observation update) problem. We propose a regularization technique based on a new spatial model on the sphere. The model is a constrained version of the general Gaussian process convolution model. The constraints on the location-dependent convolution kernel include local isotropy, positive definiteness as a function of distance, and smoothness as a function of location. The model allows for a rigorous definition of the local spectrum, which, in addition, is required to be a smooth function of spatial wavenumber. We regularize the ensemble Kalman filter by postulating that its prior covariances obey this model. The model is estimated online in a two-stage procedure. First, ensemble perturbations are bandpass filtered in several wavenumber bands to extract aggregated local spatial spectra. Second, a neural network recovers the local spectra from sample variances of the filtered fields. We show that with the growing ensemble size, the estimator is capable of extracting increasingly detailed spatially non-stationary structures. In simulation experiments, the new technique led to substantially better EnKF performance than several existing techniques.</description>
