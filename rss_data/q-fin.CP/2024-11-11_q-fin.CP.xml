      <title>Enforcing asymptotic behavior with DNNs for approximation and regression in finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple methodology to approximate functions with given asymptotic behavior by specifically constructed terms and an unconstrained deep neural network (DNN).
  The methodology we describe extends to various asymptotic behaviors and multiple dimensions and is easy to implement. In this work we demonstrate it for linear asymptotic behavior in one-dimensional examples. We apply it to function approximation and regression problems where we measure approximation of only function values (``Vanilla Machine Learning''-VML) or also approximation of function and derivative values (``Differential Machine Learning''-DML) on several examples. We see that enforcing given asymptotic behavior leads to better approximation and faster convergence.</description>

      <title>Market efficiency, informational asymmetry and pseudo-collusion of adaptively learning agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of informational efficiency in a market with asymmetrically informed, boundedly rational traders who adaptively learn optimal strategies using simple multiarmed bandit (MAB) algorithms. The strategies available to the traders have two dimensions: on the one hand, the traders must endogenously choose whether to acquire a costly information signal, on the other, they must determine how aggressively they trade by choosing the share of their wealth to be invested in the risky asset. Our study contributes to two strands of literature: the literature comparing the effects of competitive and strategic behavior on asset price efficiency under costly information as well as the actively growing literature on algorithmic tacit collusion and pseudo-collusion in financial markets. We find that for certain market environments (with low information costs) our model reproduces the results of Kyle [1989] in that the ability of traders to trade strategically leads to worse price efficiency compared to the purely competitive case. For other environments (with high information costs), on the other hand, our results show that a market with strategically acting traders can be more efficient than a purely competitive one. Furthermore, we obtain novel results on the ability of independently learning traders to coordinate on a pseudo-collusive behavior, leading to non-competitive pricing. Contrary to some recent contributions (see e.g. [Cartea et al. 2022]), we find that the pseudo-collusive behavior in our model is robust to a large number of agents, demonstrating that even in the setting of financial markets with a large number of independently learning traders non-competitive pricing and pseudo-collusive behavior can frequently arise.</description>

      <title>Optimal reinsurance and investment via stochastic projected gradient method based on Malliavin calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach using the stochastic projected gradient method and Malliavin calculus for optimal reinsurance and investment strategies. Unlike traditional methodologies, we aim to optimize static investment and reinsurance strategies by directly minimizing the ruin probability. Furthermore, we provide a convergence analysis of the stochastic projected gradient method for general constrained optimization problems whose objective function has H\"older continuous gradient. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for BSDEs with jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to propose an extension of the deep solver by Han, Jentzen, E (2018) to the case of forward backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with jumps. As in the aforementioned solver, starting from a discretized version of the FBSDE and parametrizing the (high dimensional) control processes by means of a family of artificial neural networks (ANNs), the FBSDE is viewed as a model-based reinforcement learning problem and the ANN parameters are fitted so as to minimize a prescribed loss function. We take into account both finite and infinite jump activity by introducing, in the latter case, an approximation with finitely many jumps of the forward process. We successfully apply our algorithm to option pricing problems in low and high dimension and discuss the applicability in the context of counterparty credit risk.</description>

      <title>No Tick-Size Too Small: A General Method for Modelling Small Tick Limit Order Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tick sizes not only influence the granularity of the price formation process but also affect market agents' behavior. We investigate the disparity in the microstructural properties of the Limit Order Book (LOB) across different relative tick sizes. A key contribution of this study is the identification of several stylized facts, which are used to differentiate between large, medium, and small tick stocks, along with clear metrics for their measurement. We provide cross-asset visualizations to illustrate how these attributes vary with relative tick size. Further, we propose a Hawkes Process model that accounts for sparsity, multi-tick level price moves, and the shape of the book in small-tick stocks. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the universality of the model and identify key variables that determine whether a simulated LOB resembles a large-tick or small-tick stock. Our tests show that stylized facts like sparsity, shape, and relative returns distribution can be smoothly transitioned from a large-tick to a small-tick asset using our model. We test this model's assumptions, showcase its challenges and propose questions for further directions in this area of research.</description>
