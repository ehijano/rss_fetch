      <title>Deterministic and stochastic infection dynamics in a population subject to stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physiological stress fundamentally alters disease susceptibility in aquatic environments. In this paper, we develop a stress-structured epidemiological model where host vulnerability is dynamically driven by water quality. Analytically, we establish that the system exhibits a classic forward bifurcation at $\mathcal{R}_0=1$, confirming that the basic reproduction number remains a valid threshold for eradication. However, stochastic analysis reveals a critical asymmetry not captured by deterministic thresholds. We show that while $\mathcal{R}_0$ predicts stability, the probability of an outbreak depends on the initial physiological state. Introducing infection into a stressed sub-population leads to immediate rapid growth of the disease, whereas introduction into the normal class faces a stochastic barrier that significantly delays the epidemic peak.</description>

      <title>Impulsive Release Strategies for Wolbachia-Infected Mosquitoes under Temperature-Induced Infection Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes is a promising strategy for controlling Aedes aegypti populations, but exposure to high temperatures can induce temporary infection loss and compromise long-term persistence. In this work, we propose a population-dynamics model based on impulsive differential equations to describe the interaction between wild and infected mosquitoes, incorporating cytoplasmic incompatibility, periodic release interventions, and temperature-driven infection loss. Analytical threshold conditions are derived to characterize the existence and stability of periodic solutions associated with successful Wolbachia establishment. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results and enable a comparative analysis of the wMelPop, wMel, and wAlbB strains, highlighting how differences in thermal tolerance and fitness costs influence persistence after the release phase. The results emphasize the importance of accounting for environmental stress and impulsive interventions when designing effective and robust Wolbachia release strategies.</description>

      <title>Punishment in bipartite societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From ant-acacia mutualism to performative conflict resolution among Inuit, dedicated punishments between distinct subsets of a population are widespread and can reshape the evolutionary trajectory of cooperation. Existing studies have focused on punishments within a homogeneous population, paying little attention to cooperative dynamics in a situation where belonging to a subset is equally important to the actual strategy represented by an actor. To fill this gap, we here study a bipartite population where cooperator agents in a public goods game penalize exclusively those defectors who belong to the alternative subset. We find that cooperation can emerge and remain stable under symmetric intergroup punishment. In particular, at low punishment intensity and at a small value of the enhancement factor of the dilemma game, intergroup punishment promotes cooperation more effectively than a uniformly applied punishment. Moreover, intergroup punishment in bipartite populations tends to be more favorable for overall social welfare. When this incentive is balanced, cooperators can collectively restrain defectors of the alternative set via aggregate interactions in a randomly formed working group, offering a more effective incentive. Conversely, breaking the symmetry of intergroup punishment inhibits cooperation, as the imbalance creates an Achilles' heel in the enforcement structure. Our work, thus, reveals symmetry in intergroup punishment as a unifying principle behind cooperation across human and biological systems.</description>

      <title>From Stochastic Shocks to Macroscopic Tails: The Moyal Distribution as a Unified Framework for Epidemic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional epidemiological models often fail to characterize the extreme volatility and heavy-tailed "Dragon King" events observed in real-world outbreaks. We propose a unified framework that bridges microscopic agent-based simulations with macroscopic wave decomposition using the Moyal probability density function. By treating viral transmission as a stochastic collision process, we derive a Moyal-Poisson mixture that describes secondary case distributions. Our model successfully recovers the extreme ``superspreading'' events in SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 data that standard Negative Binomial models systematically miss. Furthermore, we apply spectral decomposition to pandemic waves in Germany, demonstrating that the macroscopic "Social Friction" ($\beta$) is a direct emergent property of microscopic "Collision Shocks". This framework provides a useful descriptive tool for public health planning, emphasizing the need to manage extreme volatility rather than deterministic averages.</description>

      <title>The Great Filter hypothesis -- a new Great Filter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Great Filter hypothesis is an extension of the Fermi Paradox: "If life is so common in the universe, why don't we see it?" The Great Filter theory posits there are multiple obstacles or filters life must pass through which ultimately sifts out intelligent life. This paper identifies a new filter: depopulation. As an exospecies advances and reaches the top of the food chain on its planet, Darwinian evolution selects the species to breed fewer offspring due to a lack of predation. As the species evolves intelligence, this leads to medicines and most notably contraception, enabling the species to reduce infant mortality while controlling reproduction. Finally, economic, social and educational factors add to the conscious decision of the intelligent life to slow reproduction. These factors are currently contributing to a human global population peak mid century with subsequent population collapse in less than 500 years. Noting that population growth and decline is exponential, our modelling forecasts human extinction thresholds being tested sometime after the year 2500. There is no reason to assume depopulation dynamics (exodepopulation) would not apply to exocivilizations (exodemography), thus providing a possible resolution of the Fermi Paradox. Furthermore, as machines and AI inevitably supplement humans as depopulation accelerates, the Fermi Paradox can be restated as "Why don't we see machines and AI colonising the galaxy?" A plausible answer is machines will not become conscious and will continue to operate only as tools, tools that will cease operating once humanity is extinct. The Fermi Paradox can then be restated as "Machines will not become conscious, otherwise we would see them colonising the galaxy".</description>

      <title>Modeling Protein Evolution via Generative Inference From Monte Carlo Chains to Population Genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models derived from large protein sequence alignments define complex fitness landscapes, but their utility for accurately modeling non-equilibrium evolutionary dynamics remains unclear. In this work, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis of three simulation schemes, designed to mimic evolution in silico by local sampling of the probability distribution defined by a generative model. We compare standard independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo on a phylogenetic tree, and a population genetics dynamics, benchmarking their outputs against deep sequencing data from four distinct in vitro evolution experiments. We find that standard Monte Carlo fails to reproduce the correct phylogenetic structure and generates unrealistic, gradual mutational sweeps. Performing Monte Carlo on a tree inferred from data improves phylogenetic fidelity and historical accuracy. The population genetics scheme successfully captures phylogenetic correlations, mutational abundances, and selective sweeps as emergent properties, without the need to infer additional information from data. However, the latter choice come at the price of not sampling the proper generative model distribution at long times. Our findings highlight the crucial role of phylogenetic correlations and finite-population effects in shaping evolutionary trajectories on fitness landscapes. These models therefore provide powerful tools for predicting complex adaptive paths and for reliably extrapolating evolutionary dynamics beyond current experimental limitations.</description>

      <title>Ecosystems in the Anthropocene: transformative drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human activity has an enormous impact on Earth, changing organisms, environments and landscapes, leading to the decline of original ecosystems and irreversible changes that create new combinations of living beings and materials. As a result, ecosystems with new properties and new species pools are emerging. Here, we explore a set of transformative drivers, which can act either individually or in synergy. The expansion of novel ecosystems (hybrids of natural and agricultural systems) is a sign of irreversible, human-induced change. Human growth, adaptation to climate change, urban expansion and geoengineering are powerful transformative drivers which are expected to have a high impact, creating novel ecosystems. In contrast, less transformative drivers such as degrowth, biocentrism, ecological restoration and low-impact agriculture can mitigate human impacts, leading to adaptation, resilience and sustainability, while conserving original ecosystems. This requires a new approach, incorporating new ecological, ethical and cultural perspectives, to keep ecosystems functional and healthy.</description>

      <title>Division of labor enables efficient collective decision-making under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do social animals make effective decisions in the absence of a leader? While coordination can improve accuracy, it also delays responses as information propagates through the group. In changing environments, these delays can outweigh the benefits of centralized control, making decentralized strategies advantageous in large groups. This raises a key question: how can groups implement efficient collective decisions without central coordination? We address this question using a model of collective foraging in which individuals choose whether to invest in costly exploration or remain idle, while sharing information and rewards across the group. We show that decentralized collectives can match the performance of centrally controlled groups through a division of labor: a small, heterogeneous subset explores even when expected rewards are negative, while a synchronized majority forages only when expected rewards are positive. Information redundancy causes the optimal scout number to grow sublinearly with group size, so that larger groups need proportionally fewer explorers. The heterogeneity of the group is maximized at intermediate ecological pressures, but optimal groups are homogeneous when costs or environmental contrasts or fluctuations are extreme. Crucially, these group-level policies do not require central coordination, emerging instead from agents following simple threshold-based decision rules. We thus demonstrate a mechanism through which leaderless collectives can make effective decisions under uncertainty and show how ecological pressures can drive changes in the distribution of strategies employed by the group.</description>

      <title>Tricritical behavior in epidemic dynamics with vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08135v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the phenomenology arising from a minimal vaccination-epidemic (MVE) dynamics using three methods: mean-field approach, Monte Carlo simulations, and finite-size scaling analysis. The mean-field formulation reveals that the MVE model exhibits either a continuous or a discontinuous active-to-absorbing phase transition, accompanied by bistability and a tricritical point. However, on square lattices, we detect no signs of bistability, and we disclose that the active-to-absorbing state transition has a scaling invariance and critical exponents compatible with the continuous transition of the directed percolation universality class. Additionally, our findings indicate that the tricritical and crossover behaviors of the MVE dynamics belong to the universality class of mean-field tricritical directed percolation.</description>

      <title>Maximally probable tree topologies with $r$-furcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a specific rooted labeled tree topology, a labeled history is a sequence of branchings that give rise to that labeled topology as it unfolds over time. Here, for $r$-furcating trees, we use a connection with Huffman trees from information theory to identify maximally probable rooted trees -- unlabeled $r$-furcating topologies whose labelings each have a number of labeled histories greater than or equal to those of all other labeled topologies. Our characterization of the unique maximally probable $r$-furcating unlabeled topology generalizes the Harding--Hammersley--Grimmett result identifying the maximally probable bifurcating unlabeled topology, and it provides a new proof for that result. We present a conjecture for the maximally probable $r$-furcating unlabeled topology if labeled histories are tabulated allowing for simultaneous branching events across multiple internal nodes of a tree.</description>

      <title>Structural coarse-graining enables noise-robust functional connectivity and reveals hidden inter-subject variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional connectivity estimates are highly sensitive to analysis choices and can be dominated by noise when the number of sampled time points is small relative to network dimensionality. This issue is particularly acute in fMRI, where scan resolution is limited. Because scan duration is constrained by practical factors (e.g., motion and fatigue), many datasets remain statistically underpowered for high-dimensional correlation estimation. We introduce a framework that combines diffusion-based structural coarse-graining with spectral noise filtering to recover statistically reliable functional networks from temporally limited data. The method reduces network dimensionality by grouping regions according to diffusion-defined communication. This produces coarse-grained networks with dimensions compatible with available time points, enabling random matrix filtering of noise-dominated modes. We benchmark three common FC pipelines against our approach. We find that raw-signal correlations are strongly influenced by non-stationary fluctuations that can reduce apparent inter-subject variability under limited sampling conditions. In contrast, our pipeline reveals a broader, multimodal landscape of inter-subject variability. These large-scale organization patterns are largely obscured by standard pipelines. Together, these results provide a practical route to reliable functional networks under realistic sampling constraints. This strategy helps separate noise-driven artifacts from reproducible patterns of human brain variability.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Fear and Social Rewards in Prey-Predator Relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fear is a critical brain function that enables us to learn to avoid danger via reinforcement learning (RL). While many researchers have argued that fear has evolved to escape predators, how varying predatory pressures have shaped fear and other rewards, including positive social rewards for collective grouping, remains an open question. In this study, we investigate the relationship between predatory pressure and fear using an evolutionary simulation of RL agents with evolving rewards. In our simulation, prey and predator RL agents co-evolve their reward functions, including visual rewards for observing prey and predators. While fear-like negative visual rewards for predators often evolved in prey, we also observed cases in which positive rewards for both predators and prey evolved, the latter serving as a social reward for collective grouping. A comparison between different environmental conditions revealed that stronger predator hunting capability promoted stronger fear reward, while less food supply promoted more negative social reward. Moreover, fear did not evolve in response to static pitfalls with non-lethal damage, suggesting that actively hunting predators played an important role in its evolution. These results highlight the special role of predators in the diverse evolution of fear and social rewards.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of Integral Projection Models via Genealogical Quantities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-state structured population models, including integral projection models (IPMs) and age-structured McKendrick equations, link individual life histories to population growth and composition, yet the demographic meaning of their dominant eigenstructure can be difficult to interpret. A main goal of this paper is to derive interpretable demographic indicators for multi-state heterogeneity -- in particular expected generation numbers, which act as an effective genealogical memory length (in generations) of the ancestry-weighted contributions driving growth -- together with type reproduction numbers and generation intervals, directly from life-history transition kernels.
  To this end we develop a determinant-free genealogical framework based on a reference-point operator, a rank-one construction at the kernel level that singles out a biologically chosen reference state and organizes lineages by their contributions relative to that state. This yields stable distributions and reproductive values as convergent series of iterated kernels, and leads to an Euler--Lotka-like characteristic equation expressed by reference-point moments. The resulting expansion admits a closed combinatorial form via ordinary partial Bell polynomials, providing a direct bridge from transition kernels to genealogical quantities.
  We extend the approach to multi-state McKendrick equations and show how these indicators quantify how population scale and composition are determined by ancestry-weighted initial-state information. The framework avoids restrictive Hilbert--Schmidt assumptions and clarifies how temporal memory and multi-type heterogeneity emerge from cross-generational accumulation, yielding a unified and interpretable route from transition kernels to multi-state demographic indicators.</description>
