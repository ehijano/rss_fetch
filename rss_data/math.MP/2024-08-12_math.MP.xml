      <title>Generalised Brillouin Zone for Non-Reciprocal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been observed that the Floquet-Bloch transform with real quasiperiodicities fails to capture the spectral properties of non-reciprocal systems. The aim of this paper is to introduce the notion of a generalised Brillouin zone by allowing the quasiperiodicities to be complex in order to rectify this. It is proved that this shift of the Brillouin zone into the complex plane accounts for the unidirectional spatial decay of the eigenmodes and leads to correct spectral convergence properties. The results in this paper clarify and prove rigorously how the spectral properties of a finite structure are associated with those of the corresponding semi-infinitely or infinitely periodic lattices and give explicit characterisations of how to extend the Hermitian theory to non-reciprocal settings. Based on our theory, we characterise the generalised Brillouin zone for both open boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions. Our results are consistent with the physical literature and give explicit generalisations to the $k$-Toeplitz matrix cases.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of Dyson Brownian motion on the circle and multiradial SLE0+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13762v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main motivation of the present work is to investigate the asymptotic behavior as $\kappa \to 0+$ of multiradial Schramm-Loewner evolution, SLE$_\kappa$. We show that this process with the common parameterization satisfies a finite-time large deviation principle (LDP) in the Hausdorff metric with non-negative rate function, the multiradial Loewner energy. We also characterize the large-time behavior of curves with finite energy and zero energy (whose driving functions correspond to the trigonometric Calogero-Moser system).
  The first half of this article is of independent interest regardless of SLE theory. It is devoted to proving a finite-time LDP for Dyson Brownian motion on the circle for a fixed number $n$ of particles as the coupling parameter $\beta=8/\kappa$ tends to $\infty$. To our knowledge, in the literature large deviations of Dyson Brownian motion has only been considered for fixed $\beta$ and as $n$ tends to $\infty$. While the non-Lipschitz drift precludes the application of the Freidlin-Wentzell theorem, we show that the rate function has the same form as in Freidlin-Wentzell theory for diffusions with uniformly Lipschitz drift.
  In the second half of this article, we turn to proving an LDP for multiradial SLE$_\kappa$. Here, the main technical difficulty is that the SLE$_\kappa$ curves have a common target point, preventing the usual configurational, or global, approach. Instead, we make careful use of the contraction principle from the LDP for Dyson Brownian motion (proven in the first part of the article), combined with topological results in Loewner theory: we show that finite-energy multiradial Loewner hulls are always disjoint unions of simple curves, except possibly at their common endpoint. A key to this is obtained from a derivative estimate for the radial Loewner map in terms of the energy of its driving function.</description>

      <title>Radial Mode Stability of Two-Fluid Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radial mode stability is a necessary condition for the astrophysical viability of compact objects. In recent years, astrophysical models with two fluids have gain popularity, especially in their ability to model dark matter admixed neutron stars.Just as is the case of single-fluid stars, a stability criterion based on the background equations has been developed -- the critical curve for the particle numbers of the two fluids in the two-dimensional configuration space determines a one-dimensional sequence that labels the marginally stable configurations -- but its validity depends on the linear stability of radial perturbations which remains unstudied. In this paper, we establish a set of stability criteria for two perfect-fluid relativistic stars by carefully studying the radial mode perturbation equations. We prove that modes are complete, have real eigenvalues with a minimum eigenvalue (i.e. a fundamental mode), thus a configuration is stable if and only if the fundamental mode is positive. As a consequence, our work formally and rigorously proves these necessary conditions for the stability criterion based on the background equations.</description>

      <title>Random search with resetting in heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate random searches under stochastic position resetting at rate $r$, in a bounded 1D environment with space-dependent diffusivity $D(x)$. For arbitrary shapes of $D(x)$ and prescriptions of the associated multiplicative stochastic process, we obtain analytical expressions for the average time $T$ for reaching the target (mean first-passage time), given the initial and reset positions, in good agreement with stochastic simulations. For arbitrary $D(x)$, we obtain an exact closed-form expression for $T$, within Stratonovich scenario, while for other prescriptions, like It\^o and anti-It\^o, we derive asymptotic approximations for small and large rates $r$. Exact results are also obtained for particular forms of $D(x)$, such as the linear one, with arbitrary prescriptions, allowing to outline and discuss the main effects introduced by diffusive heterogeneity on a random search with resetting. We explore how the effectiveness of resetting varies with different types of heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Computability of Pressure for Subshifts on Countable Amenable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are a variety of results in the literature proving forms of computability for topological entropy and pressure on subshifts. In this work, we prove two quite general results, showing that topological pressure is always computable from above given an enumeration for a forbidden list inducing the subshift, and that for strongly irreducible shifts of finite type, topological pressure is computable. Our results apply to subshifts on all finitely generated amenable groups with decidable word problem and generalize several previous results which applied only to $\mathbb{Z}^d$-subshifts.
  As corollaries, we obtain some results related to ground state energy and entropy, proving that the map sending $\phi$ to $\sup_{\mu \in M_\sigma(X)} \int \phi d\mu$ is computable/computable from above when $P_X(\phi)$ is, and that the map sending $\phi$ to its ground state/residual entropy is computable from above when $P_X(\phi)$ is computable.
  We conclude by giving explicit bounds on computation time of $P_X(\phi)$ in the $\mathbb{Z}^d$ setting for SI SFTs and locally constant and rational valued $\phi$, and show that in the special case $X = A^{\mathbb{Z}^2}$, this algorithm runs in singly exponential time.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry of the Robinson-Trautman solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Robinson-Trautman solution in the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ system admits a shear-free and twist-free null geodesic congruence with a nonvanishing expansion. Restricting to the case where the Maxwell field is aligned, i.e., the spacetime is algebraically special, we provide an exhaustive classification of supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman spacetimes in the four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity. The differential constraints that arise from the integrability conditions of the Killing spinor equation enable us to systematically reconstruct the metric. We derive the explicit form of the Killing spinor either by directly integrating the Killing spinor equation or by casting the solution into the canonical form of supersymmetric solutions given in hep-th/0307022. In any case, the supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman solution generically exhibits a naked singularity.</description>

      <title>On generalization of Williamson's theorem to real symmetric matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Williason's theorem states that if $A$ is a $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive definite matrix then there exists a $2n \times 2n$ real symplectic matrix $M$ such that $M^T A M=D \oplus D$, where $D$ is an $n \times n$ diagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries known as the symplectic eigenvalues of $A$. The theorem is known to be generalized to $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive semidefinite matrices whose kernels are symplectic subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, in which case, some of the diagonal entries of $D$ are allowed to be zero. In this paper, we further generalize Williamson's theorem to $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric matrices by allowing the diagonal elements of $D$ to be any real numbers, and thus extending the notion of symplectic eigenvalues to real symmetric matrices. Also, we provide an explicit description of symplectic eigenvalues, construct symplectic matrices achieving Williamson's theorem type decomposition, and establish perturbation bounds on symplectic eigenvalues for a class of $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric matrices denoted by $\operatorname{EigSpSm}(2n)$. The set $\operatorname{EigSpSm}(2n)$ contains $2n \times 2n$ real symmetric positive semidefinite whose kernels are symplectic subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. Our perturbation bounds on symplectic eigenvalues for $\operatorname{EigSpSm}(2n)$ generalize known perturbation bounds on symplectic eigenvalues of positive definite matrices given by Bhatia and Jain \textit{[J. Math. Phys. 56, 112201 (2015)]}.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Anisotropy and Bianchi Characterization: Killing vector fields and the implied finding of their metric frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the largest scales the universe appears to be almost perfectly homogeneous and isotropic, adhering to the cosmological principle. On smaller scales inhomogeneities and anisotropies become increasingly prominent, reflecting the origin, emergence and formation of structure in the Universe and its cosmological impact. Also, a range of tensions between various cosmological observations may suggest it to be necessary to explore the consequences of such deviations from the ideal uniform universe. In this study, we restrict this to an investigation of anisotropies on the nature of the Universe. This motivates a more thorough understanding of the manifestation of anisotropy in cosmological applications. When letting go of the assumption of isotropy, spacetime metrics become homogeneous and completely anisotropic. As such, the Lie algebras of Killing vector fields will be 3D, and fit into the so-called 9-part Bianchi classification. This work strives to, given a suitable 3D Lie algebra of vector fields $\{\xi_a\}_{a=1,2,3}$ reconstruct the basis for a metric on which this Lie algebra is Killing. Through finding a determining equation for the frame invariant under $\{\xi_a\}$ and using the method of characteristics to solve it, expressions for said invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$ are obtained. This leads to general equations for the invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$, organized by Bianchi class. Some examples demonstrating this method are worked out.</description>

      <title>Functional Equations and Pole Structure of the Bartholdi Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Bartholdi zeta function on a connected simple digraph with $n_V$ vertices and $n_E$ edges. We derive a functional equation for the Bartholdi zeta function $\zeta_G(q,u)$ on a regular graph $G$ with respect to the bump parameter $u$. We also find an equivalence between the Bartholdi zeta function with a specific value of $u$ and the Ihara zeta function at $u=0$. We determine bounds of the critical strip of $\zeta_G(q,u)$ for a general graph. If $G$ is a $(t+1)$-regular graph, the bounds are saturated and $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ and $q=(t+u)^{-1}$ are the poles at the boundaries of the critical strip for $u\ne 1, -t$. When $G$ is the regular graph and the spectrum of the adjacency matrix satisfies a certain condition, $\zeta_G(q,u)$ satisfies the so-called Riemann hypothesis. For $u \ne 1$, $q=\pm(1-u)^{-1}$ are poles of $\zeta_G(q,u)$ unless $G$ is tree. Although the order of the pole at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ is $n_E-n_V+1$ if $u\ne u_* \equiv 1-\frac{n_E}{n_V}$, it is enhanced at $u=u_*$. In particular, if the Moore-Penrose inverse of the incidence matrix $L^+$ and the degree vector $\vec{d}$ satisfy the condition $|L^+ \vec{d}|^2\ne n_E$, the order of the pole at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ increases only by one at $u=u_*$. The order of the pole at $q=-(1-u)^{-1}$ coincides with that at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ if $G$ is bipartite and is $n_E-n_V$ otherwise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods used to infer nuclear parameters from neutron count statistics fall into two categories depending on whether they use moments or count number probabilities. As probabilities are in general more difficult to calculate, we are interested here in the reconstruction of distributions from their first moments. For this, we explore two approaches. The first one relies on a generalization of the 2-forked branching correlation (quadratic) approximation used in the PMZBB and Poisson radical distributions, the second one is based on the expansion of the distribution on a basis of Meixner discrete orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the Liouville-von Neumann equation for unbounded Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of mixed states of a closed quantum system is described by a group of evolution superoperators whose infinitesimal generator (the quantum Liouville superoperator, or Liouvillian) determines the mixed-state counterpart of the Schr\"odinger equation: the Liouville-von Neumann equation. When the state space of the system is infinite-dimensional, the Liouville superoperator is unbounded whenever the corresponding Hamiltonian is. In this paper, we provide a rigorous, pedagogically-oriented, and self-contained introduction to the quantum Liouville formalism in the presence of unbounded operators. We present and discuss a characterization of the domain of the Liouville superoperator originally due to M. Courbage; starting from that, we develop some simpler characterizations of the domain of the Liouvillian and its square. We also provide, with explicit proofs, some domains of essential self-adjointness (cores) of the Liouvillian.</description>

      <title>New Field Theories with Foliation Structure and Subdimensional Particles from Godbillon-Vey Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, subdimensional particles including fractons have attracted much attention from various areas. Notable features of such matter phases are mobility constraints and subextensive ground state degeneracies (GSDs). In this paper, we propose a BF-like theory motivated by the Godbillon-Vey invariant, which is a mathematical invariant of the foliated manifold. Our theory hosts subsystem higher form symmetries which manifestly ensure the mobility constraint and subextensive GSD through the spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also discuss some lattice spin models which realize the same low energy behaviours as the BF-like theory. Furthermore, we explore dynamical matter theories which are coupled to the BF-like theory.</description>

      <title>Higher-order localization landscape theory of Anderson localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Hamiltonian ${\hat H}$ containing a position-dependent (disordered) potential, we introduce a sequence of landscape functions $u_n(\mathbf{r})$ obeying ${\hat H} u_n(\mathbf{r}) = u_{n-1}(\mathbf{r})$ with $u_0(\mathbf{r}) = 1$. For $n \to \infty$, $1/v_n(\mathbf{r}) = u_{n-1}(\mathbf{r})/u_{n}(\mathbf{r})$ converges to the lowest eigenenergy $E_1$ of ${\hat H}$ whereas $u_{\infty}(\mathbf{r})$ yields the corresponding wave function $\psi_1(\mathbf{r})$. For large but finite $n$, $v_n(\mathbf{r})$ can be approximated by a piecewise constant function $v_n(\mathbf{r}) \simeq v_n^{(m)}$ for $\mathbf{r} \in \Omega_m$ and yields progressively improving estimations of eigenenergies $E_m = 1/v_n^{(m)}$ of locally fundamental eigenstates $\psi_m(\mathbf{r}) \propto u_{n}(\mathbf{r})$ in spatial domains $\Omega_m$. These general results are illustrated by a number of examples in one dimension: box potential, sequence of randomly placed infinite potential barriers, smooth and spatially uncorrelated random potentials, quasiperodic potential.</description>

Abstract: The analysis conducted by Rymarz and DiVincenzo (Phys. Rev. X 13, 021017 (2023)) regarding quantization of superconducting circuits is insufficient to justify their general conclusions, most importantly the need to discard Kirchhoff's laws to effect variable reductions. Amongst a variety of reasons, one source of several disagreements with experimental and theoretical results is the long-standing dispute between extended vs compact variables in the presence of Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermal correlators and quasinormal modes from semiclassical Virasoro blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by its relevance for thermal correlators in strongly coupled holographic CFTs, we refine and further develop a recent exact analytic approach to black hole perturbation problem, based on the semiclassical Virasoro blocks, or equivalently via AGT relation, the Nekrasov partition functions in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit. Focusing on asymptotically $\text{AdS}_5$ black hole backgrounds, we derive new universal exact expressions for holographic thermal two-point functions, both for scalar operators and conserved currents. Relatedly, we also obtain exact quantization conditions of the associated quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our expressions for the holographic $\text{CFT}_4$ closely resemble the well-known results for 2d thermal CFTs on $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}$. This structural similarity stems from the locality of fusion transformation for Virasoro blocks. We provide numerical checks of our quantization conditions for QNMs. Additionally, we discuss the application of our results to understand specific physical properties of QNMs, including their near-extremal and asymptotic limits. The latter is related to a certain large-momentum regime of semiclassical Virasoro blocks dual to Seiberg-Witten prepotentials.</description>

      <title>A master-slave coupling scheme for synchronization and parameter estimation in the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the constant parameters of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation from observed data has received attention from researchers in physics, applied mathematics and statistics. This is motivated by the various physical applications of the equation and, also, because it often serves as a test model for the study of space-time pattern formation. Remarkably, most existing inference techniques rely on statistical tools, which are computationally very costly yet do not exploit the dynamical features of the system. In this paper we introduce a simple, online parameter estimation method that relies on the synchronization properties of the KS equation. In particular, we describe a master-slave setup where the slave model is driven by observations from the master system. The slave dynamics are data-driven and designed to continuously adapt the model parameters until identical synchronization with the master system is achieved. We provide a simple analysis that supports the proposed approach and also present and discuss the results of an extensive set of computer simulations. Our numerical study shows that the proposed method is computationally fast and also robust to initialization errors, observational noise and variations in the spatial resolution of the numerical scheme used to integrate the KS equation.</description>

Abstract: We discuss integrable many-body systems in one dimension of Calogero-Moser-Sutherland type, both classical and quantum as well as nonrelativistic and relativistic. In particular, we consider fundamental properties such as integrability, the existence of explicit solutions as well as action-angle and bispectral dualities that relate different such systems. We also briefly discuss the early history of the subject and indicate connections with other integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Limiting absorption principle and absence of eigenvalues for massless Klein-Gordon operators on perturbations of the Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a uniform weighted resolvent estimate for the massless Klein-Gordon operator on a curved spacetime which is sufficiently close to the Minkowski spacetime. This particularly implies the existence and H\"{o}lder continuity of the limiting resolvents at all energies, as well as the absolute continuity, of the massless Klein-Gordon operator. The proof is based on a simple version of Mourre's commutator method and does not rely on microlocal analysis. We also prove the absence of eigenvalues via the Virial theorem under an ellipticity condition on the commutator of the massless Klein-Gordon operator against the generator of a wick-rotated dilation, which is weaker than the smallness condition for the metric perturbation.</description>

Abstract: The non-commutative harmonic oscillators (NcHO) and 2p-quantum Rabi models (2pQRM) are extensions of harmonic oscillators. The purpose of this paper is to give a relationship between NcHO and 2pQRM, and the fiber decomposition of NcHO by 2pQRM is shown. We also construct Feynman-Kac formulas of NcHO and 2pQRM. Then asymptotic behaviors of the spectral zeta function of 2pQRM is considered.</description>

      <title>Gross-Witten-Wadia Phase Transition in Induced QCD on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a modification of the Kazakov-Migdal (KM) model with gauge group $U(N_c)$, where the adjoint scalar fields in the conventional KM model are replaced by $N_f$ fundamental scalar fields (FKM model). After tuning the coupling constants and eliminating the fundamental scalar fields, the partition function of this model is expressed as an integral of a graph zeta function weighted by unitary matrices. The FKM model on cycle graphs at large $N_c$ exhibits the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) phase transition only when $N_f &gt; N_c$. In the large $N_c$ limit, we evaluate the free energy of the model on a general graph in two distinct parameter regimes and demonstrate that the FKM model generally consists of multiple phases. The effective action of the FKM model reduces to the standard Wilson action by taking an appropriate scaling limit when the graph consists of plaquettes (fundamental cycles) of the same size, as in the square lattice case. We show that, for the FKM model on such a graph, the third-order GWW phase transition universally occurs in this scaling limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete, graph theoretic approach to conformal field theory correlators. In a certain basis, called the squid basis, the correlator of N scalar operators can be expressed as the determinant of a natural, conformally covariant metric on a weighted graph, called the squid graph. We present the construction of this metric and discuss its possible role in constraining conformal data.</description>

Abstract: We derive the formula for the stationary states of particle-number conserving exclusion processes infinitesimally perturbed by inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. The formula not only proves but also generalises the conjecture proposed in arXiv:1711.06949 to account for inhomogeneous adsorption and desorption. As an application of the formula, we draw part of the phase diagrams of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process with and without Langmuir kinetics, correctly reproducing known results.</description>

      <title>Lower bound for simulation cost of open quantum systems: Lipschitz continuity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating quantum dynamics is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. While the upper bound of the simulation cost has been extensively studied through various quantum algorithms, much less work has focused on establishing the lower bound, particularly for the simulation of open quantum system dynamics. In this work, we present a general framework to calculate the lower bound for simulating a broad class of quantum Markov semigroups. Given a fixed accessible unitary set, we introduce the concept of convexified circuit depth to quantify the quantum simulation cost and analyze the necessary circuit depth to construct a quantum simulation scheme that achieves a specific order. Our framework can be applied to both unital and non-unital quantum dynamics, and the tightness of our lower bound technique is illustrated by showing that the upper and lower bounds coincide in several examples.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-0 fields and conserved charges on n-dimensional Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use conformal geometry methods and the construction of Friedrich's cylinder at spatial infinity to study the propagation of spin-$0$ fields (solutions to the wave equation) on $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes in a neighbourhood of spatial and null infinity. We obtain formal solutions written in terms of series expansions close to spatial and null infinity and use them to compute non-trivial asymptotic spin-$0$ charges. It is shown that if one considers the most general initial data within the class considered in this paper, the expansion is poly-homogeneous and hence of restricted regularity at null infinity. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the initial data needed to obtain regular solutions and well-defined limits for the asymptotic charges at the critical sets where null infinity and spatial infinity meet. In four dimensions, we find that there are infinitely many well-defined asymptotic charges at the critical sets, while for higher dimensions there is only a finite number of non-trivial asymptotic charges that remain regular at the critical sets.</description>
