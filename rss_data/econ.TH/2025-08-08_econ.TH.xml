      <title>On the Foundations of Dynamic Games and Probability: Decision Making in Stochastic Extensive Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, an abstract and general language for the fundamental objects underlying dynamic games under probabilistic uncertainty is developed. Combining the theory of decision trees by Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2005) and a Harsanyian notion of exogenous uncertainty, the concept of stochastic decision forests is introduced. Exogenous information is modelled via filtration-like objects providing dynamic updates on the "realised tree", and an abstract decision-theoretic model of adapted choice is formulated.
  Based on this, a consistent model of "rules" is introduced, leading to the notion of stochastic extensive forms, generalising Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2008, 2011). Well-posedness is completely characterised in terms of order-theoretic properties of the underlying forest. Moreover, the language of stochastic extensive forms addresses a vast class of dynamic decision problems formulated in terms of time-indexed paths of action -- a first step towards an approximation theory of continuous-time games based on stochastic processes. In this formulation, a well-posed theory obtains if and only if the time half-axis is essentially well-ordered.
  Therefore, a relaxed game-theoretic model of "extensive form characteristics" is introduced: the stochastic process form. Its action processes arise from well-posed action path stochastic extensive forms under tilting convergence, which is introduced in order to faithfully describe accumulating reaction behaviour. The problem of instantaneous reaction and information about it is tackled by introducing vertically extended continuous time, for which a suitable stochastic analysis is developed. Stochastic process forms admit a natural notion of information sets, subgames, and equilibrium. The theory applies to stochastic differential and timing games, e.g., addressing issues in Fudenberg--Tirole (1985) and Riedel--Steg (2017) .</description>

      <title>Pairwise efficiency and monotonicity imply Pareto efficiency in (probabilistic) object allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider object allocation problems with capacities (see, e.g., Abdulkadiroglu and Sonmez, 1998; Basteck, 2025) where objects have to be assigned to agents. We show that if a lottery rule satisfies ex-post non-wastefulness and probabilistic (Maskin) monotonicity, then ex-post pairwise efficiency is equivalent to ex-post Pareto efficiency. This result allows for a strengthening of various existing characterization results, both for lottery rules and deterministic rules, by replacing (ex-post) Pareto efficiency with (ex-post) pairwise efficiency, e.g., for characterizations of the Random Serial Dictatorship rule (Basteck, 2025), Trading Cycles rules (Pycia and Unver, 2017), and Hierarchical Exchange rules (Papai, 2000).</description>

      <title>Disappointment Aversion and Expectiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper recasts Gul (1991)'s theory of disappointment aversion in a Savage framework, with general outcomes, new explicit axioms of disappointment aversion, and novel explicit representations. These permit broader applications of the theory and better understanding of its decision-theoretic foundations. Our results exploit an unexpected connection of Gul's theory and the econometric framework of Newey and Powell (1987) of asymmetric least square estimation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transfer Mechanism for Municipal Soft-Budget Constraints in Newfoundland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Newfoundland and Labrador's municipalities face severe soft-budget pressures due to narrow tax bases, high fixed service costs, and volatile resource revenues. We develop a Stackelberg-style mechanism-design model in which the province commits at initial stage to an ex-ante grant schedule and an ex-post bailout rule. Municipalities privately observe their fiscal-need type, choose effort, investment, and debt, and may receive bailouts when deficits exceed a statutory threshold. Under convexity and single-crossing (or virtual monotonicity with ironing), the problem reduces to one-dimensional screening and admits a tractable transfer mechanism with quadratic bailout costs and a statutory cap. The optimal rule is threshold--linear--cap: no bailouts below a participation cutoff; a linear ramp-up up to a cap; and a hard cap thereafter. A knife-edge inequality yields a self-consistent no-bailout regime, and an explicit discount-factor threshold renders hard budgets dynamically credible. The closed-form characterisation provides a policy template that maps to Newfoundland's institutions and clarifies the micro-data required for future calibration.</description>

      <title>Inequality in the Age of Pseudonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient are used to inform and motivate policymaking, and are increasingly applied to digital platforms. We analyze how measures fare in pseudonymous settings, as common to internet-based or blockchain-based platforms. One key challenge that arises is the ability of actors to create multiple fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.'' While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently distort inequality metrics. As we show, when using inequality measures that satisfy literature's canonical set of desired properties, the presence of Sybils in an economy implies that it is impossible to properly measure the economy's inequality. Then, we present classes of Sybil-proof measures that satisfy relaxed versions of the aforementioned desired properties, and, by fully characterizing them, we prove that the structure imposed restricts their ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. In addition, we show that popular measures, liked the famous Gini coefficient, are not Sybil-proof. Finally, we examine the dynamics leading to the creation of Sybils in pseudonymous and traditional settings.</description>
