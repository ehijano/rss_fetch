      <title>A Dynamical-Time Framework for the Dynamics of Charged Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical framework for modeling the motion of point-like charged particles, with or without mass, in general external electromagnetic fields. A key feature of this formulation is the treatment of the time coordinate as a dynamical variable. The framework applies to the relativistic regime while consistently admitting a nonrelativistic limit. We also present a representation of particle trajectories in velocity space, which provides a clear insight into the nature and asymptotic behavior of the dynamics. As an application, we compare the motion of massive and massless particles in a constant electromagnetic field and find that, for identical field configurations, their asymptotic behavior is independent of both mass and initial conditions. Finally, we explore the computational advantages of the dynamical-time formulation over the conventional uniform-time approach in two study cases: an uniform electromagnetic field and an elliptically polarized wave propagating along a uniform magnetic field. In both scenarios, the proposed scheme exhibits improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Observation of flat-band skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected ideal flat bands in one-dimensional (1D) Hermitian lattices are populated by compact localized states (CLS) - a special class of localization with wavefunctions confined within a small region. In this work, we discover that the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can appear in a flat band. Unlike conventional NHSEs for dispersive bands that are protected by nontrivial point-gap topology, the flat band remains a point on the complex-energy plane and is therefore always topologically trivial. We found that, intriguingly, the flat-band skin effect (FBSE) is associated with the non-trivial spectral topology of the dispersive bands enclosing the flat band on the complex-energy plane, so it only emerges within a finite range of non-Hermitian parameters and can counterintuitively disappear at large non-Hermiticity. Moreover, the gaps between the flat and the dispersive bands can close at higher-order exceptional points under both periodic and open boundary conditions. The flat-band wavefunctions are discontinuous in quantum distance across these exceptional points, signifying that the gap-closing is singular. The FBSE was experimentally observed in a non-Hermitian mechanical lattice. Our work reveals flat-band phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems and highlights new possibilities in quantum geometry and localization control.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Eversion Buckling for Ideal Omnidirectional Energy Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing materials that can effectively and repeatedly absorb energy from unpredictable directions represents a grand challenge in modern engineering, crucial for applications from vehicle crashworthiness systems to personal protective equipment. While bistable structures offer a promising pathway towards reusable energy absorbers, their functionality is almost universally constrained to a single loading axis, rendering them vulnerable and ineffective against off axis or oblique impacts. Here, we report the discovery and harnessing of eversion buckling, a distinct pitchfork bifurcation phenomenon in axisymmetric shells, to overcome this fundamental limitation. By strategically designing shell geometries to leverage this mechanism, we have engineered structural units with robust, inplane omnidirectional bistability. This property is characterized by a massive and rapid volumetric contraction upon snapping, which is key to its exceptional performance. When assembled, these structures exhibit an ideal, extended stress plateau, leading to a near perfect energy absorption efficiency dramatically outperforming typical energy absorbing materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system's damping capacity far exceeds its constituent material, and highly tunable, spanning a sixfold range of loss factors which enables load adaptive properties. This design strategy, elucidates a clear mechanism rooted in enhanced friction and sequential stress release, paving the way for a new class of robust, reusable, and load adaptive energy absorbing systems.</description>

      <title>The Zero-Frequency Limit of Spherical Cavity Modes: On the Formal Endpoint at v=1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse magnetic (TM) modes of a spherical cavity satisfy a dispersion relation connecting the angular eigenvalue $\nu$ to the resonant frequency through zeros of the spherical Bessel function derivative. Analytic continuation of this dispersion relation to $\nu = -1$ yields a formal zero-frequency endpoint where $j_{-1}(x) = \cos x / x$ admits the root $x = 0$. We examine this limit in detail, showing that while the mathematics is well-defined, the endpoint does not correspond to a physical electromagnetic mode. The positivity of the angular Sturm-Liouville operator restricts physical eigenvalues to $\nu \geq 0$, placing $\nu = -1$ outside the admissible spectrum. We demonstrate that all electromagnetic field components vanish in this limit, even though the underlying Debye potential $\Pi = \cos(kr)/kr$ remains non-trivial and exhibits a monopole-type singularity at the origin. This distinction between potential and field reflects the kernel structure of the curl-curl operator for spherically symmetric configurations. The analysis clarifies the boundary between propagating electromagnetic modes and static field configurations in spherical geometry, connecting the formal endpoint to longstanding questions about mode counting in cavity quantization.</description>
