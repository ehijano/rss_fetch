      <title>Disease Incidence in a Stochastic SVIRS Model with Waning Immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long-term behaviour and incidence of a vaccine-preventable contact disease, under the assumption that both vaccine protection and immunity after recovery are not lifelong. The mathematical model is developed in a stochastic markovian framework. The evolution of the disease in a finite population is thus represented by a three-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain, which is versatile enough to be able to compensate for the loss of protection by including vaccination before the onset of the outbreak and also during the course of the epidemics.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of rooted binary perfect phylogenies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rooted binary perfect phylogenies provide a generalization of rooted binary unlabeled trees in which each leaf is assigned a positive integer value that corresponds in a biological setting to the count of the number of indistinguishable lineages associated with the leaf. For the rooted binary unlabeled trees, these integers equal 1. We address a variety of enumerative problems concerning rooted binary perfect phylogenies with sample size $s$: the rooted binary unlabeled trees in which a sample of size $s$ lineages is distributed across the leaves of an unlabeled tree with $n$ leaves, $1 \leq n \leq s$. The enumerations further characterize the rooted binary perfect phylogenies, which include the rooted binary unlabeled trees, and which can provide a set of structures useful for various biological contexts.</description>

      <title>The mutual arrangement of Wright-Fisher diffusion path measures and its impact on parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wright-Fisher diffusion is a fundamentally important model of evolution encompassing genetic drift, mutation, and natural selection. Suppose you want to infer the parameters associated with these processes from an observed sample path. Then to write down the likelihood one first needs to know the mutual arrangement of two path measures under different parametrizations; that is, whether they are absolutely continuous, equivalent, singular, and so on. In this paper we give a complete answer to this question by finding the separating times for the diffusion - the stopping time before which one measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the other and after which the pair is mutually singular. In one dimension this extends a classical result of Dawson on the local equivalence between neutral and non-neutral Wright-Fisher diffusion measures. Along the way we also develop new zero-one type laws for the diffusion on its approach to, and emergence from, the boundary. As an application we derive an explicit expression for the joint maximum likelihood estimator of the mutation and selection parameters and show that its convergence properties are closely related to the separating time.</description>

      <title>Networks: The Visual Language of Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origins of complexity is a fundamental challenge with implications for biological and technological systems. Network theory emerges as a powerful tool to model complex systems. Networks are an intuitive framework to represent inter-dependencies among many system components, facilitating the study of both local and global properties. However, it is unclear whether we can define a universal theoretical framework for evolving networks. While basic growth mechanisms, like preferential attachment, recapitulate common properties such as the power-law degree distribution, they fall short in capturing other system-specific properties. Tinkering, on the other hand, has shown to be very successful in generating modular or nested structures "for-free", highlighting the role of internal, non-adaptive mechanisms in the evolution of complexity. Different network extensions, like hypergraphs, have been recently developed to integrate exogenous factors in evolutionary models, as pairwise interactions are insufficient to capture environmentally-mediated species associations. As we confront global societal and climatic challenges, the study of network and hypergraphs provides valuable insights, emphasizing the importance of scientific exploration in understanding and managing complexity.</description>

      <title>Multiple merger coalescent inference of effective population size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variation in a sample of molecular sequence data informs about the past evolutionary history of the sample's population. Traditionally, Bayesian modeling coupled with the standard coalescent, is used to infer the sample's bifurcating genealogy and demographic and evolutionary parameters such as effective population size, and mutation rates. However, there are many situations where binary coalescent models do not accurately reflect the true underlying ancestral processes. Here, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric method for inferring effective population size trajectories from a multifurcating genealogy under the $\Lambda-$coalescent. In particular, we jointly estimate the effective population size and model parameters for the Beta-coalescent model, a special type of $\Lambda-$coalescent. Finally, we test our methods on simulations and apply them to study various viral dynamics as well as Japanese sardine population size changes over time. The code and vignettes can be found in the phylodyn package.</description>
