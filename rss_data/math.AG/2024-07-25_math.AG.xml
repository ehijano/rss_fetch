      <title>Linear preservers of secant varieties and other varieties of tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of characterizing linear preserver subgroups of algebraic varieties, with a particular emphasis on secant varieties and other varieties of tensors. We introduce a number of techniques built on different geometric properties of the varieties of interest. Our main result is a simple characterization of the linear preservers of secant varieties of Segre varieties in many cases, including $\sigma_r((\mathbb{P}^{n-1})^{\times k})$ for all $r \leq n^{\lfloor k/2 \rfloor}$. We also characterize the linear preservers of several other sets of tensors, including subspace varieties, the variety of slice rank one tensors, symmetric tensors of bounded Waring rank, the variety of biseparable tensors, and hyperdeterminantal surfaces. Computational techniques and applications in quantum information theory are discussed. We provide geometric proofs for several previously known results on linear preservers.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to the log canonical Beauville--Bogomolov decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $d \geq 4$, we construct a $d$-dimensional, log canonical, $K$-trivial variety with the property that two general fibers of its Albanese morphism are not birational. This provides a strong counterexample to the Beauville--Bogomolov decomposition in the log canonical setting. This construction can also be adapted to construct a smooth quasi-projective variety of logarithmic Kodaira dimension 0 whose quasi-Albanese morphism has maximal variation. On the positive side, we show that the Albanese morphism for log canonical pairs with nef anti-canonical class is a locally stable family of pairs.</description>

      <title>Univalent Foundations of Constructive Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two constructive approaches to defining quasi-compact and quasi-separated schemes (qcqs-schemes), namely qcqs-schemes as locally ringed lattices and as functors from rings to sets. We work in Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations, but reason informally. The main result is a constructive and univalent proof that the two definitions coincide, giving an equivalence between the respective categories of qcqs-schemes.</description>

Abstract: Let $O$ be an order of odd discriminant $D$ in an imaginary quadratic field $K$. Let $Cl(O)$ be the group of proper $O$-ideals and $Cl(O)[2]$ the kernel of multiplication by $2$ in $Cl(O)$. We describe explicitly the group $Cl(O)[2]$. In particular, we prove that its order is
  $2^{s_D-1}$ where $s_D$ is the number of prime divisors of $D$.</description>

      <title>Conformal limits for parabolic SL(n,C)-Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the conformal limit correspondence between Higgs bundles and holomorphic connections to the parabolic setting. Under mild genericity assumptions on the parabolic weights, we prove that the conformal limit always exists and that it defines holomorphic sections of the space of parabolic lambda-connections which preserve a natural stratification and foliate the moduli space. Along the way, we give a careful gauge theoretic construction of the moduli space of parabolic Higgs bundles with full flags which allows the eigenvalues of the residues of the Higgs field to vary. A number of new phenomena arise in the parabolic setting. In particular, in the generality we consider, unlike the nonparabolic case, the nonabelian Hodge correspondence does not define sections of the space of logarithmic lambda-connections, and the conformal limit does not define a one-parameter family in any given moduli space.</description>

      <title>The cotangent bundle of $G/U_P$ and Kostant-Whittaker descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the algebra of functions on the cotangent bundle $T^*(G/U_P)$ of the parabolic base affine space for a reductive group $G$ and a parabolic subgroup $P$ is isomorphic to the subalgebra of the functions on $G \times L \times \mathfrak{l}//L$ which are invariant under a certain action of the group scheme of universal centralizers on $G$, where $L$ is a Levi subgroup of $P$ and $\mathfrak{l}$ is its Lie algebra, upgrading an isomorphism of Ginzburg and Kazhdan simultaneously to the parabolic and the modular setting. We also derive a related isomorphism for the partial Whittaker cotangent bundle of $G$, which proves a conjecture of Devalapurkar.</description>

      <title>Certified simultaneous isotopic approximation of curves via subdivision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16911v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a certified algorithm based on subdivision for computing an isotopic approximation to any number of curves in the plane. Our algorithm is based on the certified curve approximation algorithm of Plantinga and Vegter. The main challenge in this algorithm is to correctly and efficiently identify and isolate all intersections between the curves. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new and simple test that guarantees the global correctness of our output. A main step in our algorithm for approximating any number of curves is to correctly approximate a pair of curves. In addition to developing the details of this special case, we provide complexity analyses for both the number of steps and the bit-complexity of this algorithm using both worst-case bounds as well as those based on continuous amortization.</description>

      <title>Higher order obstructions to Riccati-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop new techniques in order to deal with Riccati-type equations, subject to a further algebraic constraint, on Riemannian manifolds $(M^3,g)$. We find that the obstruction to solve the aforementioned equation has order $4$ in the metric coefficients and is fully described by an homogeneous polynomial in $\mathrm{Sym}^{16}TM$. Techniques from real algebraic geometry, reminiscent of those used for the "PositiveStellen-Satz " problem, allow determining the geometry in terms of explicit exterior differential systems. Analysis of the latter shows flatness for the metric $g$; in particular we complete the classification of asymptotically harmonic manifolds of dimension $3$, establishing those are either flat or real hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the infimum of polynomials over a generic semi-algebraic set using asymptotic critical values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present precise bit and degree estimates for the optimal value of the polynomial optimization problem $f^*:=\text{inf}_{x\in \mathscr{X}}~f(x)$, where $\mathscr{X}$ is a semi-algebraic set satisfying some non-degeneracy conditions. Our bounds depend on the degree, the bitsize of $f$, and the polynomials defining $\mathscr{X}$, and are single exponential with respect to the number of variables. They generalize the single exponential bounds from Jeronimo, Perrucci, and Tsigaridas (SIAM Journal on Optimization, 23(1):241--255, 2013) for the minimum of a polynomial function on a compact connected component of a basic closed semi-algebraic set.
  The tools that we use allow us to obtain specialized bounds and dedicated algorithms for two large families of polynomial optimization problems in which the optimum value might not be attained. The first family forms a dense set of real polynomial functions with a fixed collection of Newton polytopes; we provide the best approximation yet for the bifurcation set, which contains the optimal value, and we deduce an effective method for computations. As for the second family, we consider any unconstrained polynomial optimization problem; we present more precise bounds, together with a better bit complexity estimate of an algorithm to compute the optimal value.</description>

Abstract: We investigate vortex partition functions defined from integrals over the handsaw quiver varieties of type $A_{1}$ via wall-crossing phenomena. We consider vortex partition functions defined by two types of cohomology classes, and get functional equations for each of them. We also give explicit formula for these partition functions. This gives proofs to formula suggested by physicsts. In particular, we obtain geometric interpretation of formulas for multiple hypergeometric functions including rational limit of the Kajihara transformation formula.</description>

Abstract: For a hypersurface defined by a complex analytic function, we obtain a chain complex of free abelian groups, with ranks given in terms of relative polar multiplicities, which has cohomology isomorphic to the reduced cohomology of the real link. This leads to Morse-type inequalities between the Betti numbers of the real link of the hypersurface and the relative polar multiplicities of the function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a general approach to dimer models analogous to Krichever's scheme in the theory of integrable systems. We start with a Riemann surface and the simplest generic meromorphic functions on it and demonstrate how to obtain integrable dimer models. These are dimer models on doubly periodic bipartite graphs with quasi-periodic positive weights. Dimer models with periodic weights and Harnack curves are recovered as a special case. This generalization from Harnack curves to general M-curves leads to transparent algebro-geometric structures. In particular explicit formulas for the Ronkin function and surface tension as integrals of meromorphic differentials on M-curves are obtained. Furthermore we describe the variational principle for the height function in the quasi-periodic case. Based on Schottky uniformizations of Riemann surfaces we present concrete computational results including computing the weights and sampling dimer configurations with them. The computational results are in complete agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: Generalized complex geometry was classically formulated by the language of differential geometry. In this paper, we reformulated a generalized complex manifold as a holomorphic symplectic differentiable formal stack in a homotopical sense. Meanwhile, by developing the machinery for shifted symplectic formal stack, we prove that the coisotropic intersection inherits shifted Poisson structure. Generalized complex branes are also studied.</description>

Abstract: We present a new distinguisher for alternant and Goppa codes, whose complexity is subexponential in the error-correcting capability, hence better than that of generic decoding algorithms. Moreover it does not suffer from the strong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery algorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece candidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that allow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a shortening of the dual code.
  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the McEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.</description>
