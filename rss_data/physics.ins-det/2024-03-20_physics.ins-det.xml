      <title>Recovery of HADES drift chambers suffering from Malter-like effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central tracking system of the HADES detector, installed at the SIS-18 synchrotron at GSI/Darmstadt (Germany), employs large-area, low-mass drift chambers, featuring Aluminum potential wires and small cell sizes. The chambers in front of the magnetic field, closest to the interaction point, have developed significant self-sustained currents and discharges during operation, most probably triggered by isobutane-based gas mixtures. Only both, (i) replacing isobutane by CO2 and (ii) adding 1000 to 3500 ppmv of water into the Ar/CO2 counting gas mixture, individually optimized for a given chamber, allowed to recover the chambers, enabling stable operation in several production runs since then, e.g. with high-intensity heavy-ion induced reactions. The origin of the instability was found to be deposits on the cathode wires, provoking the Malter-like effects, by visual inspection and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The charge on the wires accumulated during their lifetime does not point to so-called classical aging, but presumably the interaction of isobutane with materials in the gas flow, residual impurities, and reaction products formed in plasma, e.g., built by discharges.</description>

      <title>Electrical/piezoresistive effects in bent Alpide MAPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ITS3 upgrade baseline design employs MAPS (Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor) in bent state. Bending experiments with the existing ITS2 MAPS (=Alpide chip) show it remains functional but with relative large analog supply current changes. It is shown that by the piezoresistive effect, rotation of current mirror FETs can be responsible which was confirmed after validating the layout. Measured Gauge Factor has proper sign but is 3 times lower than typical values derived from literature. The magnitude of the measured strain induced PMOS V$_{th}$ shift is as expected but the sign differs for compressive strain with some of the literature.</description>

      <title>A new method to search for highly ionizing exotic particles, monopoles and beyond, using time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the energy loss and mass of highly ionizing particles predicted by theories from beyond the Standard Model pose considerable challenges to conventional detection techniques. Such particles are predicted to experience energy loss to matter they pass through that exceeds the dynamic range specified for most readout chips, leading to saturation of the detectors' electronics. Consequently, achieving precise energy loss and mass measurements becomes unattainable. We present a new approach to detect such highly ionizing particles using time projection chambers that overcomes this limitation and provide a case study for triggering on magnetic monopoles.</description>

      <title>Development of low-radon ultra-pure water for the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory(JUNO) is a state-of-the-art liquid scintillator-based neutrino physics experiment under construction in South China. To reduce the background from external radioactivities, a water Cherenkov detector composed of 35~kton ultra-pure water and 2,400 20-inch photomultiplier tubes is developed. Even after specialized treatment, ultra-pure water still contains trace levels of radioactive elements that can contribute to the detector background. Among which $^{222}$Rn is particularly significant. To address this, an online radon removal system based on the JUNO prototype has been developed. By integrating micro-bubble generators to enhance degasser's radon removal efficiency, the radon concentration in water can be reduced to 1~mBq/m$^{3}$ level, meeting the stringent requirements of JUNO. Additionally, a highly sensitive online radon concentration measurement system capable of detecting concentrations $\sim$1~mBq/m$^3$ has been developed to monitor the radon concentration in water. In this paper, the details regarding both systems will be presented.</description>

      <title>High Precision Inertial Sensors on a One Inch Diameter Optic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact, high-precision inertial sensors are needed to isolate many modern physics experiments from disturbances caused by seismic motion. We present a novel inertial sensor whose mechanical oscillator fits on a standard one-inch diameter optic. The oscillators achieve a Quality factor of over 600,000 and a resonance frequency of 50\,Hz, giving them a suspension thermal noise floor lower than all commercially available inertial sensors. The oscillator is combined with a Pound-Drever-Hall based readout scheme that achieves a displacement noise of 100\,f\msqrthz above 0.2\,Hz. We integrate the oscillator and readout to make two inertial sensors. Of order n$g$ performance is achieved in a broad band from 0.1\,Hz to 200\,Hz. Below 20\,Hz, the sensor presented here offers comparable performance to the best inertial sensors available today while being a fraction of the size. Above 20\,Hz, the sensor is, to the author's knowledge, the best demonstrated in the literature to date for a device of this style, with a self-noise floor of 0.1\,n$g$\sqrthz. The excellent performance of the sensors across the relevant seismic frequencies, vacuum compatibility, and compact size make it a prime candidate for integration into sophisticated seismic isolation schemes, such as those used by gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the RED-100 detector at the Kalinin nuclear power plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RED-100 is a two-phase Xe detector designed and built for the study of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering CEvNS of reactor antineutrinos. A comprehensive calibration was performed in order to obtain important parameters of the detector during its exposition at the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant (Tver, Russia). This paper describes the analysis of calibration data, position and energy reconstruction procedures, and evaluation of the efficiency of electron extraction from the liquid xenon to the gas phase.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of the $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ Interaction Cross Sections at the LHC with FASER's Emulsion Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first results of the study of high-energy electron and muon neutrino charged-current interactions in the FASER$\nu$ emulsion/tungsten detector of the FASER experiment at the LHC. A subset of the FASER$\nu$ volume, which corresponds to a target mass of 128.6~kg, was exposed to neutrinos from the LHC $pp$ collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of 13.6~TeV and an integrated luminosity of 9.5 fb$^{-1}$. Applying stringent selections requiring electrons with reconstructed energy above 200~GeV, four electron neutrino interaction candidate events are observed with an expected background of $0.025^{+0.015}_{-0.010}$, leading to a statistical significance of 5.2$\sigma$. This is the first direct observation of electron neutrino interactions at a particle collider. Eight muon neutrino interaction candidate events are also detected, with an expected background of $0.22^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$, leading to a statistical significance of 5.7$\sigma$. The signal events include neutrinos with energies in the TeV range, the highest-energy electron and muon neutrinos ever detected from an artificial source. The energy-independent part of the interaction cross section per nucleon is measured over an energy range of 560--1740 GeV (520--1760 GeV) for $\nu_e$ ($\nu_{\mu}$) to be $(1.2_{-0.7}^{+0.8}) \times 10^{-38}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ ($(0.5\pm0.2) \times 10^{-38}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$), consistent with Standard Model predictions. These are the first measurements of neutrino interaction cross sections in those energy ranges.</description>

      <title>SiC Based Beam Monitoring System for Particle Rates from kHz to GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extremely low dark current of silicon carbide (SiC) detectors, even after high-fluence irradiation, was utilized to develop a beam monitoring system for a wide range of particle rates, i.e., from the kHz to the GHz regime. The system is completely built from off-the-shelve components and is focused on compactness and simple deployment. Beam tests using a 50 um thick SiC detector reveal, that for low fluences, single particles can be detected and counted. For higher fluences, beam properties were extracted from beam cross sections using a silicon strip detector. Overall accurate results were achieved up to a particle rate of 109 particles per second.</description>

      <title>Classical and Bayesian statistical methods for low-level metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document presents the statistical methods used to process low-level measurements in the presence of noise. These methods can be classical or Bayesian. The question is placed in the general framework of the problem of nuisance parameters, one of the canonical problems of statistical inference. By using a simple criterion proposed by Bolstad (2007), it is possible to define statistically significant results during a measurement process (act of measuring in the vocabulary of metrology). This result is similar for a classic paradigm (called ``frequentist'') or Bayesian: the presence of zero in the interval considered (confidence or credibility). It is shown that in the case of homoskedastic Gaussians, the commonly used results are found. The case of Poisson distributions is then considered. In the case of heteroscedastic Gaussians, which is that of radioactivity measurement, we can consider them as Poisson laws in the limit of large counts. The results are different from those commonly used, and in particular those from standards (ISO 11929). Their statistical performances, characterized by simulation, are better and are well verified experimentally. This is confirmed theoretically by the use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma which makes it possible to formally determine the statistical tests with the best performances. These results also make it possible to understand the paradox of the possible divergence of the detection limit. It is also formally shown that the confidence intervals thus calculated by getting rid of the nuisance parameter according to established methods result in the commonly used confidence interval. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first formal derivation of these confidence intervals.This method is based on keeping the measurement results whether they are significant or not (not censoring them). This is recommended in several standards or documents, is compatible with the ISO 11929 standard and is in line with recent proposals in the field of statistics. On the other hand, all the information necessary to determine whether a measurement result is significant or not remains available. The conservation and restitution of all results is currently applied in the USA. The textbook case of the WIPP incident makes it possible to ensure favorable public perception.The implications and applications of this method in different fields are finally discussed.</description>

      <title>Limits and prospects for long-baseline optical fiber interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's most precise optical instruments -- gravitational-wave interferometers and optical atomic clocks -- rely on long storage times for photons to realize their exquisite sensitivity. Optical fiber technology is the most widely deployed platform for realizing long-distance optical propagation. Yet, their application to precision optical measurements is sparse. We review the state-of-the-art in the noise performance of conventional (solid-core) optical fibers from the perspective of precision optical measurements and quantum technology that rely on precise transfer of information over long distances. In doing so, we highlight the limitations of this platform and point to the opportunities that structured fiber technology offers to overcome some of these limitations.</description>

      <title>Determination of impact parameter for CEE with digi-input neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact parameter characterizes the centrality in nucleus-nucleus collision geometry. The determination of impact parameters in real experiments is usually based on the reconstructed tracks and hits, or the derived event-level observables. For the scheduled Cooler-storage-ring External-target Experiment (CEE), the low beam energy results in a reduction of dependency between the impact parameter and charged particle multiplicity, which decreases the validity of the explicit determination methods. This work implements a few neural networks that directly take the digitized signals from the external Time-of-flight detectors as input. The model with the best performance has shown a mean absolute error of 0.479 fm with the simulated U-U collisions at 0.5 AGeV. Performances of these models with digi inputs are compared with reference models with phase space inputs, showing the capacity of neural networks in handling the original but potentially interrelated digitized signal information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have repeated the experiment performed recently by Krasznahorkay et al., (Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 042501 (2016)), which may indicate a new particle called X17 in the literature. In order to get a reliable, and independent result, we used a different type of electron-positron pair spectrometer which have a more simple acceptance/efficiency as a function of the correlation angle, but the other conditions of the experiment were very similar to the published ones. We could confirm the presence of the anomaly measured at the E$_x$=18.15 MeV resonance, and also confirm their absence at the E$_x$=17.6 MeV resonance, and at E$_p$= 800 keV off resonance energies.</description>
