      <title>High-power and narrow-linewidth laser on thin-film lithium niobate enabled by photonic wire bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a promising platform for the realization of high-performance chip-scale optical systems, spanning a range of applications from optical communications to microwave photonics. Such applications rely on the integration of multiple components onto a single platform. However, while many of these components have already been demonstrated on the TFLN platform, to date, a major bottleneck of the platform is the existence of a tunable, high-power, and narrow-linewidth on-chip laser. Here, we address this problem using photonic wire bonding to integrate optical amplifiers with a thin-film lithium niobate feedback circuit, and demonstrate an extended cavity diode laser yielding high on-chip power of 78 mW, side mode suppression larger than 60 dB and wide wavelength tunability over 43 nm. The laser frequency stability over short timescales shows an ultra-narrow intrinsic linewidth of 550 Hz, while long-term recordings indicate a high passive stability of the photonic wire bonded laser with 46 hours of mode-hop-free operation. This work verifies photonic wire bonding as a viable integration solution for high performance on-chip lasers, opening the path to system level upscaling and Watt-level output powers.</description>

      <title>Theory of Refraction, Ray-Wave Tilt, Hidden Momentum, and Apparent Topological Phases in Isotropy-Broken Materials based on Electromagnetism of Moving Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the problems of physics arguably greater in stature than even mathematical Hilberts problems is the mysterious nature of electromagnetic momentum in materials. In this paper we show that the difference between the Minkowski and Abraham momenta, which is composed of the Roentgen and Shockley hidden momenta, is directly related to the phenomenon of refraction and the tilt of rays from the wavefront propagation direction. We demonstrate that individual electromagnetic waves with non-unit indices of refraction n appear as quasistatic high-k waves to an observer in the proper frames of the waves. When Lorentz transformed into the material rest frames these high-k waves are Fresnel-Fizeau dragged from rest to their phase velocities and acquire longitudinal hidden momentum and related refractive properties. On the material level all electromagnetic waves belong to Fresnel wave surfaces topologically classified according to hyperbolic phases by Durach and determined from the electromagnetic material parameters. To moving observers, material parameters appear modified, which leads not only to the alterations of Fresnel wave surfaces, but even the topological classes of the materials may appear differently in moving frames. We discuss the phenomenon of the electromagnetic momentum tilt, defined as non-zero angle between Abraham and Minkowski momenta or equivalently between the rays and the wavefront propagation direction. We show that momentum tilt is only possible in isotropy-broken media, where E and H fields can be longitudinally polarized in presence of electric and magnetic bound charge waves. The momentum tilt can be understood as differential aberration of rays and waves when observed in material rest frame.</description>

      <title>Dark Superabsorbers with Dirac-delta-like superdirective radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and numerically reveal that under a given level of extinction cross section and with definite angular momentum channels dominant, there exists a physical limitation for absorption cross section being maximum and scattering cross section being minimum. In addition, any scattering systems operated at this condition would be accompanied by a needle Dirac-delta-like far-field radiation pattern, reducing to perturb the background field except in the forward direction. We therefore refer to this outcome as dark superabsorbers. Moreover, by considering the mathematical Gibbs phenomenon, we find that a completely equivalent Dirac-delta far-field radiation is excluded even we could properly design the scatterers operated at such conditions. We believe this finding has potential applications in design of dark energy harvesting, lower-visibility receivers, superdirective light-matter interaction, and Fresnel diffractive imaging.</description>

      <title>On-chip high energy photon radiation source based on microwave-dielectric undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new on-chip light source configuration has been proposed, which utilizes the interaction between microwave and a dielectric nanopillar array to generate a periodic electromagnetic near field, and applies periodic transverse acceleration to relativistic electrons to generate high-energy photon radiation. Here the dielectric nanopillar array interacting with microwave acts as the electron undulator, in which the near field drives electrons to oscillate. When an electron beam operates in this nanopillar array in this light source configuration, it is subjected to a periodic transverse near-field force, and will radiate X-ray or even gamma-ray high energy photons after a relativistic frequency up-conversion. Compared with the laser-dielectric undulator based on the interaction between strong lasers and nanostructures to generate a plasmonic near field, this configuration is less prone to damage during operation.</description>

      <title>Evanescent Optothermoelectric Trapping: Deeper Potentials at a Largescale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface plasmons (SP) and their mediated effects have been widely used to manipulate micro- and nanoscale objects of dielectric and metallic nature. In this work, we show how SP excitation can be used to induce thermofluidic and thermoelectric effects to manipulate colloidal dynamics on a large scale. In an evanescent plasmonic trap, temperature gradients induce fluid flow that can facilitate particle accumulation. However, large out-of-plane flows expel particles from the trap, resulting in a shallow trap potential. Here, we numerically demonstrate how adding thermoelectric fields can overpower the optical and hydrodynamic forces to achieve a stable nanoparticle assembly at low excitation powers. We calculate the corresponding optical, fluidic, and thermoelectric trapping forces and potentials. These potentials can be enabled without resonant SP excitation, which requires careful optical alignment. Thus, we explain the mechanism of how, despite weak optical intensities and forces, sufficient trapping force can be supplied via the evanescent optothermoelectric trap to obtain large-scale reversible nanoparticle assemblies, irrespective of their shape, size, or material.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength switchable single-frequency hyper Raman microlasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength switchable single-frequency microlasers in a broad spectral range are highly desirable for integrated photonic applications due to their dynamic switching functionality, narrow linewidth, and high side-mode-suppression-ratio (SMSR). Here, a strategy based on highly efficient successive excitation of different stimulated multi-photon hyper-Raman scattering (SMPHRS) processes is proposed to generate multi-wavelength switchable single-frequency hyper-Raman microlasers. This is achieved through collective precise dispersion management for arranging excitation wavelengths to trigger different phase-matched SMPHRS processes in order, mode-hopping-free tuning of the pump wavelength within a wide range of 0.75 nm by leveraging strong thermo-optical broadening of ultra-high Q modes, and simultaneously suppressing harmonics generation in a lithium niobate microcavity with high second-order nonlinearity. As a result, under continuous-wave laser pump at a low level of only 3.9 mW, SMPHRS processes from two- to five-photons emerged step by step and almost depleted previously generated multi-photon Raman signal. Consequently, four-wavelength dynamically switchable single-mode lasing from near infrared (857 nm) to ultraviolet (350 nm) spanning beyond the record range (~500 nm) with high SMSRs &gt;35 dB is reported.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Electrical Generation of Surface Phonon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Notwithstanding its relevance to many applications in sensing, security, and communications, electrical generation of narrow-band mid-infrared light remains highly challenging. Unlike in the ultraviolet or visible spectral regions few materials possess direct electronic transitions in the mid-infrared and most that do are created through complex band-engineering schemes. An alternative mechanism, independent of dipole active material transitions, relies instead on energy lost to the polar lattice through the Coulomb interaction. Longitudinal phonons radiated in this way can be spectrally tuned through the engineering of polar nanostructures and coupled to localized optical modes in the material, allowing them to radiate mid-infrared photons into the far-field. A recent theoretical work explored this process providing for the first time an indication of its technological relevance when compared to standard thermal emitters. In order to do so it nevertheless used an equilibrium model of the electron gas, making this model difficult to inform the design of an optimal device to experimentally observe the effect. The present paper removes this limitation, describing the electron gas using a rigorous, self-consistent, non-equilibrium Green's function model, accounting for variations in material properties across the device, and electron-electron interactions. Although the instability of the Schrodinger-Poisson iteration limits our studies to the low-bias regime, our results demonstrate emission rates comparable to that of room-temperature thermal emission despite such low biases. These results provide a pathway to design a confirmatory experiment of this new emission channel, that could power a new generation of mid-infrared optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional non-reciprocal transport in photonic topological heterostructure of arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic wave propagation in three-dimensional space typically suffers omnidirectional scattering when encountering obstacles. In this study, we employed Chern vectors to construct a topological heterostructure, where large-volume non-reciprocal topological transport in three-dimension is achieved. The shape of the cross-section in the heterostructure can be arbitrary designed, and we experimentally observed the distinctive cross-shaped field pattern transport, non-reciprocal energy harvesting, and most importantly, the remarkable ability of electromagnetic wave to traverse obstacles and abrupt structure changes without encountering reflections in 3D space.</description>

      <title>CMOS-fabricated ultraviolet light modulators using low-loss alumina piezo-optomechanical photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a CMOS-foundry-fabricated piezo-optomechanical photonic integrated circuit platform for ultraviolet and blue wavelengths, using alumina waveguides that are strongly mechanically coupled to monolithically integrated aluminum nitride piezoelectric actuators. Low waveguide losses are measured down to at least 320 nm, where we achieve 1.6 dB/cm. This allows us to demonstrate broadband amplitude modulators based on piezoelectrically actuated MEMS cantilever phase-shifters down to 320 nm, with a high extinction ratio of 30 dB. We further demonstrate the versatility of the platform by designing and demonstrating a modulator that can work with high extinction and low loss at 320 nm and 420 nm, simultaneously, demonstrating control of multiple, disparate wavelengths in one device. We also demonstrate narrow-band resonant racetrack modulators with quality factors of 4.7E5 and a tuning rate of 27.5 MHz/V. These results should open doors for a range of novel applications in UV photonics, quantum science, sensing and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Assisted End-to-End Design for Dispersive Full-Parameter Control of Meta-Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible control light field across multiple parameters is the cornerstone of versatile and miniaturized optical devices. Metasurfaces, comprising subwavelength scatterers, offer a potent platform for executing such precise manipulations. However, the inherent mutual constraints between parameters of metasurfaces make it challenging for traditional approaches to achieve full-parameter control across multiple wavelengths. Here, we propose a universal end-to-end inverse design framework to directly optimize the geometric parameter layout of meta-optics based on the target functionality of full-parameter control across multiple wavelengths. This framework employs a differentiable forward simulator integrating a neural network-based dispersive full-parameter Jones matrix and Fourier propagation to facilitate gradient-based optimization. Its superiority over sequential forward designs in dual-polarization channel color holography with higher quality and tri-polarization three-dimensional color holography with higher multiplexed capacity is showcased. To highlight the universality, we further present polarized spectral multi-information processing with six arbitrary polarizations and three wavelengths. This versatile, differentiable, system-level design framework is poised to expedite the advancement of meta-optics in integrated multi-information display, imaging, and communication, extending to multi-modal sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic angular momentum, spin and helicity of higher-order Poincare modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of coherent sources of higher order Poincare optical beams have opened up new opportunities for applications such as in the optical trapping of atoms and small particles, the manipulation of chirally-sensitive systems and in improved encoding schemes for broad-bandwidth communications. Here we determine the intrinsic properties of Poincare Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes which have so far neither been evaluated, nor their significance highlighted. The theoretical framework we adopt here is both novel and essential because it emphasises the crucial role played by the normally ignored axial components of the twisted light fields of these modes. We show that the inclusion of the axial field components enables the intrinsic properties of the Poincare modes, notably their angular momentum, both spin and orbital as well as their helicity and chirality, to be determined. We predict significant enhancements of the intrinsic properties of these modes when compared with those due to the zero order LG modes. In particular, we show that higher order LG Poincare modes exhibit super-chirality and, significantly so, even in the case of the first order</description>

      <title>A study of the coupled dynamics of asymmetric absorbing clusters in a photophoretic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study on the dynamics of absorbing asymmetric carbon clusters trapped by a loosely focused Gaussian beam using photophoretic force. At high laser powers, all the trapped clusters display rotation coupled with oscillation along the axial direction, with a majority spinning about a body fixed axis, while the rest display dual spin as well as orbital motion about a fixed point in space. The spinning and orbiting frequency is inversely proportional to the amplitude of the axial oscillation - with one growing at the expense of the other. Further, the frequencies of these rotations are not proportional to the laser power, but to the trap stiffnesses inferred from the corresponding natural frequencies. The clusters also stop rotating below a certain laser power, and execute random thermal fluctuations. Our work suggests that the dynamics of clusters trapped with photophoretic force are largely dependent on the cluster size and morphology, which could, in principle, be tuned to obtain various motional responses, and help in the design of rotating micromachines in air.</description>

      <title>A Novel Design of Capacitive Plasmonic Near Field Transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A near field transducer (NFT) is a key photonics component in heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) for the localized heating of the magnetic medium. In this work, we present a novel NFT design through capacitive coupling. In our design, tapered metal bars separated by thin dielectric materials with gap distance G are used to create the plasmonic resonance and focus the electromagnetic field. The design is motivated by the intention to improve thermal stability, which can be achieved through segmentation using thermally stable dielectric material between the plasmonic metal bars. Using COMSOL Multiphysics software, the performance of this capacitive-coupled NFT is systematically modeled. It is shown that the electromagnetic field could gradually be focused through the tapering towards the air bearing surface (ABS). In addition, the focusing effect could be enhanced with a smaller NFT peg size at the resonant wavelength. The material selection for the NFT tip material will be discussed to further address the thermal stability of the device. In conclusion, this capacitive-coupled NFT with dielectric separation gaps and tapering yields an enhanced |E| field intensity at the tip with the potential for an enhanced material thermal stability. Such a design can also exhibit applications in other energy delivery systems as well as plasmonic waveguides and sensors.</description>

      <title>Periodic domain inversion in single crystal barium titanate-on-insulator thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimentally achieving first-ever electric field periodic poling of single crystal barium titanate (BTO, or BaTiO3) thin film on insulator. Owing to the outstanding optical nonlinearities of BTO, this result is a key step towards achieving quasi-phase-matching in BTO. We first grow the BTO thin film on a dysprosium scandate substrate using pulsed laser deposition with a thin layer of strontium ruthenate later serving as the bottom electrode for poling. We present characterization of the BTO thin film using x-ray diffraction and piezo-response force microscopy to clearly demonstrate single crystal, single domain growth of the film which enables the desired periodic poling. To investigate the poling quality, we apply both non-destructive piezo force response microscopy and destructive etching-assisted scanning electron microscopy and we show that high quality, uniform and intransient poling with 50 % duty cycle and periods ranging from 2 {\mu}m to 10 {\mu}m is achieved. The successful realization of periodic poling in BTO thin film unlocks the potential for highly efficient nonlinear processes under quasi-phase-matching that seemed far-fetched with prior polycrystalline BTO thin films which predominantly relied on efficiency-limited random or non-phase matching conditions and is a key step towards integration of BTO photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological winding in non-Hermitian systems are generally associated to the Bloch band properties of lattice Hamiltonians. However, in certain non-Hermitian models topological winding naturally arise from the dynamical evolution of the system and related to a new form of geometric phase. Here we investigate dynamical topological winding in non-Hermitian photonic mesh lattices, where the mean survival time of an optical pulse circulating in coupled fiber loops is quantized and robust against Hamiltonian deformations. The suggested photonic model could provide an experimentally accessible platform for the observation of non-Hermitian dynamical topological windings.</description>

      <title>Remote Electric Powering by Germanium Photovoltaic Conversion of an Erbium-Fiber Laser Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The commercially available 4000-Watt continuous-wave Erbium-doped-fiber laser, emitting at the 1567-nanometer wavelength where the atmosphere has high transmission, provides an opportunity for harvesting electric power at remote off the grid locations using a multi-module photovoltaic receiver panel. This paper proposes a 32-element monocrystalline thick-layer Germanium photovoltaic panel for efficient harvesting of a collimated 1.13-meter-diameter beam.The 0.78-meter squared PV panel is constructed from commercial Ge wafers. For incident continuous-wave laser-beam power in the 4000 to 10000 Watt range, our thermal and electrical and infrared simulations predict 660 to 1510 Watts of electrical output at panel temperatures of 350 to 423 Kelvin.</description>

      <title>Agile Free-Form Signal Filtering with a Chaotic-Cavity-Backed Non-Local Programmable Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filter synthesis is an inverse problem that is traditionally approached rationally by considering spatially disjoint resonators, approximating them as lumped elements, and engineering the coupling of selected pairs. This approach strongly limits the design space, making it challenging to build extremely tunable filters. Here, we demonstrate agile free-form signal filtering with an alternative purely-optimization-based design paradigm using a programmable system with many spatially overlapping modes. We back a programmable metallic metasurface with a quasi-2D chaotic cavity, inducing strong non-local interactions between all meta-elements and the connected ports. Thereby, the metasurface efficiently controls the transfer function between the ports. Our all-metallic device has unique advantages: ultra-wideband (UWB) tunability (7.5-13.5GHz), low loss, compactness, guaranteed linearity under high signal-power levels. First, we experimentally confirm theoretical predictions about reflectionless and transmissionless scattering modes; we also experimentally observe transmissionless exceptional points. Second, we impose diverse types of transfer function zeros at desired frequencies within an UWB range. Third, we achieve low-loss reflectionless programmable signal routing. Fourth, we investigate the trade-off between routing fidelity and bandwidth, achieving 20dB discrimination over 10MHz bandwidth. Fifth, we demonstrate UWB tunable multi-band filters that reject (&lt;-24dB) or pass (&gt;-1dB) signals in specified bands whose centers, widths and number are reprogrammable.</description>

Abstract: Developing thermal analogues of field-effect transistor could open the door to a low-power and even zero-power communication technology working with heat rather than electricity. These solid-sate devices could also find many applications in the field of active thermal management in numerous technologies (microelectronic, building science, energy harvesting,conversion,...). Recent theoretical works has suggested that a photonic transistor made with three terminals can in principle be used to switch, modulate, and even amplify heat flux through exchange of thermal photons. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of thermal transistor effect using a non-contact system composed by a temperature-controlled metal-insulator-based material interacting in far-field regime with two blackbodies held at two different temperatures. We demonstrate that, with a tiny change in the temperature of the active layer, the heat flux received by the cold blackbody can be drastically modified. An amplification parameter of heat flux over 20 is reported.</description>

      <title>Microheater hotspot engineering for repeatable multi-level switching in foundry-processed phase change silicon photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonvolatile photonic integrated circuits employing phase change materials have relied either on optical switching mechanisms with precise multi-level control but poor scalability or electrical switching with seamless integration and scalability but mostly limited to a binary response. Recent works have demonstrated electrical multi-level switching; however, they relied on the stochastic nucleation process to achieve partial crystallization with low demonstrated repeatability and cyclability. Here, we re-engineer waveguide-integrated microheaters to achieve precise spatial control of the temperature profile (i.e., hotspot) and, thus, switch deterministic areas of an embedded phase change material cell. We experimentally demonstrate this concept using a variety of foundry-processed doped-silicon microheaters on a silicon-on-insulator platform to trigger multi-step amorphization and reversible switching of Sb$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Se$_{4}$Te alloys. We further characterize the response of our microheaters using Transient Thermoreflectance Imaging. Our approach combines the deterministic control resulting from a spatially resolved glassy-crystalline distribution with the scalability of electro-thermal switching devices, thus paving the way to reliable multi-level switching towards robust reprogrammable phase-change photonic devices for analog processing and computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance photonic switches are essential for large-scale optical routing for AI large models and Internet of things. Realizing nonvolatility can further reduce power consumption and expand application scenarios. We propose a nonvolatile 2*2 silicon photonic micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) switch compatible with standard silicon photonic foundry processes. The switch employs electrostatic comb actuator to change the air gap of the horizontal adiabatic coupler and achieves nonvolatility with centrally-clamped stepped bistable mechanical beams. The photonic switch shows a 10 us-scale switching speed and a 10 fJ-scale simulated switching energy in a 100*100 um^2 footprint, with &lt;=26 V driving voltages.</description>

      <title>Ising Hamiltonian for Coupled Fibre-Based Optical Parametric Oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, I derive an Ising Hamiltonian for $N$ coupled fibre-based Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPOs). For this, I use the Lugiato-Lefever equation. The derivation of the Hamiltonian does not pretend to be mathematically correct, although it works under the assumption of plane waves propagating through the OPOs. Its objective is rather to be as close as possible to the Hamilton formalism than to be mathematically rigorous. The approach is based on the assumptions that are justified from the physical point of view and are implemented experimentally. The resulting Ising Hamiltonian contains all necessary terms that are connected to the appearance and evolution of phase solitons.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Anisotropic Beer-Lambert Law from Dichroism and Birefringence in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anisotropic optical absorption edge of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ follows a modified Beer-Lambert law having two effective absorption coefficients. The absorption coefficient of linearly polarized light reduces to the least absorbing direction beyond a critical penetration depth, which itself depends on polarization and wavelength. To understand this behavior, a Stokes vector analysis is performed to track the polarization state as a function of depth. The weakening of the absorption coefficient is associated with a gradual shift of linear polarization to the least absorbing crystallographic direction in the plane, which is along the a-exciton within the (010) plane or along the b-exciton in the (001) plane. We show that strong linear dichroism near the optical absorption edge causes this shift in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, which arises from the anisotropy and spectral splitting of the physical absorbers i.e., excitons. The linear polarization shift is accompanied by a variation in the ellipticity due to the birefringence of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Analysis of the phase relationship between the incoming electric field to that at a certain depth reveals the phase speed as an effective refractive index, which varies along different crystallographic directions. The critical penetration depth is shown to be correlated with the depth at which the ellipticity is maximal. Thus, the anisotropic Beer-Lambert law arises from the interplay of both the dichroic and birefringent properties of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical adiabatons are specific shape-invariant pulse pairs propagating at the reduced group velocity and without optical absorption in the medium. The purpose of this study is to analyze and demonstrate adiabaton formation in many level atomic systems. Here we focus on the analysis of five level M-type and double tripod systems. It is found that M-type atomic systems are prone to intensity dependent group velocity and pulse front steepening which prevents the formation of long range optical adiabatons. In contrast, the double tripod atomic system is quite favorable for the formation of optical adiabatons leading to two different optical field configurations propagating with invariant shape.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise induced nonreciprocity for single photon transport in parity-time symmetric systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show nonreciprocal light propagation for single-photon inputs due to quantum noise in coupled optical systems with gain and loss. We consider two parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of either two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides evanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even without noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the broken phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupled atom-photon system described by the Tavis-Cummings dimer (two coupled cavities) in the presence of photon loss and atomic pumping, to investigate the quantum signature of dissipative chaos. The appropriate classical limit of the model allows us to obtain a phase diagram identifying different dynamical phases, especially the onset of chaos. Both classically and quantum mechanically, we demonstrate the emergence of a steady state in the chaotic regime and analyze its properties. The interplay between quantum fluctuation and chaos leads to enhanced mixing dynamics and dephasing, resulting in the formation of an incoherent photonic fluid. The steady state exhibits an intriguing phenomenon of subsystem thermalization even outside the chaotic regime; however, its effective temperature increases with the degree of chaos. Moreover, the statistical properties of the steady state show a close connection with the random matrix theory. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology Optimization (TO) holds the promise of designing next-generation compact and efficient photonic components. However, ensuring the optimized designs comply with fabrication constraints imposed by semiconductor foundries remains a challenge. This work presents a TO framework that guarantees designs satisfy fabrication criteria, particularly minimum feature size and separation. Leveraging recent advancements in machine learning and feature mapping methods, our approach constructs components by transforming shapes from a predefined library, simplifying constraint enforcement. Specifically, we introduce a Convo-implicit Variational Autoencoder to encode the discrete shape library into a differentiable space, enabling gradient-based optimization. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated through the design of several common photonic components.</description>

      <title>Strong Field Optical Hall Effect in 2D Weyl Semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of interplay between the geometric nature of Bloch electrons and transverse responses under strong field offers new opportunities for optoelectronic applications. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the strong-field response of Weyl Dirac nodes in bilayer T'-WTe2 using time-dependent first-principles formalism. The electron dynamics is explored focusing on the mid-infrared frequency, ranging from the perturbative to nonperturbative regime. In the nonperturbative regime, the high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectra under a strong field clearly exhibit a plateau and energy cutoffs for both longitudinal and anomalous Hall (transverse) currents, with the latter being due to the large interband Berry curvature of the Weyl-Dirac semimetal. For the longitudinal harmonics, the intraband contributions increase with intensity, resulting in a complex interplay between interband polarization and intraband motions. Remarkably, if we take a comprehensive all-band perspective enabled by time-dependent density functional calculations, the anomalous Hall responses are purely attributed to the interband processes, even in the nonperturbative regime, thus Hall HHG can be crucial to understand the carrier dynamics. Our findings suggest that HHG associated with the ultrafast strong-field driven electron dynamics holds immense potential for exploring the nonlinear high Hall responses in Weyl semimetal.</description>

      <title>Quantitative evaluation method for magnetoelastic coupling between surface acoustic waves and spin waves using electrical and optical measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling and hybridization of different elementary excitations leads to new functionalities. In phononics and spintronics, magnetoelastic coupling between Rayleigh-type surface acoustic wave (SAW) and spin wave (SW) has recently attracted much attention. Quantitatively evaluating and comparing the coupled system are essential to develop the study of the magnetoelastic SAW-SW coupling. So far, previous studies of SAW-SW coupling have employed a quantity called coupling strength. However, it is still challenging to compare the coupling strength values among studies fairly because the quantity depends on the device geometry and the applied magnetic field angle, which are not unified among the previous studies. Here, we focus on a practical constant composed of a magnetoelastic constant and a strain amplitude that depends only on the material properties. We demonstrate a versatile evaluation technique to evaluate the practical constant by combining electrical measurements and optical imaging. An essential part of the technique is an analysis that can be used under off-resonance conditions where SAW and SW resonance frequencies do not match. Existing analysis can only handle the case under on-resonance conditions. Our analysis makes it possible to observe the magnetoelastic couplings between SAW with resonance frequencies that can be imaged optically and SW with resonance frequencies in the gigahertz range. Our demonstrated technique, which uses electrical and optical measurements under off-resonance conditions, can significantly advance research on SAW-SW coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference with a Coexisting Clock using Transceivers for Synchronization over Deployed Fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interference between independently generated photons is a key step towards distributing entanglement over long distances, but it requires synchronization between the distantly-located photon sources. Synchronizing the clocks of such photon sources using coexisting two-way classical optical communications over the same fiber that transport the quantum photonic signals is a promising approach for achieving photon-photon interference over long distances, enabling entanglement distribution for quantum networking using the deployed fiber infrastructure. Here, we demonstrate photon-photon interference by observing the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip between two distantly-located sources: a weak coherent state source obtained by attenuating the output of a laser and a heralded single-photon source. We achieve a maximum dip visibility of $0.58 \pm 0.04$ when the two sources are connected via $4.3$ km of deployed fiber. Dip visibilities $&gt;0.5$ are nonclassical and a first step towards achieving teleportation over the deployed fiber infrastructure. In our experiment, the classical optical communication is achieved with $-21$ dBm of optical signal launch power, which is used to synchronize the clocks in the two independent, distantly-located photon sources. The impact of spontaneous Raman scattering from the classical optical signals is mitigated by appropriate choice of the quantum and classical channel wavelengths. All equipment used in our experiment (the photon sources and the synchronization setup) is commercially available. Finally, our experiment represents a scalable approach to enabling practical quantum networking with commercial equipment and coexistence with classical communications in optical fiber.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian skin effect in arbitrary dimensions: non-Bloch band theory and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a distinctive phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems, characterized by a significant accumulation of eigenstates at system boundaries. While well-understood in one dimension via non-Bloch band theory, unraveling the NHSE in higher dimensions faces formidable challenges due to the diversity of open boundary conditions or lattice geometries and inevitable numerical errors. Key issues, including higher-dimensional non-Bloch band theory, geometric dependency, spectral convergence and stability, and a complete classification of NHSE, remain elusive. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a geometry-adaptive non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary dimensions, through the lens of spectral potential. Our formulation accurately determines the energy spectra, density of states, and generalized Brillouin zone for a given geometry in the thermodynamic limit (TDL), revealing their geometric dependencies. Furthermore, we systematically classify the NHSE into critical and non-reciprocal types using net winding numbers. In the critical case, we identify novel scale-free skin modes residing on the boundary. In the nonreciprocal case, the skin modes manifest in various forms, including normal or anomalous corner modes, boundary modes or scale-free modes. We reveal the non-convergence and instability of the non-Bloch spectra in the presence of scale-free modes and attribute it to the non-exchangeability of the zero-perturbation limit and the TDL. The instability drives the energy spectra towards the Amoeba spectra in the critical case. Our findings provide a unified non-Bloch band theory governing the energy spectra, density of states, and generalized Brillouin zone in the TDL, offering a comprehensive understanding of NHSE in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We study the steady-state non-Hermitian magnomechanical system driven by a transverse magnetic field directly interacting with YIG sphere and excites cavity magnons and photons. To make the system non-Hermitian, we use a traveling field directly interacting with magnons generating gain to the system. We start by illustrating PT-configuration of the system, which contains two PT broken region around exceptional point and PT protected region along the axis of exceptional point. Late, we discover that the numbers of cavity photons and magnons show bistable behavior depending upon the PT configuration, which becomes more significant as the values of the magnon-photon coupling and traveling field strength increases. We illustrate that steady-state photon only shows bistable behavior when the system in in lossy PT broken configuration, means strength of traveling field is less than the magnon-photon coupling. Otherwise, it will just contain a single stable state because of bistability suppression with gain in the system, which is unlike with any other investigation in this direction. Further, a larger magnon-photon coupling increases photon intensity and decreases magnon intensity, because of photon and magnon energy exchange, leading to enhanced photon bistablity and decreased magnon bistability. However, in case of increasing strength of traveling field, both photon as well as magnon bistability is appeared to be decreasing. We also study the steady-state effective potential of the system and illustrate the occurrence of bistability with nonlinear interactions between contour trajectories, which similarly depends on the PT broken configuration of the system.</description>

      <title>Point-Spread Function of the Optics in Scanning Electron Microscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-spread function of the probe forming optics ($PSF_{optics} $) is reported for the first time in an uncorrected (without multipole correctors) scanning electron microscope (SEM). In an SEM, the electron probe information is lost as the beam interacts with the specimen. We show how the probe phase information can be recovered from reconstructed probe intensity estimates. Controlled defocus was used to capture a focal-series of SEM images of $28.5\;nm $ gold ($\mathrm{Au} $) nanoparticles ($\mathrm{NPs} $) on a carbon ($\mathrm C $) film. These images were used to reconstruct their respective probe intensities to create a focal-series of probe intensities, which were the input to the phase retrieval pipeline. Using the complete description (intensity and phase) of the electron probe wavefunction at the specimen plane, we report the $PSF_{optics} $ for multiple data sets for beam energy $E\;=20\;keV\; $. This work opens up new possibilities for an alternative way of aberration correction and aberration-free imaging in scanning electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal Method for Quasinormal Modes of Non-Relativistic Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently reported compactified hyperboloidal method has found wide use in the numerical computation of quasinormal modes, with implications for fields as diverse as gravitational physics and optics. We extend this intrinsically relativistic method into the non-relativistic domain, demonstrating its use to calculate the quasinormal modes of the Schr\"odinger equation and solve related bound-state problems. We also describe how to further generalize this method, offering a perspective on the importance of non-relativistic quasinormal modes for the programme of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: Optical methods based on thin multimode fibers (MMFs) are promising tools for measuring neuronal activity in deep brain regions of freely moving mice thanks to their small diameter. However, current methods are limited: while fiber photometry provides only ensemble activity, imaging techniques using of long multimode fibers are very sensitive to bending and have not been applied to unrestrained rodents yet. Here, we demonstrate the fundamentals of a new approach using a short MMF coupled to a miniscope. In proof-of-principle in vitro experiments, we disentangled spatio-temporal fluorescence signals from multiple fluorescent sources transmitted by a thin (200 \mu m) and short (8 mm) MMF, using a general unconstrained non-negative matrix factorization algorithm directly on the raw video data. Furthermore, we show that low-cost open-source miniscopes have sufficient sensitivity to image the same fluorescence patterns seen in our proof-of-principle experiment, suggesting a new avenue for novel minimally invasive deep brain studies using multimode fibers in freely behaving mice.</description>

      <title>An optically defined phononic crystal defect</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate a mechanical crystal with an optically programmable defect mode. By applying an optical spring to a single unit cell of a phononic crystal membrane, we smoothly transfer a single mechanical mode into the bandgap, thereby localizing its spatial profile from one spanning the entire crystal to one confined within a few unit cells. This localization is evidenced by an enhanced mechanical frequency shift commensurate with a 37-fold reduction in the mode's participating mass. Our results lay groundwork for a new class of optomechanical systems that control mechanical mode profile and participating mass.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the theoretical framework for understanding the sensing capabilities of optical fibers. We show the distinct advantage of polarization over phase in detecting subhertz environmental processes. Subsequently, we propose a scheme capable of extracting the spectrum of perturbations affecting a specific section at any position along an optical fiber by detecting the state of polarization of the backreflected light. We discuss two examples of earthquake detection and the detection of sea swells and ocean tides through the analysis of the state of polarization of an optical signal reconstructed by the receiver of a transoceanic cable, obtained from an online database.\cite{zhongwenzhan_2020} Finally, we provide the analytical expression for the cross-correlation of the polarization perturbations of two wavelength division multiplexed channels, and show that the analysis of the polarization correlations between adjacent channels can provide valuable insights into the localization of earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Magnetically tunable optical bound states in the continuum with arbitrary polarization and intrinsic chirality</title>

Abstract: Optical bound states in the continuum (BICs), which are exotic localized eigenstates embedded in the continuum spectrum and topological polarization singularity in momentum space, have attracted great attentions in both fundamental and applied physics. Here, based on magneto-optical photonic crystal slab placed in external magnetic fields to break the time-reversal symmetry, we theoretically demonstrate magnetically tunable BICs with arbitrary polarization covering the entire Poincar\'e sphere and efficient off-{\Gamma} chiral emission of circularly polarized states. More interestingly, by further breaking the in-plane inversion symmetry of the magneto-optical photonic crystal slab to generate a pair of circularly polarized states (C point) spawning from the eliminated BICs and tuning the external magnetic field strength to move one C point to the {\Gamma} point, one at-{\Gamma} intrinsic chiral BICs with near-unity circular dichroism exceeding 0.99 and a high quality factor of 46000 owning to the preserved out-of-plane mirror symmetry can be observed. These findings may lead to a plethora of potential applications in chiral-optical effects, structured light, and tunable optical devices.</description>

Abstract: The optical properties of rod-like two-layer nanoparticles are studied using the notions of equivalent prolate spheroid. The calculations are presented for frequency dependencies for polarizability and the absorption and scattering cross-section of prolate spheroids, cylinders, and spherocylinders. The effect of the sizes, the shapes of the nanoparticle and the material of the core and the shell on the location of the maxima of the imaginary part of polarizability and absorption and scattering cross-sections is analysed. The recommendations regarding the shape and size ratio of the nanoparticles for obtaining the maximum value of radiation efficiency are formulated.</description>

      <title>MieAI: A neural network for calculating optical properties of internally mixed aerosol in atmospheric models</title>

Abstract: Aerosols influence weather and climate by interacting with radiation through absorption and scattering. These effects heavily rely on the optical properties of aerosols, which are mainly governed by attributes such as morphology, size distribution, and chemical composition. These attributes undergo continuous changes due to chemical reactions and aerosol micro-physics, resulting in significant spatio-temporal variations. Most atmospheric models struggle to incorporate this variability because they use pre-calculated tables to handle aerosol optics. This offline approach often leads to substantial errors in estimating the radiative impacts of aerosols alongwith posing significant computational burdens. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel and computationally efficient machine learning ap proach called MieAI. It allows for online calculation of the optical properties of internally mixed aerosols with a log-normal size distribution. Importantly, MieAI fully incorporates the variability in aerosol chemistry and microphysics. Our evaluation of MieAI against traditional Mie calculations, using number concentrations from ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic model with Aerosol and Reactive Trace gases (ICON-ART) simulations, demonstrates that MieAI exhibits excellent predictive accuracy for aerosol optical properties. MieAI achieves this with errors well within 10%, and it operates more than 1000 times faster than the benchmark approach of Mie calculations. Due to its generalized nature, the MieAI approach can be implemented in any chemistry transport model which represents aerosol size distribution in the form of log-normally distributed internally mixed modes. This advancement has the potential to replace frequently employed lookup tables and play a substantial role in the ongoing attempts to reduce uncertainties in estimating aerosol radiative forcing.</description>

Abstract: Coherent states are a well-established tool of quantum optics to describe electromagnetic waves in terms of photons. However, they do not describe the near-field regime of radiation sources. Instead, we generically use classical solutions of Maxwell's equations to describe radiation in the near-field regime. The classical solutions provide linear relations between currents and emitted electromagnetic fields, whereas evolution of states at the quantum level proceeds through unitary time evolution operators involving photon operators. This begs questions how the classical radiation equations relate to unitary quantum evolution, and how we can describe macroscopic fields from antennas or magnetic coils in terms of elementary photons. The present paper answers both questions through the construction of generalized Glauber states for radiation emitters.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence enhancement of single V2 centers in a 4H-SiC cavity antenna</title>

Abstract: Solid state quantum emitters are a prime candidate in distributed quantum technologies since they inherently provide a spin-photon interface. An ongoing challenge in the field, however, is the low photon extraction due to the high refractive index of typical host materials. This challenge can be overcome using photonic structures. Here, we report the integration of V2 centers in a cavity-based optical antenna. The structure consists of a silver-coated, 135 nm thin 4H-SiC membrane functioning as a planar cavity with a broadband resonance yielding a theoretical photon collection enhancement factor of 34. The planar geometry allows us to identify over 20 single V2 centers at room temperature with a mean (maximum) count rate enhancement factor of 9 (15). Moreover, we observe 10 V2 centers with a mean absorption linewidth below 80MHz at cryogenic temperatures. These results demonstrate a photon collection enhancement that is robust to the lateral emitter position.</description>
