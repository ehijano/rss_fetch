      <title>Spin-3/2 nuclear magnetic resonance: Exact solutions for aligned systems and implications for probing Fe-based superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of spin-3/2 nuclei in a static magnetic field aligned with one of the electric field gradient (EFG) principal axes is developed analytically, based on fictitious spin-1/2 formalism. Compact closed-form expressions for the eigenstates and transitions frequencies, as well as the expectation value of the magnetic moment after resonant excitation, are derived. Emphasis is placed on defining and interpreting the associated Rabi frequencies, as a function of excitation direction and ellipticity. It is found transitions inherently fall into two subsets, depending on their sensitivity to excitation direction, with the Rabi frequency of one subset directly depending on the asymmetry of the EFG. A natural application is the study of Fe-based superconductors, whose antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures leads to a strong intrinsic magnetic field aligned with the EFG principal axes. Zero external-field NMR spectra, from powder samples of two such Fe-based superconductors, BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and CaFe$_2$As$_2$, are analyzed and exemplify the simplicity in extracting the internal magnetic field, the quadrupole coupling constant, and the EFG asymmetry parameter, which are important for studying magnetic ordering, structural properties, phase transitions, and NMR dynamics. Results compare favorably to conventional high-field NMR experiments done with the rotation of single crystals. Overall, the physical insights, afforded by the exact and concise expressions, will lead to ready interpretation of spin-3/2 spectra as well as precipitate new experimental directions.</description>

      <title>Josephson oscillations of two weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical experiment based on a particle number-conserving quantum field theory is performed for two initially independent Bose-Einstein condensates that are coherently coupled at two temperatures. The present model illustrates ab initio that the initial relative phase of each of the two condensates doesn't remain random, but is distributed around integer multiple values of $2\pi$ from the interference and thermalization of forward and backward propagating matter waves at the Boltzmann equilibrium, that intrinsically measures zero average phases for each of the two independent condensates. Following this approach, focus is put on the original Gedanken experiment of Anderson on whether a Josephson current between two initially separated Bose-Einstein condensates occurs in a deterministic way or not, depending on the initial phase distribution.</description>

      <title>Precision frequency tuning of tunable transmon qubits using alternating-bias assisted annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are one of the leading platforms for realizing scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). The recent demonstration of post-fabrication tuning of Josephson junctions using alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique and a reduction in junction loss after ABAA illuminates a promising path towards precision tuning of qubit frequency while maintaining high coherence. Here, we demonstrate precision tuning of the maximum $|0\rangle\rightarrow |1\rangle$ transition frequency ($f_{01}^{\rm max}$) of tunable transmon qubits by performing ABAA at room temperature using commercially available test equipment. We characterize the impact of junction relaxation and aging on resistance spread after tuning, and demonstrate a frequency equivalent tuning precision of 7.7 MHz ($0.17\%$) based on targeted resistance tuning on hundreds of qubits, with a resistance tuning range up to $18.5\%$. Cryogenic measurements on tuned and untuned qubits show evidence of improved coherence after ABAA with no significant impact on tunability. Despite a small global offset, we show an empirical $f_{01}^{\rm max}$ tuning precision of 18.4 MHz by tuning a set of multi-qubit processors targeting their designed Hamiltonians. We experimentally characterize high-fidelity parametric resonance iSWAP gates on two ABAA-tuned 9-qubit processors with fidelity as high as $99.51\pm 0.20\%$. On the best-performing device, we measured across the device a median fidelity of $99.22\%$ and an average fidelity of $99.13\pm 0.12 \%$. Yield modeling analysis predicts high detuning-edge-yield using ABAA beyond the 1000-qubit scale. These results demonstrate the cutting-edge capability of frequency targeting using ABAA and open up a new avenue to systematically improving Hamiltonian targeting and optimization for scaling high-performance superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Emerging Majorana bound states in superconducting Haldane nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phase diagram of the $p$-wave superconducting Haldane model. In two dimensions, we find a topological nodal superconducting phase, which exhibits a chiral Majorana mode propagating along the edges of nanoribbons with cylindrical boundary conditions. This phase is however unstable in a finite two-dimensional rectangular-shaped lattice, yielding corner states close to zero energy in a flake with alternating zigzag and armchair edges. When we reduce one of the dimensions, quantum confinement gaps out the bulk bands faster than the edge states. In this scenario, hybridization between the edge states can then result in Majorana zero modes. Our results hence suggest quantum confinement as a crucial ingredient in building quasi-one-dimensional topological superconducting phases out of two-dimensional nodal topological superconductors. Furthermore, we characterize the emergence of this novel topological phase by means of its topological invariant, coinciding with a quantized conductance of $2 e^2/h$ in a normal-superconducting junction.</description>

      <title>Treatment of the strongly correlated topological superconductors through the $su(2|1)$ path-integral technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that topological superconductivity can be produced by strong electron-electron (e-e) interaction in two minimal one (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models containing only nearest neighbor hopping and suitable superconducting order parameters. The presence of the strong e-e interaction constrains each atomic site to be either empty or singly occupied. One can treat this scenario by fractionalizing the electrons into spin and charge degrees of freedom. We use the coherent state symbols associated with the lowest irreducible representation of the $su(2|1)$ superalgebra spanned by the Hubbard operators to solve the proposed models, as they implicitly take into account both the single particle occupation constraint and the fractionalization of the electrons. Our two example display the emergence of topological superconductivity in an 1D nanowire with extended $s$-wave superconductivity, and in a 2D square lattice with $p$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Majorana and Shiba states in a minimal Kitaev chain coupled to a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) coupled through a superconductor constitute a minimal realisation of a Kitaev chain with Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Such MZMs can be detected by e.g., tunneling conductance between each QD and normal leads [Dvir et al, Nature 614, 445 (2023)]. We here discuss how the seemingly trivial substitution of one of the normal leads by a superconducting (SC) one gives rise to a plethora of new effects. In particular, the coupling to the SC lead induces non-local Majorana effects upon variations of the QDs' energies. Furthermore, the lowest excitation of the chain is no longer determined by the bulk gap but rather by the energy of an emergent subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state coexisting with the MZMs. The YSR state hybridizes with the MZMs when the coupling between the SC and the QD is larger than the spin splitting, spoiling the Majorana properties, including the quantized conductance.</description>

      <title>Magnetization amplification in the interlayer pairing superconductor 4Hb-TaS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent experiment on the bulk compound 4Hb-TaS$_2$ reveals an unusual time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting state that possesses a magnetic memory not manifest in the normal state. Here we provide a mechanism for this observation by studying the magnetic and electronic properties of 4Hb-TaS$_2$. We discuss the criterion for a small magnetization in the normal state in terms of spin and orbital magnetizations. Based on an analysis of lattice symmetry and Fermi surface structure, we propose that 4Hb-TaS$_2$ realizes superconductivity in the interlayer, equal-spin channel with a gap function whose phase winds along the Fermi surface by an integer multiple of $6\pi$. The enhancement of the magnetization in the superconducting state compared to the normal state can be explained if the state with a gap winding of $6\pi$ is realized, accounting for the observed magnetic memory. We discuss how this superconducting state can be probed experimentally by spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy.</description>

      <title>Hydride Units Filled B--C Clathrate: A New Pathway for High-Temperature Superconductivity at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of room-temperature superconductors has recently advanced with the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in compressed hydrides, although sustaining the superconductivity of hydrides at ambient pressure remains challenging. In parallel, $sp^3$-bonded frameworks comprising lightweight elements (\textit{e.g.}, boron and carbon) have emerged as another avenue for developing ambient-pressure superconductors. However, despite their stability at low pressures, the critical temperature ($T_\text{c}$) values observed in these materials have not yet reached the impressive benchmarks set by hydride-based superconductors. Here we propose a novel design strategy for achieving high-temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure by integrating hydride units into B-C clathrate structures. This approach exploits the beneficial properties of hydrogen, the lightest element, to enhance the superconductivity beyond that of the parent compounds. For instance, our computational predictions indicate that doping SrB$_3$C$_3$ with ammonium (NH$_4$) yields a SrNH$_4$B$_6$C$_6$ compound with an estimated $T_\text{c}$ of 85 K at ambient pressure -- more than double that of its precursor (31 K). Extensive substitution across the periodic table results in a family of MNHNH$_4$B$_6$C$_6$ superconductors that are predicted to be superconducting at ambient pressure. These compounds can potentially be synthesized using high-pressure techniques and then quenched to ambient conditions, with the highest predicted ambient-pressure $T_\text{c}$ of 115 K in PbNH$_4$B$_6$C$_6$. Our findings present a promising strategy for discovering high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductors at ambient pressure, potentially revolutionizing technologies reliant on superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in pressurized trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-{\delta}}$ single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of discovering new high-temperature superconductors that diverge from the copper-based paradigm1-3 carries profound implications for elucidating mechanisms behind superconductivity and may also enable new applications4-8. Here, our investigation reveals that application of pressure effectively suppresses the spin and charge order in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10-{\delta} single crystals, leading to the emergence of superconductivity with a maximum critical temperature (Tc) of around 30 K at 69.0 GPa. The DC susceptibility measurements confirm a substantial diamagnetic response below Tc, indicating the presence of bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. In the normal state, we observe a "strange metal" behavior, characterized by a linear temperature-dependent resistance extending up to 300 K. Furthermore, the layer-dependent superconductivity observed hints at a unique interlayer coupling mechanism specific to nickelates, setting them apart from cuprates in this regard. Our findings provide crucial insights into the fundamental mechanisms underpinning superconductivity, while also introducing a new material platform to explore the intricate interplay between the spin/charge order, flat band structures, interlayer coupling, strange metal behavior and high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent transport measurement of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ uncover a "right-triangle" shape of the superconducting dome in the pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram. Motivated by this, we perform theoretical first-principles studies of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with the pressure ranging from 0 to 100 GPa. Notably, we reveal a pressure dependence of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ electron density at the Fermi energy ($n_z^{EF}$) that highly coincides with such shape. On this basis, we further explore the electronic structure under uniaxial stress. By tracking the stress response of $n_z^{EF}$, we propose that superconductivity can be achieved by applying only about 2 GPa of compression along the c axis. The idea is further exemplified from the perspectives of lattice distortion, band structure, Fermi surface and superconducting phase coherence. We also discuss the possible charge modulation under the stress and provide an insight to the relation between n_z^EF and the superconducting Tc in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ system. Our study provides a helpful guide to the future experiment.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Unconventional Rashba Band and Vortex Zero Mode in Topopogical Superconductor Candidate AuSn$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological superconductivity (TSC) is a promising platform to host Majorana zero mode (MZM) for topological quantum computing. Recently, the noble metal alloy AuSn$_{4}$ has been identified as an intrinsic surface TSC. However, the atomic visualization of its nontrivial surface states and MZM remains elusive. Here, we report the direct observation of unconventional surface states and vortex zero mode at the gold (Au) terminated surfaces of AuSn$_{4}$, by ultra-low scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy. Distinct from the trivial metallic bulk states at tin (Sn) surfaces, the Au terminated surface exhibits pronounced surface states near Fermi level. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that these states arise from unconventional Rashba bands, where two Fermi circles from different bands share identical helical spin textures, chiralities, and group velocities in the same direction. Furthermore, we find that although the superconducting gap, critical temperature, anisotropic in-plane critical field are almost identical on Au and Sn terminated surfaces, the in-gap bound states inside Abrikosov vortex cores show significant differences. The vortex on Sn terminated surfaces exhibits a conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound state while the Au surface shows a sharp zero-energy core state with a long non-splitting distance, resembling an MZM in a non-quantum-limit condition. This distinction may result from the dominant contribution of unconventional Rashba bands near Fermi energy from Au terminated surface. Our results provide a new platform for studying unconventional Rashba band and MZM in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Surface induced odd-frequency spin-triplet superconductivity as a veritable signature of Majorana bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict surface-induced odd-frequency (odd-$\nu$) spin-triplet superconducting pairing can be a veritable signature of Majorana bound states (MBS) in a Josephson nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$)-spin flipper (SF)-nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$) junction. Remarkably, in a $p_{x}$-SF-$p_{x}$ Josephson junction three distinct phases emerge: the topological phase featuring MBS, the topological phase without MBS, and the trivial phase devoid of MBS. Surface odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is induced only in the topological regime when MBS appears. In contrast, surface-induced even-frequency (even-$\nu$) spin-triplet pairing is finite regardless of the existence of MBS. Importantly, we find the surface induced odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is immune to disorder in the topological phase featuring MBS, while in the trivial phase the surface induced even-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is affected by disorder. Our study offers a potential means for distinguishing the topological phase featuring MBS from both the trivial phase as well as the topological phase devoid of MBS, primarily through the observation of induced surface odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Emergence and evolution of electronic modes with temperature in spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic modes emerge within the band gap at nonzero temperature in strongly correlated insulators such as Mott and Kondo insulators, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. As the temperature increases, the emergent modes gain considerable spectral weights and form robust bands that differ from the zero-temperature bands. Here, the origin of the emergent modes, their relation to doping-induced modes, and how their spectral weights increase with temperature are clarified in the ladder and bilayer Hubbard models and one- and two-dimensional Kondo lattice models using effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping and numerical calculations. The results indicate that the temperature-driven change in the band structure reflecting spin excitation, including the change in the number of bands, can be observed in various strongly correlated insulators even with a spin gap, provided that the temperature increases up to about spin-excitation energies. The controlled analyses developed in this study significantly contribute to the fundamental understanding of the band structure of strongly correlated insulators at nonzero temperature.</description>
