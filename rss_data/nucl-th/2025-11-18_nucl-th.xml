      <title>Coexisting phases in the chiral transition within the Linear sigma model with quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is believed at present that the chiral transition changes from a smooth crossover to a first-order transition at low temperatures and high densities. Such regime is commonly analyzed using effective models since first principle calculations, as in lattice arrangements, are not feasible. This transition is assumed to be discontinuous, with unstable or metastable intermediate states. However, if multiple charges are simultaneously conserved the system could undergo a continuous change through a coexistence of equilibrium states. This type of transition has multiple manifestations, as in the nuclear liquid-gas transition causing the spinodal fragmentation. The coexistence of phases in the chiral transition is studied here for quark matter assuming the conservation of the isospin composition. Using the Linear sigma model with quarks several remarkable effects are found and discussed.</description>

      <title>To bin or not to bin: does binning in multiplicity reliably suppress unwanted volume fluctuations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the effect of the so-called Centrality Bin Width Correction (CBWC) on the measurement of (net-)proton number cumulants in nucleus-nucleus collisions. We present an analytically tractable model, which includes correlations between multiplicity and proton number similar to those generated by the decay of baryon resonances. Within this model, we analyze the circumstances under which the CBWC method correctly removes the undesired effects of volume or impact parameter fluctuations. Additionally, we explore situations where the method fails and produces misleading results.</description>

      <title>Simplification of chiral nuclear forces near the unitarity limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern theory approaches for describing atomic nuclei often make use of on an effective theory that constructs the interaction between nucleons systematically based on Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), exploiting constraints arising from the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD. The tensor nuclear force produced by one-pion exchange is an important feature that arises naturally in this framework. In this work we show that, however, the tensor force is suppressed by the large nucleon-nucleon scattering lengths in combination with the smallness of the pion mass. Based on this observation, we propose a new scheme for a chiral nuclear force that is able to describe $NN$ phase shifts up to the center-of-mass momenta $k \simeq 300$ MeV while treating pion exchange as a perturbation. Our much simplified leading-order force provides a microscopic explanation for the recent success of various short-range nuclear forces from the perspective of chiral effective field theory, and it shares with those approaches an approximate Wigner SU(4) symmetry, as well as the closeness to the unitarity limit (infinite nucleon-nucleon scattering lengths), as guiding principles. Compared to previous approaches to perturbative-pion interactions, our force also adjusts the ordering of short-range contact interactions, by means of which we overcome convergence problems of the expansion that were previously assumed to severely limit its usefulness. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with numerical calculations of $NN$ scattering up to fourth order, in addition to studies of $3N$ and $4N$ bound-state properties.</description>

      <title>Thermal Quarkyonic Matter and Its Implications for Neutron Star Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and basic properties of dense nuclear matter still remain one of the open problems of Physics. In particular, the composition of the matter that composes neutron stars is under theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the theories that have been proposed, apart from the classical one where the composition is dominated by hadrons, the existence or coexistence of deconfined quark matter is a dominant guess. An approach towards this solution is the phenomenological view according to which the existence of quarkyonic matter plays a dominant role in the construction of the equation of state (EOS). According to it the structure of the EOS is based on the existence of the quarkyonic particle which is a hybrid state of a particle that combines properties of hadronic and quark matter with a corresponding representation in momentum space. In this paper we propose a phenomenological model for hot quarkyonic matter, borrowed from corresponding applications in hadronic models, where the interaction in the quarkyonic matter depends not only on the position but also on the momentum of the quarkyonic particles. This consideration, as we demonstrate, can have a remarkable consequence on the shape of the EOS and thus on the properties of neutron stars, especially in those for which the effect of temperature is significant, offering a sufficiently flexible model. Comparison with recent observational data can place constraints on the parameterization of the particular model and help improve its reliability.</description>

      <title>A deep learning approach for predicting multiple observables in Au+Au collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a neural network model, based on the processes of high-energy heavy-ion collisions, to study and predict several experimental observables in Au+Au collisions. We present a data-driven deep learning framework for predicting multiple bulk observables in Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies. A single neural network is trained exclusively on experimental measurements of charged-particle pseudorapidity density distributions, transverse-momentum spectra and elliptic flow coefficients over a broad range of collision energies and centralities. The network architecture is inspired by the stages of a heavy-ion collision -- from the quark-gluon plasma to chemical and kinetic freeze-out -- and employs locally connected hidden layers and a structured input design that encode basic geometric and kinematic features of the system. We demonstrate that these physics-motivated choices significantly improve test performance compared to purely fully connected baselines. The trained model is then used to predict the above observables at collision energies not yet explored experimentaly at RHIC, and the results are validated using the energy dependence of the total charged-particle multiplicity per participant pair as well as comparisons to a CLVisc hydrodynamic calculation with TRENTo initial conditions. Our findings indicate that such physics-guided neural networks can serve as efficient surrogates to fill critical data gaps at RHIC and to support further phenomenological studies of QGP properties.</description>

      <title>Medium modification of the charge-weighted Energy-Energy Correlators in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$~TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of medium-induced modifications in charge-dependent jet substructure using the charge-weighted Energy-Energy Correlators (EEC) in p+p and 0-10\% central Pb+Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. Charged hadron jets as well as flavor separated quark and gluon-initiated jets with momentum 40-60 GeV and R=0.4 are analyzed. The ratio of the charge-weighted distribution to the inclusive EEC, which reflects the magnitude of charge correlations, is consistently negative, demonstrating the dominance of opposite-charge pairs due to charge conservation. In Pb+Pb collisions, significant medium modifications are observed. The A+A to p+p ratio for charge correlations exhibits a universal pattern across jet types, showing no flavor dependence. Jet quenching enhances opposite-charge correlations at small angles while reducing them at large angles, leading to a steeper angular distance RL dependence of charge correlations in A+A, indicating a more rapid decorrelation behavior as RL increases. A distinctive V-shaped modification pattern appears in the plateau-like enhancement in the transition and small-RL region, independent of jet flavor. Through factorization of the EEC into charged hadron pair multiplicity and average energy weighting distributions, we identify enhanced energy weighting of opposite-charge pairs at small RL as the origin of the V-shaped modification. Also, the plateau-like enhancement of charge correlations is found to be unrelated to selection bias effects.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Dirac Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles in local equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently proposed Boltzmann local equilibrium Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles is generalized to the case of Fermi-Dirac statistics. The resulting formula ensures the correct normalization of the mean polarization vector and reproduces the generalized thermodynamic relations with spin that were obtained in earlier studies. Moreover, we show that the macroscopic currents constructed from the Fermi-Dirac Wigner function can be obtained as derivatives of a suitably defined generating function with respect to the Lagrange multipliers (temperature, hydrodynamic flow, and chemical potentials). The identified generating function also indicates that the underlying framework can be classified as a divergence-type theory.</description>

      <title>A Study of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ Nature : Compact v.s. Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central question in exotic-hadron physics is their internal structure whether these states are loosely bound hadronic molecules or compact multiquark configurations. To shed light on this issue, we develop a model that incorporates mixing between hadronic-molecular and compact multiquark components. We then apply this framework to the specific case of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and analyze the peak structure in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ invariant-mass spectrum reported by LHCb. We find that a scenario based on a predominantly compact tetraquark provides the best fitted solution which can explain the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. We also find that the model admits two more solutions of comparable quality, both of which imply that the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a molecular state: (1) the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a $D^{*+}D^0$ molecule and there is a $D^{*0}D^+$ molecular state in addition; (2) the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is a $D^{*0}D^+$ molecule and an aditional $D^{*+}D^0$ molecular state is found below $D^0D^0\pi^+$ threshold. These molecular states are not simple $I = 0$ states, but mixtures of $I = 0$ and $I = 1$ states. We show that all three scenarios are also consistent with the experimentally observed near-threshold $D^0D^0$ and $D^0D^+$ invariant-mass distributions.</description>

      <title>Prospects for a Solid-State Nuclear Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental breakthroughs toward a realization of a solid-state Thorium-229 nuclear clock, we review the technology, basic physics motivation, and limitations of the present generation of atomic clocks. We then discuss prospects for a new generation of clocks based on an anomalous low-energy 8.4 eV nuclear transition in Th-229, with an extremely long lifetime of 641 seconds when doped into CaF crystals. To realize such solid-state nuclear clocks one must confront basic nuclear, AMO, and solid state physics questions. Key challenges are understanding and minimizing the effects of inhomogeneous broadening, associated with strains and electric field gradients due to both the Th dopants and intrinsic crystal defects.</description>

      <title>Vortex creep heating in neutron star cooling with direct Urca processes in heavy neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Old, thermally bright neutron stars imply internal heating at late times. Among candidate mechanisms, vortex creep heating (VCH) provides a robust link between spin-down and frictional dissipation in the pinned inner-crust superfluid, yet its interplay with fast DUrca cooling in massive stars remains insufficiently explored.
  We (i) implement VCH in our cooling code and validate it; (ii) identify the physically consistent domain where the steady-state form $L_{\text{h}}=J|\dot\Omega_\infty|$ applies; (iii) quantify how $(B,P_0)$ regulate observable VCH signatures under DUrca cooling; and (iv) introduce a 3D representation that resolves degeneracies hidden in standard 2D projections.
  Cooling is computed with BSk24 and APR EoS, standard pairing gaps, and iron/carbon envelopes. VCH is modeled with $J\simeq10^{42.9\text{--}43.8}$ erg s, and a quantum-creep coverage fraction $f_{\text{Q}}(t)$ diagnoses when steady-state heating is valid. We survey $B=10^{10\text{--}13}$ G and $P_0=10$--$570$ ms for $1.4$ and $2.0\,M_\odot$, and compare with a curated set of ordinary pulsars with measured $(P,\dot P)$.
  Results: (1) Our implementation reproduces published VCH bands. (2) The $(B,P_0)$ validity boundary follows magnetic-dipole spin-down, confirming consistency with $|\dot\Omega|$. (3) DUrca+VCH maintains $T_{\text{s}}^\infty\gtrsim10^5$ K for $B\gtrsim10^{11-12}$ G up to $P_0\sim10^2$ ms. (4) The 3D representation shows that sources appearing coincident in $(t,T_{\text{s}}^\infty)$ occupy distinct $B$-layers, removing degeneracies.
  VCH can substantially reshape late-time thermal states when spin-down power remains high; its observability depends chiefly on $(B,P_0)$ rather than on mass alone. We provide a practical $(B,P_0)$ validity map for $L_{\text{h}}=J|\dot\Omega_\infty|$ and advocate treating $B$ as a co-equal axis in cooling analyses.

      <title>Exploring the production of Terbium-161 in the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) was conceived to meet national needs for radioisotope production, materials irradiation testing, and neutron beam applications. In addition to its 30~MW pool-type reactor, the RMB complex will include additional facilities for radioisotope production and related applications. $^{161}Tb$ is a promising radionuclide for radiopharmaceutical therapy, offering decay properties similar to $^{177}Lu$ but with additional conversion and Auger electrons that enhance dose delivery to cancer cells. In light of this emerging radioisotope, this study explores the potential production of $^{161}Tb$ in the RMB through neutron irradiation of enriched $Gd_{2}O_{3}$ targets. Monte Carlo (MCNP) simulations provided detailed neutron flux distributions, which were used as input for ORIGEN calculations of isotope buildup. Assuming 10 mg targets enriched to 97.5% in $^{160}Gd$, a 40-day irradiation, and a thermal flux of $2 \cdot 10^{14}$ $n/cm^{2}s$, the results indicate that $^{161}Tb$ activity reaches approximately 4.5 GBq after 14 days ($\approx 450 GBq/g$), in agreement with data from other research reactors. Building on prior studies that demonstrated the RMB's capability to irradiate larger targets, terabecquerel-scale yields appear feasible. These findings highlight the RMB's potential to support domestic production of emerging therapeutic radionuclides such as $^{161}Tb$. The potential for isotopic enrichment of $^{160}Gd$ using the AVLIS method is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical potentials are a standard tool in the study of nuclear reactions, as they describe the interaction between a target nucleus and a projectile. The use of phenomenological optical potentials built using experimental data on stable isotopes is widespread. Although successful in their dedicated domain, it is unclear whether these phenomenological potentials can provide reliable predictions for unstable isotopes. To address this problem, optical potentials based on microscopic nuclear structure input calculations prove to be crucial and are an important current line of research. In this work we present an explicit implementation of the Feshbach formalism for the systematic derivation of optical potentials using input from nuclear structure models. Numerical tools for the derivation of Green's functions associated with nonlocal potentials are presented. The new optical potential, based on the valence shell model, is applied to the calculations of n+24Mg elastic scattering and yields a close agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>The $\eta^\prime N$ interaction from the $\eta^\prime p$ correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate for the first time the $\eta^\prime p$ femtoscopic correlation function to study the $\eta^\prime N$ interaction. We find it extremely sensitive to the value of the $\eta^\prime p$ scattering length, for which at present there exists only very limited information, not even knowing its sign. The measurement of this correlation function would provide much valuable information on the $\eta^\prime N$ interaction, which could then also be used to settle the issue of possible $\eta^\prime$ nucleus bound states, an issue attracting much attention in the nuclear physics community.</description>

HFBTHO has previously been used to calibrate energy functionals and perform sensitivity analysis by using derivative-free methods. To enable derivative-based optimization and uncertainty quantification approaches, we must compute the derivatives of HFBTHO outputs with respect to the parameters of the energy functional, which are a subset of all input parameters of the code. We use the algorithmic/automatic differentiation (AD) tool Tapenade to differentiate HFBTHO. We compare the derivatives obtained using AD against finite-difference approximation and examine the performance of the derivative computation.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic interactions serve as essential probes for studying and testing our understanding of the atomic nucleus, as they reveal emergent properties across the nuclear chart. We analyse their corresponding observables, which relate to charge and current distributions in nuclei expressed through their multipole components. We focus on theoretical results obtained within nuclear density functional theory (DFT) to derive self-consistent, symmetry-restored nuclear wave functions along with their spectroscopic multipole moments. We demonstrate how these compare with experimental data. We also discuss potential improvements in the formulation of magnetic dipole operators by including two-body meson-exchange contributions. Discussions of exotic symmetry-breaking moments emphasise their importance for understanding fine details of fundamental nuclear interactions. Detailed derivations are provided in the accompanying Supplemental Material.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on (Anti-)nuclei Production with Pion-Nucleus Femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions provide a unique environment for synthesizing both nuclei and antinuclei (such as $\bar{d}$ and $\overline{^4\text{He}}$) at temperatures ($k_BT\sim100$ MeV) nearly two orders of magnitude above their binding energies of a few MeV. The underlying production mechanism, whether through statistical hadronization, nucleon coalescence, or dynamical regeneration and disintegration, remains unsettled. Here we address this question using a novel tool of pion-nucleus femtoscopy. By solving relativistic kinetic equations for pion-catalyzed reactions ($\pi NN \leftrightarrow \pi d$) for deuteron production and including a $70~\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$ downward shift of the in-medium $\Delta(1232)$ mass, we successfully reproduce the resonance peaks observed by the ALICE Collaboration in both $\pi^+-p$ and $\pi^+-d$ femtoscopic correlation functions in high-multiplicity $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13~\mathrm{TeV}$. We further find that the nucleon coalescence model reproduces only about half of the observed peak strength, while the statistical hadronization model predicts no resonance feature. These results provide compelling evidence that pion-catalyzed reactions play a dominant role in the production of light (anti-)nuclei in high-energy nuclear collisions and cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Controlled Gate Networks: Theory and Application to Eigenvalue Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13557v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new scheme for quantum circuit design called controlled gate networks. Rather than trying to reduce the complexity of individual unitary operations, the new strategy is to toggle between all of the unitary operations needed with the fewest number of gates. We present the general theory of controlled gate networks and show that, under quite general conditions, it can significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates needed to produce linear combinations of unitary operators. The first example we consider is a variational subspace calculation for a two-qubit system. The second example is estimating the eigenvalues of a two-qubit Hamiltonian via the rodeo algorithm using operators that we call controlled reversal gates. We use the Quantinuum H1-2 and IBM Perth devices to realize the quantum circuits. The third example is the application of controlled gate networks to the controlled time evolution of a free nucleon on a three-dimensional lattice. For all of the examples, we show very substantial reductions in the number of two-qubit gates required. Our work demonstrates that controlled gate networks are a useful tool for reducing gate complexity in quantum algorithms for quantum many-body problems such as those relevant to nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Precision cross-sections for advancing cosmic-ray physics and other applications: a comprehensive programme for the next decade</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray physics in the GeV-to-TeV energy range has entered a precision era thanks to recent data from space-based experiments. However, the poor knowledge of nuclear reactions, in particular for the production of antimatter and secondary nuclei, limits the information that can be extracted from these data, such as source properties, transport in the Galaxy and indirect searches for particle dark matter. The Cross-Section for Cosmic Rays at CERN workshop series has addressed the challenges encountered in the interpretation of high-precision cosmic-ray data, with the goal of strengthening emergent synergies and taking advantage of the complementarity and know-how in different communities, from theoretical and experimental astroparticle physics to high-energy and nuclear physics. In this paper, we present the outcomes of the third edition of the workshop that took place in 2024. We present the current state of cosmic-ray experiments and their perspectives, and provide a detailed road map to close the most urgent gaps in cross-section data, in order to efficiently progress on many open physics cases, which are motivated in the paper. Finally, with the aim of being as exhaustive as possible, this report touches several other fields -- such as cosmogenic studies, space radiation protection and hadrontherapy -- where overlapping and specific new cross-section measurements, as well as nuclear code improvement and benchmarking efforts, are also needed. We also briefly highlight further synergies between astroparticle and high-energy physics on the question of cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Benchmark of Proton Helicity and Flavor-Dependent Unpolarized Transverse Momentum-Dependent Parton Distribution Functions at Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculations of the isovector helicity transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) and the flavor-dependent unpolarized TMDPDFs for up and down quarks in the proton. Our computations utilize domain-wall fermion discretization with physical quark masses. Employing Coulomb-gauge-fixed quark correlation functions within the large-momentum effective theory framework, we access nonperturbative transverse quark separations $b_T$ up to approximately 1 fm, corresponding to transverse momenta as low as 200 MeV. Based on the quasi-TMD factorization theorem, we construct renormalization-group-invariant ratios that are equal to the corresponding light-cone TMDPDF ratios. At moderate $x$, our results reveal that the isovector helicity and unpolarized TMDPDFs exhibit nearly identical transverse structure up to a normalization factor, and the unpolarized distributions display only mild flavor dependence. These findings not only support key trends observed in recent global analyses but also provide robust, nonperturbative constraints that can distinguish between different parameterizations. This work establishes a first-principles benchmark for TMDPDFs, offering valuable input for ongoing and future experimental efforts to map the proton's three-dimensional structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-by-event QCD kinetic theory simulations are hindered by the large numerical cost of evaluating the high-dimensional collision integral in the Boltzmann equation. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used to obtain an accurate estimate of the collision integral in a fraction of the time required for the ordinary Monte Carlo evaluation of the integral. We demonstrate that for isotropic and anisotropic distribution functions, the network accurately predicts the time evolution of the distribution function, which we verify by performing traditional evaluations of the collision integral and comparing several moments of the distribution function. This work sets the stage for an event-by-event modeling of the pre-equilibrium initial stages in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Spin correlations and Bell nonlocality in $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ pair production from $e^+e^-$ collisions with a thrust cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of spin correlations in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ production from $e^+e^-$ annihilation, providing the theoretical predictions for the Belle II experiment. Using soft-collinear effective theory, we perform the first resummation of large logarithms for the longitudinal ($C_{LL}$) and transverse ($C_{TT}$) spin correlations for events with a cut on the thrust variable. Our calculation achieves next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and incorporates the determination of polarized fragmenting jet functions. This framework provides robust predictions with significantly reduced theoretical uncertainties compared to fixed-order parton model approaches. Furthermore, we establish a direct mapping between the experimentally accessible spin correlation, $C_{TT}$, and a testable CHSH-Bell inequality. This result reframes $C_{TT}$ as a quantitative probe of quantum decoherence, providing a novel tool to measure the degree of parton-level entanglement that survives the fragmentation and hadronization process.</description>

      <title>Correlation function for the $n \bar{D}_{s0}^*(2317)$ interaction and the issue of elastic unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a neutron with the $\bar D_{s0}^*(2317)$ resonance and look at the amplitude below threshold and close above threshold. The study is done from the perspective that the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ resonance is a molecular state of $DK$ in $I=0$. To study this interaction, we use the Fixed Center Approximation to Faddeev equations that considers the $DK$ molecule as the cluster and the neutron as the external particle. We improve the Fixed Center approach to implement elastic unitarity around threshold, which is needed to obtain scattering parameters and to evaluate the $n \bar D_{s0}^*(2317)$ correlation function that we determine here. One interesting result of the study is the appearance of a resonant state below threshold with a binding of about 130 MeV and a width of about 80 MeV, which we suggest to look at in reactions measuring the invariant mass of $\pi \Sigma \bar D$. The ALICE collaboration has initiated studies of this type, by looking at the $p f_1(1285)$ correlation function, and we can only encourage work in this direction which should provide much valuable information on the nature of many resonant states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nuclear gamma decays and $\gamma$-emitting reactions that can be an efficient source of hypothetical millicharged particles ($\chi$). In particular, we revisit the production of millicharged particles in nuclear reactor environment, pointing out that $\gamma$ cascades from $^{239}$U is an overlooked yet a powerful source of $\chi\bar\chi$ pairs. This leads to an increased flux compared to previous studies. We then apply new estimates of the flux to derive novel limits on the value of millicharge, $\varepsilon = Q_\chi/e$, from the electron recoil searched for in a variety of experiments placed in proximity to the reactor cores. The derived limits on $\varepsilon$ are the strongest in the interval of masses $\sim 0.7-2 $\,MeV. We also derive the MCP flux from the Sun and point out potential sensitivity of the low-threshold dark matter search experiments.</description>

Abstract: A direct comparison and analysis of published spectra for the 7$\alpha$ disassembly of $^{28}$Si projectiles excited in collisions with $^{12}$C at 35 MeV/u reveals significant agreement in the derived excitation energies of high excitation energy resonances observed in two different experiments, in contrast to some earlier conclusions reported in the literature. Many of the observed resonances have excitation energies consistent with those arrived at in recent theoretical investigations explicitly predicting the excitation energies and spins of toroidal nuclei. An AI-assisted application of well-established statistical filtering techniques reveals identical structures in all spectra investigated. Some additional peaks are observed. The possibility that they correspond to other favored geometries is discussed.</description>

      <title>Initial-state geometry and multiplicity distributions in pp and pPb collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the possibility of accessing the initial geometric shape of the proton in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC, in particular the configuration in which the proton is made of three quarks linked by a Y-shape gluon string, called baryon junction. This initial state spatial configuration has been used in the past to describe data on baryon rapidity distributions, diffractive $J/\psi$ production and multiplicity distributions in pp collisions. In spite of its success in explaining the data, the evidence of the baryon junction still needs confirmation. Further studies will be undertaken at the electron-ion collider. In this work we study multiplicity distributions measured in pp and pPb collisions. Different initial state geometries are used as input in a Monte Carlo event generator which implements the $k_T$-factorization formalism of the CGC with KLN unintegrated gluon distributions. The results indicate that the hard-sphere and Gaussian proton configurations are incompatible with the data. In contrast, the baryon junction configuration can describe the data provided that intrinsic fluctuations of the saturation scale are included.</description>

      <title>Unified Resummation of Soft Gluon Radiation in Heavy Meson Pair Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified resummation framework for heavy-meson pair photoproduction that treats soft-gluon radiation in a massive scheme for $|\boldsymbol q| \lesssim m_Q$ and is consistent with the massless limit $m_Q \ll |\boldsymbol q|$, where $\boldsymbol q$ denotes the transverse momentum of the pair and $m_Q$ the quark mass. This framework describes the full correlation regime $|\boldsymbol q| \ll |\boldsymbol P|$, with $\boldsymbol P$ the pair's relative transverse momentum. Next, within the Color Glass Condensate framework, we quantify the impact of soft gluon radiation on two important phenomenological observables, namely, the azimuthal $\Delta\phi$ correlation and the harmonic asymmetries $\langle \cos(2n\phi_{qP})\rangle$. Our results show that the resummation provides an excellent description of the H1 $\Delta\phi$ data. We then find that the angular-asymmetry harmonics are sizable and their ratios in $\gamma A$ to $\gamma p$ collisions are highly sensitive to gluon saturation. We further find a clear mass hierarchy in both observables, indicating that heavy-quark masses suppress soft radiation and thereby enhance genuine small-$x$ saturation signals. Our work demonstrates that heavy-quark pair photoproduction provides a quantitative probe of gluon saturation, directly measurable in forthcoming EIC and UPC measurements. Finally, the unified resummation is readily extendable to other processes involving massive particles and jets in both $eA$ and $pA$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadronic $\tau$ decays present an opportunity to determine the isovector part of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in a way complementary to $e^+e^-\to\text{hadrons}$ cross sections. However, the required isospin rotation is only exact in the isospin limit, and corrections need to be under control to draw robust conclusions, most notably for $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ decays to determine the two-pion contribution, $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$. In this work, we present a novel analysis of the required radiative corrections using dispersion relations, thereby extending in a model-independent way the previous analysis in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) beyond the threshold region. In particular, we include the dominant structure-dependent virtual corrections from pion-pole diagrams, leading to sizable changes in the vicinity of the $\rho(770)$ resonance. Moreover, we work out the matching to ChPT and devise a strategy for a stable numerical evaluation of real-emission contributions near the two-pion threshold, which proves important to capture isospin-breaking corrections enhanced by the threshold singularity. For the numerical analysis, we use a dispersive representation of the pion form factor including the $\rho'$, $\rho''$ resonances, perform fits to the available data sets for the $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ spectral function, and calculate the corresponding radiative correction factor $G_\text{EM}(s)$ in a self-consistent manner. Based on these results, we evaluate the $\tau$-specific isospin-breaking corrections to $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$.</description>
