      <title>Hyperchaos and complex dynamical regimes in $N$-dimensional neuron lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of $N$-dimensional lattices of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons coupled with a flow of electrical current. We consider both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, homogeneous and heterogeneous neurons, and small and large lattices over a wide range of electrical coupling strengths. As the coupling strength is varied, the neurons exhibit a number of complex dynamical regimes, including unsynchronized chaotic spiking, local quasi-bursting, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical effects arising from the ``destructive interference'' of many connected neurons and miniature ``phase transitions'' from coordinated spiking threshold crossings. In large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent dynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag synchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from coupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how dimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective behavior of neuronal systems.</description>

      <title>Robust methods to detect coupling among nonlinear dynamic time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11252v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two numerical methods are proposed for detection of coupling between multiple time series generated by deterministic nonlinear systems. The first detects interdependence or the existence of coupling between time series. The second ascertains directionality of coupling, or alternatively, latent coupling, the case when multiple series are driven by another, unobserved system. In either case, the driver and the recipients of the coupling may be periodic or aperiodic, and in particular may be chaotic. The only inputs to the method are two or more simultaneously recorded time series. The methods rely solely on ranking distances between states in time-delay reconstructions of the data, and for that reason tend to be robust to observational noise.</description>

      <title>Relativistically Magnetized Collisionless Shocks in Pair Plasma: I. Solitons, Chaos, and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the first in a series, we present a new theoretical model for the global structure and dissipation of relativistically magnetized collisionless shock waves. Quite remarkably, we find that in contrast to unmagnetized shocks, the leading energy dissipation channel does not involve collective plasma interactions. Rather, it is a consequence of nonlinear particle dynamics. We demonstrate that the kinetic-scale shock transition can be modeled as a stationary system consisting of a large set of cold beams coupled through the magnetic field. The fundamental mechanism governing shock dissipation relies on the onset of chaos in orbital dynamics within quasiperiodic solitonic structures. We discuss the impact of upstream temperature and magnetization on the shock profile, recovering the magnetic field compression, downstream velocities, and heating expected from the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. We deduce a rate of entropy generation from the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents and discuss the thermalization of the beam distribution. Our model provides a general framework to study magnetized collisionless shock structures.</description>
