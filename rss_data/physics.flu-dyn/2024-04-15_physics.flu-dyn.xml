      <title>Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability at high Mach Number: Non-Newtonian Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) occurs when a shock wave passes through an interface between fluids of different densities, a phenomenon prevalent in a variety of scenarios including supersonic combustion, supernovae, and inertial confinement fusion. In the most advanced current numerical modelling of RMI, a multitude of secondary physical phenomena are typically neglected that may crucially change in silico predictions. In this study, we investigate the effects of shear-thinning behaviour of a fluid on the RMI at negative Atwood numbers via numerical simulations. A parametric study is carried out over a wide range of Atwood and Mach numbers that probes the flow dynamics following the impact on the interface of the initial shock wave and subsequent, reflected shocks. We demonstrate agreement between our numerical results and analytical predictions, which are valid during the early stages of the flow, and examine the effect of the system parameters on the vorticity distribution near the interface. We also carry out an analysis of the rate of vorticity production and dissipation budget which pinpoints the physical mechanisms leading to instability due to the initial and reflected shocks. Our findings indicate that the shear-thinning effects have a significant impact on instability growth and the development of secondary instabilities, which manifest themselves through the formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves. Specifically, we demonstrate that these effects influence vorticity generation and damping, which, in turn, affect the RMI growth. These insights have important implications for a range of applications, including inertial confinement fusion and bubble collapse within non-Newtonian materials.</description>

      <title>Minimization Principle for Analytical Solution of Turbulent Flow in Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical solution for turbulent flow in channel presented in Fedoseyev (2023), described the mean turbulent flow velocity as a superposition of the laminar (parabolic) and turbulent (superexponential) solutions. In this study, the coefficients of superposition are proposed to obtain through the minimization principle, the principle of minimum viscous dissipation. The obtained analytical solutions agree well with the experimental data for turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>On the Control of a Leading-Edge Vortex &amp; its Liftoff on a Cranked, Swept Back Wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines flow over a cranked {\lambda}-wing model with a sweep of {\Lambda}=60{\deg} of the inboard leading edge (LE) that changed to {\Lambda}=30{\deg} outboard of the crank. The study focuses on the liftoff of the inboard Leading-Edge Vortex (LEV) and its influence over the flow on the outer wing. Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) indicates that the flow is largely separated and dominated by strong outboard spanwise flow at {\alpha}=14{\deg}. The separation is mitigated by a small, steady supersonic jet that interacted with the lifted vortex and changed the pitch characteristic of the entire model. The use of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) revealed the unsteadiness of the separated structures that may cause wing flutter.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulations of microlayer formation during heterogeneous bubble nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present direct numerical simulation results for the expansion of spherical cap bubbles attached to a rigid wall due to a sudden drop in the ambient pressure. The critical pressure drop beyond which the bubble growth becomes unstable is found to match well with the predictions from classical theory of heterogeneous nucleation imposing a quasi-static bubble evolution. When the pressure drop is significantly higher than the critical value, a liquid microlayer appears between the bubble and the wall. In this regime, the interface outside the microlayer grows at an asymptotic velocity that can be predicted from the Rayleigh--Plesset equation, while the contact line evolves with another asymptotic velocity that scales with a visco-capillary velocity that obeys the Cox--Voinov law. In general, three distinctive regions can be distinguished: the region very close to the contact line where dynamics is governed by visco-capillary effects, an intermediate region controlled by inertio-viscous effects away from the contact line yet inside the viscous boundary layer, and the region outside the boundary layer dominated by inertial effects. The microlayer forms in a regime where the capillary effects are confined in a region much smaller than the viscous boundary layer thickness. In this regime, the global capillary number takes values much larger then the critical capillary number for bubble nucleation, and the microlayer height is controlled by viscous effects and not surface tension.</description>

      <title>PiRD: Physics-informed Residual Diffusion for Flow Field Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning in fluid dynamics is becoming more common to expedite the computation when solving forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations. Yet, a notable challenge with existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods for data fidelity enhancement is their reliance on specific low-fidelity data patterns and distributions during the training phase. In addition, the CNN-based method essentially treats the flow reconstruction task as a computer vision task that prioritizes the element-wise precision which lacks a physical and mathematical explanation. This dependence can dramatically affect the models' effectiveness in real-world scenarios, especially when the low-fidelity input deviates from the training data or contains noise not accounted for during training. The introduction of diffusion models in this context shows promise for improving performance and generalizability. Unlike direct mapping from a specific low-fidelity to a high-fidelity distribution, diffusion models learn to transition from any low-fidelity distribution towards a high-fidelity one. Our proposed model - Physics-informed Residual Diffusion, demonstrates the capability to elevate the quality of data from both standard low-fidelity inputs, to low-fidelity inputs with injected Gaussian noise, and randomly collected samples. By integrating physics-based insights into the objective function, it further refines the accuracy and the fidelity of the inferred high-quality data. Experimental results have shown that our approach can effectively reconstruct high-quality outcomes for two-dimensional turbulent flows from a range of low-fidelity input conditions without requiring retraining.</description>

      <title>Transitions near the onset of stationary rotating magnetoconvection: role of magnetic Prandtl number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the instabilities and associated bifurcation structure near the onset of rotating magnetoconvection of low Prandtl number fluids by performing three dimensional direct numerical simulations. Previous studies considered zero magnetic Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pm}$) limit for the investigation of bifurcation structure near the onset of convection. Here we numerically investigate the effect of $\mathrm{Pm}$ on the bifurcation structure. The classical Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection setup in the presence of horizontal magnetic field and rotation about the vertical axis are considered for the study. The control parameters, including the Taylor number ($\mathrm{Ta}$), Chandrasekhar number ($\mathrm{Q}$), reduced Rayleigh number ($\mathrm{r}$), and magnetic Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pm}$) are varied in the ranges $0 &lt; \mathrm{Ta}\leq 500$, $0 &lt; \mathrm{Q}\leq 1000$, $0.8\leq \mathrm{r} \leq 2$ and $0 &lt; \mathrm{Pm} &lt; 1$ by considering Prandtl numbers $\mathrm{Pr}= 0.025$ and $0.1$. The investigation reveals the presence of supercritical, subcritical and hybrid transitions to convection. These transitions leads to infinitesimal and finite amplitude fluid patterns at the onset of convection. The finite amplitude solutions can be both stationary and time dependent. The bifurcation structures associated with these flow patterns at the onset are studied in detail. For very small $\mathrm{Pm}$, the bifurcation structure is found to be qualitatively similar to the ones observed in the $\mathrm{Pm}\rightarrow 0$ limit. However, as $\mathrm{Pm}$ is increased, several new solutions appear at the onset and the resulting bifurcation structures are greatly modified.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stabilization of an oscillating flow with LTI controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents advances towards the data-based control of periodic oscillator flows, from their fully-developed regime to their equilibrium stabilized in closed-loop, with linear time-invariant (LTI) controllers. The proposed approach directly builds upon Leclercq et al. (2019) and provides several improvements for an efficient online implementation, aimed at being applicable in experiments. First, we use input-output data to construct an LTI mean transfer functions of the flow. The model is subsequently used for the design of an LTI controller with Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) synthesis, that is practical to automate online. Then, using the controller in a feedback loop, the flow shifts in phase space and oscillations are damped. The procedure is repeated until equilibrium is reached, by stacking controllers and performing balanced truncation to deal with the increasing order of the compound controller. In this article, we illustrate the method on the classic flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re=100. Care has been taken such that the method may be fully automated and hopefully used as a valuable tool in a forthcoming experiment.</description>

      <title>Advancing aortic stenosis assessment: validation of fluid-structure interaction models against 4D flow MRI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic in vivo validations of computational models of the aortic valve remain scarce, despite successful validation against in vitro data. Utilizing a combination of computed tomography and 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging data, we developed patient-specific fluid-structure interaction models of the aortic valve immersed in the aorta for five patients in the pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement configuration. Incorporating also an in vitro setup of the valve, our computational models are subjected to rigorous validation against 4D flow measurements. Our results demonstrate the models' capacity to accurately replicate flow dynamics within established ranges of uncertainties mainly arising from 4D flow noise. In addition, we illustrate how computational models can serve as valuable cross-checks to reduce noise and erratic behaviour of in vivo data. This study represents a significant step towards integrating in silico technologies into real clinical contexts, providing a robust framework for improving aortic stenosis diagnosis and the design of next-generation aortic valve bioprostheses.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning of Range-Dependent Transmission Loss for Underwater Acoustic using Conditional Convolutional Neural Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a significant need for precise and reliable forecasting of the far-field noise emanating from shipping vessels. Conventional full-order models based on the Navier-Stokes equations are unsuitable, and sophisticated model reduction methods may be ineffective for accurately predicting far-field noise in environments with seamounts and significant variations in bathymetry. Recent advances in reduced-order models, particularly those based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks, offer a faster and more accurate alternative. These models use convolutional neural networks to reduce data dimensions effectively. However, current deep-learning models face challenges in predicting wave propagation over long periods and for remote locations, often relying on auto-regressive prediction and lacking far-field bathymetry information. This research aims to improve the accuracy of deep-learning models for predicting underwater radiated noise in far-field scenarios. We propose a novel range-conditional convolutional neural network that incorporates ocean bathymetry data into the input. By integrating this architecture into a continual learning framework, we aim to generalize the model for varying bathymetry worldwide. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we analyze our model on several test cases and a benchmark scenario involving far-field prediction over Dickin's seamount in the Northeast Pacific. Our proposed architecture effectively captures transmission loss over a range-dependent, varying bathymetry profile. This architecture can be integrated into an adaptive management system for underwater radiated noise, providing real-time end-to-end mapping between near-field ship noise sources and received noise at the marine mammal's location.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experiment on forced convection where a previously heated object is cooled under the effect of a controlled stream of air. We consider a square copper plate in which temperature variations can be considered negligible and we measure the cooling rate as a function of the average velocity of the air stream. We use a thermal camera to measure the temperature field and the cooling curves as a function of time for different conditions. An empirical relation between the characteristic cooling time and the mean velocity of the air stream is reported. The results obtained are discussed in the framework of simple dimensional models and their limits of validity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum methods for solving differential equations that are based on a gradual improvement of the solution via an iterative process, and are targeted at applications in fluid dynamics. First, we implement the Jacobi iteration on a quantum register that utilizes a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) approach to store the trajectory information. Second, we extend quantum methods to Gauss-Seidel iterative methods. Additionally, we propose a quantum-suitable resolvent decomposition based on the Woodbury identity. From a technical perspective, we develop and utilize tools for the block encoding of specific matrices as well as their multiplication. We benchmark the approach on paradigmatic fluid dynamics problems. Our results stress that instead of inverting large matrices, one can program quantum computers to perform multigrid-type computations and leverage corresponding advances in scientific computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use video footage of a water tunnel experiment to construct a two-dimensional reduced-order model of the flapping dynamics of an inverted flag in uniform flow. The model is obtained as the reduced dynamics on an attracting spectral submanifold (SSM) that emanates from the two slowest modes of the unstable fixed point of the flag. Beyond an unstable fixed point and a limit cycle expected from observations, our SSM-reduced model also confirms the existence of two unstable fixed points for the flag, which were found by previous studies. Importantly, the model correctly reconstructs the dynamics from a small number of general trajectories and no further information on the system. In the chaotic flapping regime, we construct a 4D SSM-reduced model that captures the system's chaotic attractor.</description>

      <title>Eulerian Formulation of the Tensor-Based Morphology Equations for Strain-Based Blood Damage Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of blood-handling medical devices, such as ventricular assist devices, requires the analysis of their biocompatibility. Among other aspects, this includes hemolysis, i.e., red blood cell damage. For this purpose, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are employed to predict blood flow in prototypes. The most basic hemolysis models directly estimate red blood cell damage from fluid stress in the resulting flow field. More advanced models explicitly resolve cell deformation. On the downside, these models are typically written in a Lagrangian formulation, i.e., they require pathline tracking. We present a new Eulerian description of cell deformation, enabling the evaluation of the solution across the whole domain. The resulting hemolysis model can be applied to any converged CFD simulation due to one-way coupling with the fluid velocity field. We discuss the efficient numerical treatment of the model equations in a stabilized finite element context. We verify the model by comparison to the original Lagrangian formulation in selected benchmark flows. Two more complex test cases demonstrate the method's capabilities in real-world applications. The results highlight the advantages over previous hemolysis models. In conclusion, the model holds great potential for the design process of future generations of medical devices.</description>

      <title>Spectral effects of radiating gases on the ignition in a multiswirl staged model combustor using full-spectrum k distribution method -- A Large Eddy Simulation Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiative heat transfer has been proven to be important during the ignition process in gas turbine. Those radiating gases (CO2, H2O, CO) generated during combustion may display strong spectral, or nongray behavior, which is difficult to both characterize and calculate. In this work, both the full-spectrum k-distribution (FSK) and weighted-sum-of-gray-gases (WSGG) method, along with the Dynamic-thickened-flame (DTF) and Large-Eddy-Simulation (LES) methods, are used to analyze how spectral behavior affects the ignition process in an experimental gas turbine. Results show that radiation affects the ignition process by heating the relatively low temperature regions. Consequently, each ignition phase is differently affected by different spectral treatments. During the initial kernel phase, spectral properties have minimal influence on flame structures and the ignition delay time due to the negligible radiation and optically-thin scenario. However, during the flame growth phase, significant differences appear in the flame structure and the flame propagation speed among different spectral treatments. After the flame fill the combustor and during the stable combustion phase, differences in flame structures calculated by different models become less, but radiation still play an important role in combustion. Therefore, high-fidelity spectral models are recommended during the modelling of the ignition process in the gas turbine.</description>

      <title>On the mass transfer in the 3D Pitaevskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a micro-scale model of superfluidity derived by Pitaevskii in 1959 which describes the interacting dynamics between superfluid He-4 and its normal fluid phase. This system consists of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the incompressible, inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations, coupled to each other via a bidirectional nonlinear relaxation mechanism. The coupling permits mass/momentum/energy transfer between the phases, and accounts for the conversion of superfluid into normal fluid. We prove the existence of weak solutions in $\mathbb{T}^3$ for a power-type nonlinearity, beginning from small initial data. The main challenge is to control the inter-phase mass transfer in order to ensure the strict positivity of the normal fluid density, while obtaining time-independent a priori estimates.</description>
