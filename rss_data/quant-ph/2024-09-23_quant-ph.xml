      <title>Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems on a Photonic Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems pose significant computational challenges across various fields, from logistics to cryptography. Traditional computational methods often struggle with their exponential complexity, motivating exploration into alternative paradigms such as quantum computing. In this paper, we investigate the application of photonic quantum computing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, we demonstrate how photonic quantum computers can efficiently explore solution spaces and identify optimal solutions for a range of combinatorial problems. We provide an overview of quantum algorithms tailored for combinatorial optimization for different quantum architectures (boson sampling, quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing). Additionally, we discuss the advantages and challenges of implementing those algorithms on photonic quantum hardware. Through experiments run on an 8-qumode photonic quantum device, as well as numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of photonic quantum computers in solving representative combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Max-Cut problem and the Job Shop Scheduling Problem.</description>

      <title>Quantum evolutionary algorithm for TSP combinatorial optimisation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper implements a new way of solving a problem called the traveling salesman problem (TSP) using quantum genetic algorithm (QGA). We compared how well this new approach works to the traditional method known as a classical genetic algorithm (CGA). The TSP is a well-established challenge in combinatorial optimization where the objective is to find the most efficient path to visit a series of cities, minimizing the total distance, and returning to the starting point. We chose the TSP to test the performance of both algorithms because of its computational complexity and importance in practical applications. We choose the dataset from the international standard library TSPLIB for our experiments. By designing and implementing both algorithms and conducting experiments on various sizes and types of TSP instances, we provide an in-depth analysis of the accuracy of the optimal solution, the number of iterations, the execution time, and the stability of the algorithms for both. The empirical findings indicate that the CGA outperforms the QGA in terms of finding superior solutions more quickly in most of the test instances, especially when the problem size is large. This suggests that although the principle of quantum computing provides a new way to solve complex combinatorial optimisation problems, the implementation of quantum phenomena and the setting of parameters such as the optimal angle for a quantum revolving gate is challenging and need further optimisation to achieve the desired results. Additionally, it is important to note that the QGA has not been tested on real quantum hardware, so its true performance remains unverified. These limitations provide rich opportunities for further research in the future.</description>

      <title>Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulability of Quantum Circuits with Shallow Magic Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magic is a resource that allows quantum computation to surpass classical simulation. Previous results have linked the amount of quantum magic, characterized by the number of $T$ gates or stabilizer rank, to classical simulability. However, the effect of the distribution of quantum magic on the hardness of simulating a quantum circuit remains open. In this work, we investigate the classical simulability of quantum circuits with alternating Clifford and $T$ layers across three tasks: amplitude estimation, sampling, and evaluating Pauli observables. In the case where all $T$ gates are distributed in a single layer, performing amplitude estimation and sampling to multiplicative error are already classically intractable under reasonable assumptions, but Pauli observables are easy to evaluate. Surprisingly, with the addition of just one $T$ gate layer or merely replacing all $T$ gates with $T^{\frac{1}{2}}$, the Pauli evaluation task reveals a sharp complexity transition from P to GapP-complete. Nevertheless, when the precision requirement is relaxed to 1/poly($n$) additive error, we are able to give a polynomial time classical algorithm to compute amplitudes, Pauli observable, and sampling from $\log(n)$ sized marginal distribution for any magic-depth-one circuit that is decomposable into a product of diagonal gates. Our research provides new techniques to simulate highly magical circuits while shedding light on their complexity and their significant dependence on the magic depth.</description>

      <title>Fermion and Boson Pairs in Beamsplitters and MZIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short Topical Review, we look at something typically considered trivial, but not given formally elsewhere -- the behaviour of first multiple fermions then multiple bosons at a beamsplitter, and, extending from this, the behaviour of multiple fermions and multiple bosons in Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs). We hope that by showing how to go from mathematically-simple but unintuitive quantum field theory to a phenomenological description, this Review will help researchers and students in the field build a stronger intuition for the behaviour of quantum particles.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo for Economics: Stress Testing and Macroeconomic Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational methods both open the frontiers of economic analysis and serve as a bottleneck in what can be achieved. We are the first to study whether Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm can improve the runtime of economic applications and challenges in doing so. We provide a detailed introduction to quantum computing and especially the QMC algorithm. Then, we illustrate how to formulate and encode into quantum circuits (a) a bank stress testing model with credit shocks and fire sales, (b) a neoclassical investment model solved with deep learning, and (c) a realistic macro model solved with deep neural networks. We discuss potential computational gains of QMC versus classical computing systems and present a few innovations in benchmarking QMC.</description>

      <title>A coherent approach to quantum-classical optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical optimization techniques, which incorporate the pre-optimization of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) using Tensor Networks (TNs), have been shown to allow for the reduction of quantum computational resources. In the particular case of large optimization problems, commonly found in real-world use cases, this strategy is almost mandatory to reduce the otherwise unfathomable execution costs and improve the quality of the results. We identify the coherence entropy as a crucial metric in determining the suitability of quantum states as effective initialization candidates. Our findings are validated through extensive numerical tests for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), in which we find that the optimal initialization states are pure Gibbs states. Further, these results are explained with the inclusion of a simple and yet novel notion of expressivity adapted to classical optimization problems. Based on this finding, we propose a quantum-classical optimization protocol that significantly improves on previous approaches for such tasks, with specific focus on its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Galvanically connected tunable coupler between a cavity and a waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key technologies in recent quantum devices is the tunable coupling among quantum elements such as qubits, cavities, and waveguides. In this work, we propose a cavity-waveguide tunable coupler with an excellent on-off ratio, which is realized in a semi-infinite waveguide equipped with a tunable stub. The working principle of the present device is the shift of the node position of the cavity mode induced by the tunable boundary condition at the stub end. When the node position is adjusted to the branch point of the waveguide, the cavity mode becomes decoupled from the waveguide modes in principle. At the same time, owing to the galvanic connection, the present device readily achieves an ultrastrong cavity-waveguide coupling, where the cavity decay rate is comparable to the cavity resonance frequency.</description>

      <title>Robust Single-Photon Generation for Quantum Information Enabled by Stimulated Adiabatic Rapid Passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of single photons using solid-state quantum emitters is pivotal for advancing photonic quantum technologies, particularly in quantum communication. As the field continuously advances towards practical use cases and beyond shielded laboratory environments, specific demands are placed on the robustness of quantum light sources during operation. In this context, the robustness of the quantum light generation process against intrinsic and extrinsic effects is a major challenge. Here, we present a robust scheme for the coherent generation of indistinguishable single-photon states with very low photon number coherence (PNC) using a three-level system in a semiconductor quantum dot. Our novel approach combines the advantages of adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) and stimulated two-photon excitation (sTPE). We demonstrate robust quantum light generation while maintaining the prime quantum-optical quality of the emitted light state. Moreover, we highlight the immediate advantages for the implementation of various quantum cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>Super-Heisenberg scaling in a triple point criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum-enhanced metrology in a triple point criticality and discover that quantum criticality can not always enhance measuring precision. We have developed suitable adiabatic evolution protocols approaching a final point around the triple point to effectively restrain excitations, which could accelerate the adiabatic evolutions and lead to an exponential super-Heisenberg scaling. This scaling behavior is quite valuable in practical parameter estimating experiments with limited coherence time. The super-Heisenberg scaling will degrade into a sub-Heisenberg scaling if the adiabatic parameter modulations adopted can not reduce excitations and weaken the slowing down effect. Additionally, a feasible experimental scheme is also suggested to achieve the anticipated exponential super-Heisenberg scaling. Our findings strongly indicate that criticality-enhanced metrology can indeed significantly enhance measuring precision to a super-Heisenberg scaling when combining a triple point and beneficial parameter modulations in the adiabatic evolution, which will be conducive to the exploration of other super-Heisenberg scaling and their applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced stratification of Breast Cancer: exploring quantum expressivity for real omics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is considered one of the most promising applications of Quantum Computing in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era for the impact it is thought to have in the near future. Although promising theoretical assumptions, the exploration of how QML could foster new discoveries in Medicine and Biology fields is still in its infancy with few examples. In this study, we aimed to assess whether Quantum Kernels (QK) could effectively classify subtypes of Breast Cancer (BC) patients on the basis of molecular characteristics. We performed an heuristic exploration of encoding configurations with different entanglement levels to determine a trade-off between kernel expressivity and performances. Our results show that QKs yield comparable clustering results with classical methods while using fewer data points, and are able to fit the data with a higher number of clusters. Additionally, we conducted the experiments on the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) to evaluate the effect of noise on the outcome. We found that less expressive encodings showed a higher resilience to noise, indicating that the computational pipeline can be reliably implemented on the NISQ devices. Our findings suggest that QK methods show promises for application in Precision Oncology, especially in scenarios where the dataset is limited in size and a granular non-trivial stratification of complex molecular data cannot be achieved classically.</description>

      <title>Data Management in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising tool for transforming the landscape of computing technology. Recent efforts have applied quantum techniques to classical database challenges, such as query optimization, data integration, index selection, and transaction management. In this paper, we shift focus to a critical yet underexplored area: data management for quantum computing. We are currently in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where qubits, while promising, are fragile and still limited in scale. After differentiating quantum data from classical data, we outline current and future data management paradigms in the NISQ era and beyond. We address the data management challenges arising from the emerging demands of near-term quantum computing. Our goal is to chart a clear course for future quantum-oriented data management research, establishing it as a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum computing in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Enhancing One-Way Steering and Non-Classical Correlations in Magnomechanics via Coherent Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a theoretical scheme to explore the enhancement of quantum correlation hierarchies in a cavity magnonmechanical system via the coherent feedback tool. We use Gaussian geometric discord to quantify quantum correlations between the two magnon modes, including those beyond entanglement, in the steady state. Logarithmic negativity and Gaussian quantum steering are employed to characterize entanglement and steerability, respectively. Our results show that adjusting the beam splitter's reflective parameter can significantly enhance quantum correlations and increase their resilience to thermal noise. Moreover, we demonstrate that coherent feedback can achieve enhanced genuine tripartite entanglement among the photon, magnon \(M_1\), and phonon. These findings present promising strategies for enhancing entanglement in magnon-based systems and advancing quantum information technologies. We conclude by validating the system and demonstrating its ability to detect entanglement.</description>

      <title>Universal and complete extraction for energy-invariant catalysis in quantum batteries versus no uncorrelated state-invariant catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of catalysts in energy extraction from quantum batteries. Two basic classes of catalysts are proposed in this regard, viz., energy- and state-invariant catalysts. Moreover, we separately consider cases when the catalysts are or are not correlated with the battery, in the final output. For energy extraction, we restrict to unitaries which jointly act on the battery and the catalyst. Total extraction via energy-invariant catalysis: We demonstrate that in presence of an energy-invariant catalyst, having the same dimension as the battery, all stored energy of the battery can always be extracted, transforming the battery into its ground state, when an appropriate joint unitary and catalyst state are employed. Additionally, we offer a necessary and sufficient condition of passivity for energy extraction from quantum batteries, considering arbitrary but fixed state of energy-invariant catalysts. Focusing on state-invariant catalysts, we first prove a no-go theorem, viz. there are no uncorrelated state-invariant catalysts that can provide more extraction of energy than ergotropy, and this is valid for an arbitrary-dimensional battery. Does there exist a corresponding no-go result for correlated state-invariant catalysts? Yes, we have found its existence for single-qubit batteries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the greatest debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for (ii) and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. The purity loss for a free quantum particle is evaluated and shown to be extremely inefficient for elementary particles but very effective for those at the Planck scale. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would easily leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing could impact various industries, with the automotive industry with many computational challenges, from optimizing supply chains and manufacturing to vehicle engineering, being particularly promising. This chapter investigates state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across the automotive value chain. We explore recent advances in quantum optimization, machine learning, and numerical and chemistry simulations, highlighting their potential and limitations. We identify and discuss key challenges in near-term and fault-tolerant algorithms and their practical use in industrial applications. While quantum algorithms show potential in many application domains, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware limits scale and, thus, business benefits. In the long term, fault-tolerant systems promise theoretical speedups; however, they also require further progress in hardware and software (e.\,g., related to error correction and data loading). We expect that with this progress, significant practical benefits will emerge eventually.</description>

      <title>Flag Proxy Networks: Tackling the Architectural, Scheduling, and Decoding Obstacles of Quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is necessary for achieving exponential speedups on important applications. The planar surface code has remained the most studied error-correcting code for the last two decades because of its relative simplicity. However, encoding a singular logical qubit with the planar surface code requires physical qubits quadratic in the code distance~($d$), making it space-inefficient for the large-distance codes necessary for promising applications. Thus, {\em Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC)} have emerged as an alternative to the planar surface code but require a higher degree of connectivity. Furthermore, the problems of fault-tolerant syndrome extraction and decoding are understudied for these codes and also remain obstacles to their usage.
  In this paper, we consider two under-studied families of QLDPC codes: hyperbolic surface codes and hyperbolic color codes. We tackle the three challenges mentioned above as follows. {\em First}, we propose {\em Flag-Proxy Networks (FPNs)}, a generalizable architecture for quantum codes that achieves low connectivity through flag and proxy qubits. {\em Second}, we propose a {\em greedy syndrome extraction scheduling} algorithm for general quantum codes and further use this algorithm for fault-tolerant syndrome extraction on FPNs. {\em Third}, we present two decoders that leverage flag measurements to decode the hyperbolic codes accurately. Our work finds that degree-4 FPNs of the hyperbolic surface and color codes are respectively $2.9\times$ and $5.5\times$ more space-efficient than the $d = 5$ planar surface code, and become even more space-efficient when considering higher distances. The hyperbolic codes also have error rates comparable to their planar counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a heralded single photon source which is based on the photon pairs generated from pulse pumped spontaneous four wave mixing in a piece of commercially available dispersion shifted fiber. The single photon source at 1550 nm telecom band is characterized with both photon counting technique and homodyne detection method. The heralding efficiency and mode purity can be measured by photon counting while the vacuum contribution part can be found by homodyne detection.</description>

      <title>Information acquisition, scrambling, and sensitivity to errors in quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signatures of chaos can be understood by studying quantum systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic. However, the concepts of integrability, non-integrability and chaos extend to systems without a classical analogue. Here, we first review the classical route from order into chaos. Since nature is fundamentally quantum, we discuss how chaos manifests in the quantum domain. We briefly describe semi-classical methods, and discuss the consequences of chaos in quantum information processing. We review the quantum version of Lyapunov exponents, as quantified by the out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOC), Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy and sensitivity to errors. We then review the study of signatures of quantum chaos using quantum tomography. Classically, if we know the dynamics exactly, as we maintain a constant coarse-grained tracking of the trajectory, we gain exponentially fine-grained information about the initial condition. In the quantum setting,as we track the measurement record with fixed signal-to-noise, we gain increasing information about the initial condition. In the process, we have given a new quantification of operator spreading in Krylov subspaces with quantum state reconstruction. The study of these signatures is not only of theoretical interest but also of practical importance.</description>

      <title>On the extreme points of sets of absolulely separable and PPT states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absolutely separable (resp. PPT) states remain separable (resp. positive partial transpose) under any global unitary operation. We present a compact form of the extreme points in the sets of absolutely separable states and PPT states in two-qubit and qubit-qudit systems. The results imply that each extreme point has at most three distinct eigenvalues. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for determining extreme points of the set of absolutely PPT states in two-qutrit and qutrit-qudit systems, expressed as solvable linear equations. We also demonstrate that any extreme point in qutrit-qudit system has at most seven distinct eigenvalues. We introduce the concept of robustness of nonabsolute separability. It quantifies the minimal amount by which a state needs to mix with other states such that the overall state is absolutely separable. We show that the robustness satisfies positivity, invariance under unitary transformation, monotonicity and convexity, so it is a good measure within the resource theory of nonabsolute separability. Analytical expressions for this measure are given for pure states in arbitrary system and rank-two mixed states in two-qubit system.</description>

      <title>Scattering of TE and TM waves and quantum dynamics generated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the scattering of electromagnetic waves by a linear isotropic medium with planar symmetry can be reduced to that of their TE and TM modes. For situations where the medium consists of parallel homogeneous slabs, one may use the standard transfer matrix technique to address the scattering problem for these modes. We extend the utility of this technique to inhomogeneous permittivity and permeability profiles by proposing a dynamical formulation of the scattering of TE and TM waves in which the transfer matrix for the medium is given in terms of the evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. This leads to a system of dynamical equations for the reflection and transmission amplitudes. Decoupling these equations we reduce the solution of the scattering problem for TE and TM modes to that of an initial-value problem for a Riccati equation. We discuss the application of this observation in identifying media that do not reflect TE or TM waves with given wavenumber and incidence angle.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures of bistability and limit cycle in Kerr-modified cavity magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Kerr-modified cavity magnomechanical system with a focus on its bistable regime. We identify a distinct parametric condition under which bistability appears, featuring two stable branches and one unstable branch in the middle. Interestingly, our study reveals a unique transition where the upper branch loses its stability under a sufficiently strong drive, giving rise to limit cycle oscillation. Consequently, we report a rich phase diagram consisting of both bistable and periodic solutions and study quantum correlations around them. While in the bistable regime, we find the entanglement reaching different steady state value, in the unstable regime, entanglement oscillates in time. This study is especially important in understanding quantum entanglement at different stable and unstable points arising in a Kerr-modified cavity magnomechanical system.</description>

      <title>Geometric Optimization of Quantum Control with Minimum Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimization of quantum control from the perspective of differential geometry. Here, optimal quantum control takes the minimum cost of transporting a quantum state. By defining a cost function, we quantify the cost by the length of a trajectory in the relevant Riemannian manifold. We demonstrate the optimization protocol using SU(2) and SU(1,1) dynamically symmetric systems, which cover a large class of physical scenarios. For these systems, time evolution is visualized in the three-dimensional manifold. Given the initial and final states, the minimum-cost quantum control corresponds to the geodesic of the manifold. When the trajectory linking the initial and final states is specified, the minimum-cost quantum control corresponds to the geodesic in a sub-manifold embedded in the three-dimensional manifold. Optimal quantum control in this situation provides a geometrical means of optimizing shortcuts to adiabatic driving.</description>

      <title>Simulating Schwinger model dynamics with quasi-one-dimensional qubit arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time dynamics of the Schwinger model provide an effective description of quark confinement out of equilibrium, routinely employed to model hadronization processes in particle-physics event generators. Ab-initio simulations of such non-perturbative processes are far beyond the reach of existing computational tools, and remain an outstanding open quest for quantum simulators to date. In this work we develop a general strategy to run Schwinger model dynamics on synthetic quantum spin lattices, such as neutral-atom or superconducting-qubit arrays. Our construction encodes the constrained fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom of the model into the geometric shape of a magnetic interface. We show that global magnetic field patterns can drive coherent quantum dynamics of the interface equivalent to the lattice Schwinger Hamiltonian. We rigorously establish that the optimal array required for simulating real-time wave packet collisions and string fragmentation processes with accuracy $\epsilon$ in the continuum field-theory limit, is a quasi-one-dimensional ribbon with polynomial length and polylogarithmic width in $\epsilon^{-1}$. We finally discuss a concrete advantageous implementation using a state-of-the-art dual-species Rydberg atom array. This work opens up a path for near-term quantum simulators to address questions of immediate relevance to particle physics.</description>

      <title>Exact mean and variance of the squared Hellinger distance for random density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hellinger distance between quantum states is a significant measure in quantum information theory, known for its Riemannian and monotonic properties. It is also easier to compute than the Bures distance, another measure that shares these properties. In this work, we derive the mean and variance of the Hellinger distance between pairs of density matrices, where one or both matrices are random. Along the way, we also obtain exact results for the mean affinity and mean square affinity. The first two cumulants of the Hellinger distance allow us to propose an approximation for the corresponding probability density function based on the gamma distribution. Our analytical results are corroborated through Monte Carlo simulations, showing excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Defending crosstalk-mediated quantum attacks using dynamical decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past few years, the field of quantum computing is reaching new heights with significant advancements in algorithm development. In parallel to rising research areas, companies and research labs are actively working to build fault-tolerant quantum computers which can help provide accurate and speedy results for the various experiments. The increasing demand for quantum computers necessitates the sharing of hardware to enable multi-tenancy for a broad user base. While this approach optimizes the utilization of limited quantum resources, it also introduces potential security vulnerabilities. In this paper we examine dynamical decoupling (DD) as a countermeasure to protect the legitimate circuit from such threats. We focus on crosstalk-mediated attacks on Grover's search algorithm. We find that, when compared to other countermeasures, DD successfully mitigates the attack and in some cases is able to improve the performance of the circuit beyond the level of no-attack. Thus our results emphasis the importance of incorporating DD into algorithm executions on multi-tenancy quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Triply Resonant Microwave to Optical Conversion in Erbium-170 Doped Yttrium Orthosilicate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report microwave to optical upconversion in isotopically purified erbium-doped yttrium orthosilicate in a Fabry-P\'erot resonator at millikelvin temperatures. This follows on from investigations made at higher temperatures and with natural isotopic ratios for the erbium dopants. In these previous investigations the highest efficiency was seen only for moderately strong microwave powers. The removal of the unwanted erbium-167 which has hyperfine structure and provides unwanted background optical absorption, and the lower temperatures has removed this problem. We now see efficiencies still increasing as the microwave power is decreased when we reach the smallest input powers for which we could measure an output. Efficiencies of $2\times10^{-6}$ were observed and we discuss potential improvements, including better optical cavity frequency stability and better thermalisation of the erbium spins.</description>

      <title>LatentQGAN: A Hybrid QGAN with Classical Convolutional Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning consists in taking advantage of quantum computations to generate classical data. A potential application of quantum machine learning is to harness the power of quantum computers for generating classical data, a process essential to a multitude of applications such as enriching training datasets, anomaly detection, and risk management in finance. Given the success of Generative Adversarial Networks in classical image generation, the development of its quantum versions has been actively conducted. However, existing implementations on quantum computers often face significant challenges, such as scalability and training convergence issues. To address these issues, we propose LatentQGAN, a novel quantum model that uses a hybrid quantum-classical GAN coupled with an autoencoder. Although it was initially designed for image generation, the LatentQGAN approach holds potential for broader application across various practical data generation tasks. Experimental outcomes on both classical simulators and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers have demonstrated significant performance enhancements over existing quantum methods, alongside a significant reduction in quantum resources overhead.</description>

      <title>Gate Optimization of NEQR Quantum Circuits via PPRM Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum image representation (QIR) is a key challenge in quantum image processing (QIP) due to the large number of pixels in images, which increases the need for quantum gates and qubits. However, current quantum systems face limitations in run-time complexity and available qubits. This work aims to compress the quantum circuits of the Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR) scheme by transforming their Exclusive-Or Sum-of-Products (ESOP) expressions into Positive Polarity Reed-Muller (PPRM) equivalents without adding ancillary qubits. Two cases of run-time complexity, exponential and linear, are considered for NEQR circuits with m controlling qubits ($m \rightarrow \infty$), depending on the decomposition of multi-controlled NOT gates. Using nonlinear regression, the proposed transformation is estimated to reduce the exponential complexity from $O(2^m)$ to $O(1.5^m)$, with a compression ratio approaching 100%. For linear complexity, the transformation is estimated to halve the run-time, with a compression ratio approaching 52%. Tests on six 256$\times$256 images show average reductions of 105.5 times for exponential cases and 2.4 times for linear cases, with average compression ratios of 99.05% and 58.91%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Error-Mitigated Multi-Layer Quantum Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the numerous limitations of current quantum devices, quantum error mitigation methods become potential solutions for realizing practical quantum applications in the near term. Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) and Clifford Data Regression (CDR) are two promising quantum error mitigation methods. Based on the characteristics of these two methods, we propose a new method named extrapolated CDR (eCDR). To benchmark our method, we embed eCDR into a quantum application, specifically multi-layer quantum routing. Quantum routers direct a quantum signal from one input path to a quantum superposition of multiple output paths and are considered important elements of future quantum networks. Multi-layer quantum routers extend the scalability of quantum networks by allowing for further superposition of paths. We benchmark the performance of multi-layer quantum routers implemented on current superconducting quantum devices instantiated with the ZNE, CDR, and eCDR methods. Our experimental results show that the new eCDR method significantly outperforms ZNE and CDR for the 2-layer quantum router. Our work highlights how new mitigation methods built from different components of pre-existing methods, and designed with a core application in mind, can lead to significant performance enhancements.</description>

      <title>Spectral Signatures of the Markovian to Non-Markovian Transition in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach for investigating the Markovian to non-Markovian transition in quantum aggregates strongly coupled to a vibrational bath through the analysis of linear absorption spectra. Utilizing hierarchical algebraic equations in the frequency domain, we elucidate how these spectra can effectively reveal transitions between Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, driven by the complex interplay of dissipation, aggregate-bath coupling, and intra-aggregate dipole-dipole interactions. Our results demonstrate that reduced dissipation induces spectral peak splitting, signaling the emergence of bath-induced non-Markovian effects, which are further amplified by enhanced dipole-dipole interactions. Additionally, with an increase in aggregate-bath coupling strength, initially symmetric or asymmetric peaks with varying spectral amplitudes may merge under weak dipole-dipole interactions, whereas strong dipole-dipole interactions are more likely to cause peak splitting. These phenomena serve as alternative indicators of the shift from Markovian to non-Markovian behavior. Moreover, the spectral features can act as sensitive probes for distinguishing geometric structures of the aggregates. This study not only deepens our understanding of the Markovian to non-Markovian transition but also provides a robust framework for optimizing and controlling quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Improved Routing of Multiparty Entanglement over Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective routing of entanglements over a quantum network is a fundamental problem in quantum communication. Due to the fragility of quantum states, it is difficult to route entanglements at long distances. Graph states can be utilized for this purpose, reducing the need for long-distance entanglement routing by leveraging local operations. In this paper, we propose two graph state-based routing protocols for sharing GHZ states, achieving larger sizes than the existing works, for given network topologies. For this improvement, we consider tree structures connecting the users participating in the final GHZ states, as opposed to the linear configurations used in the earlier ones. For arbitrary network topologies, we show that if such a tree is balanced, it achieves a larger size than unbalanced trees. In particular, for grid networks, we show special constructions of the above-mentioned tree that achieve optimal results. Moreover, if the user nodes among whom the entanglement is to be routed are pre-specified, we propose a strategy to accomplish the required routing.</description>

      <title>QueenV2: Future of Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A state vector-based quantum circuit simulation can provide accurate results for the development and validation of quantum computing algorithms, without being affected by noise interference. However, existing quantum circuit simulators have consistently underperformed due to inadequate integration with quantum circuits and high-performance computing architectures. To tackle the challenges in quantum computing, we propose QueenV2, which builds upon the design principles of Queen and elevates performance to a new level. Experimental results on the NVIDIA RTX-4090 demonstrate that QueenV2 achieves up to a 40x improvement in gate performance and a 5x improvement in circuit performance compared to hyQuas. Furthermore, QueenV2 realizes a 137x speedup in gate benchmarks and a 14x speedup in circuit performance relative to NVIDIA cuQuantum, enabled by gate fusion via the IBM Qiskit toolkit. By eliminating reliance on third-party libraries, QueenV2 is positioned to significantly accelerate quantum circuit simulation, thus promoting the development of innovative accelerators and quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stronger Nonlocality in GHZ States: A Step Beyond the Conventional GHZ Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) paradox, involving quantum systems with three or more subsystems, offers an 'all-vs-nothing' test of quantum nonlocality. Unlike Bell tests for bipartite systems, which reveal statistical contradictions, the GHZ paradox demonstrates a definitive (i.e. 100%) conflict between local hidden variable theories and quantum mechanics. Given this, how can the claim made in the title be justified? The key lies in recognising that GHZ games are typically played under a predefined promise condition for input distribution. By altering this promise, different GHZ games can be constructed. Here, we introduce a randomized variant of GHZ game, where the promise condition is randomly selected from multiple possibilities and revealed to only one of the parties chosen randomly. We demonstrate that this randomized GHZ paradox can also be perfectly resolved using a GHZ state, revealing a potentially stronger form of nonlocality than the original paradox. The claim of enhanced nonlocality is supported by its operational implications: correlations yielding perfect success in the randomized game offer a greater communication advantage than traditional GHZ correlations in a distributed multi-party communication complexity task.</description>

      <title>Phonon Dephasing, Entanglement and Exchange-Only Toffoli Gate Sequence in Quantum Dot Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum dot spin chain system is vital for quantum simulation and studying collective electron behaviors, necessitating an understanding of its mechanisms and control protocols. Chapter 1 introduces key concepts, focusing on the extended Hubbard model, double quantum dot systems, and electron-phonon coupling. Chapter 2 explores electron-phonon coupling in multielectron double quantum dots under unbiased and biased scenarios via detuning variations. In the unbiased case, dephasing due to electron-phonon coupling generally increases with more electrons in the right dot; this trend is inconsistent in the biased case, suggesting potential advantages of multielectron quantum dots under certain conditions. Chapter 3 investigates entanglement entropy in a multielectron quantum dot spin chain described by the extended Hubbard model. Local and pairwise entanglement are influenced by Coulomb interactions, tunneling strengths, electronic configurations, and site potential energies. The entanglement diagram reveals phase transitions significantly impacted by coupling strength ratios and potential energy variations; adjusting the potential energy of a specific dot critically influences ground state configurations and entanglement entropy. Chapter 4, inspired by the decoherence-free subspace concept, explores operation sequences in a nine-spin, nine-quantum-dot system defined by the Heisenberg model, with bases determined by total angular momentum quantum numbers. Employing the Krotov method of quantum optimal control, we identify a more efficient pulse-level operation sequence for an exchange-only quantum dot spin chain, offering a superior alternative to conventional quantum gate decomposition and potentially enhancing the development of more concise quantum algorithm representations.</description>

      <title>Compare the Pair: Rotated vs. Unrotated Surface Codes at Equal Logical Error Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical quantum computers will require resource-efficient error-correcting codes. The rotated surface code uses approximately half the number of qubits as the unrotated surface code to create a logical qubit with the same error-correcting distance. However, instead of distance, a more useful qubit-saving metric would be based on logical error suppression. In this work we compare the number of qubits used by each code to achieve equal logical error rates under circuit-level noise. We perform Monte Carlo sampling of memory experiment circuits with all valid CNOT orders, using the stabiliser simulator Stim and the uncorrelated minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder PyMatching 2. We clarify the well-below-threshold scaling of logical to physical error rates for high odd and even code distances. We find that the rotated code uses $\sim74\%$ the number of qubits used by the unrotated code to achieve a logical error rate of $p_L = 10^{-12}$ at the operational physical error rate of $p=10^{-3}$. The ratio remains $\sim75\%$ for physical error rates within a factor of two of $p=10^{-3}$ for all useful logical error rates. Our work clarifies the qubit savings provided by the rotated code and provides numerical justification for its use in future implementations of the surface code.</description>

      <title>Performance of Parity QAOA for the Signed Max-Cut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practical implementation of quantum optimization algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices requires accounting for their limited connectivity. As such, the Parity architecture was introduced to overcome this limitation by encoding binary optimization problems onto planar quantum chips. We investigate the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on the Parity architecture (Parity QAOA) for solving instances of the signed Max-Cut problem on complete and regular graphs. By comparing the algorithms at fixed circuit depth, we demonstrate that Parity QAOA outperforms conventional QAOA implementations based on SWAP networks. Our analysis utilizes Clifford circuits to estimate lower performance bounds for Parity QAOA for problem sizes that would be otherwise inaccessible on classical computers. For single layer circuits we additionally benchmark the recursive variant of the two algorithms, showing that their performance is equal.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Methods as Robust Quantum Noise Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to quantum computing is steadily increasing each year as the speed advantage of quantum computers solidifies with the growing number of usable qubits. However, the inherent noise encountered when running these systems can lead to measurement inaccuracies, especially pronounced when dealing with large or complex circuits. Achieving a balance between the complexity of circuits and the desired degree of output accuracy is a nontrivial yet necessary task for the creation of production-ready quantum software. In this study, we demonstrate how traditional machine learning (ML) models can estimate quantum noise by analyzing circuit composition. To accomplish this, we train multiple ML models on random quantum circuits, aiming to learn to estimate the discrepancy between ideal and noisy circuit outputs. By employing various noise models from distinct IBM systems, our results illustrate how this approach can accurately predict the robustness of circuits with a low error rate. By providing metrics on the stability of circuits, these techniques can be used to assess the quality and security of quantum code, leading to more reliable quantum products.</description>

      <title>Coherent population trapping and spin relaxation of a silicon vacancy center in diamond at mK temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimental studies of coherent population trapping and spin relaxation in a temperature range between 4 K and 100 mK in a silicon vacancy (SiV) center subject to a transverse magnetic field. Near and below 1 K, phonon-induced spin dephasing becomes negligible compared with that induced by the spin bath of naturally abundant 13C atoms. The temperature dependence of the spin dephasing rates agrees with the theoretical expectation that phonon-induced spin dephasing arises primarily from orbital relaxation induced by first order electron-phonon interactions. A nearly 100-fold increase in spin lifetime is observed when the temperature is lowered from 4 K to slightly below 1 K, indicating that two-phonon spin-flip transitions play an essential role in the spin relaxation of SiV ground states.</description>

      <title>Experimental Simulation of Two Pulses and Three Pulses Coherent One Way Quantum Key Distribution Protocol in Noisy/Noiseless and Wired/Wireless Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the rapid advancement of quantum technology, the traditional established classical cryptographic protocols are no longer secure. To make the world quantum safe, different quantum protocols have been taken into account. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols are one of them where two legitimate parties can securely communicate by upholding the quantum principles. Out of various QKD protocols, Coherent One Way (COW) protocol is one of the most famous protocol because of its ease of hardware deployment, and resilience nature towards PNS attack. In this initiative, we have implemented the original version of two pulses COW QKD protocol and a very recent variant of it, three pulses COW (Phys. Rev. Applied 18, 064053 Published 19 December 2022), in Optisystem v21.1. We demonstrate the encoding as well as decoding portions of the protocols under both noisy and noiseless scenario considering different weather conditions. Finally, we report a comparative study amongst the protocols under wired (optical fibre) and wireless (free space) environments to check the proper integrity of transmission. The simulation results provide us an overview regarding the practical implementation of the protocols under different weather conditions.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Randomness Certification from Incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum randomness can be certified from probabilistic behaviors demonstrating Bell nonlocality or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, leveraging outcomes from uncharacterized devices. However, such nonlocal correlations are not always sufficient for this task, necessitating the identification of required minimum quantum resources. In this work, we provide the necessary and sufficient condition for nonzero certifiable randomness in terms of measurement incompatibility and develop approaches to detect them. Firstly, we show that the steering-based randomness can be certified if and only if the correlations arise from a measurement compatibility structure that is not isomorphic to a hypergraph containing a star subgraph. In such a structure, the central measurement is individually compatible with the measurements at branch sites, precluding certifiable randomness in the central measurement outcomes. Subsequently, we generalize this result to the Bell scenario, proving that the violation of any chain inequality involving $m$ inputs and $d$ outputs rules out such a compatibility structure, thereby validating all chain inequalities as credible witnesses for randomness certification. Our results point out the role of incompatibility structure in generating random numbers, offering a way to identify minimum quantum resources for the task.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the tunneling of two bosons in a double-well, for contact, soft-, and hard-core Coulomb interaction of tunable strength. Transitions from correlated to uncorrelated tunneling of the left well's two-particle ground state are due to resonances with states with one particle in either well.

      <title>Efficient Large-Scale Quantum Optimization via Counterdiabatic Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the fundamental variational quantum algorithms, while a version of QAOA that includes counterdiabatic driving, termed Digitized Counterdiabatic QAOA (DC-QAOA), is generally considered to outperform QAOA for all system sizes when the circuit depth for the two algorithms are held equal. Nevertheless, DC-QAOA introduces more CNOT gates per layer, so the overall circuit complexity is a tradeoff between the number of CNOT gates per layer and the circuit depth, and must therefore be carefully assessed. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of DC-QAOA and QAOA on MaxCut problem with the total number of CNOT gates held equal, and we focus on one implementation of counterdiabatic terms using nested commutators in DC-QAOA, termed as DC-QAOA(NC). We have found that DC-QAOA(NC) reduces the overall circuit complexity as compared to QAOA only for sufficiently large problems, and for MaxCut problem the number of qubits must exceed 16 for DC-QAOA(NC) to outperform QAOA. We have further shown that this advantage can be understood from the effective dimensions introduced by the counterdiabatic driving terms. Moreover, based on our finding that the
  optimal parameters generated by DC-QAOA(NC) strongly concentrate in the parameter space, we haved devised an instance-sequential training method for DC-QAOA(NC) circuits, which, compared to traditional methods, offers performance improvement while using even fewer quantum resources. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the advantages of DC-QAOA circuits and an efficient training method based on their generalizability.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Correction of Qudits Beyond Break-even</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilbert space dimension is a key resource for quantum information processing. A large Hilbert space is not only an essential requirement for quantum error correction, but it can also be advantageous for realizing gates and algorithms more efficiently. There has thus been considerable experimental effort in recent years to develop quantum computing platforms using qudits (d-dimensional quantum systems with d&gt;2) as the fundamental unit of quantum information. Just as with qubits, quantum error correction of these qudits will be necessary in the long run, but to date error correction of logical qudits has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here we report the experimental realization of error-corrected logical qutrits (d=3) and ququarts (d=4) by employing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) bosonic code in a circuit QED architecture. Using a reinforcement learning agent, we optimize the GKP qutrit (ququart) as a ternary (quaternary) quantum memory and achieve beyond break-even error correction with a gain of 1.82 +/- 0.03 (1.87 +/- 0.03). This work represents a new way of leveraging the large Hilbert space of a harmonic oscillator for hardware-efficient quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Bound States in the Continuum in a Double Whispering Gallery Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the single-photon transport through two whispering gallery resonators (WGRs) coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Using Green's function formalism, we compute the transmission spectra and the photonic density of states (DOS) for the stationary states. We also obtain the formation of two types of bound states in the continuum (BICs). The first kind is localized into the WGR and are symmetry-protected BICs. In contrast, the second depends on the distance between resonators through the waveguide and is of the Fabry-Perot kind. These BICs are represented as Dirac delta functions in the local density of states. Additionally, we show that quasi-BICs manifest as sharp resonances in photonic transmission due to small symmetry-breaking perturbations. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics of a single-photon wave packet interacting with the WGRs and analyze the mechanism for storing the wave packet in the structure formed by the WGRs and the finite waveguide between them.</description>

      <title>Fourier analysis of many-body transition amplitudes and states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the Fourier transform over the symmetric group $S_N$ to the set of multiparticle transition amplitudes arising from the permutations of $N$ identical particles. This allows us to analyse the counting statistics at the output of multiparticle and multimode interference setups in terms of contributions from irreducible symmetry types. We apply our formalism to the interference of partially distinguishable bosons and fermions, whose state can also be submitted to Fourier analysis, and to the determination of suppressed transitions for states of a given symmetry type.</description>

      <title>The Top Manifold Connectedness of Quantum Control Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of quantum systems has been proven to possess trap-free optimization landscapes under the satisfaction of proper assumptions. However, many details of the landscape geometry and their influence on search efficiency still need to be fully understood. This paper numerically explores the path-connectedness of globally optimal control solutions forming the top manifold of the landscape. We randomly sample a plurality of optimal controls in the top manifold to assess the existence of a continuous path at the top of the landscape that connects two arbitrary optimal solutions. It is shown that for different quantum control objectives including state-to-state transition probabilities, observable expectation values and unitary transformations, such a continuous path can be readily found, implying that these top manifolds are fundamentally path-connected. The significance of the latter conjecture lies in seeking locations in the top manifold where an ancillary objective can also be optimized while maintaining the full optimality of the original objective that defined the landscape.</description>

      <title>Joint State-Channel Decoupling and One-Shot Quantum Coding Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider decoupling a bipartite quantum state via a general quantum channel. We propose a joint state-channel decoupling approach to obtain a one-shot error exponent bound without smoothing, in which trace distance is used to measure how good the decoupling is. The established exponent is expressed in terms of a sum of two sandwiched R{\'e}nyi entropies, one quantifying the amount of initial correlation between the state and environment, while the other characterizing the effectiveness of the quantum channel. This gives an explicit exponential decay of the decoupling error in the whole achievable region, which was missing in the previous results [Commun. Math. Phys. 328, 2014]. Moreover, it strengthens the error exponent bound obtained in a recent work [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 69(12), 2023], for exponent from the channel part. As an application, we establish a one-shot error exponent bound for quantum channel coding given by a sandwiched R\'enyi coherent information.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Quantum Repeater with Single Atoms in Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient quantum repeaters are needed to combat photon losses in fibers in future quantum networks. Single atom coupled with photonic cavity offer a great platform for photon-atom gate. Here I propose a quantum repeater scheme with deterministic entanglement generation and entanglement swapping based on photon-atom gates. It can be implemented with various types of atomic systems and require much less experimental complexity compared with other repeater protocols. With current available experimental techniques and reasonable improvements, high entanglement distribution rates can be achieved. A multiplexing configuration of 5-10 single atoms in cavities, secret key rates in order of 100s Hz to kHz can be achieved for communication distance of 1000km, and a few Hz to 10s Hz can be achieved for communication distance of 10000km with longer atomic coherence time and lower photon-atom gate error rate. This proposal paves the way to demonstrate efficient entanglement distribution with quantum repeaters in near future.</description>

      <title>Locality vs Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves optimal tradeoffs between the locality and parameters of quantum error-correcting codes. Quantum codes give a promising avenue towards quantum fault tolerance, but the practical constraint of locality limits their quality. The seminal Bravyi-Poulin-Terhal (BPT) bound says that a $[[n,k,d]]$ quantum stabilizer code with 2D-locality must satisfy $kd^2\le O(n)$. We answer the natural question: for better code parameters, how much "non-locality" is needed? In particular, (i) how long must the long-range interactions be, and (ii) how many long-range interactions must there be?
  We give a complete answer to both questions for all $n,k,d$: above the BPT bound, any 2D-embedding must have at least $\Omega(\#^*)$ interactions of length $\Omega(\ell^*)$, where $\#^*= \max(k,d)$ and $\ell^*=\max\big(\frac{d}{\sqrt{n}}, \big( \frac{kd^2}{n} \big)^{1/4} \big)$. Conversely, we exhibit quantum codes that show, in strong ways, that our interaction length $\ell^*$ and interaction count $\#^*$ are asymptotically optimal for all $n,k,d$.
  Our results generalize or improve all prior works on this question, including the BPT bound and the results of Baspin and Krishna. One takeaway of our work is that, for any desired distance $d$ and dimension $k$, the number of long-range interactions is asymptotically minimized by a good qLDPC code of length $\Theta(\max(k,d))$. Following Baspin and Krishna, we also apply our results to the codes implemented in the stacked architecture and obtain better bounds. In particular, we rule out any implementation of hypergraph product codes in the stacked architecture.</description>

      <title>Patch-Based End-to-End Quantum Learning Network for Reduction and Classification of Classical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era, the control over the qubits is limited due to the errors caused by quantum decoherence, crosstalk, and imperfect calibration. Hence, it is necessary to reduce the size of the large-scale classical data, such as images, when they are to be processed by quantum networks. Conventionally input classical data are reduced in the classical domain using classical networks such as autoencoders and, subsequently, analyzed in the quantum domain. These conventional techniques involve training an enormous number of parameters, making them computationally costly. In this paper, a dynamic patch-based quantum domain data reduction network with a classical attention mechanism is proposed to avoid such data reductions, and subsequently coupled with a novel quantum classifier to perform classification tasks. The architecture processes the classical data sequentially in patches and reduces them using a quantum convolutional-inspired reduction network and further enriches them using a self-attention technique, which utilizes a classical mask derived from simple statistical operations on the native classical data, after measurement. The reduced representation is passed through a quantum classifier, which re-encodes it into quantum states, processes them through quantum ansatzes, and finally measures them to predict classes. This training process involves a joint optimization scheme that considers both the reduction and classifier networks, making the reduction operation dynamic. The proposed architecture has been extensively tested on the publicly available Fashion MNIST dataset, and it has excellent classification performance using significantly reduced training parameters.</description>

      <title>Founding Quantum Cryptography on Quantum Advantage, or, Towards Cryptography from #P-Hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent oracle separations [Kretschmer, TQC'21, Kretschmer et. al., STOC'23] have raised the tantalizing possibility of building quantum cryptography from sources of hardness that persist even if the polynomial heirarchy collapses. We realize this possibility by building quantum bit commitments and secure computation from unrelativized, well-studied mathematical problems that are conjectured to be hard for $\mathsf{P^{\#P}}$ -- such as approximating the permanents of complex gaussian matrices, or approximating the output probabilities of random quantum circuits. Indeed, we show that as long as any one of the conjectures underlying sampling-based quantum advantage (e.g., BosonSampling, Random Circuit Sampling, IQP, etc.) is true, quantum cryptography can be based on the extremely mild assumption that $\mathsf{P^{\#P}} \not\subseteq \mathsf{(io)BQP/qpoly}$. We prove that the following hardness assumptions are equivalent. (1) The hardness of approximating the probability assigned to a randomly chosen string in the support of certain efficiently sampleable distributions (upto inverse polynomial multiplicative error).(2) The existence of one-way puzzles, where a quantum sampler outputs a pair of classical strings -- a puzzle and its key -- and where the hardness lies in finding the key corresponding to a random puzzle. These are known to imply quantum bit commitments [Khurana and Tomer, STOC'24]. (3) The existence of state puzzles, or one-way state synthesis, where it is hard to synthesize a secret quantum state given a public classical identifier. These capture the hardness of search problems with quantum inputs (secrets) and classical outputs (challenges). These are the first constructions of quantum cryptographic primitives (one-way puzzles, quantum bit commitments, state puzzles) from concrete, well-founded mathematical assumptions that do not imply the existence of classical cryptography.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed analysis of density-functional theory for quantum-electrodynamical model systems is provided. In particular, the quantum Rabi model, the Dicke model, and a generalization of the latter to multiple modes are considered. We prove a Hohenberg-Kohn theorem that manifests the magnetization and displacement as internal variables, along with several representability results. The constrained-search functionals for pure states and ensembles are introduced and analyzed. We find the optimizers for the pure-state constrained-search functional to be low-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and, based on the properties of the optimizers, we formulate an adiabatic-connection formula. In the reduced case of the Rabi model we can even show differentiability of the universal density functional, which amounts to unique pure-state v-representability.</description>

      <title>Bose-Fermi $N$-polaron state emergence from correlation-mediated blocking of phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $N$ fermionic impurities in a one-dimensional lattice bosonic bath at unit filling. Using DMRG and mixed boundary conditions -- closed for bosons, open for fermions -- we find an $N$-polaron ground state replacing phase separation at high interspecies repulsion. This tightly bound state of clustered particles emerges due to strong impurity-bath correlations which induce large impurity-impurity correlations, that we quantify via the von Neumann entropy and bipartite mutual information respectively. This system also reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator background due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The growth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the transition to localized impurity clusters. Finally, we show that there is a critical impurity number, which depends on intraspecies bosonic interaction, beyond which phase separation is recovered.</description>

      <title>Gravity as a mesoscopic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a probabilistic mesoscopic description to draw conceptual and quantitative analogies between Brownian motion and late-time fluctuations of thermal correlation functions in generic chaotic systems respecting ETH. In this framework, thermal correlation functions of `simple' operators are described by stochastic processes, which are able to probe features of the microscopic theory only in a probabilistic sense. We apply this formalism to the case of semiclassical gravity in AdS$_3$, showing that wormhole contributions can be naturally identified as moments of stochastic processes. We also point out a `Matryoshka doll' recursive structure in which information is hidden in higher and higher moments, and which can be naturally justified within the stochastic framework. We then re-interpret the gravitational results from the boundary perspective, promoting the OPE data of the CFT to probability distributions. The outcome of this study shows that semiclassical gravity in AdS can be naturally interpreted as a mesoscopic description of quantum gravity, and a mesoscopic holographic duality can be framed as a moment-vs-probability-distribution duality.</description>

      <title>Gauge Loop-String-Hadron Formulation on General Graphs and Applications to Fully Gauge Fixed Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a gauge invariant, Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) based representation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory defined on a general graph consisting of vertices and half-links. Inspired by weak coupling studies, we apply this technique to maximal tree gauge fixing. This allows us to develop a fully gauge fixed representation of the theory in terms of LSH quantum numbers. We explicitly show how the quantum numbers in this formulation directly relate to the variables in the magnetic description. In doing so, we will also explain in detail the way that the Kogut-Susskind formulation, prepotentials, and point splitting, work for general graphs. In the appendix of this work we provide a self-contained exposition of the mathematical details of Hamiltonian pure gauge theories defined on general graphs.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the application of light-ray operators (LROs) in high energy physics, we propose a new strategy to study correlation functions of LROs through real-time quantum simulations. We argue that quantum simulators provide an ideal laboratory to explore the properties LROs in lower-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs). This is exemplified in the 1+1-d Schwinger model, employing tensor network methods, focusing on the calculation of energy and charge correlators. Despite some challenges in extracting the necessary correlation functions from the lattice the methodology used can be extended to real quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as powerful observables for probing the fragmentation dynamics of high-energy collisions. We introduce the first numerical strategy for calculating energy correlators using the Hamiltonian lattice approach, providing access to the intriguing nonperturbative dynamics of these observables. Furthermore, motivated by rapid advances in quantum computing hardware and algorithms, we propose a quantum algorithm for calculating energy correlators in quantum field theories. This algorithm includes ground state preparation, the application of source, sink, energy flux, real-time evolution operators, and the Hadamard test. We validate our approach by applying it to the SU(2) pure gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on $3\times 3$ and $5\times 5$ honeycomb lattices with $j_{\rm max} = \frac{1}{2}$ at various couplings, utilizing both classical methods and the quantum algorithm, the latter tested using the IBM emulator for specific configurations. The results are consistent with the expected behavior of the strong coupling regime and motivate a more comprehensive study to probe the confinement dynamics across the weak and strong coupling regimes.</description>

Abstract: Testing can be key to software quality assurance. Automated verification may increase throughput and reduce human fallibility errors. Test scripts supply inputs, run programs and check their outputs mechanically using test oracles. In software engineering implicit oracles automatically check for universally undesirable behaviour, such as the software under test crashing. We propose 4 properties (probability distributions, fixed qubit width, reversibility and entropy conservation) which all quantum computing must have and suggest they could be implicit test oracles for automatic, random, or fuzz testing of quantum circuits and simulators of quantum programs.</description>

Abstract: The Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQR) is an emerging quantum precision sensing platform designed for receiving radio frequency (RF) signals. It relies on creation of Rydberg atoms from normal atoms by exciting one or more electrons to a very high energy level, which in turn makes the atom sensitive to RF signals. The RAQR realizes RF-to-optical conversion based on light-atom interaction relying on the so called electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and Aulter-Townes splitting (ATS), so that the desired RF signal can be read out optically. The large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms associated with rich choices of Rydberg states and various modulation schemes facilitate an ultra-high sensitivity ($\sim$ nV/cm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$) and an ultra-broadband tunability (near direct-current to Terahertz). RAQRs also exhibit compelling scalability and lend themselves to the construction of innovative, compact receivers. Initial experimental studies have demonstrated their capabilities in classical wireless communications and sensing. To fully harness their potential in a wide variety of applications, we commence by outlining the underlying fundamentals of Rydberg atoms, followed by the principles, structures, and theories of RAQRs. Finally, we conceive Rydberg atomic quantum single-input single-output (RAQ-SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) schemes for facilitating the integration of RAQRs with classical wireless systems, and conclude with a set of potent research directions.</description>

      <title>Generalized boson and fermion operators with a maximal total occupation property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new generalization of the standard (anti-)commutation relations for creation and annihilation operators of bosons and fermions. These relations preserve the usual symmetry properties of bosons and fermions. Only the standard (anti-)commutator relation involving one creation and one annihilation operator is deformed by introducing fractional coefficients, containing a positive integer parameter $p$. The Fock space is determined by the classical definition. The new relations are chosen in such a way that the total occupation number in the system has the maximum value $p$. From the actions of creation and annihilation operators in the Fock space, a group theoretical framework is determined, and from here the correspondence with known particle statistics is established.</description>

      <title>Electric imaging and dynamics of photo-charged graphene edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional side gate based on graphene edges shows a significant capability of reducing the channel length of field-effect transistors, further increasing the integration density of semiconductor devices. The nano-scale electric field distribution near the edge provides the physical limit of the effective channel length, however, its imaging under ambient conditions still lacks, which is a critical aspect for the practical deployment of semiconductor devices. Here, we used scanning nitrogen-vacancy microscopy to investigate the electric field distribution near edges of a single-layer-graphene. Real-space scanning maps of photo-charged floating graphene flakes were acquired with a spatial resolution of $\sim$ 10 nm, and the electric edge effect was quantitatively studied by analyzing the NV spin energy level shifts due to the electric Stark effect. Since the graphene flakes are isolated from external electric sources, we brought out a theory based on photo-thermionic effect to explain the charge transfer from graphene to oxygen-terminated diamond probe with a disordered distribution of charge traps. Real-time tracing of electric fields detected the photo-thermionic emission process and the recombination process of the emitted electrons. This study provides a new perspective for graphene-based one-dimensional gates and opto-electronics with nanoscale real-space imaging, and moreover, offers a novel method to tune the chemical environment of diamond surfaces based on optical charge transfer.</description>

      <title>On demand single photon generation and coherent control of excitons from resonantly driven nanowire quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control of single photon sources is a key requirement for the advancement of photonic quantum technologies. Among them, nanowire-based quantum dot sources are popular due to their potential for on-chip hybrid integration. Here we demonstrate on-demand single-photon generation ($g^{(2)}(0)(X^{*}) =0.078$ and $g^{(2)}(0)(X)= 0.03$) from resonantly excited InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dots and observe Rabi oscillations in the dot emission, indicating successful coherent manipulation of the excitonic states in the nanowire. We also measure a low emission time jitter for resonant excitation as compared to above-band excitation. This work addresses the long-standing challenge of resonantly exciting nanowire-quantum dots. It paves the way for hybrid quantum photonic integration, enabling spin-photon entanglement and matter memories on-chip.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase diagrams of Dicke-Ising models by a wormhole algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We gain quantitative insights on effects of light-matter interactions on correlated quantum matter by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines.</description>

      <title>Two-component repulsive atomic Fermi gases in a thin spherical shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present possible ground-state structures of two-component atomic Fermi gases with repulsive interactions in a thin spherical shell geometry by implementing a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. The system exhibits a miscible-immiscible transition from a homogeneous mixture to two-chunk phase separation as the interaction strength crosses a critical value. While the critical value is relatively insensitive to population imbalance for equal-mass mixtures, it decreases with the mass ratio when mass-imbalance is present. The interaction may be tuned by the two-body scattering length or the radius of the sphere, thereby allowing the system to cross the transition by varying different parameters. When the sphere is rotating, three-chunk sandwich structures emerge in mass-imbalanced mixtures as a consequence of maximal angular momentum along the rotation axis. Some indications of geometric effects and possible experimental implications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Interaction dependence of the Hall response for the Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the behavior of the Hall response of a Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder in a magnetic field as a function of the repulsive on-site atomic interactions. We consider a wide range of interaction strengths, from the weakly interacting limit to the hardcore regime. This is realized by computing the Hall polarization following the quench of a weak linear potential which induces the flow of a current through the system, using time-dependent matrix product state numerical simulations. We complement our understanding in the regime of small magnetic fields by analytical calculations of the equilibrium value of the Hall polarization for non-interacting bosonic atoms, or under a mean-field assumption. The Bose-Hubbard triangular flux ladder exhibits a rich phase diagram, containing Meissner, vortex and biased-chiral superfluid phases. We show that the Hall response can be employed to fingerprint the various chiral state, the frustration effects occurring in the limit of strong interactions, and the phase boundaries of the equilibrium phase diagram.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of implementing arbitrary permutations of qubits under interaction constraints in quantum systems that allow for arbitrarily fast local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In particular, we show examples of speedups over swap-based and more general unitary routing methods by distributing entanglement and using LOCC to perform quantum teleportation. We further describe an example of an interaction graph for which teleportation gives a logarithmic speedup in the worst-case routing time over swap-based routing. We also study limits on the speedup afforded by quantum teleportation - showing an $O(\sqrt{N \log N})$ upper bound on the separation in routing time for any interaction graph - and give tighter bounds for some common classes of graphs.</description>

Abstract: We examine the potential-energy curves and polarization of the dipole moments of two static polar molecules under the influence of an external dc electric field and their anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction. We model the molecules as quantum rigid rotors to take their rotational degrees of freedom into account and consider a selection of linear, symmetric, and asymmetric top molecules. We provide a comprehensive examination of the energy curves and polarization of the dipoles for varying inter-molecular separation and direction of the electric field and find that the properties of the molecules depend strongly on the field's direction at short separations, showing the importance of accounting for molecular rotation. The latter provides insight into the possible effects of accounting for rotational degrees of freedom in molecular dipolar gases.</description>

Abstract: From correlations in measurement outcomes alone, can two otherwise isolated parties establish whether such correlations are atemporal? That is, can they rule out that they have been given the same system at two different times? Classical statistics says no, yet quantum theory disagrees. Here, we introduce the necessary and sufficient conditions by which such quantum correlations can be identified as atemporal. We demonstrate the asymmetry of atemporality under time reversal, and reveal it to be a measure of spatial quantum correlation distinct from entanglement. Our results indicate that certain quantum correlations possess an intrinsic arrow of time, and enable classification of general quantum correlations across space-time based on their (in)compatibility with various underlying causal structures.</description>

      <title>Circuit decompositions and scheduling for neutral atom devices with limited local addressability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite major ongoing advancements in neutral atom hardware technology, there remains limited work in systems-level software tailored to overcoming the challenges of neutral atom quantum computers. In particular, most current neutral atom architectures do not natively support local addressing of single-qubit rotations about an axis in the xy-plane of the Bloch sphere. Instead, these are executed via global beams applied simultaneously to all qubits. While previous neutral atom experimental work has used straightforward synthesis methods to convert short sequences of operations into this native gate set, these methods cannot be incorporated into a systems-level framework nor applied to entire circuits without imposing impractical amounts of serialization. Without sufficient compiler optimizations, decompositions involving global gates will significantly increase circuit depth, gate count, and accumulation of errors. No prior compiler work has addressed this, and adapting existing compilers to solve this problem is nontrivial.
  In this paper, we present an optimized compiler pipeline that translates an input circuit from an arbitrary gate set into a realistic neutral atom native gate set containing global gates. We focus on decomposition and scheduling passes that minimize the final circuit's global gate count and total global rotation amount. As we show, these costs contribute the most to the circuit's duration and overall error, relative to costs incurred by other gate types. Compared to the unoptimized version of our compiler pipeline, minimizing global gate costs gives up to 4.77x speedup in circuit duration. Compared to the closest prior existing work, we achieve up to 53.8x speedup. For large circuits, we observe a few orders of magnitude improvement in circuit fidelities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pseudorandom Scramblers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs) have stimulated exciting developments in recent years. A PRSG, on a fixed initial (e.g., all-zero) state, produces an output state that is computationally indistinguishable from a Haar random state. However, pseudorandomness of the output state is not guaranteed on other initial states. In fact, known PRSG constructions provably fail on some initial states.
  In this work, we propose and construct quantum Pseudorandom State Scramblers (PRSSs), which can produce a pseudorandom state on an arbitrary initial state. In the information-theoretical setting, we obtain a scrambler which maps an arbitrary initial state to a distribution of quantum states that is close to Haar random in total variation distance. As a result, our scrambler exhibits a dispersing property. Loosely, it can span an $\epsilon$-net of the state space. This significantly strengthens what standard PRSGs can induce, as they may only concentrate on a small region of the state space provided that average output state approximates a Haar random state.
  Our PRSS construction develops a parallel extension of the famous Kac's walk, and we show that it mixes exponentially faster than the standard Kac's walk. This constitutes the core of our proof. We also describe a few applications of PRSSs. While our PRSS construction assumes a post-quantum one-way function, PRSSs are potentially a weaker primitive and can be separated from one-way functions in a relativized world similar to standard PRSGs.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Energy-Conserving Quantum Circuits with XY interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum circuits constructed from $\sqrt{iSWAP}$ gates and, more generally, from the entangling gates that can be realized with the XX+YY interaction alone. Such gates preserve the Hamming weight of states in the computational basis, which means they respect the global U(1) symmetry corresponding to rotations around the z axis. Equivalently, assuming that the intrinsic Hamiltonian of each qubit in the system is the Pauli Z operator, they conserve the total energy of the system. We develop efficient methods for synthesizing circuits realizing any desired energy-conserving unitary using XX+YY interaction with or without single-qubit rotations around the z-axis. Interestingly, implementing generic energy-conserving unitaries, such as CCZ and Fredkin gates, with 2-local energy-conserving gates requires the use of ancilla qubits. When single-qubit rotations around the z-axis are permitted, our scheme requires only a single ancilla qubit, whereas with the XX+YY interaction alone, it requires 2 ancilla qubits. In addition to exact realizations, we also consider approximate realizations and show how a general energy-conserving unitary can be synthesized using only a sequence of $\sqrt{iSWAP}$ gates and 2 ancillary qubits, with arbitrarily small error, which can be bounded via the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Our methods are also applicable for synthesizing energy-conserving unitaries when, rather than the XX+YY interaction, one has access to any other energy-conserving 2-body interaction that is not diagonal in the computational basis, such as the Heisenberg exchange interaction. We briefly discuss the applications of these circuits in the context of quantum computing, quantum thermodynamics, and quantum clocks.</description>

      <title>Quantum computer-enabled receivers for optical communication</title>

Abstract: Optical communication is the standard for high-bandwidth information transfer in today's digital age. The increasing demand for bandwidth has led to the maturation of coherent transceivers that use phase- and amplitude-modulated optical signals to encode more bits of information per transmitted pulse. Such encoding schemes achieve higher information density, but also require more complicated receivers to discriminate the signaling states. In fact, achieving the ultimate limit of optical communication capacity, especially in the low light regime, requires coherent joint detection of multiple pulses. Despite their superiority, such joint detection receivers are not in widespread use because of the difficulty of constructing them in the optical domain. In this work we describe how optomechanical transduction of phase information from coherent optical pulses to superconducting qubit states followed by the execution of trained short-depth variational quantum circuits can perform joint detection of communication codewords with error probabilities that surpass all classical, individual pulse detection receivers. Importantly, we utilize a model of optomechanical transduction that captures non-idealities such as thermal noise and loss in order to understand the transduction performance necessary to achieve a quantum advantage with such a scheme. We also execute the trained variational circuits on an IBM-Q device with the modeled transduced states as input to demonstrate that a quantum advantage is possible even with current levels of quantum computing hardware noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, a peculiar connection between particles, underpins powerful technologies such as quantum computing and secure communication. However, quantifying the minimum entanglement required to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes remains a significant challenge. We develop an efficiently computable tool that reliably estimates the amount of entanglement needed for realizing arbitrary quantum processes respecting certain physical principles. Our tool applies to the entanglement required to prepare a broad range of quantum states in the asymptotic regime, surpassing previous methods' limitations. We also confirm that entanglement, once consumed to realize the considered class of quantum operations, cannot be fully recovered, even asymptotically. This irreversible behavior is evident for full-rank entangled states and practically relevant amplitude damping channels, even under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose. We showcase our approach's power through examples such as estimating entanglement requirements for realizing bipartite dephasing SWAP channels and solving Hamiltonian simulations under thermal interaction, highlighting its advantages over existing techniques. Our work provides a practical toolkit for benchmarking entanglement requirements for generic states and quantum dynamics, paving the way for assessing and optimizing the performances of quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computers are demonstrating the ability to solve problems at a scale beyond brute force classical simulation. As such, a widespread interest in quantum algorithms has developed in many areas, with optimization being one of the most pronounced domains. Across computer science and physics, there are a number of different approaches for major classes of optimization problems, such as combinatorial optimization, convex optimization, non-convex optimization, and stochastic extensions. This work draws on multiple approaches to study quantum optimization. Provably exact versus heuristic settings are first explained using computational complexity theory - highlighting where quantum advantage is possible in each context. Then, the core building blocks for quantum optimization algorithms are outlined to subsequently define prominent problem classes and identify key open questions that, if answered, will advance the field. The effects of scaling relevant problems on noisy quantum devices are also outlined in detail, alongside meaningful benchmarking problems. We underscore the importance of benchmarking by proposing clear metrics to conduct appropriate comparisons with classical optimization techniques. Lastly, we highlight two domains - finance and sustainability - as rich sources of optimization problems that could be used to benchmark, and eventually validate, the potential real-world impact of quantum optimization.</description>

Abstract: We bound the time necessary to implement the shift unitary on a one-dimensional ring, both using local Hamiltonians and those with power-law interactions. This time is constrained by the Frobenius light cone; hence we prove that (for certain power law exponents) shift unitaries cannot be implemented in the same amount of time needed to prepare long-range Bell pairs. We note an intriguing similarity between the proof of our results, and the hardness of preparing symmetry-protected topological states with symmetry-preserving Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit the complete complementarity relations (CCR) to fully characterize various aspects of quantumness in QED scattering processes at tree level. As a paradigmatic example, we consider Bhabha scattering in two different configurations: in the first case, the initial state is factorized in the spin and we study the generation of entanglement due to the scattering. Then we consider the most general case in which the initial state can be entangled: we find that the scattering generates and distributes quantum information in a non-trivial way among the spin degrees of freedom of the particles, with CCR relations being preserved. An important outcome of our analysis is that maximal entanglement is conserved in the scattering process involving only fermions as input and output states, with a more complex situation if photons are present.</description>

      <title>Magic Mirror on the Wall, How to Benchmark Quantum Error Correction Codes, Overall ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs) are pivotal in advancing quantum computing by protecting quantum states against the adverse effects of noise and errors. With a variety of QECCs developed, including new developments and modifications of existing ones, selecting an appropriate QECC tailored to specific conditions is crucial. Despite significant improvements in the field of QECCs, a unified methodology for evaluating them on a consistent basis has remained elusive. Addressing this gap, this paper presents the first benchmarking framework for QECCs, introducing a set of universal parameters. By evaluating eight prominent QECCs, we propose a comprehensive suite of eight parameters for their analysis. Our methodology establishes a universal benchmarking approach and highlights the complexity of quantum error correction, indicating that the choice of a QECC depends on the unique requirements and limitations of each scenario. Furthermore, we develop a systematic strategy for selecting QECCs that adapts to the specific requirements of a given scenario, facilitating a tailored approach to quantum error correction. Additionally, we introduce a novel QECC recommendation tool that assesses the characteristics of a given scenario provided by the user, subsequently recommending a spectrum of QECCs from most to least suitable, along with the maximum achievable distance for each code. This tool is designed to be adaptable, allowing for the inclusion of new QECCs and the modification of their parameters with minimal effort, ensuring its relevance in the evolving landscape of quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: We consider a thermodynamic framework to quantify instrument incompatibility via a resource theory subject to thermodynamic constraints. We use the minimal thermalisation time needed to erase incompatibility's signature to measure incompatibility. Unexpectedly, this time value is equivalent to incompatibility advantage in a work extraction task. Hence, both thermalisation time and extractable work can directly quantify instrument incompatibility. Finally, we show that incompatibility signatures must vanish in non-Markovian thermalisation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted classical capacities of some channels acting as radial multipliers on fermion algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$, acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to a receiver when they share an unlimited amount of entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermion algebras with the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements have expanded Hardy's nonlocality arguments into multisetting and multidimensional systems to enhance quantum correlations. In comparison with Hardy's nonlocal argument, Cabello's nonlocal argument (CNA) emerges as a superior choice for illustrating nonlocal features. An open question persists regarding the potential extension of CNA to arbitrary (k, d) scenarios. Here, we answer this question both in theory and experiment. Theoretically, by utilizing compatibility graphs, we construct a new logical framework for multisetting and multidimensional CNA, demonstrating an increase in the maximum successful probability with setting k and dimension d. Experimentally, by employing controllable photonic orbital angular momentum entanglement, we exhibit nonlocality with an experimentally recorded probability of 20.29% in the (2, 4) scenario and 28.72% in the (6, 2) scenario. Our work showcases a sharper contradiction between quantum mechanics and classical theory, surpassing the bound limited by the original version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Liouvillian skin effect and the non-Hermitian skin effect have both been used to explain the localization of eigenmodes near system boundaries, though the former is arguably more accurate in some regimes due to its incorporation of quantum jumps. However, these frameworks predominantly focus on weak Markovian interactions, neglecting the potentially crucial role of memory effects. To address this, we investigate, utilizing the powerful hierarchical equations of motion method, how a non-Markovian environment can modify the Liouvillian skin effect. We demonstrate that a non-Markovian environment can induce a ``thick skin effect", where the skin mode broadens and shifts into the bulk. {We further identify that the skin-mode quantum coherence can only be generated when the coupling contains counter-rotating terms}, leading to the coherence-delocalization and oscillatory relaxation with a characteristic linear scaling with system size. Remarkably, both the skin-mode and steady-state coherence exhibit resistance to decoherence from additional environmental noise. These findings highlight the profound impact of system-bath correlations on relaxation and localization, revealing unique phenomena beyond conventional Markovian approximations.</description>

Abstract: A recently proposed variational quantum algorithm has expanded the horizon of variational quantum computing to nonlinear physics and fluid dynamics. In this work, we probe the ability of such approaches to capture the ground state of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a range of parameters on real superconducting quantum processors. Specifically, we study the expressivity of real-amplitude, hardware-efficient ansatz to capture the ground state of this nonlinear system across various interaction regimes and implement different noise scenarios in both simulators and cloud processors. Our investigation reveals that although quantum hardware noise impairs the evaluation of the energy cost function, certain small instances of the problem consistently converge to the ground state. We test for a variety of cases on IBM Q superconducting devices and analyze the discrepancies in the energy cost function evaluation due to quantum hardware noise. These discrepancies are absent in the state fidelity estimation because of the shallow state preparation circuit. Our comprehensive analysis offers valuable insights into the practical implementation and advancement of the variational algorithms for nonlinear problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Coherent Quantum Phase Estimation via Tapering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is one of the fundamental primitives that underpins many quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm for efficiently factoring large numbers. Due to its significance as a subroutine, in this work, we consider the coherent version of the phase estimation problem, where given an arbitrary input state and black-box access to unitaries $U$ and controlled-$U$, the goal is to estimate the phases of $U$ in superposition. Most existing phase estimation algorithms involve intermediary measurements that disrupt coherence. Only a couple of algorithms, including the standard quantum phase estimation algorithm, consider this coherent setting. However, the standard algorithm only succeeds with a constant probability. To boost this success probability, it employs the coherent median technique, resulting in an algorithm with optimal query complexity (the total number of calls to U and controlled-U). However, this coherent median technique requires a large number of ancilla qubits and a computationally expensive quantum sorting network.
  To address this, in this work, we propose an improved version of this standard algorithm called the tapered quantum phase estimation algorithm. It leverages tapering/window functions commonly used in signal processing. Our algorithm achieves the optimal query complexity without requiring the expensive coherent median technique to boost success probability. We also show that the tapering functions that we use are optimal by formulating optimization problems with different optimization criteria. Beyond the asymptotic regime, we also provide non-asymptotic query complexity of our algorithm, as it is crucial for practical implementation. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm to prepare the quantum state corresponding to the optimal tapering function.</description>

      <title>Analytical derivation and extension of the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling in the transverse field Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A defect density which quantifies the deviation from the spin ground state characterizes non-equilibrium dynamics during phase transitions. The widely recognized Kibble-Zurek scaling predicts how the defect density evolves during phase transitions. However, it can be perturbed by a noise, leading to the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. In this research, we analytically investigate the effect of Gaussian white noise on the transition probabilities of the Landau-Zener model. We apply this analysis to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and obtain an analytical approximate solution of the defect density. Our analysis reveals that when the introduced noise is small, the model follows the previously known anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. Conversely, when the noise increases, the scaling can be obtained by using the adiabatic approximation. This result indicates that deriving the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling does not require solving differential equations, instead, it can be achieved simply by applying the adiabatic approximation. Furthermore, we identify the parameter that minimizes the defect density based on the new scaling, which allows us to verify how effective the already known scaling of the optimized parameter is.</description>

Abstract: Quantum processing units will be modules of larger information processing systems containing also digital and analog electronics modules. Silicon-based quantum computing offers the enticing opportunity to manufacture all the modules using the same technology platform. Here, we present a cryogenic multi-module assembly for multiplexed readout of silicon quantum devices where all modules have been fabricated using the same fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS process. The assembly is constituted by three chiplets: (i) a low-noise amplifier (LNA), (ii) a single-pole eight-throw switch (SP8T), and (iii) a silicon quantum dot (QD) array. We integrate the chiplets into modules and show respectively, (i) a peak gain over 35dB with a 3dB bandwidth from 709MHz to 827MHz and an average noise temperature of 6.2K (minimum 4.2K), (ii) an insertion loss smaller than 1.1dB and a noise temperature less than 1.1K over the 0-2GHz range, and (iii) single-electron box (SEB) charge sensors. Finally, we combine all modules into a single demonstration showing time-domain radio-frequency multiplexing of two SEBs paving the way to an all-silicon quantum computing system.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of acceleration and rotation by interfering magnetically-launched atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of inertial quantities is essential in geophysics, geodesy, fundamental physics and navigation. For instance, inertial navigation systems require stable inertial sensors to compute the position and attitude of the carrier. Here, we present an architecture for a compact cold-atom accelerometer-gyroscope based on a magnetically launched atom interferometer. Characterizing the launching technique, we demonstrate 700 ppm gyroscope scale factor stability over one day, while acceleration and rotation rate bias stabilities of $7 \times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ rad/s are reached after two days of integration of the cold-atom sensor. Hybridizing it with a classical accelerometer and gyroscope, we correct their drift and bias to achieve respective 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the classical ones. Compared to state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our launching technique make this architecture easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway towards autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty relations for quantum measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current study aims to examine uncertainty relations for measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames. Informationally overcomplete measurements are a valuable tool in quantum information processing, including tomography and state estimation. The maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases are the most common case of such measurements. The existence of $d+1$ mutually unbiased bases is proved for $d$ being a prime power. More general classes of informationally overcomplete measurements have been proposed for various purposes. Measurements of interest are typically characterized by some inner structure maintaining the required properties. It leads to restrictions imposed on generated probabilities. To apply the considered measurements, these restrictions should be converted into information-theoretic terms. It is interesting that certain restrictions hold irrespectively to overcompleteness. To describe the amount of uncertainty quantitatively, we use the Tsallis and R\'{e}nyi entropies as well as probabilities of separate outcomes. The obtained results are based on estimation of the index of coincidence. The derived relations are briefly exemplified.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantum field theory of tachyons is unphysical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tachyons have fascinated generations of physicists due to their peculiar behavior, but they did not solve any real physical problem. This changed with the recent work of Dragan and Ekert, who have shown that superluminal observers may be related to the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM), since they require introducing non-determinism and wave-like behavior at the fundamental level. In fact, both classical and quantum field theory of tachyons have been constructed. Unfortunately, we will show that the latter theory contains several flaws, mostly caused by adapting incorrect results due to other authors, which puts the aforementioned program in question. In particular, unlike Feinberg, we show that tachyon microcausality violation spoils fundamental features of QFT such as statistical independence of distant measurements, and it negatively affects constructing Lorentz invariant scattering theory of tachyons. Moreover, the Feynman propagator, which was adapted from Dhar and Sudarshan, is shown to violate unitarity, the tachyonic vacuum is unstable due to radiatively generated tachyon self-interactions, and an interpolating tachyon field likely does not satisfy the LSZ asymptotic condition. Our analysis indicates that a covariant QFT of tachyons seems impossible, hence superluminal observers are unphysical and cannot be used to derive QM.</description>

      <title>Witnessing mass-energy equivalence with trapped atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an experimental setup to probe the interplay between the quantum superposition principle and the gravitational time dilation arising from the mass-energy equivalence. It capitalizes on state-of-the-art atom interferometers that can keep atoms trapped in a superposition of heights in Earth's gravitational field for exceedingly long times reaching minute-scale. Our proposal consists of adding two additional laser pulses to the existing setups that would set up a clock trapped at a superposition of heights reading a quantum superposition of relativistic proper times. We develop a method to include relativistic corrections to Bloch oscillations which describe the trapped part of the interferometer. As a result, we derive all the trajectories arising in this setup, the phases acquired by different trajectories in the interferometer, and demonstrate that the effect of superposition of proper times would manifest itself in the interference pattern in two distinct ways: as visibility modulations, and as a shift of the resonant frequency of the atom. We argue that the latter might be observable with current technology.</description>

      <title>Circuit Partitioning and Transmission Cost Optimization in Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the limitations on the number of qubits in current NISQ devices, the implementation of large-scale quantum algorithms on such devices is challenging, prompting research into distributed quantum computing. This paper focuses on the issue of excessive communication complexity in distributed quantum computing oriented towards quantum circuits. To reduce the number of quantum state transmissions, i.e., the transmission cost, in distributed quantum circuits, a circuit partitioning method based on the QUBO model is proposed, coupled with the lookahead method for transmission cost optimization. Initially, the problem of distributed quantum circuit partitioning is transformed into a graph minimum cut problem. The QUBO model, which can be accelerated by quantum algorithms, is introduced to minimize the number of quantum gates between QPUs and the transmission cost. Subsequently, the dynamic lookahead strategy for the selection of transmission qubits is proposed to optimize the transmission cost in distributed quantum circuits. Finally, through numerical simulations, the impact of different circuit partitioning indicators on the transmission cost is explored, and the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed circuit partitioning method has a shorter runtime compared with current circuit partitioning methods. Additionally, the transmission cost optimized by the proposed method is significantly lower than that of current transmission cost optimization methods, achieving noticeable improvements across different numbers of partitions.</description>

      <title>Reliability Function of Classical-Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the reliability function of general classical-quantum channels, which describes the optimal exponent of the decay of decoding error when the communication rate is below the capacity. As main result, we prove a lower bound, in terms of the quantum Renyi information in Petz's form, for the reliability function. This resolves Holevo's conjecture proposed in 2000, a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory. It turns out that the obtained lower bound matches the upper bound derived by Dalai in 2013, when the communication rate is above a critical value. Thus we have determined the reliability function in this high-rate case. Our approach relies on Renes' breakthrough made in 2022, which relates classical-quantum channel coding to that of privacy amplification, as well as our new characterization of the channel Renyi information.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Quantum Control Gates for Functional MRI Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex problems intractable for classical computers, particularly in popular fields such as cryptography, optimization, and neurocomputing. In this paper, we present a new quantum-based approach named the Hierarchical Quantum Control Gates (HQCG) method for efficient understanding of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. This approach includes two novel modules: the Local Quantum Control Gate (LQCG) and the Global Quantum Control Gate (GQCG), which are designed to extract local and global features of fMRI signals, respectively. Our method operates end-to-end on a quantum machine, leveraging quantum mechanics to learn patterns within extremely high-dimensional fMRI signals, such as 30,000 samples which is a challenge for classical computers. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms classical methods. Additionally, we found that the proposed quantum model is more stable and less prone to overfitting than the classical methods.</description>

      <title>Stationary states of boundary driven quantum systems: some exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study finite-dimensional open quantum systems whose density matrix evolves via a Lindbladian, $\dot{\rho}=-i[H,\rho]+{\mathcal D}\rho$. Here $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the isolated system and ${\mathcal D}$ is the dissipator. We consider the case where the system consists of two parts, the "boundary'' $A$ and the ``bulk'' $B$, and ${\mathcal D}$ acts only on $A$, so ${\mathcal D}={\mathcal D}_A\otimes{\mathcal I}_B$, where ${\mathcal D}_A$ acts only on part $A$, while ${\mathcal I}_B$ is the identity superoperator on part $B$. Let ${\mathcal D}_A$ be ergodic, so ${\mathcal D}_A\hat{\rho}_A=0$ only for one unique density matrix $\hat{\rho}_A$. We show that any stationary density matrix $\bar{\rho}$ on the full system which commutes with $H$ must be of the product form $\bar{\rho}=\hat{\rho}_A\otimes\rho_B$ for some $\rho_B$. This rules out finding any ${\mathcal D}_A$ that has the Gibbs measure $\rho_\beta\sim e^{-\beta H}$ as a stationary state with $\beta\neq 0$, unless there is no interaction between parts $A$ and $B$. We give criteria for the uniqueness of the stationary state $\bar{\rho}$ for systems with interactions between $A$ and $B$. Related results for non-ergodic cases are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Nonexponential decay law of the 2P-1S transition of the H-atom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate numerically the survival probability $P(t)$ for the unstable 2P excited state of the hydrogen atom, which decays into the ground-state 1S emitting one photon ($\tau \sim 1.595$ ns), thus extending the analytic study of Facchi and Pascazio, Physics Letters A 241 (1998). To this end, we first determine the analytic expression of the spectral function of the unstable state, which allows for an accurate evaluation of $P(t)$. As expected, for short and long times $P(t)$ shows deviations from the exponential law: a `Zeno' region occurs at extremely short times (up to $\sim 0.3$ attosec, followed by a longer `anti-Zeno' domain (up to $\sim 50$ attosec); at long times above $125 \tau$, the decay law scales as $t^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Temperature shift of magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence features of nitrogen-vacancy ensembles in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently significant attention has been paid to magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence (PL) features of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. These features are used for microwave-free sensing and are indicative of the spin-bath properties in the diamond sample. Examinating the temperature dependence of the PL features allows to identify both temperature dependent and independent features, and to utilize them in diamond-based quantum sensing and dynamic nuclear polarization applications. Here, we study the thermal variability of many different features visible in a wide range of magnetic fields. To this end, we first discuss the origin of the features and tentatively assign the previously unidentified features to cross relaxation of NV center containing multi-spin systems. The experimental results are compared with theoretically predicted temperature shifts deduced from a combination of thermal expansion and electron-phonon interactions. A deeper insight into the thermal behavior of a wide array of the features may come with important consequences for various applications in high-precision NV thermometry, gyroscopes, solid-state clocks, and biomagnetic measurements.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Scully-Dr\"uhl-type quantum erasers on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum circuit that genuinely implements the Scully-Dr\"uhl-type delayed-choice quantum eraser, where the two recorders of the which-way information directly interact with the signal qubit and remain spatially separated. Experiments conducted on IBM Quantum and IonQ processors demonstrate that the recovery of interference patterns, to varying degrees, aligns closely with theoretical predictions, despite the presence of systematic errors. This quantum circuit-based approach, more manageable and versatile than traditional optical experiments, facilitates arbitrary adjustment of the erasure and enables a true random choice in a genuine delayed-choice manner. On the IBM Quantum platform, delay gates can be employed to further defer the random choice, thereby amplifying the retrocausal effect. Since gate operations are executed sequentially in time, the system does not have any involvement of random choice until after the signal qubit has been measured, therefore eliminating any potential philosophical loopholes regarding retrocausality that might exist in other experimental setups. Remarkably, quantum erasure is achieved with delay times up to $\sim1\,\mu\text{s}$ without noticeable decoherence, a feat challenging to replicate in optical setups.</description>

      <title>CompressedMediQ: Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Pipeline for High-Dimensional Neuroimaging Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces CompressedMediQ, a novel hybrid quantum-classical machine learning pipeline specifically developed to address the computational challenges associated with high-dimensional multi-class neuroimaging data analysis. Standard neuroimaging datasets, such as large-scale MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia (NIFD), present significant hurdles due to their vast size and complexity. CompressedMediQ integrates classical high-performance computing (HPC) nodes for advanced MRI pre-processing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-PCA-based feature extraction and reduction, addressing the limited-qubit availability for quantum data encoding in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era. This is followed by Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) classification. By utilizing quantum kernel methods, the pipeline optimizes feature mapping and classification, enhancing data separability and outperforming traditional neuroimaging analysis techniques. Experimental results highlight the pipeline's superior accuracy in dementia staging, validating the practical use of quantum machine learning in clinical diagnostics. Despite the limitations of NISQ devices, this proof-of-concept demonstrates the transformative potential of quantum-enhanced learning, paving the way for scalable and precise diagnostic tools in healthcare and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Shadow Quantum Linear Solver: A Resource Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Linear Systems of Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the solution to linear systems is at the heart of many applications in science and technology. Over the years a number of algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem on a digital quantum device, yet most of these are too demanding to be applied to the current noisy hardware. In this work, an original algorithmic procedure to solve the Quantum Linear System Problem (QLSP) is presented, which combines ideas from Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) and the framework of classical shadows. The result is the Shadow Quantum Linear Solver (SQLS), a quantum algorithm solving the QLSP avoiding the need for large controlled unitaries, requiring a number of qubits that is logarithmic in the system size. In particular, our heuristics show an exponential advantage of the SQLS in circuit execution per cost function evaluation when compared to other notorious variational approaches to solving linear systems of equations. We test the convergence of the SQLS on a number of linear systems, and results highlight how the theoretical bounds on the number of resources used by the SQLS are conservative. Finally, we apply this algorithm to a physical problem of practical relevance, by leveraging decomposition theorems from linear algebra to solve the discretized Laplace Equation in a 2D grid for the first time using a hybrid quantum algorithm.</description>

      <title>Control of solid-state nuclear spin qubits using an electron spin-1/2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum registers consisting of optically active electron spins with nearby nuclear spins are promising building blocks for future quantum technologies. For electron spin-1 registers, dynamical decoupling (DD) quantum gates have been developed that enable the precise control of multiple nuclear spin qubits. However, for the important class of electron spin-1/2 systems, this control method suffers from intrinsic selectivity limitations, resulting in reduced nuclear spin gate fidelities. Here we demonstrate improved control of single nuclear spins by an electron spin-1/2 using Dynamically Decoupled Radio Frequency (DDRF) gates. We make use of the electron spin-1/2 of a diamond tin-vacancy center, showing high-fidelity single-qubit gates, single-shot readout, and spin coherence beyond a millisecond. The DD control is used as a benchmark to observe and control a single carbon-13 nuclear spin. Using the DDRF control method, we demonstrate improved control on that spin. In addition, we find and control an additional nuclear spin that is insensitive to the DD control method. Using these DDRF gates, we show entanglement between the electron and the nuclear spin with 72(3)% state fidelity. Our extensive simulations indicate that DDRF gate fidelities well in excess are feasible. Finally, we employ time-resolved photon detection during readout to quantify the hyperfine coupling for the electron's optically excited state. Our work provides key insights into the challenges and opportunities for nuclear spin control in electron spin-1/2 systems, opening the door to multi-qubit experiments on these promising qubit platforms.</description>

Abstract: Echo state property (ESP) is a fundamental property that allows an input-driven dynamical system to perform information processing tasks. Recently, extensions of ESP to potentially nonstationary systems and subsystems, that is, nonstationary ESP and subset/subspace ESP, have been proposed. In this paper, we theoretically and numerically analyze the sufficient and necessary conditions for a quantum system to satisfy nonstationary ESP and subset/subspace nonstationary ESP. Based on extensive usage of the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) form, we find that (1) the interaction with a quantum-coherent environment, termed $\textit{coherence influx}$, is indispensable in realizing nonstationary ESP, and (2) the spectral radius of PTM can characterize the fading memory property of quantum reservoir computing (QRC). Our numerical experiment, involving a system with a Hamiltonian that entails a spin-glass/many-body localization phase, reveals that the spectral radius of PTM can describe the dynamical phase transition intrinsic to such a system. To comprehensively understand the mechanisms under ESP of QRC, we propose a simplified model, multiplicative reservoir computing (mRC), which is a reservoir computing (RC) system with a one-dimensional multiplicative input. Theoretically and numerically, we show that the parameters corresponding to the spectral radius and coherence influx in mRC directly correlates with its linear memory capacity (MC). Our findings about QRC and mRC will provide a theoretical aspect of PTM and the input multiplicativity of QRC. The results will lead to a better understanding of QRC and information processing in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Tunneling of Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.15298v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his celebrated textbook, $\textit{Quantum Mechanics: Nonrelativistic Theory}$, Landau argued that, for single particle systems in 1D, tunneling probability remains the same for a particle incident from the left or the right of a barrier. This left-right symmetry of tunneling probability holds regardless of the shape of the potential barrier. However, there are a variety of known cases that break this symmetry, e.g. when observing composite particles. We computationally (and analytically, in the simplest case) show this breaking of the left-right tunneling symmetry for Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in 1D, modelled by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). By varying $g$, the parameter of inter-particle interaction in the BEC, we demonstrate that the transition from symmetric ($g=0$) to asymmetric tunneling is a threshold phenomenon. Our computations employ experimentally feasible parameters such that these results may be experimentally demonstrated in the near future. We conclude by suggesting applications of the phenomena to design atomtronic diodes, synthetic gauge fields, Maxwell's demons, and black-hole analogues.</description>

      <title>Probing multi-mobility edges in quasiperiodic mosaic lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mobility edge (ME) is a crucial concept in understanding localization physics, marking the critical transition between extended and localized states in the energy spectrum. Anderson localization scaling theory predicts the absence of ME in lower dimensional systems. Hence, the search for exact MEs, particularly for single particles in lower dimensions, has recently garnered significant interest in both theoretical and experimental studies, resulting in notable progress. However, several open questions remain, including the possibility of a single system exhibiting multiple MEs and the continual existence of extended states, even within the strong disorder domain. Here, we provide experimental evidence to address these questions by utilizing a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice with meticulously designed nanophotonic circuits. Our observations demonstrate the coexistence of both extended and localized states in lattices with broken duality symmetry and varying modulation periods. By single site injection and scanning the disorder level, we could approximately probe the ME of the modulated lattice. These results corroborate recent theoretical predictions, introduce a new avenue for investigating ME physics, and offer inspiration for further exploration of ME physics in the quantum regime using hybrid integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Signature of attochemical quantum interference upon ionization and excitation of an electronic wavepacket in fluoro-benzene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort pulses can excite or ionize molecules and populate coherent electronic wavepackets, inducing complex dynamics. In this work, we simulate the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics upon ionization to different electronic wavepackets of (deuterated) benzene and fluoro-benzene molecules, quantum mechanically and in full dimensionality. In fluoro-benzene, the calculations unravel both inter-state and intra-state quantum interferences that leave clear signatures of attochemistry and charge-directed dynamics in the shape of the autocorrelation function. The latter are in agreement with experimental high harmonic spectroscopy measurements of benzenes and fluoro-benzene.</description>

      <title>Sonoluminescence: Photon production in time dependent analog system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sonoluminescence is a well known laboratory phenomenon where an oscillating gas bubble in the appropriate environment periodically emits a flash of light in the visible frequency range. In this submission, we study the system in the framework of analog gravity. We model the oscillating bubble in terms of analog geometry and propose a non-minimal coupling prescription of the electromagnetic field with the geometry. The geometry behaves as an analogous oscillating time dependent background in which repeated flux of photons are produced in a wide frequency range through parametric resonance from quantum vacuum. Due to our numerical limitation, we could reach the frequency up to $\sim 10^5 ~\mbox{m}^{-1}$. However, we numerically fit the spectrum in a polynomial form including the observed frequency range around $\sim 10^7 ~\mbox{m}^{-1}$. Our current analysis seems to suggest that parametric resonance in analog background may play a fundamental role in explaining such phenomena in the quantum field theory framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Wigner chain in a periodic potential is a paradigmatic example of geometric frustration with long-range interactions. The dynamics emulates the Frenkel-Kontorova model with Coulomb interactions. In the continuum approximation, dislocations are sine-Gordon solitons with power-law decaying tails. We show that their action is mapped into a massive, long-range (1+1) Thirring model, where the solitons are charged fermionic excitations over an effective Dirac sea. We identify the corresponding mean field theory and show that the Coulomb interactions destabilize structures commensurate with the periodic substrate, suppressing their onset and giving rise to {\it interaction-induced} lubrication. Our study identifies the role of long-range interactions on determining nanofriction. Our predictions can be probed in state-of-the-art trapped ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Floer theory I: exponential integrals in finite and infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first of the series of papers devoted to our project ``Holomorphic Floer Theory" we discuss exponential integrals and related wall-crossing structures. We emphasize two points of view on the subject: the one based on the ideas of deformation quantization and the one based on the ideas of Floer theory. Their equivalence is a corollary of our generalized Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. In the case of exponential integrals this amounts to several comparison isomorphisms between local and global versions of de Rham and Betti cohomology. We develop the corresponding theories in particular generalizing Morse-Novikov theory to the holomorphic case. We prove that arising wall-crossing structures are analytic. As a corollary, perturbative expansions of exponential integrals are resurgent. Based on a careful study of finite-dimensional exponential integrals we propose a conjectural approach to infinite-dimensional exponential integrals. We illustrate this approach in the case of Feynman path integral with holomorphic Lagrangian boundary conditions as well as in the case of the complexified Chern-Simons theory. We discuss the arising perverse sheaf of infinite rank as well as analyticity of the corresponding ``Chern-Simons wall-crossing structure". We develop a general theory of quantum wave functions and show that in the case of Chern-Simons theory it gives an alternative description of the Chern-Simons wall-crossing structure based on the notion of generalized Nahm sum. We propose several conjectures about analyticity and resurgence of the corresponding perturbative series.</description>

      <title>Total and Symmetry resolved Entanglement spectra in some Fermionic CFTs from the BCFT approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the universal total and symmetry-resolved entanglement spectra for a single interval of some $2$d Fermionic CFTs using the Boundary Conformal Field theory (BCFT) approach. In this approach, the partition of Hilbert space is achieved by cutting out discs around the entangling boundary points and imposing boundary conditions preserving the extended symmetry under scrutiny. The reduced density moments are then related to the BCFT partition functions and are also found to be diagonal in the symmetry charge sectors. In particular, we first study the entanglement spectra of massless Dirac fermion and modular invariant $Z_2$-gauged Dirac fermion by considering the boundary conditions preserving either the axial or the vector $U(1)$ symmetry. The total entanglement spectra of the modular invariant Dirac fermion are shown to match with the compact boson result at the Bose-Fermi duality radius, while for the massless Dirac fermion, it is found that the boundary entropy term doesn't match with the self-dual compact boson. The symmetry-resolved entanglement is found to be the same in all cases, except for the charge spectrum which is dependent on both the symmetry and the theory. We also study the entanglement spectra of $N$ massless Dirac fermions by considering boundary conditions preserving different chiral $U(1)^N$ symmetries. Entanglement spectra are studied for $U(1)^M$ subgroups, where $M\leq N$, by imposing boundary conditions preserving different chiral symmetries. The total entanglement spectra are found to be sensitive to the representations of the $U(1)^M$ symmetry in the boundary theory among other behaviours at $O(1)$. Similar results are also found for the Symmetry resolved entanglement entropies. The characteristic $\log\log\left(\ell/\epsilon\right)$ term of the $U(1)$ symmetry is found to be proportional to $M$ in the symmetry-resolved entanglement spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new fifth force between particles carrying $B-L$ charges is well-motivated by the intriguing $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the standard model. The gauge boson mediator, F\'eeton, also serves as a dark matter candidate. In this letter, we propose a novel experimental design to detect the quantum phase difference caused by this fifth force using a superconducting Josephson junction. We find that the experiment has the best sensitivity to the gauge coupling when the gauge boson is within the mass range of $0.01\,$eV to $10\,$eV, which is an interesting mass region for the F\'eeton dark matter. This opens up a new avenue for the measurement of new physics at small scale below millimeter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy of local-operator-excited states for replica index $n$ can be a sign of quantum chaos. As concrete examples, we analyze the logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy in various two-dimensional conformal field theories. We show that there are always logarithmic singularities of the Renyi entropy in holographic CFTs, but no such singularities in free and rational CFTs. These singularities of the Renyi entropy are also related to the logarithmic time growth of the Renyi entropy at late times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of extensive many-body Hamiltonians with few-body interactions and a many-body mobility edge: all eigenstates below a nonzero energy density are localized in an exponentially small fraction of "energetically allowed configurations" within Hilbert space. Our construction is based on quantum perturbations to a classical low-density parity check code. In principle, it is possible to detect this eigenstate localization by measuring few-body correlation functions in efficiently preparable mixed states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the N-partite coherences of GHZ and W states for free bosonic and fermionic fields when any n observers hover near the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. We derive the more general analytical expressions for N-partite coherence, encompassing both physically accessible and inaccessible coherences in the context of the dilaton black hole. It has been found that the coherence of the bosonic field is greater than that of the fermionic field, while the entanglement of the fermionic field is greater than that of the bosonic field in dilaton spacetime. Additionally, the coherence of the W state is greater than that of the GHZ state, whereas the entanglement of the GHZ state is greater than that of the W state in curved spacetime. These results suggest that we should utilize suitable quantum resources and different types of particles for relativistic quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, it is shown that the improvements can be introduced into the current models of ideal Fermi and ideal gas to take into account the quantum nature of phase space related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. Hamiltonian operator of a gas particle and its eigenstates are firstly determined and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamics properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the grand canonical potential, the thermodynamic particles number, the internal energy, the Von Neumann entropy and the pressure as well as the state equations, corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperature and for confined volume. They permit in particular to highlight the existence of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamics functions and variables are directly related to the momenta quantum statistical variances. Well-known relations corresponding to classical ideal gas model can be retrieved from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperature and for large volume.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in quantum system driven by heavy-tailed stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastically driven non-equilibrium quantum system where the driving protocols consist of hopping and waiting processes. The waiting times between two hopping processes satisfy a heavy-tailed distribution. By calculating the squared width of the wavepackets, our findings demonstrate the emergence of various anomalous transport phenomenons when the system remains unchanged within the heavy-tailed regime, including superdiffusive, subdiffusive, and standard diffusive motion. Only subdiffusion occurs when the system has evolved during the waiting process. All these transport behaviors are accompanied by a breakdown of ergodicity, highlighting the complex dynamics induced by the stochastic driving mechanism.</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While the counterexamples of the instability were observed in several literates, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we provide a systematic understanding that the robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in a Hermitian system with chiral symmetry against stacking. We clarify that the robustness generally originates from level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system derived from Hermitization. We demonstrate this by treating a class DIII superconductor in 1D with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and the corresponding non-Hermitian 1D system in class AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>

      <title>Reality of the Eigenvalues of the Hilbert-P\'olya Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent manuscript~[J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 235204 (2024)], a candidate Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture was introduced. Here, we elegantly demonstrate the existence of a well-defined similarity transformation of the candidate Hamiltonian, whose eigenfunctions are square-integrable and, crucially, whose eigenvalues are real. This represents a significant step toward proving the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Many-body phases from effective geometrical frustration and long-range interactions in a subwavelength lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometrical frustration and long-range couplings are key contributors to create quantum phases with different properties throughout physics. We propose a scheme where both ingredients naturally emerge in a Raman induced subwavelength lattice. We first demonstrate that Raman-coupled multicomponent quantum gases can realize a highly versatile frustrated Hubbard Hamiltonian with long-range interactions. The deeply subwavelength lattice period leads to strong long-range interparticle repulsion with tunable range and decay. We numerically demonstrate that the combination of frustration and long-range couplings generates many-body phases of bosons, including a range of density-wave and superfluid phases with broken translational and time reversal symmetries, respectively. Our results thus represent a powerful approach for efficiently combining long-range interactions and frustration in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>

      <title>Unique and Universal scaling in dynamical quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universality and scaling are fundamental concepts in equilibrium continuous phase transitions. Here, we unveil a unique and universal scaling behavior of the critical time in slowly driven dynamical quantum phase transition. Going beyond the analogy with equilibrium phase transition, we find that the critical time exhibits a power-law scaling with quenching rate and the scaling exponent is fully determined by underlining universality class. We explain this unique scaling behavior based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. This universal scaling behavior is verified to be valid not only in noninteracting single-particle system, but also in many-body interacting system, and not only in Hermitian system, but also in non-Hermitian system. Our study unravels a deep and fundamental relationship between dynamical phase transition and equilibrium phase tranition.</description>
