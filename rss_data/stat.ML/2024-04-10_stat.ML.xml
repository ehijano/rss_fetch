      <title>A Copula Graphical Model for Multi-Attribute Data using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by modern data forms such as images and multi-view data, the multi-attribute graphical model aims to explore the conditional independence structure among vectors. Under the Gaussian assumption, the conditional independence between vectors is characterized by blockwise zeros in the precision matrix. To relax the restrictive Gaussian assumption, in this paper, we introduce a novel semiparametric multi-attribute graphical model based on a new copula named Cyclically Monotone Copula. This new copula treats the distribution of the node vectors as multivariate marginals and transforms them into Gaussian distributions based on the optimal transport theory. Since the model allows the node vectors to have arbitrary continuous distributions, it is more flexible than the classical Gaussian copula method that performs coordinatewise Gaussianization. We establish the concentration inequalities of the estimated covariance matrices and provide sufficient conditions for selection consistency of the group graphical lasso estimator. For the setting with high-dimensional attributes, a {Projected Cyclically Monotone Copula} model is proposed to address the curse of dimensionality issue that arises from solving high-dimensional optimal transport problems. Numerical results based on synthetic and real data show the efficiency and flexibility of our methods.</description>

      <title>The CAST package for training and assessment of spatial prediction models in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One key task in environmental science is to map environmental variables continuously in space or even in space and time. Machine learning algorithms are frequently used to learn from local field observations to make spatial predictions by estimating the value of the variable of interest in places where it has not been measured. However, the application of machine learning strategies for spatial mapping involves additional challenges compared to "non-spatial" prediction tasks that often originate from spatial autocorrelation and from training data that are not independent and identically distributed.
  In the past few years, we developed a number of methods to support the application of machine learning for spatial data which involves the development of suitable cross-validation strategies for performance assessment and model selection, spatial feature selection, and methods to assess the area of applicability of the trained models. The intention of the CAST package is to support the application of machine learning strategies for predictive mapping by implementing such methods and making them available for easy integration into modelling workflows.
  Here we introduce the CAST package and its core functionalities. At the case study of mapping plant species richness, we will go through the different steps of the modelling workflow and show how CAST can be used to support more reliable spatial predictions.</description>

      <title>Quiver Laplacians and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of selecting the most relevant features of a given dataset arises ubiquitously in data analysis and dimensionality reduction. However, features found to be of high importance for the entire dataset may not be relevant to subsets of interest, and vice versa. Given a feature selector and a fixed decomposition of the data into subsets, we describe a method for identifying selected features which are compatible with the decomposition into subsets. We achieve this by re-framing the problem of finding compatible features to one of finding sections of a suitable quiver representation. In order to approximate such sections, we then introduce a Laplacian operator for quiver representations valued in Hilbert spaces. We provide explicit bounds on how the spectrum of a quiver Laplacian changes when the representation and the underlying quiver are modified in certain natural ways. Finally, we apply this machinery to the study of peak-calling algorithms which measure chromatin accessibility in single-cell data. We demonstrate that eigenvectors of the associated quiver Laplacian yield locally and globally compatible features.</description>

      <title>DiffObs: Generative Diffusion for Global Forecasting of Satellite Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an autoregressive generative diffusion model (DiffObs) to predict the global evolution of daily precipitation, trained on a satellite observational product, and assessed with domain-specific diagnostics. The model is trained to probabilistically forecast day-ahead precipitation. Nonetheless, it is stable for multi-month rollouts, which reveal a qualitatively realistic superposition of convectively coupled wave modes in the tropics. Cross-spectral analysis confirms successful generation of low frequency variations associated with the Madden--Julian oscillation, which regulates most subseasonal to seasonal predictability in the observed atmosphere, and convectively coupled moist Kelvin waves with approximately correct dispersion relationships. Despite secondary issues and biases, the results affirm the potential for a next generation of global diffusion models trained on increasingly sparse, and increasingly direct and differentiated observations of the world, for practical applications in subseasonal and climate prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing deep neural networks is one of the main tasks in successful deep learning. Current state-of-the-art optimizers are adaptive gradient-based optimization methods such as Adam. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in formulating gradient-based optimizers in a probabilistic framework for better estimation of gradients and modeling uncertainties. Here, we propose to combine both approaches, resulting in the Variational Stochastic Gradient Descent (VSGD) optimizer. We model gradient updates as a probabilistic model and utilize stochastic variational inference (SVI) to derive an efficient and effective update rule. Further, we show how our VSGD method relates to other adaptive gradient-based optimizers like Adam. Lastly, we carry out experiments on two image classification datasets and four deep neural network architectures, where we show that VSGD outperforms Adam and SGD.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent is Pareto-Optimal in the Oracle Complexity and Memory Tradeoff for Feasibility Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide oracle complexity lower bounds for finding a point in a given set using a memory-constrained algorithm that has access to a separation oracle. We assume that the set is contained within the unit $d$-dimensional ball and contains a ball of known radius $\epsilon&gt;0$. This setup is commonly referred to as the feasibility problem. We show that to solve feasibility problems with accuracy $\epsilon \geq e^{-d^{o(1)}}$, any deterministic algorithm either uses $d^{1+\delta}$ bits of memory or must make at least $1/(d^{0.01\delta }\epsilon^{2\frac{1-\delta}{1+1.01 \delta}-o(1)})$ oracle queries, for any $\delta\in[0,1]$. Additionally, we show that randomized algorithms either use $d^{1+\delta}$ memory or make at least $1/(d^{2\delta} \epsilon^{2(1-4\delta)-o(1)})$ queries for any $\delta\in[0,\frac{1}{4}]$. Because gradient descent only uses linear memory $\mathcal O(d\ln 1/\epsilon)$ but makes $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ queries, our results imply that it is Pareto-optimal in the oracle complexity/memory tradeoff. Further, our results show that the oracle complexity for deterministic algorithms is always polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ if the algorithm has less than quadratic memory in $d$. This reveals a sharp phase transition since with quadratic $\mathcal O(d^2 \ln1/\epsilon)$ memory, cutting plane methods only require $\mathcal O(d\ln 1/\epsilon)$ queries.</description>

      <title>FiP: a Fixed-Point Approach for Causal Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling true world data-generating processes lies at the heart of empirical science. Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and their associated Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) provide an increasingly popular answer to such problems by defining the causal generative process that transforms random noise into observations. However, learning them from observational data poses an ill-posed and NP-hard inverse problem in general. In this work, we propose a new and equivalent formalism that do not require DAGs to describe them, viewed as fixed-point problems on the causally ordered variables, and show three important cases where they can be uniquely recovered given the topological ordering (TO). To the best of our knowledge, we obtain the most general recovery results when the TO is known. Based on our theoretical findings, we design a two-stage causal generative model that first infers the causal order from observations in a zero-shot manner, thus by-passing the search, and then learns the generative fixed-point SCM on the ordered variables. To infer TOs from observations, we propose to amortize the learning of TOs on generated datasets by sequentially predicting the leaves of graphs seen during training. To learn fixed-point SCMs, we design a transformer-based architecture that exploits a new attention mechanism enabling the modeling of causal structures, and show that this parameterization is consistent with our formalism. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of each method individually, and show that when combined, our model outperforms various baselines on generated out-of-distribution problems.</description>

      <title>On Regression in Extreme Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The statistical learning problem consists in building a predictive function $\hat{f}$ based on independent copies of $(X,Y)$ so that $Y$ is approximated by $\hat{f}(X)$ with minimum (squared) error. Motivated by various applications, special attention is paid here to the case of extreme (i.e. very large) observations $X$. Because of their rarity, the contributions of such observations to the (empirical) error is negligible, and the predictive performance of empirical risk minimizers can be consequently very poor in extreme regions. In this paper, we develop a general framework for regression on extremes. Under appropriate regular variation assumptions regarding the pair $(X,Y)$, we show that an asymptotic notion of risk can be tailored to summarize appropriately predictive performance in extreme regions. It is also proved that minimization of an empirical and nonasymptotic version of this 'extreme risk', based on a fraction of the largest observations solely, yields good generalization capacity. In addition, numerical results providing strong empirical evidence of the relevance of the approach proposed are displayed.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Estimates of Shapley Values with Control Variates</title>

Abstract: Shapley values are among the most popular tools for explaining predictions of blackbox machine learning models. However, their high computational cost motivates the use of sampling approximations, inducing a considerable degree of uncertainty. To stabilize these model explanations, we propose ControlSHAP, an approach based on the Monte Carlo technique of control variates. Our methodology is applicable to any machine learning model and requires virtually no extra computation or modeling effort. On several high-dimensional datasets, we find it can produce dramatic reductions in the Monte Carlo variability of Shapley estimates.</description>

      <title>Learning Sparse Codes with Entropy-Based ELBOs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard probabilistic sparse coding assumes a Laplace prior, a linear mapping from latents to observables, and Gaussian observable distributions. We here derive a solely entropy-based learning objective for the parameters of standard sparse coding. The novel variational objective has the following features: (A) unlike MAP approximations, it uses non-trivial posterior approximations for probabilistic inference; (B) unlike for previous non-trivial approximations, the novel objective is fully analytical; and (C) the objective allows for a novel principled form of annealing. The objective is derived by first showing that the standard ELBO objective converges to a sum of entropies, which matches similar recent results for generative models with Gaussian priors. The conditions under which the ELBO becomes equal to entropies are then shown to have analytical solutions, which leads to the fully analytical objective. Numerical experiments are used to demonstrate the feasibility of learning with such entropy-based ELBOs. We investigate different posterior approximations including Gaussians with correlated latents and deep amortized approximations. Furthermore, we numerically investigate entropy-based annealing which results in improved learning. Our main contributions are theoretical, however, and they are twofold: (1) for non-trivial posterior approximations, we provide the (to the knowledge of the authors) first analytical ELBO objective for standard probabilistic sparse coding; and (2) we provide the first demonstration on how a recently shown convergence of the ELBO to entropy sums can be used for learning.</description>

      <title>A Federated Data Fusion-Based Prognostic Model for Applications with Multi-Stream Incomplete Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most prognostic methods require a decent amount of data for model training. In reality, however, the amount of historical data owned by a single organization might be small or not large enough to train a reliable prognostic model. To address this challenge, this article proposes a federated prognostic model that allows multiple users to jointly construct a failure time prediction model using their multi-stream, high-dimensional, and incomplete data while keeping each user's data local and confidential. The prognostic model first employs multivariate functional principal component analysis to fuse the multi-stream degradation signals. Then, the fused features coupled with the times-to-failure are utilized to build a (log)-location-scale regression model for failure prediction. To estimate parameters using distributed datasets and keep the data privacy of all participants, we propose a new federated algorithm for feature extraction. Numerical studies indicate that the performance of the proposed model is the same as that of classic non-federated prognostic models and is better than that of the models constructed by each user itself.</description>

      <title>A General Theory for Kernel Packets: from state space model to compactly supported basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04022v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the state space (SS) model formulation of a Gaussian process (GP) can lower its training and prediction time both to $\CalO(n)$ for $n$ data points. We prove that an $m$-dimensional SS model formulation of GP is equivalent to a concept we introduce as the general right Kernel Packet (KP): a transformation for the GP covariance $K$ such that $\sum_{i=0}^{m}a_iD_t^{(j)}K(t,t_i)=0$ holds for any $t \leq t_1$, 0 $\leq j \leq m-1$, and $m+1$ consecutive points $t_i$, where ${D}_t^{(j)}f(t) $ denotes $j$-th derivative acting on $t$. We extend this idea to the backward SS model formulation, leading to the left KP for next $m$ consecutive points: $\sum_{i=0}^{m}b_i{D}_t^{(j)}K(t,t_{m+i})=0$ for any $t\geq t_{2m}$. By combining both left and right KPs, we can prove that a suitable linear combination of these covariance functions yields $m$ KP functions compactly supported on $(t_0,t_{2m})$. KPs improve GP prediction time to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ or $\mathcal{O}(1)$, enable broader applications including GP's derivatives and kernel multiplications, and can be generalized to multi-dimensional additive and product kernels for scattered data.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Optimal Dynamic Treatment Assignment Rules under Policy Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.05031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies statistical decisions for dynamic treatment assignment problems. Many policies involve dynamics in their treatment assignments where treatments are sequentially assigned to individuals across multiple stages and the effect of treatment at each stage is usually heterogeneous with respect to the prior treatments, past outcomes, and observed covariates. We consider estimating an optimal dynamic treatment rule that guides the optimal treatment assignment for each individual at each stage based on the individual's history. This paper proposes an empirical welfare maximization approach in a dynamic framework. The approach estimates the optimal dynamic treatment rule using data from an experimental or quasi-experimental study. The paper proposes two estimation methods: one solves the treatment assignment problem at each stage through backward induction, and the other solves the whole dynamic treatment assignment problem simultaneously across all stages. We derive finite-sample upper bounds on worst-case average welfare regrets for the proposed methods and show $1/\sqrt{n}$-minimax convergence rates. We also modify the simultaneous estimation method to incorporate intertemporal budget/capacity constraints.</description>

Abstract: In the regression framework, the empirical measure based on the responses resulting from the nearest neighbors, among the covariates, to a given point $x$ is introduced and studied as a central statistical quantity. First, the associated empirical process is shown to satisfy a uniform central limit theorem under a local bracketing entropy condition on the underlying class of functions reflecting the localizing nature of the nearest neighbor algorithm. Second a uniform non-asymptotic bound is established under a well-known condition, often referred to as Vapnik-Chervonenkis, on the uniform entropy numbers. The covariance of the Gaussian limit obtained in the uniform central limit theorem is simply equal to the conditional covariance operator given the covariate value. This suggests the possibility of using standard formulas to estimate the variance by using only the nearest neighbors instead of the full data. This is illustrated on two problems: the estimation of the conditional cumulative distribution function and local linear regression.</description>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in making accurate predictions for computer vision, natural language processing, as well as science and engineering domains. However, it is also well-recognized that DNNs sometimes make unexpected, incorrect, but overconfident predictions. This can cause serious consequences in high-stake applications, such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and disaster response. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to estimate the confidence of DNN predictions beyond prediction accuracy. In recent years, many UQ methods have been developed for DNNs. It is of great practical value to systematically categorize these UQ methods and compare their advantages and disadvantages. However, existing surveys mostly focus on categorizing UQ methodologies from a neural network architecture perspective or a Bayesian perspective and ignore the source of uncertainty that each methodology can incorporate, making it difficult to select an appropriate UQ method in practice. To fill the gap, this paper presents a systematic taxonomy of UQ methods for DNNs based on the types of uncertainty sources (data uncertainty versus model uncertainty). We summarize the advantages and disadvantages of methods in each category. We show how our taxonomy of UQ methodologies can potentially help guide the choice of UQ method in different machine learning problems (e.g., active learning, robustness, and reinforcement learning).

      <title>Bridging Algorithmic Information Theory and Machine Learning: A New Approach to Kernel Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) look at Complexity from different points of view. We explore the interface between AIT and Kernel Methods (that are prevalent in ML) by adopting an AIT perspective on the problem of learning kernels from data, in kernel ridge regression, through the method of Sparse Kernel Flows. In particular, by looking at the differences and commonalities between Minimal Description Length (MDL) and Regularization in Machine Learning (RML), we prove that the method of Sparse Kernel Flows is the natural approach to adopt to learn kernels from data. This approach aligns naturally with the MDL principle, offering a more robust theoretical basis than the existing reliance on cross-validation. The study reveals that deriving Sparse Kernel Flows does not require a statistical approach; instead, one can directly engage with code-lengths and complexities, concepts central to AIT. Thereby, this approach opens the door to reformulating algorithms in machine learning using tools from AIT, with the aim of providing them a more solid theoretical foundation.</description>

      <title>Global $\mathcal{L}^2$ minimization at uniform exponential rate via geometrically adapted gradient descent in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15487v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of supervised learning in Deep Learning (DL) networks, and exploit the arbitrariness of choice in the Riemannian metric relative to which the gradient descent flow can be defined (a general fact of differential geometry). In the standard approach to DL, the gradient flow on the space of parameters (weights and biases) is defined with respect to the Euclidean metric. Here instead, we choose the gradient flow with respect to the Euclidean metric in the output layer of the DL network. This naturally induces two modified versions of the gradient descent flow in the parameter space, one adapted for the overparametrized setting, and the other for the underparametrized setting. In the overparametrized case, we prove that, provided that a rank condition holds, all orbits of the modified gradient descent drive the ${\mathcal L}^2$ cost to its global minimum at a uniform exponential convergence rate; one thereby obtains an a priori stopping time for any prescribed proximity to the global minimum. We point out relations of the latter to sub-Riemannian geometry. Moreover, we generalize the above framework to the situation in which the rank condition does not hold; in particular, we show that local equilibria can only exist if a rank loss occurs, and that generically, they are not isolated points, but elements of a critical submanifold of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Causal Representation Learning from Multiple Distributions: A General Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many problems, the measured variables (e.g., image pixels) are just mathematical functions of the hidden causal variables (e.g., the underlying concepts or objects). For the purpose of making predictions in changing environments or making proper changes to the system, it is helpful to recover the hidden causal variables $Z_i$ and their causal relations represented by graph $\mathcal{G}_Z$. This problem has recently been known as causal representation learning. This paper is concerned with a general, completely nonparametric setting of causal representation learning from multiple distributions (arising from heterogeneous data or nonstationary time series), without assuming hard interventions behind distribution changes. We aim to develop general solutions in this fundamental case; as a by product, this helps see the unique benefit offered by other assumptions such as parametric causal models or hard interventions. We show that under the sparsity constraint on the recovered graph over the latent variables and suitable sufficient change conditions on the causal influences, interestingly, one can recover the moralized graph of the underlying directed acyclic graph, and the recovered latent variables and their relations are related to the underlying causal model in a specific, nontrivial way. In some cases, each latent variable can even be recovered up to component-wise transformations. Experimental results verify our theoretical claims.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on learning from preferences and choices with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference modelling lies at the intersection of economics, decision theory, machine learning and statistics. By understanding individuals' preferences and how they make choices, we can build products that closely match their expectations, paving the way for more efficient and personalised applications across a wide range of domains. The objective of this tutorial is to present a cohesive and comprehensive framework for preference learning with Gaussian Processes (GPs), demonstrating how to seamlessly incorporate rationality principles (from economics and decision theory) into the learning process. By suitably tailoring the likelihood function, this framework enables the construction of preference learning models that encompass random utility models, limits of discernment, and scenarios with multiple conflicting utilities for both object- and label-preference. This tutorial builds upon established research while simultaneously introducing some novel GP-based models to address specific gaps in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Streamlining Ocean Dynamics Modeling with Fourier Neural Operators: A Multiobjective Hyperparameter and Architecture Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training an effective deep learning model to learn ocean processes involves careful choices of various hyperparameters. We leverage the advanced search algorithms for multiobjective optimization in DeepHyper, a scalable hyperparameter optimization software, to streamline the development of neural networks tailored for ocean modeling. The focus is on optimizing Fourier neural operators (FNOs), a data-driven model capable of simulating complex ocean behaviors. Selecting the correct model and tuning the hyperparameters are challenging tasks, requiring much effort to ensure model accuracy. DeepHyper allows efficient exploration of hyperparameters associated with data preprocessing, FNO architecture-related hyperparameters, and various model training strategies. We aim to obtain an optimal set of hyperparameters leading to the most performant model. Moreover, on top of the commonly used mean squared error for model training, we propose adopting the negative anomaly correlation coefficient as the additional loss term to improve model performance and investigate the potential trade-off between the two terms. The experimental results show that the optimal set of hyperparameters enhanced model performance in single timestepping forecasting and greatly exceeded the baseline configuration in the autoregressive rollout for long-horizon forecasting up to 30 days. Utilizing DeepHyper, we demonstrate an approach to enhance the use of FNOs in ocean dynamics forecasting, offering a scalable solution with improved precision.</description>
