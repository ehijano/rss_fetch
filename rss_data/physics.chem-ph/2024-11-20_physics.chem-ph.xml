      <title>MixPI: Mixed-Time Slicing Path Integral Software for Quantized Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD) is a well established simulation technique to compute exact equilibrium properties for a quantum system using classical trajectories in an extended phase space. Standard PIMD simulations are numerically converged by systematically increasing the number of classical 'beads' or replicas used to represent each particle in the quantum system. Currently available scientific software for PIMD simulations leverage the massively parallel (with respect to number of beads) nature of the classical PIMD Hamiltonian. For particularly high-dimensional systems, contraction schemes designed to reduce the overall number of beads per particle required to achieve numerical convergence are also frequently employed. However, these implementations all rely on using the same number of beads to represent all atoms/particles, and become inefficient in systems with a large number of atoms where only a handful contribute significant quantum effects. Mixed time slicing (mixTS) offers an alternate path to efficient PIMD simulations by providing a framework where numerical convergence can be achieved with different numbers of beads for different types of atoms. Unfortunately, mixTS is not available in existing PIMD software. In this paper, we introduce MixPI for atomistic mixTS-PIMD simulations within the open-source software package CP2K. We demonstrate the use of MixPI in two different benchmark systems: we explore the use of mixTS in computing radial distributions functions for water, and in a more significant demonstration, for a solvated Co2+ ion represented as a classical Co3+ ion in water with an explicit, quantized 1024-bead electron localized on the metal ion.</description>

      <title>Post-CCSD(T) corrections in the S66 noncovalent interactions benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For noncovalent interactions, it is generally assumed that CCSD(T) is nearly the exact solution within the 1-particle basis set. For the S66 noncovalent interactions benchmark, we present for the majority of species CCSDT and CCSDT(Q) corrections with a polarized double-zeta basis set. For hydrogen bonds, pure London complexes, and mixed-influence complexes, CCSD(T) benefits from error cancellation between (usually repulsive) higher-order triples, $T_3 - (T)$, and (almost universally attractive) connected quadruples, (Q). For $\pi$-stacking complexes, this cancellation starts breaking down and CCSD(T) overbinds; CCSD(T)$_\Lambda$ corrects the problem at the expense of London complexes. A fairly simple two-parameter model predicts CCSDT(Q)--CCSD(T) differences to 0.01 kcal/mol RMS, requiring no calculations that scale more steeply than $O(N^7)$.</description>

      <title>A polarizable CASSCF/MM approach using the interface between OpenMMPol library and CFour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a polarizable embedding quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) framework for ground- and excited-state Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) calculations on molecules within complex environments, such as biological systems. These environments are modeled using the AMOEBA polarizable force field. This approach is implemented by integrating the OpenMMPol library with the CFour quantum chemistry software suite. The implementation supports both single-point energy evaluations and geometry optimizations, facilitated by the availability of analytical gradients. We demonstrate the methodology by applying it to two distinct photoreceptors, exploring the impact of the protein environment on the structural and photophysical properties of their embedded chromophores.</description>

      <title>When Theory Meets Experiment: What Does it Take to Accurately Predict $^1$H NMR Dipolar Relaxation Rates in Neat Liquid Water from Theory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we compute the $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate of liquid water at ambient conditions. We are using structural and dynamical information from Coupled Cluster Molecular Dynamics (CCMD) trajectories generated at CCSD(T) electronic structure accuracy while considering also nuclear quantum effects in addition to consulting information from X-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Our analysis is based on a recently presented computational framework for determining the frequency-dependent NMR dipole-dipole relaxation rate of spin $1/2$ nuclei from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows for an effective disentanglement of its structural and dynamical contributions, and is including a correction for finite-size effects inherent to MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions. A close to perfect agreement with experimental relaxation data is achieved if structural and dynamical informations from CCMD trajectories are considered including a re-balancing of the rotational and translational dynamics, according to the product of the self-diffusion coefficient and the reorientational correlation time of the H-H vector $D_0\times\tau_\mathrm{HH}$. The simulations show that this balance is significantly altered when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account. Our analysis suggests that the intermolecular and intramolecular contribution to the $^1$H NMR relaxation rate of liquid water are almost similar in magnitude, unlike to what was predicted earlier from classical MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Electron Irradiation of Crystalline Nitrous Oxide Ice at Low Temperatures: Applications to Outer Solar System Planetary Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiation chemistry and physics of solid N2O have been increasingly studied due to its potential presence on the surfaces of cold, outer Solar System bodies. However, to date, no study has investigated systematically the influence of temperature on this chemistry and physics. In this present study, crystalline N2O ices were irradiated using 2 keV electrons at five different temperatures in the 20-60 K range and the radiolytic dissociation of the molecular solid (as well as the radiolytic formation of seven product molecules) was quantified through the G-value. Our results indicate that temperature does indeed play a role in the radiolytic destruction of crystalline N2O, with higher temperatures being associated with higher destruction G-values. The formation G-values of NO, NO2, N2O2, N2O3, N2O4, N2O5, and O3 were also noted to vary with temperature, with each product molecule exhibiting a distinct trend. The applications of our experimental results to further understanding solid-phase radiation chemistry in the outer Solar System are discussed.</description>

      <title>qHEOM: A Quantum Algorithm for Simulating Non-Markovian Quantum Dynamics Using the Hierarchical Equations of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers promising new avenues for tackling the long-standing challenge of simulating the quantum dynamics of complex chemical systems, particularly open quantum systems coupled to external baths. However, simulating such non-unitary dynamics on quantum computers is challenging since quantum circuits are specifically designed to carry out unitary transformations. Furthermore, chemical systems are often strongly coupled to the surrounding environment, rendering the dynamics non-Markovian and beyond the scope of Markovian quantum master equations like Lindblad or Redfield. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm designed to simulate non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. Our approach enables the implementation of arbitrary quantum master equations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We illustrate the method as applied in conjunction with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method. The effectiveness of the resulting quantum HEOM algorithm (qHEOM) is demonstrated as applied to simulations of the non-Lindbladian electronic energy and charge transfer dynamics in models of the carotenoid-porphyrin-C60 molecular triad dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.</description>

      <title>Light-Matter Interactions in Photosynthetic Protein Attached to solids and Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of light with photosynthetic proteins is an extremely efficient process and has been thoroughly investigated. However, exploring light-matter interactions in hybrid nano-solid-photosynthetic proteins is a relatively new and existing field of research. The properties of these hybrid materials significantly influence the energy levels, non-radiative energy transfer, absorption, and fluorescence of the photosynthetic proteins upon interaction with light. There is special interest in levering these light-matter interactions for applications such as photo-sensing and converting light energy to electricity. The development of efficient devices requires the formation of a junction for oriented attachment, facilitating efficient energy and electronic transfer between the solids and the proteins. This review will outline the major advancements in solid-state photosynthetic protein devices, elucidate the underlying mechanism, and assess electron transfer efficiency. Furthermore, it will explore and analyze the effect of plasmons on the enhancement of absorption, fluorescence, and photocurrent in hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Absorption cross-sections for the 5th and 6th vibrational overtones in a series of short chained alcohols using incoherent broadband cavity enhanced-absorption spectroscopy (IBBCEAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Absorption cross-sections for the 5th (6 $\leftarrow$ 0) and 6th (7 $\leftarrow$ 0) OH overtones for gas-phase methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol were measured using a slow flow cell and Incoherent Broadband Cavity-Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (IBBCEAS). Measurements were performed in two wavelength regions, 447-457 nm, and 508-518 nm, using two different instruments. The experimental results are consistent with previous computational predictions of the excitation energies for these transitions. Treating the OH stretch as a local mode allowed for calculation of the fundamental vibrational frequency ($\omega_e$), anharmonicity constant ($\omega_e x_e$), and the vertical dissociation energy (VDE) for each alcohol studied. The fundamental vibrational frequency is $3848 \pm 18 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$, $3807 \pm 55 \,\text{cm}^{-1}$, and $3813 \pm 63 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$ for methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, respectively. The anharmonicity constant was measured to be $84.8 \pm 2.1 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$, $80.2 \pm 5.9 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$, and $84.4 \pm 6.8 \, \text{cm}^{-1}$ for methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, respectively. The OH vertical dissociation energy was measured to be $499.4 \pm 18.4$ kJ/mol, $518.0 \pm 56.7$ kJ/mol, and $492.7 \pm 59.9$ kJ/mol. The spectroscopically measured values are compared to thermodynamically measured OH bond dissociation energies. The observed differences in previous measurements of the bond dissociation energies compared to the values reported herein can be explained due to the difference between vertical dissociation energies and bond dissociation energies. If the OH overtone stretching mode is excited in methanol to either the 5th or 6th overtone, the bimolecular reaction between methanol and O$_2$ becomes thermodynamically feasible and could contribute to formation of methoxy and HO$_2$ radicals under the proper combination of pressure and temperature.</description>

      <title>NEP-MB-pol: A unified machine-learned framework for fast and accurate prediction of water's thermodynamic and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water's unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties pose significant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic, and transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned potentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water's complex and subtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address this challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient neuroevolution potential (NEP) trained on extensive many-body polarization (MB-pol) reference data approaching coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined with path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to incorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces experimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of water across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and accurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring thermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with significant potential for broader applications across research fields.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Nucleation Theory for Ice Crystallization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the simplicity of the water molecule, the kinetics of ice nucleation under natural conditions can be complex. We investigated spontaneously grown ice nuclei using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and found significant differences between the kinetics of ice formation through spontaneously formed and ideal nuclei. Since classical nucleation theory can only provide a good description of ice nucleation in ideal conditions, we propose a generalized nucleation theory that can better characterize the kinetics of ice crystal nucleation in general conditions. This study provides an explanation on why previous experimental and computational studies have yielded widely varying critical nucleation sizes.</description>

      <title>Proposal on the Calculation of the Ionisation-Cluster Size Distribution (I). The Model and Its Simulation Methodology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A statistical model for the calculation of the ionisation-cluster size distribution in nanodosimetry is proposed. It is based on a canonical ensemble and derives from the well-known nuclear droplet model. The model especially can be applied to the scenario 'low energy primaries (smaller than 100 eV) moving in nanovolumes (in the order of a few nanometers)'; a scenario to which trajectory models should not be used. The focus of this work is on presenting the model and demonstrating its feasibility.</description>
