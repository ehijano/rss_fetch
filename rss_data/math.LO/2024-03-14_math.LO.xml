      <title>The Axiom of Choice in the $\kappa$-Mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usuba has asked whether the $\kappa$-mantle, the intersection of all grounds that extend to $V$ via a forcing of size ${&lt;}\kappa$, is always a model of ZFC. We give a negative answers by constructing counterexamples where $\kappa$ is a Mahlo cardinal, $\kappa=\omega_1$ and where $\kappa$ is the successor of a regular uncountable cardinal.</description>

      <title>An Iteration Theorem for $\omega_1$-preserving Forcings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an iteration theorem which guarantees for a wide class of nice iterations of $\omega_1$-preserving forcings that $\omega_1$ is not collapse, at the price of needing large cardinals to burn as fuel. More precisely, we show that a nice iteration of $\omega_1$-preserving forcings which force SRP at successor steps and preserves old stationary sets does not collapse $\omega_1$.</description>

      <title>Forcing "$\mathrm{NS}_{\omega_1}$ is $\omega_1$-dense" From Large Cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer a question of Woodin by showing that assuming an inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$ which is a limit of ${&lt;}\kappa$-supercompact cardinals exists, there is a stationary set preserving forcing $\mathbb{P}$ so that $V^{\mathbb P}\models``\mathrm{NS}_{\omega_1}\text{ is }\omega_1\text{-dense}"$. We also introduce a new forcing axiom $\mathrm{QM}$, show it is consistent assuming a supercompact limit of supercompact cardinals and prove that it implies $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathrm{max}}\text{-}(*)$. Consequently, $\mathrm{QM}$ implies ``$\mathrm{NS}_{\omega_1}$ is $\omega_1$-dense".</description>

      <title>Generalisation of proof simulation procedures for Frege systems by M.L.~Bonet and S.R.~Buss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a~generalisation of proof simulation procedures for Frege systems by Bonet and Buss to some logics for which the deduction theorem does not hold. In particular, we study the case of finite-valued \L{}ukasiewicz logics. To this end, we provide proof systems that augment Avron's Frege system for \L{}ukasiewicz three-valued logic with nested and general versions of the disjunction elimination rule, respectively. For these systems we provide upper bounds on speed-ups w.r.t.\ both the number of steps in proofs and the length of proofs. We also consider Tamminga's natural deduction and Avron's hypersequent calculus for 3-valued \L{}ukasiewicz logic and generalise our results considering the disjunction elimination rule to all finite-valued \L{}ukasiewicz logics.</description>

      <title>Non-distributive relatives of ETL and NFL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we devise non-distributive relatives of Exactly True Logic (ETL) by Pietz and Riveccio and its dual (NFL) Non-Falsity Logic by Shramko, Zaitsev and Belikov. We consider two pre-orders which are algebraic counterparts of the ETL's and NFL's entailment relations on the De Morgan lattice $\mathbf{4}$. We generalise these pre-orders and determine which distributive properties that hold on $\mathbf{4}$ are not forced by either of the pre-orders. We then construct relatives of ETL and NFL but lack such distributive properties. For these logics, we also devise a truth table semantics which uses non-distributive lattice $\mathbf{M3}$ as their lattice of truth values. We also provide analytic tableaux systems that work with sequents of the form $\phi\vdash\chi$. We also prove the correctness and completeness results for these proof systems and provide a neat generalisation for non-distributive ETL- and NFL-like logics built over a certain family of non-distributive modular lattices.</description>

      <title>The Existential Closedness and Zilber-Pink Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we survey the history of, and recent developments on, two major conjectures originating in Zilber's model-theoretic work on complex exponentiation -- Existential Closedness and Zilber-Pink. The main focus is on the modular versions of these conjectures and specifically on novel variants incorporating the derivatives of modular functions. The functional analogues of all the conjectures that we consider are theorems which are presented too. The paper also contains some new results and conjectures.</description>

      <title>On ultrafilters in ZF models and indecomposable ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use indecomposable ultrafilters to answer some questions of Hayut, Karagila paper "Spectra of uniformity". It is shown that the bound on the strength by T. Usuba "A note on uniform ultrafilters in choiceless context" is optimal.</description>

      <title>Sketches and Classifying Logoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the theory of classifying topoi for geometric theories, we define rounded sketches and logoi and provide the notion of classifying logos for a rounded sketch. Rounded sketches can be used to axiomatise all the known fragments of infinitary first order logic in $\mathbf{L}_{\infty,\infty}$, in a spectrum ranging from weaker than finitary algebraic to stronger than $\lambda$-geometric for $\lambda$ a regular cardinal. We show that every rounded sketch has an associated classifying logos, having similar properties to the classifying topos of a geometric theory. This amounts to a Diaconescu-type result for rounded sketches and (Morita small) logoi, which generalises the one for classifying topoi.</description>

      <title>Spectral Spaces in o-minimal and other NIP theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some model-theoretic notions in NIP by means of spectral topology. In the o-minimal setting we relate the o-minimal spectrum with other topological spaces such as the real spectrum and the space of infinitesimal types of Peterzil and Starchenko. In particular, we prove for definably compact groups that the space of closed points is homeomorphic to the space of infinitesimal types. We also prove that with the spectral topology the set of invariant types concentrated in a definably compact set is a normal spectral space whose closed points are the finitely satisfiable types.
  On the other hand, for arbitrary NIP structures we equip the set of invariant types with a new topology, called the {\em honest topology}. With this topology the set of invariant types is a normal spectral space whose closed points are the finitely satisfiable ones, and the natural retraction from invariant types onto finitely satisfiable types coincides with Simon's $F_M$ retraction.</description>

      <title>On closed definable subsets in Hensel minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with Hensel minimal structures on non-trivially valued fields $K$. The main aim is to establish the following two properties of closed 0-definable subsets $A$ in the affine spaces $K^{n}$. Every such subset $A$ is the zero locus of a continuous 0-definable function $f:K^{n} \to K$, and there exists a 0-definable retraction $r: K^{n} \to A$. While the former property is a non-Archimedean counterpart of the one from o-minimal geometry, the former does not hold in real geometry in general. The proofs make use of a model-theoretic compactness argument and ubiquity of clopen sets in non-Archimedean geometry.</description>
