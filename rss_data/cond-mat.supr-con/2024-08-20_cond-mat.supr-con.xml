      <title>Twist-Programmable Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relative twist angle between layers of near-lattice-matched van der Waals materials is critical for the emergent correlated phenomena associated with moire flat bands. However, the concept of angle rotation control is not exclusive to moir\'e superlattices in which electrons directly experience a twist-angle-dependent periodic potential. Instead, it can also be employed to induce programmable symmetry-breaking perturbations with the goal of stabilizing desired correlated states. Here, we experimentally demonstrate `moireless' twist-tuning of superconductivity together with other correlated orders in Bernal bilayer graphene proximitized by tungsten diselenide. The alignment between the two materials systematically controls the strength of the induced Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC), profoundly altering the phase diagram. As Ising SOC is increased, superconductivity onsets at a higher displacement field and features a higher critical temperature, reaching up to 0.5K. Within the main superconducting dome and in the strong Ising SOC limit, we find an unusual phase transition characterized by a nematic redistribution of holes among trigonally warped Fermi pockets and enhanced resilience to in-plane magnetic fields. The behavior of the superconducting phase is well captured by our theoretical model, which emphasizes the role of interband interactions between Fermi pockets arising due to interaction-enhanced symmetry breaking. Moreover, we identify two additional superconducting regions, one of which descends from an inter-valley coherent normal state and exhibits a Pauli-limit violation ratio exceeding 40, among the highest for all known superconductors. Our results provide new insights into ultra-clean graphene-based superconductors and underscore the potential of utilizing moireless-twist engineering across a range of van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in two-dimensional Hubbard models with an incipient flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One promising way to enhance superconductivity is to have coexisting wide and incipient narrow bands, where the Fermi level intersecting the wide band lies just above the narrow band, by which finite-energy spin fluctuations act as glue to mediate pair scattering. As an extreme case of the narrow band dispersion, we investigate spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in two-dimensional Hubbard models with an incipient flat band. For all of the systems investigated in this study, the Kagome, Lieb, and bilayer square lattices with a flat band, we find that spin-singlet pairing superconductivity is enhanced when the flat band is nearly fully filled, due to the interband pair scattering even when the flat band becomes dispersive by correlation effects. Among these models, enhancement of superconductivity is weak in the Lieb lattice, possibly because the density of states of the wide band goes to zero at the Dirac point where the flat and wide bands intersect. Also, when the electron density is smaller so that the flat band approaches half filling, ferromagnetic spin fluctuations and spin-triplet pairing arises, which does not develop strongly compared to the case of the spin-singlet pairing for the incipient band situation.</description>

      <title>Kagome materials $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K,Rb,Cs): pairing symmetry and pressure-tuning studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vanadium-based kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, and Cs) host a superconducting ground state that coexists with an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). The CDW state exhibits experimental signatures of chirality, electronic nematicity, and time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, raising the questions whether the superconductivity (SC) in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ may also be unconventional, how SC interplays with CDW, and how the two orders evolve upon tuning. This article reviews studies of the superconducting pairing symmetry, and the tuning of SC and CDW in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds. Various experimental techniques consistently find that CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits nodeless SC, which remains robust regardless whether the CDW is present. Under hydrostatic pressure, SC in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ becomes enhanced as the CDW is gradually suppressed, revealing a competition between the two orders. In CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, a new CDW state emerges under pressure that competes more strongly with SC relative to the CDW at ambient pressure, and results in two superconducting domes that coexist with CDW. After the CDW in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ is fully suppressed with hydrostatic pressure, a further increase in pressure leads to a nonmonotonic evolution of the superconducting transition temperature driven by lattice modulations. Thickness is shown to be a powerful tuning parameter in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes, revealing the evolution of CDW and SC upon dimensional reduction, and can be combined with hydrostatic pressure to shed light on the interplay between SC and CDW. Based on results reviewed in this article, we discuss outstanding issues to be addressed in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ systems.</description>

      <title>The quantum and anharmonic effects on the vibrational and superconducting properties of H3Se in Im-3m phase under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-based compounds have attracted significant attention in recent years due to the discovery of conventional superconductivity with high critical temperature under high pressure, rekindling hopes for searching room temperature superconductor. In this work, we investigated systematically the vibrational and superconducting properties of H3Se in Im-3m phase under pressures ranging from 75 to 200 GPa. Our approach combines the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation with first-principles calculations to address effects from the quantum and anharmonic vibrations of ions. It turns out that these effects significantly modify the crystal structure, increasing the inner pressure by about 8 GPa compared to situations where they are ignored. The phonon spectra suggest that with these effects included, the crystal can be stabilized at pressures as low as 50 GPa, much lower than the previously predicted value of over 100 GPa. Our calculations also highlight the critical role of quantum and anharmonic effects on electron-phonon coupling properties. Neglecting these factors could result in a substantial overestimation of the superconducting critical temperature, by approximately 25 K at 125 GPa, for example.</description>

      <title>Spin excitations in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ superconductors with the interlayer pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompted by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, this study delves into a theoretical investigation of spin excitations within this intriguing material. Employing self-consistent mean-field calculations, we find that superconductivity in this compound is predominantly governed by interlayer pairing mechanisms. In the superconducting state, our analysis uncovers a notable absence of a spin resonance mode, a finding that deviates from conventional expectations. Furthermore, we reveal a spectrum of energy-dependent incommensurate spin excitations. The observed incommensurate structures are elegantly explained by the nesting effect of energy contours, providing a coherent and comprehensive account of experimental observations. The implications of these spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are profound, offering critical insights into the superconducting mechanism at play. Our results not only contribute to the understanding of this novel superconductor but also pave the way for further research into the interplay between spin dynamics and unconventional superconductivity in layered materials.</description>

      <title>Development of a Nb-based semiconductor-superconductor hybrid platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid materials are used as a platform to realise Andreev bound states, which hold great promise for quantum applications. These states require transparent interfaces between the semiconductor and superconductor, which are typically realised by in-situ deposition of an Al superconducting layer. Here we present a hybrid material based on an InAs two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) combined with in-situ deposited Nb and NbTi superconductors, which offer a larger operating range in temperature and magnetic field due to their larger superconducting gap. We overcome the inherent difficulty associated with the formation of an amorphous interface between III-V semiconductors and Nb-based superconductors by introducing a 7 nm Al interlayer. The Al interlayer provides an epitaxial connection between an in-situ magnetron sputtered Nb or NbTi thin film and a shallow InAs 2DEG. This metal-to-metal epitaxy is achieved by optimization of the material stack and results in an induced superconducting gap of approximately 1 meV, determined from transport measurements of superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions. This induced gap is approximately five times larger than the values reported for Al-based hybrid materials and indicates the formation of highly-transparent interfaces that are required in high-quality hybrid material platforms.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate inter-valley coherent states in ABC graphene: collective modes and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments in ABC trilayer graphene detected superconductivity on the border of a phase transition to a symmetry-broken phase. In this work, we use unrestricted Hartree-Fock to study the nature of this phase. We find a close competition between two incommensurate inter-valley coherent (IVC) phases: an IVC crystal where the ordering occurs at multiple wavevectors, and an IVC spiral with a single ordering wavevector. Focusing on one of the regimes where superconductivity is observed experimentally, we find a continuous (or very weakly first order) transition between a half metallic phase to an IVC crystal, followed by a first-order transition into an IVC spiral. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we study the collective mode spectrum in the half-metalic phase. We find a soft inter-valley mode that can mediate superconductivity in a narrow sliver of density near the continuous transition, with a Tc that can reach a few hundreds of mK and a sign-changing s-wave order parameter. The spin stiffness in the half metal phase is found to be surprisingly low, of the order of a few degrees Kelvin.</description>

      <title>Enhanced triplet superconductivity in next generation ultraclean UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unconventional superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits numerous signatures of spin-triplet superconductivity -- a rare state of matter which could enable quantum computation protected against decoherence. UTe$_2$ possesses a complex phase landscape comprising two magnetic field-induced superconducting phases, a metamagnetic transition to a field-polarised state, along with pair- and charge-density wave orders. However, contradictory reports between studies performed on UTe$_2$ specimens of varying quality have severely impeded theoretical efforts to understand the microscopic origins of the exotic superconductivity. Here, we report a comprehensive suite of high magnetic field measurements on a new generation of pristine quality UTe$_2$ crystals. Our experiments reveal a significantly revised high magnetic field superconducting phase diagram in the ultraclean limit, showing a pronounced sensitivity of field-induced superconductivity to the presence of crystalline disorder. We employ a Ginzburg-Landau model that excellently captures this acute dependence on sample quality. Our results suggest that in close proximity to a field--induced metamagnetic transition the enhanced role of magnetic fluctuations -- that are strongly suppressed by disorder -- is likely responsible for tuning UTe$_2$ between two distinct spin-triplet superconducting phases.</description>

      <title>Microscopic solutions for vortex clustering in two-band type-1.5 superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-band superconductors exhibit a distinct phase characterized by two correlation lengths, one smaller and the other larger than the magnetic field penetration length. This regime was coined type-1.5 superconductivity, with several unconventional properties, such as vortex clustering. However, a fully microscopic solution for vortex clusters has remained challenging due to computational complexities beyond quasiclassical models. This work presents numerical solutions obtained in a fully self-consistent two-band Bogoliubov-de Gennes model. We show the presence of discrepant correlation lengths leading to vortex clustering in two-band superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Discovered in Niobium Polyhydride at High Pressures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Niobium polyhydride was synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions by using diamond anvil cell combined with in situ high pressure laser heating techniques. High pressure electric transport experiments demonstrate that superconducting transition occurs with critical temperature(Tc) 42 K at 187 GPa. The shift of Tc as function of external applied magnetic field is in consistent to the nature of superconductivity while the upper critical field at zero temperature Hc2(0) is estimated to~16.8 Tesla while the GL coherent length ~57 angstrom is estimated. The structure investigation using synchrotron radiation implies that the observed superconductivity may come from Fm-3m phase of NbH3.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian zero-energy pinning of Andreev and Majorana bound states in superconductor-semiconductor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Majorana bound states in finite length superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems has been predicted to occur in the form of oscillatory energy levels with parity crossings around zero energy. Each zero-energy crossing is expected to produce a quantized zero-bias conductance peak but several studies have reported conductance peaks pinned at zero energy over a range of Zeeman fields, whose origin, however, is not clear. In this work we consider superconducting systems with spin-orbit coupling under a Zeeman field and demonstrate that non-Hermitian effects, due to coupling to ferromagnet leads, induce zero-energy pinning of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states. We find that this zero-energy pinning effect occurs due to the formation of non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies known as exceptional points, whose emergence can be controlled by the interplay of non-Hermiticity, the applied Zeeman field, and chemical potentials. Moreover, depending on the non-Hermitian spatial profile, we find that non-Hermiticity changes the single point Hermitian topological phase transition into a flattened zero energy line bounded by exceptional points from multiple low energy levels. This seemingly innocent change notably enables a gap closing well below the Hermitian topological phase transition, which can be in principle simpler to achieve. Furthermore, we reveal that the energy gap separating Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states from the quasicontinuum remains robust for the values that give rise to the zero-energy pinning effect. While reasonable values of non-Hermiticity can be indeed beneficial, very strong non-Hermitian effects can be detrimental as it might destroy superconductivity. Our findings can be therefore useful for understanding the zero-energy pinning of trivial and topological states in Majorana devices.</description>

      <title>Microwave Signatures of Topological Superconductivity in Planar Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16535v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions provide a platform to host topological superconductivity which, through manipulating Majorana bound states (MBS), could enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, what constitutes experimental signatures of topological superconductivity and how MBS can be detected remains strongly debated. In addition to spurious effects that mimic MBS, there is a challenge to discern the inherent topological signals in realistic systems with many topologically-trivial Andreev bound states, determining the transport properties of Josephson junctions. Guided by the advances in microwave spectroscopy, we theoretically study Al/InAs-based planar Josephson junction embedded into a radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference device to identify microwave signatures of topological superconductivity. Remarkably, by exploring the closing and reopening of a topological gap, we show that even in a wide planar Josephson junction with many Andreev bound states, such a topological signature is distinguishable in the resonance frequency shift of a microwave drive and the ``half-slope'' feature of the microwave absorption spectrum. Our findings provide an important step towards experimental detection of non-Abelian statistics and implementing scalable topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A method for reconstructing the self-energy from the spectral function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question about the nature of quantum materials such as High-T$_c$ systems remain open to date -- it is unclear whether they are (some variety of) Fermi liquids, or (some variety of) non Fermi liquids. A direct avenue to determine their nature is to study the (imaginary part of the) self-energy at low energies. Here we present a novel method to extract this low $\omega$ self-energy from experimentally derived spectral functions. The method seems suited for implementation with high quality angle resolved photoemission data. It is based on a helpful Theorem proposed here, which assures us that the method has minimal (or vanishing) error at the lowest energies. We provide numerical examples showing that a few popular model systems yield distinguishably different low energy self-energies.</description>

Abstract: We present X-ray scattering studies resolving structural twinning and phase separation in the charge density wave (CDW) state of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. The three-dimensional CDW state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is reported to form a complex superposition of Star of David (SoD) or Tri-Hexagonal (TrH) patterns of distortion within its kagome planes, but the out-of-plane stacking is marked by metastability. In order to resolve the impact of this metastability, we present reciprocal space mapping and real-space images of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ collected across multiple length scales using temperature-dependent high-dynamic range mapping (HDRM) and dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). The experimental data provide evidence for a rich microstructure that forms in the CDW state. Data evidence metastability in the formation of $2\times 2\times 4$ and $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW supercells dependent on thermal history and mechanical deformation. We further directly resolve the real space phase segregation of both supercells as well as a real-space, structural twinning driven by the broken rotational symmetry of the CDW state. Our combined results provide insights into the role of microstructure and twinning in experiments probing the electronic properties of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ where rotational symmetry is broken by the three-dimensional charge density wave order but locally preserved for any single kagome layer.</description>
