      <title>Time Profile of U.S. Neighborhoods: Datasets of Time Use at Social Infrastructure Places</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social infrastructure plays a critical role in shaping neighborhood well-being by fostering social and cultural interaction, enabling service provision, and encouraging exposure to diverse environments. Despite the growing knowledge of its spatial accessibility, time use at social infrastructure places is underexplored due to the lack of a spatially resolved national dataset. We address this gap by developing scalable Social-Infrastructure Time Use measures (STU) that capture length and depth of engagement, activity diversity, and spatial inequality, supported by first-of-their-kind datasets spanning multiple geographic scales from census tracts to metropolitan areas. Our datasets leverage anonymized and aggregated foot traffic data collected between 2019 and 2024 across 49 continental U.S. states. The data description reveals variances in STU across time, space, and differing neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics. Validation demonstrates generally robust population representation, consistent with established national survey findings while revealing more nuanced patterns. Future analyses could link STU with public health outcomes and environmental factors to inform targeted interventions aimed at enhancing population well-being and guiding social infrastructure planning and usage.</description>

      <title>State &amp; Geopolitical Censorship on Twitter (X): Detection &amp; Impact Analysis of Withheld Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State and geopolitical censorship on Twitter, now X, has been turning into a routine, raising concerns about the boundaries between criminal content and freedom of speech. One such censorship practice, withholding content in a particular state has renewed attention due to Elon Musk's apparent willingness to comply with state demands. In this study, we present the first quantitative analysis of the impact of state censorship by withholding on social media using a dataset in which two prominent patterns emerged: Russian accounts censored in the EU for spreading state-sponsored narratives, and Turkish accounts blocked within Turkey for promoting militant propaganda. We find that censorship has little impact on posting frequency but significantly reduces likes and retweets by 25%, and follower growth by 90%-especially when the censored region aligns with the account's primary audience. Meanwhile, some Russian accounts continue to experience growth as their audience is outside the withholding jurisdictions. We develop a user-level binary classifier with a transformer backbone and temporal aggregation strategies, aiming to predict whether an account is likely to be withheld. Through an ablation study, we find that tweet content is the primary signal in predicting censorship, while tweet metadata and profile features contribute marginally. Our best model achieves an F1 score of 0.73 and an AUC of 0.83. This work informs debates on platform governance, free speech, and digital repression.</description>

      <title>Towards a general diffusion-based information quality assessment model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid and unregulated dissemination of information in the digital era has amplified the global "infodemic," complicating the identification of high quality information. We present a lightweight, interpretable and non-invasive framework for assessing information quality based solely on diffusion dynamics, demonstrated here in the context of academic publications. Using a heterogeneous dataset of 29,264 sciences, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and social science papers from ArnetMiner and OpenAlex, we model the diffusion network of each paper as a set of three theoretically motivated features: diversity, timeliness, and salience. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) trained on these features achieved Pearson correlations of 0.8468 for next-year citation gain and up to 97.8% accuracy in predicting high-impact papers. Feature relevance studies reveal timeliness and salience as the most robust predictors, while diversity offers less stable benefits in the academic setting but may be more informative in social media contexts. The framework's transparency, domain-agnostic design, and minimal feature requirements position it as a scalable tool for global information quality assessment, opening new avenues for moving beyond binary credibility labels toward richer, diffusion-informed evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Trust and Reputation in Data Sharing: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data sharing is the fuel of the galloping artificial intelligence economy, providing diverse datasets for training robust models. Trust between data providers and data consumers is widely considered one of the most important factors for enabling data sharing initiatives. Concerns about data sensitivity, privacy breaches, and misuse contribute to reluctance in sharing data across various domains. In recent years, there has been a rise in technological and algorithmic solutions to measure, capture and manage trust, trustworthiness, and reputation in what we collectively refer to as Trust and Reputation Management Systems (TRMSs). Such approaches have been developed and applied to different domains of computer science, such as autonomous vehicles, or IoT networks, but there have not been dedicated approaches to data sharing and its unique characteristics. In this survey, we examine TRMSs from a data-sharing perspective, analyzing how they assess the trustworthiness of both data and entities across different environments. We develop novel taxonomies for system designs, trust evaluation framework, and evaluation metrics for both data and entity, and we systematically analyze the applicability of existing TRMSs in data sharing. Finally, we identify open challenges and propose future research directions to enhance the explainability, comprehensiveness, and accuracy of TRMSs in large-scale data-sharing ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Research on Conversational Recommender System Considering Consumer Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services through multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users' heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains both accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs. satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book, and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Influence Maximization in User Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However, existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value &lt; 0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B test, respectively. Implementation codes are available at https://github.com/socialalgo/HIM.</description>

      <title>Exit Stories: Using Reddit Self-Disclosures to Understand Disengagement from Problematic Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online platforms like Reddit are increasingly becoming popular for individuals sharing personal experiences of leaving behind social, ideological, and political groups. Specifically, a series of "ex-" subreddits on Reddit allow users to recount their departures from commitments such as religious affiliations, manosphere communities, conspiracy theories or political beliefs, and lifestyle choices. Understanding the natural process through which users exit, especially from problematic groups such as conspiracy theory communities and the manosphere, can provide valuable insights for designing interventions targeting disengagement from harmful ideologies. This paper presents an in-depth exploration of 15K exit stories across 131 subreddits, focusing on five key areas: religion, manosphere, conspiracy theories, politics, and lifestyle. Using a transdisciplinary framework that incorporates theories from social psychology, organizational behavior, and violent extremism studies, this work identifies a range of factors contributing to disengagement. The results describe how disengagement from problematic groups, such as conspiracy theories and the manosphere, is a multi-faceted process that is qualitatively different than disengaging from more established social structures, such as religions or political ideologies. This research further highlights the need for moving beyond interventions that treat conspiracy theorizing solely as an information problem and contributes insights for future research focusing on offering mental health interventions and support in exit communities.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Community Formation in Response to Extreme Weather Events through Human Mobility Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community formation in socio-spatial human networks is one of the important mechanisms for mitigating hazard impacts of extreme weather events. Research is scarce regarding latent network characteristics shaping community formation in human mobility networks during natural disasters. Here, we examined human mobility networks in Harris County, Texas, in the context of the managed power outage forced by 2021 Winter Storm Uri to detect communities and to evaluate latent characteristics in those communities. We examined three characteristics in the communities formed within human mobility networks: hazard-exposure heterophily, socio-demographic homophily, and social-connectedness strength. The results show that population movements were shaped by socio-demographic homophily, heterophilic hazard exposure, and social connectedness strength. Our results also indicate that a community encompassing more high-impact areas would motivate population movements to areas with weaker social connectedness. Our findings reveal important characteristics shaping community formation in human mobility networks in hazard response. Specific to managed power outages, formed communities are spatially co-located, underscoring a best management practice to avoid prolonged power outages among areas within communities, thus improving hazard exposure heterophily. The findings have implications for power utility operators to account for the characteristics of socio-spatial human networks when determining the patterns of managed power outages.</description>

      <title>Edge Correlations and Link Prediction in Growing Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generative model of temporally-evolving hypergraphs in which hyperedges form via noisy copying of previous hyperedges. Our proposed model reproduces several stylized facts from many empirical hypergraphs, is learnable from data, and defines a likelihood over a complete hypergraph rather than ego-based or other sub-hypergraphs. Analyzing our model, we derive descriptions of node degree, edge size, and edge intersection size distributions in terms of the model parameters. We also show several features of empirical hypergraphs which are and are not successfully captured by our model. We provide a scalable stochastic expectation maximization algorithm with which we can fit our model to hypergraph data sets with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, we assess our model on a hypergraph link prediction task, finding that an instantiation of our model with just 11 parameters can achieve competitive predictive performance with large neural networks.</description>

      <title>Exploring Content and Social Connections of Fake News with Explainable Text and Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global spread of misinformation and concerns about content trustworthiness have driven the development of automated fact-checking systems. Since false information often exploits social media dynamics such as "likes" and user networks to amplify its reach, effective solutions must go beyond content analysis to incorporate these factors. Moreover, simply labelling content as false can be ineffective or even reinforce biases such as automation and confirmation bias. This paper proposes an explainable framework that combines content, social media, and graph-based features to enhance fact-checking. It integrates a misinformation classifier with explainability techniques to deliver complete and interpretable insights supporting classification decisions. Experiments demonstrate that multimodal information improves performance over single modalities, with evaluations conducted on datasets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework's explanations were assessed for interpretability, trustworthiness, and robustness with a novel protocol, showing that it effectively generates human-understandable justifications for its predictions.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Attributes and Multi-Scale Structures for Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) are composed of multiple types of nodes and edges, making it more effective in capturing the complex relational structures inherent in the real world. However, in real-world scenarios, labeled data is often difficult to obtain, which limits the applicability of semi-supervised approaches. Self-supervised learning aims to enable models to automatically learn useful features from data, effectively addressing the challenge of limited labeling data. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework for heterogeneous graphs (ASHGCL), which incorporates three distinct views, each focusing on node attributes, high-order and low-order structural information, respectively, to effectively capture attribute information, high-order structures, and low-order structures for node representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce an attribute-enhanced positive sample selection strategy that combines both structural information and attribute information, effectively addressing the issue of sampling bias. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that ASHGCL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines and even surpasses some supervised benchmarks.</description>
