      <title>Logarithmic Subdiffusion from a Damped Bath Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A damped heat bath is a modification of the standard oscillator heat bath model, wherein each bath oscillator itself has a Markovian coupling to its own heat bath. We modify such a model as described in $\textit{Plyukhin (2019)}$ to one where the oscillators undergo linear rather than constant damping, and find that this generates a memory kernel which behaves like $k(t) \sim 1/t$ as $t\to \infty$ when the spectral density is Ohmic. This is a boundary case not considered in previous works. As the memory kernel does not have a finite integral, it is subdiffusive, and we numerically show the diffusion to go as $\langle\Delta Q^{2}(t)\rangle \sim t/\log(t)$ as $t\to \infty$. We also numerically calculate the velocity correlation function in the asymptotic regime and use it to confirm the aforementioned subdiffusion.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Hilbert space fragmentation in the quantum East model: fragmentation, subspace-restricted quantum scars, and effects of density-density interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional correlated-hopping model of spinless fermions with an East constraint. We first analytically unravel the fractured Hilbert space by labeling each fragment by a unique root configuration. This enables us to compute the total number of fragments and frozen states using transfer matrices. This method further allows us to analytically calculate how all the fragments grow with system size by mapping the transitions allowed by the East constraint to the combinatorics sequence of Dyck words with the help of the Catalan triangle. The energy level spacing statistics indicates that while the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) does not hold within the full Hilbert space, the largest fragments obey a weaker version of the subspace-restricted thermalization. This weaker form of the ETH is supported by the presence of subspace-restricted quantum many-body scars. Our analysis further reveals that the filling fraction at which the model has the largest fragment shifts with increasing system sizes from half-filling. In order to stabilize the ground state at a particular filling fraction, we examine the effect of perturbations, namely, a nearest-neighbor density-density interaction with strength $V$. Within the largest fragment, the model undergoes a transition from a weakly ETH-violating phase to a statistical bubble localized phase with increasing $V$. The $V\to \infty$ limit reduces to an integrable model with inversion symmetry. The stabilization of the ground state at half-filling for finite $V$ abruptly changes exactly at $V\to\infty$ due to the emergence of a distinct fragmentation structure. We analytically uncover this new fractured Hilbert space, followed by the mapping of each fragment to a nearest-neighbor tight-binding model of non-interacting fermions. Finally, we propose an experimental setup to realize the infinite-$V$ model.</description>

      <title>The Viscosity of Liquids in the Dual Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reliable model of viscosity in liquids using a dual liquid model framework is developed. The analytical expression arrived at exhibits the correct T-dependence Arrhenius-like. It is compared with the values of viscosity for water with acceptable accuracy and those related to the mechano-thermal effect in liquids under low-frequency shear. It has even been shown that a numerical approach of viscosity in liquids dealt with as dual systems provides good agreement with experimental data. The expression of viscosity shows an explicit dependence upon the sound velocity and the collective vibratory degrees of freedom excited at a given temperature. The terms involved depend upon the Boltzmann and Planck constants. Finally, the physical model is coherent with the postulate of microscopic reversibility as well as with the time's arrow for macroscopic dissipative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Condensate Size Control by Charge Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are complex droplets comprising many different types of molecules that interact using various mechanisms. Condensation is often driven by short-ranged attraction, but net charges can also mediate long-ranged repulsion. Using molecular dynamics simulations and an equilibrium field theory, we show that such opposing interactions can suppress coarsening so that many droplets of equal size coexist at equilibrium. This size control depends strongly on the charge asymmetry between constituents, while the strength of the short-ranged attractions has a weak influence. Our work reveals how electrostatic effects control droplet size, which is relevant for understanding biomolecular condensates and creating synthetic patterns in chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>Hyperdisordered cell packing on a growing surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the physics of disordered packing in non-growing systems is well understood, unexplored phenomena can emerge when packing takes place in growing domains. We study the arrangements of pigment cells (chromatophores) on squid skin as a biological example of a packed system on an expanding surface. We find that relative density fluctuations in cell numbers grow with spatial scale. We term this behavior ''hyperdisordered'', in contrast with hyperuniform behavior in which relative fluctuations tend to zero at large scale. We find that hyperdisordered scaling, akin to that of a critical system, is quantitatively reproduced by a model in which hard disks are randomly inserted in a homogeneously growing surface. In addition, we find that chromatophores increase in size during animal development, but maintain a stationary size distribution. The physical mechanisms described in our work may apply to a broad class of growing dense systems.</description>

      <title>Avalanche criticality emerges by thermal fluctuation in a quiescent glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report avalanche criticality of thermal relaxation in glassy systems after a rapid quench by molecular simulation. Our analysis of the energy landscape and the scaling reveals that particle rearrangement is critical. The critical phenomenon has the same origin as avalanches in sheared amorphous solids, but the critical exponent differs from previously observed. Our results suggest that by viewing a glass as a thermally driven elastoplastic material, we can understand dynamics below the glass transition point, such as aging.</description>

      <title>Navigating Uncertainty: Risk-Averse vs. Risk-Prone Strategies in Populations Facing Demographic and Environmental Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategies aimed at reducing the negative effects of long-term uncertainty and risk are common in biology, game theory, and finance, even if they entail a cost in terms of mean benefit. Here, we focus on the single mutant's invasion of a finite resident population subject to fluctuating environmental conditions. Thus, the game-theoretical model we analyze integrates environmental and demographic randomness, i.e., the two leading sources of stochasticity and uncertainty. We use simulations and mathematical analysis to study if and when strategies that either increase or reduce payoff variance across environmental states can enhance the mutant fixation probability. Variance aversion implies that the mutant pays insurance in terms of mean payoff to avoid worst-case scenarios. Variance-prone or gambling strategies, on the other hand, entail specialization, allowing the mutant to capitalize on transient favorable conditions, leading to a series of ``boom-and-bust'' cycles. Our analyses elucidate how the rate of change of environmental conditions and the shape of the probability distribution of possible states affect the possible most convenient strategies. We discuss how our results relate to the bet-hedging theory, which aims to reduce fitness variance rather than payoff variance. We also describe the analogies and differences between these similar yet distinct approaches.</description>

      <title>The Arrhenius Law Prefactor in Permalloy Mesoscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Arrhenius equation was used to describe the dynamics of two-state switching in mesoscale, ferromagnetic particles. Using square, permalloy dots as an idealized two-state switching system, measurements of the prefactor of the Arrhenius law changed by 26 decades over barrier heights from 30 meV to 700 meV. Measurements of the prefactor ratios for a two well system revealed significant deviations from the common interpretation of the Arrhenius law. The anomalous Arrhenius prefactors and the prefactor ratios can be fitted to a modified model that includes entropic contributions to two-state transitions. Similar considerations are likely for the application of the Arrhenius law to other mesoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Modified Bridgman formula for the thermal conductivity of complex (dusty) plasma fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple and popular Bridgman's formula predicts a linear correlation between the thermal conductivity coefficient and the sound velocity of dense liquids. Unfortunately, it cannot be applied to strongly coupled plasma-related fluids, because the sound velocity can greatly increase as screening weakens. We propose a modification of the Bridgman formula by correlating the thermal conductivity coefficient with the transverse (shear) sound velocity. This approach is demonstrated to work reasonably well in screened Coulomb (Yukawa) fluids and can be useful in the context of complex (dusty) plasmas.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the distribution of partition function zeros for the grand-canonical ensemble of the zeta-urn model, where tuning a single parameter can give a first or any higher order condensation transition. We compute the locus of zeros for finite-size systems and test scaling relations describing the accumulation of zeros near the critical point against theoretical predictions for both the first and higher order transition regimes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic dissipation does not bound replicator growth and decay rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a well-known paper, Jeremy England derived a bound on the free energy dissipated by a self-replicating system [England, "Statistical physics of self-replication", The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013]. This bound is usually interpreted as a universal relationship that connects thermodynamic dissipation to replicator per-capita decay and growth rates. We argue from basic thermodynamic principles against this interpretation. In fact, we suggest that such a relationship cannot exist in principle, because it is impossible for a thermodynamically-consistent replicator to undergo both per-capita growth and per-capita decay back into reactants. Instead, replicator may decay into separate waste products, but in that case, replication and decay are two independent physical processes, and there is no universal relationship that connects their thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have established negative energetic elasticity, the negative contribution of energy to the elastic modulus, as a universal property of polymer gels. To reveal the microscopic origin of this phenomenon, Shirai and Sakumichi investigated a polymer model on a cubic lattice with the energy effect from the solvent in finite-size calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 148101 (2023)]. Motivated by this work, we provide a simple platform to study the elasticity of polymer chains by considering a one-dimensional random walk with the energy effect. This model can be mapped onto the classical Ising chain, leading to an exact form of the free energy in the thermodynamic or continuous limit. Our analytical results are qualitatively consistent with Shirai and Sakumichi's work. Our model serves as a fundamental benchmark for studying negative energetic elasticity.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics at the Quantum-Classical Boundary: A Self-Consistent Framework Based on Adiabatic-Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscopic thermal machines promise to play an important role in future quantum technologies. Making such devices widely applicable will require effective strategies to channel their output into easily accessible storage systems like classical degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a self-consistent theoretical framework that makes it possible to model such quantum-classical hybrid devices in a thermodynamically consistent manner. Our approach is based on the assumption that the quantum part of the device is subject to strong decoherence and dissipation induced by a thermal reservoir. Due to the ensuing separation of time scales between slowly evolving classical and fast relaxing quantum degrees of freedom, the dynamics of the hybrid system can be described by means of adiabatic-response theory. We show that, upon including fluctuations in a minimally consistent way, the resulting equations of motion can be equipped with a first and second law, both on the ensemble level and on the level of individual trajectories of the classical part of the system, where thermodynamic quantities like heat and work become stochastic variables. As an application of our theory, we work out a physically transparent model of a quantum-classical hybrid engine, whose working system consists of a chain of Rydberg atoms, which is confined in an optical cavity and driven by periodic temperature variations. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that the engine can sustain periodic oscillations of a movable mirror, which acts as a classical load, against external friction and extract the full distributions of input heat and output work. By making the statistics of thermodynamic processes in quantum-classical hybrid systems accessible without the need to further specify a measurement protocol, our work contributes to bridging the long-standing gap between classical and quantum stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized hydrodynamics and approach to Generalized Gibbs equilibrium for a classical harmonic chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a classical harmonic chain with nearest-neighbor interactions starting from domain wall initial conditions. The initial state is taken to be either a product of two Gibbs Ensembles (GEs) with unequal temperatures on the two halves of the chain or a product of two Generalized Gibbs Ensembles (GGEs) with different parameters in the two halves. For this system, we construct the Wigner function and demonstrate that its evolution defines the Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD) describing the evolution of the conserved quantities. We solve the GHD for both finite and infinite chains and compute the evolution of conserved densities and currents. For a finite chain with fixed boundaries, we show that these quantities relax as $\sim 1/\sqrt{t}$ to their respective steady-state values given by the final expected GE or GGE state, depending on the initial conditions. Exact expressions for the Lagrange multipliers of the final expected GGE state are obtained in terms of the steady state densities. In the case of an infinite chain, we find that the conserved densities and currents at any finite time exhibit ballistic scaling while, at infinite time, any finite segment of the system can be described by a current-carrying non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). We compute the scaling functions analytically and show that the relaxation to the NESS occurs as $\sim 1/t$ for the densities and as $\sim 1/t^2$ for the currents. We compare the analytic results from hydrodynamics with those from exact microscopic numerics and find excellent agreement.</description>

Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Ising model with varying spin strength on a scale-free network: scaling functions and critical amplitude ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a novel model to describe ordering in systems comprising agents which, although matching in their binarity (i.e., maintaining the iconic Ising features of ``+'' or ``-'', ``up'' or ``down'', ``yes'' or ``no''), still differing in their strength was suggested [Krasnytska et al., J. Phys. Complex., 2020, 1, 035008]. The model was analyzed for a particular case when agents are located on sites of a scale-free network and agent strength is a random variable governed by a power-law decaying distribution. For the annealed network, the exact solution shows a rich phase diagram with different types of critical behavior and new universality classes. This paper continues the above studies and addresses the analysis of scaling functions and universal critical amplitude ratios for the model on a scale-free network.</description>

      <title>Consensus decision making on a complete graph: complex behaviour from simple assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a model of consensus decision making [Hartnett A. T., et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2016, 116, 038701] following a statistical physics approach presented in [Sarkanych P., et al., Phys. Biol., 2023, 20, 045005]. Within this approach, the temperature serves as a measure of fluctuations, not considered before in the original model. Here, we discuss the model on a complete graph. The main goal of this paper is to show that an analytical description may lead to a very rich phase behaviour, which is usually not expected for a complete graph. However, the variety of individual agent (spin) features - their inhomogeneity and bias strength - taken into account by the model leads to rather non-trivial collective effects. We show that the latter may emerge in a form of continuous or abrupt phase transitions sometimes accompanied by re-entrant and order-parameter flipping behaviour. In turn, this may lead to appealing interpretations in terms of social decision making. We support analytical predictions by numerical simulation. Moreover, while analytical calculations are performed within an equilibrium statistical physics formalism, the numerical simulations add yet another dynamical feature - local non-linearity or conformity of the individual to the opinion of its surroundings. This feature appears to have a strong impact both on the way in which an equilibrium state is approached as well as on its characteristics.</description>

      <title>Solvable models of many-body chaos from dual-Koopman circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-unitary circuits are being vigorously studied as models of many-body quantum chaos that can be solved exactly for correlation functions and time evolution of states. Here we define their classical counterparts as dual-canonical transformations and associated dual-Koopman operators. Like their quantum counterparts, the correlations vanish everywhere except on the light cone, on which they decay with rates governed by a simple contractive map. Providing a large class of such dual-canonical transformations, we study in detail the example of a coupled standard map and show analytically that arbitrarily away from the integrable case, in the thermodynamic limit the system is mixing. We also define ``perfect" Koopman operators that lead to the correlation vanishing everywhere including on the light cone and provide an example of a cat-map lattice which would qualify to be a Bernoulli system at the apex of the ergodic hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based simulation reveals localized isolation key to saving lives and resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of pandemic dynamics, understanding the intricate interplay between disease transmission, interventions, and immunity is pivotal for effective control strategies. Through a rigorous agent-based computer simulation, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration, traversing unmitigated spread, lockdown scenarios, and the transformative potential of vaccination. We unveil that while quarantine unquestionably delays the pandemic peak, it does not act as an impenetrable barrier to halt the progression of infectious diseases. Vaccination factor revealed a potent weapon against outbreaks higher vaccination percentage not only delayed infection peaks but also substantially curtailed their impact. Our investigation into bond dilution below the percolation threshold presents an additional dimension to pandemic control. We observed that localized isolation through bond dilution offers a more resource-efficient targeted control strategy than blanket lockdowns or large-scale vaccination campaigns.</description>

      <title>Categorical-Symmetry Resolved Entanglement in CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a symmetry resolution of entanglement for categorical non-invertible symmetries (CaT-SREE) in (1 + 1)-dimensional CFTs. The definition parallels that of group-like invertible symmetries, employing the concept of symmetric boundary states with respect to a categorical symmetry. Our examination extends to rational CFTs, where the behavior of CaT-SREE mirrors that of group-like invertible symmetries. We find that CaT-SREE can be defined if there is no obstruction to gauging the categorical symmetry, as happens in the case of group-like symmetries. We also provide instances of the breakdown of entanglement equipartition at the next-to-leading order in the cutoff expansion. Our findings shed light on how the interplay between conformal boundary conditions and categorical symmetries lead to specific patterns in the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hamiltonian learning from Gibbs states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel algorithm that learns a Hamiltonian from local expectations of its Gibbs state using the free energy variational principle. The algorithm avoids the need to compute the free energy directly, instead using efficient estimates of the derivatives of the free energy with respect to perturbations of the state. These estimates are based on a new entropy bound for Lindblad evolutions, which is of independent interest. We benchmark the algorithm by performing black-box learning of a nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian on a 100-qubit spin chain. A implementation of the algorithm with a Python front-end is made available for use.</description>

      <title>Toward mean-field bound for critical temperature on Nishimori line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12728v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation establishes a lower bound of the true critical inverse temperature in a broad class of ferromagnetic spin models. This is referred to as the mean-field bound for the critical temperature. In this study, we explored the possibility of a corresponding mean-field bound for the critical temperature in Ising spin glass models with Gaussian randomness on the Nishimori line. On this line, the critical inverse temperature of the mean-field approximation is given by $\beta_{MF}^{NL}=\sqrt{1/z}$, where $z$ is the coordination number. Using the Griffiths inequalities on the Nishimori line, we proved that there is zero spontaneous magnetization in the high-temperature region $\beta &lt; \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. In other words, the true critical inverse temperature $\beta_c^{NL}$ on the Nishimori line is always bounded by $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}/2$. Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in obtaining the corresponding mean-field bound $\beta_c^{NL} \ge \beta_{MF}^{NL}$ on the Nishimori line.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the haystack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of first sound in a weakly interacting ultracold Fermi liquid: an exact calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At low temperature, a normal gas of unpaired spin-1/2 fermions is one of the cleanest realizations of a Fermi liquid. It is described by Landau's theory, where no phenomenological parameters are needed as the quasiparticle interaction function can be computed perturbatively in powers of the scattering length $a$, the sole parameter of the short-range interparticle interactions. Obtaining an accurate solution of the transport equation nevertheless requires a careful treatment of the collision kernel, as the uncontrolled error made by the relaxation time approximations increases when the temperature $T$ drops below the Fermi temperature. Here, we study sound waves in the hydrodynamic regime up to second order in the Chapman-Enskog's expansion. We find that the frequency $\omega_q$ of the sound wave is shifted above its linear depart as $\omega_q=c_1 q(1+\alpha q^2\tau^2)$ where $c_1$ and $q$ are the speed and wavenumber of the wave and the typical collision time $\tau$ scales as $1/a^2T^2$. Besides the shear viscosity, the coefficient $\alpha$ is described by a single second-order collision time which we compute exactly from an analytical solution of the transport equation, resulting in a positive dispersion $\alpha&gt;0$. Our results suggest that ultracold atomic Fermi gases are an ideal experimental system for quantitative tests of second order hydrodynamics.</description>
