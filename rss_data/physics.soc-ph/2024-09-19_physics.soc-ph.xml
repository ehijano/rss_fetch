      <title>Cool Pavements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cool pavements designate alternative pavements designed to reduce their contribution to urban heating. Urban heating generally refers to the sensible heat exchanged with the atmosphere by urban materials but can also include the radiative load they impose on pedestrians. In either case, pavement surface temperature is a very important parameter, which cool pavements seek to decrease compared with standard pavement designs. The energy balance of a pavement surface or very thin pavement slab helps identify the outbound flows which cool pavements attempt to promote and fundamental physical principles which govern them. On this basis, cool pavements can be classified as reflective pavements, green and evaporative pavements, high inertia or phase changing pavements as well as conductive or heatharvesting pavements. This chapter presents the urban heat island and the urban heating phenomena and provides an overview of cool pavement technologies, detailing areas which require further scientific investigation.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the public transport network against attacks on its routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Public Transport Networks (PTNs) when subjected to route attacks, focusing specifically on public bus lines. Such attacks, mirroring real-world scenarios, offer insight into the multifaceted dynamics of cities. Our study delves into the consequences of systematically removing entire routes based on strategies that use centrality measures. We evaluate the network's robustness by analyzing the sizes of fragmented networks, focusing on the largest components and derived metrics. To assess the efficacy of various attack strategies, we employ them on both a synthetic PTN model and a real-world example, specifically the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area in Argentina. We examine these strategies and contrast them with random, and one-step most and least harmful procedures. Our findings indicate that \textit{betweenness}-based attacks and the one-step most (\textit{maximal}) harmful procedure emerge as the most effective attack strategies. Remarkably, the \textit{betweenness} strategy partitions the network into components of similar sizes, whereas alternative approaches yield one dominant and several minor components.</description>

      <title>Trust in society: A stochastic compartmental model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a novel stochastic compartmental model that describes the dynamics of trust in society. The population is split into three compartments representing levels of trust in society: trusters, skeptics and doubters. The focus lies on assessing the long-term dynamics, under `bounded confidence' i.e., trusters and doubters do not communicate). We state and classify the stationary points of the system's mean behavior. We find that an increase in life-expectancy, and a greater population may increase the proportion of individuals who lose their trust completely. In addition, the relationship between the rate at which doubters convince skeptics to join their cause and the expected number of doubters is not monotonic -- it does not always help to be more convincing to ensure the survival of your group. We numerically illustrate the workings of our analysis. Because the study of stochastic compartmental models for social dynamics is not common, we in particular shed light on the limitations of deterministic compartmental models.
  In our experiments we make use of fluid and diffusion approximation techniques as well as Gillespie simulation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing variability in complex network community structure with a recursive significance clustering scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network science has presented community detection as a valuable tool for revealing the functional modules in complex systems as rooted in the wiring architectures of complex networks. The varying procedures of community detection can produce, however, divisions of a network into communities that are prone to degeneracy given small changes to the network's configuration. This yields network partitions of similar merit that are structurally dissimilar, which is especially problematic when the network is constructed on uncertain data. To reconcile with the ambiguity in interpreting degenerate network partitions as representations of underlying system function, we introduce a recursive significance clustering scheme that identifies the subsets of nodes that have stable joint community assignments under network perturbation. These robust node groups are referred to here as cores, and represent well-supported features of the network. We show that cores characterize the variability inherent to non-overlapping community structure in weighted and directed networks and indicate robust community assignments that are cohesive under temporal evolution of the network.</description>

      <title>Emergence of echo chambers in a noisy adaptive voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belief perseverance is the widely documented tendency of holding to a belief, even in the presence of contradicting evidence. In online environments, this tendency leads to heated arguments with users ``blocking'' each other. Introducing this element to opinion modelling in a social network, leads to an adaptive network where agents tend to connect preferentially to like-minded peers. In this work we study how this type of dynamics behaves in the voter model with the addition of a noise that makes agents change opinion at random. As the intensity of the noise and the propensity of users blocking each other is changed, we observe a transition between 2 phases. One in which there is only one community in the whole network and another where communities arise and in each of then there is a very clear majority opinion, mimicking the phenomenon of echo chambers. These results are obtained with simulations and with a mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Post-disaster Recovery in Behavior-dependent Business Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recovery of businesses after a disaster is vital to community economic resilience, yet the network dynamics influencing the speed and spillover effects of recovery remain poorly understood. Understanding these dynamics is essential for characterizing economic resilience and informing more effective recovery policies. This study explores the extent to which post-disaster business recovery is shaped by network diffusion processes within pre-disaster business dependency networks, driven by visitation behaviors among business points of interest (POIs). We developed a network diffusion model to simulate recovery across businesses in the Louisiana Gulf Coast following Hurricane Ida (2021) and assessed its performance using empirical data. Our analysis focuses on four key areas: (1) the presence of a diffusion process influencing recovery across the business network; (2) variations in how different business types depend on others for recovery; (3) identification of recovery multiplier businesses that accelerate regional recovery; and (4) differences in recovery multipliers across high- and low-income areas. The findings reveal that business recovery is governed by diffusion dynamics in these behavior-based networks, with recovery speed closely linked to pre-disaster visitation patterns. Retail and service businesses are identified as key recovery multipliers whose rapid recovery accelerates the broader business network's recovery, enhancing economic resilience. Additionally, recovery multipliers vary between high- and low-income areas. This study enhances our understanding of network mechanisms in post-disaster recovery and offers valuable insights for improving recovery policies.</description>

      <title>Co-evolving networks for opinion and social dynamics in agent-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of digital social media has strengthened the coevolution of public opinions and social interactions, that shape social structures and collective outcomes in increasingly complex ways. Existing literature often explores this interplay as a one-directional influence, focusing on how opinions determine social ties within adaptive networks. However, this perspective overlooks the intrinsic dynamics driving social interactions, which can significantly influence how opinions form and evolve. In this work, we address this gap, by introducing the co-evolving opinion and social dynamics using stochastic agent-based models. Agents' mobility in a social space is governed by both their social and opinion similarity with others. Similarly, the dynamics of opinion formation is driven by the opinions of agents in their social vicinity. We analyze the underlying social and opinion interaction networks and explore the mechanisms influencing the appearance of emerging phenomena, like echo chambers and opinion consensus. To illustrate the model's potential for real-world analysis, we apply it to General Social Survey data on political identity and public opinion regarding governmental issues. Our findings highlight the model's strength in capturing the coevolution of social connections and individual opinions over time.</description>

      <title>Nicer Than Humans: How do Large Language Models Behave in the Prisoner's Dilemma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) as artificial social agents is largely unexplored, and we still lack extensive evidence of how these agents react to simple social stimuli. Testing the behavior of AI agents in classic Game Theory experiments provides a promising theoretical framework for evaluating the norms and values of these agents in archetypal social situations. In this work, we investigate the cooperative behavior of three LLMs (Llama2, Llama3, and GPT3.5) when playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma against random adversaries displaying various levels of hostility. We introduce a systematic methodology to evaluate an LLM's comprehension of the game rules and its capability to parse historical gameplay logs for decision-making. We conducted simulations of games lasting for 100 rounds and analyzed the LLMs' decisions in terms of dimensions defined in the behavioral economics literature. We find that all models tend not to initiate defection but act cautiously, favoring cooperation over defection only when the opponent's defection rate is low. Overall, LLMs behave at least as cooperatively as the typical human player, although our results indicate some substantial differences among models. In particular, Llama2 and GPT3.5 are more cooperative than humans, and especially forgiving and non-retaliatory for opponent defection rates below 30%. More similar to humans, Llama3 exhibits consistently uncooperative and exploitative behavior unless the opponent always cooperates. Our systematic approach to the study of LLMs in game theoretical scenarios is a step towards using these simulations to inform practices of LLM auditing and alignment.</description>
