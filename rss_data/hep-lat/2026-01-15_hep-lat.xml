      <title>Inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays of heavy mesons on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the recent progress from our group in extracting observables of both inclusive and exclusive semileptonic heavy-meson decays directly from lattice QCD four-point correlators. On the inclusive side, we illustrate how to estimate the systematic uncertainties from omitted higher-order terms and non-zero smearing of the kernel approximation, building on two important features of the Chebyshev expansion. On the exclusive side, we perform BCL parameterizations of the pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar form factors and compare the fitted coefficients with those from earlier results by HPQCD. We also perform a HQET-based parameterization of the P-wave form factors to shed new light on the 1/2-vs-3/2 puzzle. This work constitutes a step toward a unified lattice treatment of inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays, relevant for the Vcb puzzle. In this study, we use lattice ensembles from the RBC/UKQCD collaboration for numerical investigations. Future developments from our group will focus on the control of other systematic effects for inclusive decays and investigations of other techniques with reduced statistical errors to extract exclusive contributions from lattice four-point correlators.</description>

      <title>Spatial Wilson Loops and Energy Loss for Heavy Quarks in Magnetized HQCD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effective potential and the string tension for the spatial Wilson loop (SWL) in hot dense QGP with two types of anisotropy, i.e. external magnetic field and spatial anisotropy, employing a holographic approach for the heavy quark model. In this approach, the string is extended in the 5th, holographic direction and has a turning point either on a dynamical wall (DW) configuration or on the horizon configuration in the 5th direction. We obtain the magnetic catalysis behavior for a phase transition between DW and horizon configuration of the string. The structure of the phase diagram does not depend on the boundary conditions choice for the dilaton field. Inclusion of the external magnetic field and spatial anisotropy enhance the string tension in the horizon configuration, namely drag force. For the spatially isotropic case $\nu = 1$ at different magnetic field values the string tension is proportional to $T^2$ and is qualitatively consistent with lattice results. However, for the anisotropic case, $\nu = 4.5$, it deviates from the quadratic term.</description>

      <title>Numerical stability of force-gradient integrators and their Hessian-free variants in lattice QCD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive linear stability analysis of force-gradient integrators and their Hessian-free variants is carried out by investigating the harmonic oscillator as a test equation. The analysis reveals that the linear stability of conventional force-gradient integrators and their Hessian-free counterparts coincides. By performing detailed linear stability investigations for the entire family of self-adjoint integrators with up to eleven exponentials per time step, we detect promising integrator variants that are providing a good trade-off between accuracy and numerical stability. Special attention is given to the application of these promising integrator variants within the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm, particularly in the context of interacting field theories. Simulations for the two-dimensional Schwinger model are conducted to demonstrate that there are no significant differences in the stability domain of a force-gradient integrator and its Hessian-free counterpart. Lattice QCD simulations with two heavy Wilson fermions emphasize that Hessian-free force-gradient integrators with a larger stability threshold allow for a more efficient computational process compared to conventional splitting methods. Furthermore, detailed investigations of the stability threshold are performed by investigating Nf = 2 twisted-mass fermions and nested integrators, highlighting the reliability of the linear stability threshold for lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Insights into Meson and Baryon Structure using Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with running masses that take constituent-like values at infrared momenta. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches these ideas via the unified explanation of pion and proton electromagnetic and gravitational form factors.</description>
