      <title>Contrast-enhanced X-ray imaging of articular cartilage: reliability of a cationic contrast agent in combination with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Articular cartilage showcases distinctive mechanical behaviour, attributable to its biphasic composition and hierarchical organization. Proteoglycans, essential constituents of the extracellular matrix, contribute to tissue swelling, stiffness, and viscoelasticity, thanks to the fixed charge density. Degenerative alterations in proteoglycan content and collagen structure - key indicators of diseases such as osteoarthritis - compromise the mechanical integrity of articular cartilage, underscoring the importance of early detection. Although magnetic resonance imaging provides valuable compositional information, its limited spatial resolution restricts its effectiveness in evaluating thin soft tissues such as articular cartilage. As an alternative, contrast-enhanced X-ray imaging circumvents such limitation, resorting to the use of radiopaque contrast agents. In this context, cationic contrast agents, like CA4+, enable the quantitative assessment of proteoglycan content via electrostatic attraction. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography offers an optimal compromise between spatial resolution and radiation exposure, making it a promising tool for clinical use. This study aimed to explore the relationship between proteoglycan content - quantified through contrast-enhanced high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography combined with the use of CA4+ - and the viscoelastic properties of healthy bovine articular cartilage, assessed via indentation testing. Results highlighted significant correlations between the enhanced radiopacity of articular cartilage, ascribable to the PG content, with parameters representing the mechanical response of the tissue.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Emission Cascade Predicting Progression to Failure of Rock and Bone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi brittle materials such as rock and bone are understood to fail via microcrack coalescence. The accompanying Acoustic Emission (AE) event rate is known to increase as failure progresses. Here we examine the progression of the AE event rate for both rock and bone under conditions where failure progresses under fixed loading. The experiments for rock entail subjecting granite beams to a fixed loading under three point bending and monitoring the time-dependent failure. For bone, human cadaver skulls are loaded under pinning loads similar to those used for immobilization of the head for neurosurgical procedures. AE rates are shown to be consistent with a rate dependent material failure law including a quasi-linear cascade of the inverse AE energy rate in the lead up to failure that is shown here to arise because of a coupling wherein a response rate is a power law of a driver and the driver is, in turn, a power law of the accumulated response. For both materials and experimental configurations this cascade provides warning of impending failure. For granite beams there is accurate prediction of failure time over the final 30 percent of the specimens lifetimes, which ranged from 35 seconds to two days. For skull fracture, the commencement of the failure cascade provides 30-70 seconds for warning of failure, which would be sufficient for basic remedial action to avoid patient injury in a surgical application.</description>

      <title>Understanding Mechanistic Role of Structural and Functional Connectivity in Tau Propagation Through Multi-Layer Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent AD cohort.</description>

      <title>Material Decomposition in Photon-Counting Computed Tomography with Diffusion Models: Comparative Study and Hybridization with Variational Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) has emerged as a promising imaging technique, enabling spectral imaging and material decomposition (MD). However, images typically suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to constraints such as low photon counts and sparse-view settings which provoke artifacts. To prevent this, variational methods minimize a data-fit function coupled with handcrafted regularizers that mimic a prior by enforcing image properties such as gradient sparsity. In the last few years, diffusion models (DMs) have become predominant in the field of generative models and have been used as a learned prior for image reconstruction. This work investigates the use of DMs as regularizers for MD tasks in PCCT, specifically using diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) guidance. Three DPS-based approaches-image-domain two-step DPS (im-TDPS), projection-domain two-step DPS (proj-TDPS), and one-step DPS (ODPS)-are evaluated. The first two methods achieve MD in two steps by performing reconstruction and MD separately. The last method, ODPS, samples the material images directly from the measurement data. The results indicate that ODPS achieves superior performance compared to im-TDPS and proj-TDPS, providing sharper, noise-free and crosstalk-free images. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid method for scenarios involving materials absent from the training dataset. This method combines DM priors with standard variational handcrafted regularizers for the materials unknown to the DM. This hybrid method demonstrates improved MD quality compared to a standard variational method and does not require additional training of the DM neural network (NN).</description>

      <title>Simulation of Repair on Dynamic Patient-Specific Left Atrioventricular Valve Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09285v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a dynamic, image-derived patient-specific physical simulation platform for the assessment of left atrioventricular valve (LAVV) repair strategies in pediatric patients with repaired atrioventricular canal defects. Methods: 3D transesophageal echocardiographic images of two patients with regurgitant LAVVs were identified from an institutional database. Custom code in SlicerHeart was used to segment leaflets, define the annulus, and generate patient-specific valve molds. Silicone valve models were fabricated and tested in a pulse duplicator under simulated physiological conditions. Five unrepaired valves were analyzed for manufacturing consistency, and multiple surgical repair techniques were compared for two patient-specific models. Results: Manufacturing variability was low in annular metrics (CV for annular circumference: 2.1; commissural distance: 4.1; annulus height: 14.7) but higher in leaflet closure metrics (billow height: 11.1%; billow volume: 18.9%; tenting height: 45.9%; tenting volume: 73.5%). In Patient 1, cleft closure and an Alfieri stitch both eliminated the regurgitant orifice area, but the Alfieri stitch resulted in elevated mean pressure gradient (17 mmHg vs. 4-9 mmHg for other repairs) and deteriorated with repeated loading. In Patient 2, no repair eliminated regurgitation entirely; however, combining an 11 mm patch augmentation with commissuroplasty reduced regurgitant area to 0.147 cm2, the smallest observed among tested strategies. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a dynamic physical simulation platform for preclinical LAVV repair evaluation. This proof-of-concept work highlights the platform potential for refining repair strategies before clinical application, which may be particularly relevant in small and heterogeneous populations with congenital heart disease.</description>

      <title>PolyPose: Deformable 2D/3D Registration via Polyrigid Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19256v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise-rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-rays, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail. Additional visualizations, tutorials, and code are available at https://polypose.csail.mit.edu.</description>
