      <title>Spinning Boundary Correlators from (A)dS$_4$ Twistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a twistor-space framework to compute boundary correlators via a boundary limit of nested Penrose transforms in (A)dS$_4$. Starting from correlators of (anti-)self-dual bulk fields, the boundary limit reproduces the correlators of the dual conserved currents; we demonstrate this explicitly for two- and three-point functions. The two-point correlator is rendered finite by working in Euclidean signature. At three points, we obtain compact rational twistor-space representatives obeying a double-copy relation, thereby clarifying the twistor-space origin of the results in Baumann et al. 2024. We further extend the analysis to non-conserved currents with integer conformal dimension, dual to massive bulk fields, as well as to the free scalar.</description>

      <title>Entanglement C-functions of defects and interfaces in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider planar codimension-one defects and interfaces in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, realized by the D3/D5-brane intersection. Working in the probe limit, where the number of D5-branes is small compared to the number of D3-branes, we obtain analytic results for the holographic entanglement entropy of a ball-shaped region centered on the defect. A defect renormalization group flow is triggered by giving the defect hypermultiplets a mass, which corresponds to separating the D3- and D5-branes. Along this flow the entanglement C-function decreases monotonically. We also allow the D5-branes to carry worldvolume flux corresponding to dissolved D3-branes, in which case the setup describes an interface between two copies of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory with different gauge groups, where an RG flow is triggered by a mass term for vector multiplets. Here we again find monotonic behavior of the entanglement C-function, although its interpretation as a measure of effective degrees of freedom is problematic. We investigate possible alternative measures of degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Lectures on Open Effective Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theories offer a powerful method to unify diverse models under a small set of control parameters, allowing systematic expansions around well-established theories. These techniques, developed in particle physics, were designed for experiments where the initial state - the vacuum before a scattering event - is as clean and isolated as possible. Besides colliders, realistic environments are often noisy and dissipative. The recognition of the limitations of traditional EFT techniques has, over the past decade, sparked intense progress at the interface of high-energy physics and condensed matter. These considerations motivate a new approach to gravitation and cosmology, one that models the gravitational sector as evolving in the presence of an unobservable medium. Open Effective Field Theories provide a systematic and controllable field-theoretic framework for modeling dissipation and noise in gravitation and cosmology. These notes aim to introduce this versatile toolkit, enabling model-agnostic assessments of how unknown environments shape our observational probes.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant renormalization scheme for twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short-distance asymptotics of the generating functional for $n$-point correlators of twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric (SUSY) SU($N$) Yang-Mills (SYM) theory were recently calculated in [1,2]. This calculation depends on a change of basis for renormalized twist-$2$ operators, in which $-\gamma(g)/ \beta(g)$ reduces to $\gamma_0/ (\beta_0\,g)$ at all orders in perturbation theory, where $\gamma_0$ is diagonal, $\gamma(g) = \gamma_0 g^2+\ldots$ is the anomalous-dimension matrix, and $\beta(g) = -\beta_0 g^3+\ldots$ is the beta function. The method is founded on a new geometric interpretation of operator mixing [3], assuming that the eigenvalues of the matrix $\gamma_0/ \beta_0$ meet the nonresonant condition $\lambda_i-\lambda_j\neq 2k$, with the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ ordered nonincreasingly and $k\in \mathbb{N}^+$. This nonresonant condition was numerically verified for $i,j$ up to $10^4$ in [1,2]. In this work, we employ techniques initially developed in [4] to present a number-theoretic proof of the nonresonant condition for twist-$2$ operators, fundamentally based on the classic result that Harmonic numbers are not integers.</description>

      <title>Brickwall model for hyperbolic black holes and chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum chaotic behavior of black holes within the brickwall model, focusing on probe scalar fields in ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic AdS black holes. The brickwall model has captured the normal modes of BTZ black holes ($d=2$) with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon and their connection to quantum chaos signatures of random matrix theory. Here, we extend this framework to higher-dimensional AdS black holes ($d&gt;2$), exploring how black hole normal modes encode chaotic dynamics across dimensions and examining the universality of this approach. We show that quantum chaos is prominent in lower dimensions and persists in higher dimensions. Specifically, deviations from the logarithmic spectrum in $d=2$ evolves into a power-law spectrum at higher $d$, highlighting the sensitivity of black hole normal modes to dimensionality, while retaining signatures of quantum chaos despite the spectral deformation. Our results are supported by conventional diagnostics, including level spacing distributions and spectral form factors, as well as modern tools like Krylov complexity. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the brickwall model in capturing chaotic behavior in the parametrically large dimension limit, where the spectrum becomes constant leading to degeneracy and a non-chaotic regime, while emphasizing its effectiveness as a tool for studying quantum aspects of black holes in moderate higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>New variants of $N=3,4$ superconformal mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct superconformal mechanics with $N=3$ and $N=4$ supersymmetries that were inspired by analogies with the supersymmetric Schwarzian mechanics. The Schwarzian, being another system with superconformal symmetry, provides insight into the field content of supersymmetric mechanics, most notably, on the number and properties of the fermionic fields involved. Adding more fermionic fields (four in the $N=3$ case and eight in the $N=4$ case) made it possible to construct systems possessing maximal superconformal symmetries in $N=3$ and $N=4$, namely $OSp(3|2)$ and $D(1,2;\alpha)$. In the case of $N=4$ supersymmetry, we explicitly construct a new variant of $N=4$ superconformal mechanics in which all bosonic subalgebras of $D(1,2;\alpha)$ superalgebra have bosonic realization. In addition, the constructed systems involve $so(3)$ currents whose parametrization is not fixed, which allows to consider different underlying geometries.</description>

      <title>Unitarity and the On-Shell Action of Worldline Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the on-shell action formalism within Worldline Quantum Field Theory (WQFT) to describe scattering of spinning compact bodies in General Relativity in the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion. The real on-shell action is constructed from vacuum diagrams with causal (retarded) propagators from which scattering observables such as momentum impulse and spin kick follow via Poisson brackets of the initial scattering data. Furthermore, we explore the implications of unitarity at the level of the worldline and show how generalised unitarity techniques can be adapted to WQFT to efficiently compute multi-loop contributions. Our work establishes a concrete link between WQFT and amplitude-based methods, elucidating how unitarity cuts ensure equivalence between the on-shell action derived from either approach. Extending the state-of-the-art, we complete the full on-shell action -- including dissipative terms -- at (formal) 3PM order and up to quartic spin interactions on both massive bodies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Unitarity Method for Worldline Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized unitarity method for theories of point-particle worldlines coupled to gravity, analogous to that of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. This method allows the computation of perturbative observables from basic principles such as locality and unitarity, thus avoiding gauge redundancies and the use of Feynman diagrams. We illustrate the method with a variety of examples, including the gravitational waveform for the scattering of two point masses at next-to-leading order (or ${\cal O}(G^{5/2})$), reproducing known results. Our method further streamlines the calculation of the scattering dynamics of compact binary systems and opens the door to further applications and systematical exploration of structure in this class of observables.</description>

      <title>Setting $T^2$ free for braneworld holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify what has been referred to as 'cut-off CFT' in holographic braneworld with $T^2$ or $T\bar T$ theory (depending on the dimension of the bulk), so that the holographic dual of AdS-gravity with Neumann boundary conditions is a $T^2$-deformed CFT that is set free. After making statements that apply for general dimensions higher than three, we focus on the case of a three-dimensional bulk. We find from bulk arguments that the effective theory on the brane is governed by a $T\bar T$-like flow equation, such that under certain assumptions the effective gravity theory on the brane is given by a $T\bar T$-like deformed timelike Liouville theory, which limits to the description of the holographic Weyl anomaly for branes that approach the asymptotic boundary.</description>

      <title>Effect of dark matter halo environment on GW memory signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the gravitational wave (GW) memory effect for a black hole embedded in a dark matter halo described by a Hernquist-type density profile, both with and without a spike. We first solve the geodesic equations in this spacetime under the influence of a GW pulse to examine how the combined effects of the dark matter halo and the GW pulse modify the geodesic deviation equation and particle trajectories. We then investigate how the memory effect manifests in the waveform in the presence of the dark matter halo. To do that, we analyze the memory contribution at asymptotic null infinity using the Bondi-Sachs formalism and, in particular, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) flux balance laws associated with BMS symmetries. This framework allows us to quantify the GW memory contribution to the waveform, incorporate it into the ringdown waveform templates, and thereby provide a possible avenue for extracting information about the dark matter halo parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum speed limit as a sensitive probe of Planck-scale effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many quantum-gravity scenarios predict a minute modification of the canonical commutator, known as the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), whose low-energy signatures are, in principle, accessible to state-of-the-art laboratory tests. We compute first-order minimal-length corrections to the quantum speed limit (QSL) for three cases: uniform superpositions in an infinite square well, coherent harmonic-oscillator states, and squeezed-oscillator states. We identify a universal amplification law: for any pure state, the fractional shift of either speed limit scales linearly with $\beta$ and algebraically with the state's effective Hilbert-space size. As the effective Hilbert-space dimension can be exceedingly large, the associated minimal-length signatures are amplified by several orders of magnitude. Using high-precision matter-wave timing data, we set a direct bound on the GUP parameter $\beta$, which quantifies minimal-length quantum-gravity effects. Our analysis indicates that phase-locked, short-time overlap fits on kilogram-scale optical-spring modes can tighten this bound by orders of magnitude. We outline two implementable measurement pipelines -- continuous back-action-evading single-quadrature readout and stroboscopic, phase-locked pulsed tomography -- that exploit this leverage, making QSL-based timing a practical, near-term probe of minimal-length physics on quantum-optical and optomechanical platforms.</description>

      <title>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Thompson optical depth to the CMB from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first constraints on the electron optical depth to reionization, $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$, from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest alone for physically motivated reionization models that match the reionization's end-point, $z_{\rm{end}}$, required by the same astrophysical probe, and for symmetric reionization models with fixed duration, $\Delta z$, commonly adopted in CMB reionization analyses. Compared to traditional estimates from the latter, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest traces the ionization state of the IGM through its coupling with the thermal state. We find an explicit mapping between the two solving the chemistry and temperature evolution equations for hydrogen and helium. Our results yield $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=$0.042^{+0.047}_{-0.02}$ (95% C.L) and $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=$0.042^{+0.024}_{-0.015}$ for reionization models with $z_{\rm{end}}$ and $\Delta z$-fixed, respectively, disfavoring a high $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$=0.09 by 2.57$\sigma$ and 4.31$\sigma$. With mock Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data that mimics the precision of future larger quasar sample datasets, we would potentially obtain tighter $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$ constraints and exclude such a high $\tau_{\mathrm{e}}$ with a higher significance, paving the way for novel constraints on the epoch of reionization from a large-scale structure probe independent of the CMB.</description>

      <title>Geodesics in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of test particles in quantum-gravitational backgrounds by introducing the concept of q--desics, quantum-corrected analogs of classical geodesics. Unlike standard approaches that rely solely on the expectation value of the spacetime metric, our formulation is based on the expectation value of quantum operators, such as the the affine connection-operator. This allows us to capture richer geometric information. We derive the q--desic equation using both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods and apply it to spherically symmetric static backgrounds obtained from canonical quantum gravity. Exemplary results include, light-like radial motion and circular motion with quantum gravitational corrections far above the Planck scale.
  This framework provides a refined description of motion in quantum spacetimes and opens new directions for probing the interface between quantum gravity and classical general relativity.</description>

      <title>Exotic PeVatrons as sources of ultra-high-energy gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore novel classes of exotic astrophysical sources capable of producing ultra-high-energy gamma rays extending beyond the PeV scale, motivated by quantum gravity scenarios and dark matter phenomenology. These sources include: ultra-spinning black hole vortex-string systems; exotic compact objects such as boson star, axion star and Q-ball. Such Exotica generate powerful magnetic fields through interactions with millicharged dark matter, enabling particle acceleration mechanisms that surpass the energy limits of conventional astrophysical sources like pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants. We demonstrate that such exotic PeVatrons could be distributed throughout our Galaxy and may be detectable by current (LHAASO, HAWC) and next-generation (CTA) gamma-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Noncoincidence $f(Q)$-Cosmology with Dark Matter Coupled to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate FLRW cosmology in the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity with a nonminimal coupling between dark matter and the gravitational field. In the noncoincidence gauge, the field equations admit an equivalent multi-scalar field representation, which we investigate the phase-space using the Hubble-normalization approach. We classify all stationary points for arbitrary function $f(Q)$ and we discuss the physical properties of the asymptotic solutions. For the power-law theory, we perform a detailed stability analysis and show that the de Sitter solution is the unique future attractor, while the matter-dominated point appears as a saddle point. Moreover, there exist a family of scaling solutions that can be related to inflationary dynamics. In contrast with uncoupled $f(Q)$ models, the presence of the coupling introduces a viable matter-dominated era alongside late-time accelerated expansion. Our study shows that the coupling function plays a crucial role in cosmological dynamics in $f(Q)$ gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the classical Batalin--Vilkovisky cohomology at negative ghost number of the spinning particle, observed in ref. arXiv:1511.02135, is removed by a Koszul--Tate resolution involving saturation of Grassmann odd variables. The model thus satisfies the axioms of Felder and Kazhdan. The AKSZ formulation of the resolved model is described. We reveal partial information on the resolution of the constrained phase space, which involves resolving the parity-shifted tangent sheaf of the light-c\^one. Specialising to dimension one, we describe the full resolution.</description>

      <title>Modified cosmology through generalized mass-to-horizon entropy: implications for structure growth and primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of entropic cosmology, entropic forces arising at the cosmological horizon have been proposed as an alternative mechanism to explain the Universe's current accelerated phase. However, recent studies have shown that, under the Clausius relation and assuming a linear mass-to-horizon (MHR) relation, all entropic force models reduce to the original Bekenstein-Hawking formulation, regardless of the specific form of the horizon entropy. As a result, they inherit the same observational limitations in accounting for cosmic dynamics. To address this issue, a generalized MHR has been introduced, providing the foundation for a modified cosmological scenario rooted in the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture. In this work, we explore the implications of this generalized framework for early-Universe dynamics. Specifically, we analyze the growth of matter perturbations within the spherical Top-Hat formalism in the linear regime, showing that the density contrast profile is significantly influenced by the modified background dynamics predicted by the model. Moreover, considering the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors in the sub-$10^3\,\mathrm{Hz}$ range, we examine the impact on the relic abundance of Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs), identifying parameter regions where deviations from standard cosmology may arise through an enhanced PGW spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how matter density affects neutrino oscillations by considering a mass-varying neutrino scenario where the neutrino mass depends on a scalar field. This scalar field is non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant, causing its profile to be implicitly influenced by the surrounding matter distribution. Using data from solar neutrino experiments, we derive constraints on the model parameters, providing new insights into the properties of mass-varying neutrino within the Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor framework</description>

      <title>Shadow of black holes with consistent thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects in general induce scale dependence in the coupling constants. We explore this possibility in gravity, with a scale-dependent Newton coupling. When applied to Kerr black holes with such a running coupling, the consistency of black hole thermodynamics requires that the Newton coupling have a specific dependence on the black hole parameters. In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Pointwise spinor quantum fields cannot be microcausal nor Poincar\'e covariant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend and strengthen no-go results on pointwise-defined quantum fields to cover general spinors. We show that the weak continuity of quantum fields rules out equal-time canonical conjugate (anti)commutation relations in globally hyperbolic spacetimes; for quantum fields on Minkowski spacetime, weakly continuous translation covariance enforces the needed continuity and yields the same no-go. We also extend Wightman's no-go theorem to show that the weak continuity of quantum fields rules out fermionic microcausality in $C^2$ Lorentzian spacetimes. We finish by generalising Wizimirski's no-go theorem to show that the existence of a Poincar\'e-invariant vacuum precludes pointwise spinorial covariance on a Minkowski background -- ruling out, in particular, pointwise covariance for Weyl and Dirac fermions, for photons and gravitons -- which further highlights the difficulty of quantising gravity pointwisely.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Cosmological Tensions with the Hadrosymmetric Twin Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hadrosymmetric Twin Higgs (HTH) model provides a natural solution to the little hierarchy problem by incorporating all three generations of quarks in a twin sector. Unlike other Twin Higgs scenarios, such as the Mirror Twin Higgs (MTH), the HTH framework avoids introducing additional light states or radiation and thus remains consistent with stringent bounds on the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Its particle content and interactions also make it difficult to probe at colliders, highlighting the importance of cosmological tests. In this work, we study the cosmological implications of the HTH model, focusing on the persistent tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($\sigma_8$). Implementing the HTH sector in a Boltzmann code and confronting it with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and local $H_0$ measurements, we find that the scenario reduces the Hubble tension from more than $4\sigma$ to about $2.5\sigma$, while also alleviating the $\sigma_8$ discrepancy. These results demonstrate that the HTH framework not only addresses naturalness in particle physics but also offers a viable route to mitigating current cosmological tensions, thereby strengthening the link between fundamental theory and precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Do plasmoids induce fast magnetic reconnection in well-resolved current sheets in 2D MHD simulations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the development of tearing-mode instability using the highest resolution two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of reconnecting current sheets on a uniform grid, for Lundquist numbers $10^3 \le S \le 2 \times 10^5$. Although the tearing-mode instability is commonly thought to trigger a plasmoid cascade that enables fast reconnection - i.e., independent of $S$ - our results, in broad agreement with the recent findings of Morillo \&amp; Alexakis (2025), challenge this belief. We demonstrate a Sweet-Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \sim 10^4$. For larger values, plasmoid formation sets in leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity dependent, and therefore slow. In our simulations, the plasmoids do not form a cascade of mergers, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Our findings call for the revision of the role of plasmoid formation in 2D high Lundquist number magnetic reconnection. Even if future studies demonstrate that 2D plasmoid-reconnection becomes resistivity-independent at sufficiently large $S$, directly extending those results to 3D astrophysical environments is not justified, as in realistic circumstances, the increase of $S$ also raises the Reynolds number of the outflows, making it essential to account for the dominant role of turbulence.</description>

Abstract: Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used to compute the nucleation rate $\Gamma$, but these are incomplete. We perform nonperturbative lattice simulations of nucleation in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, computing a final result extrapolated to the thermodynamic and continuum limits. Although the system in question should be well-described by a complete one-loop perturbative calculation, we find only qualitative agreement with the full perturbative result, with a 20% discrepancy in $|\log \Gamma|$. Our result motivates further testing of the current nucleation paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that a large class of characters of 2d conformal field theories (CFTs) can be written in the form of a Nahm sum. In \cite{Zagier:2007knq}, D. Zagier identified a list of Nahm sum expressions that are modular functions under a congruence subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and can be thought of as candidates for characters of rational CFTs. Motivated by the observation that the same formulas appear as the half-indices of certain 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories, we perform a general search over low-rank 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theories which either flow to unitary TFTs or $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-zero SCFTs in the infrared. These are exceptional classes of 3d theories, which are expected to support rational and $C_2$-cofinite chiral algebras on their boundary. We compare and contrast our results with Zagier's and comment on a possible generalization of Nahm's conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We construct wavefunctions for unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, i.e. BMS particles, and show that they describe quantum superpositions of (Poincar\'e) particles propagating on inequivalent gravity vacua. This follows from reconsidering McCarthy's classification of BMS group UIRs through a unique, Lorentz-invariant but non-linear, decomposition of supermomenta into hard and soft pieces.</description>

Abstract: We give a rigorous definition of sine dilaton gravity in terms of the worldsheet theory of the complex Liouville string arXiv:2409.17246. The latter has a known exact solution that we leverage to explore the gravitational path integral of sine dilaton gravity - a quantum deformation of dS JT gravity that admits both AdS$_2$ and dS$_2$ vacua. We uncover that the gravitational path integral receives contributions from new saddles describing transitions between vacua in a third-quantized picture. We also discuss the sphere and disk partition function in this context and contrast our findings with other recent work on this theory.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the computation of the classical gravitational waveform for a particle moving in a plane wave background using on-shell amplitudes. We emphasize the relationship between gravitational memory and the boundary conditions of external scattering states, which were neglected in previous works. We then provide the first tree-level expression for the waveform that captures all memory effects. The waveform is presented in terms of Synge's world function, with explicit tail terms, and a smooth weak memory limit. We also discuss the choice of BMS frame for the waveform on a plane wave background. In flat space, this corresponds to a choice of soft dressing of the initial state. We show that on a plane wave background, this dressing becomes a supertranslation of the waveform, in addition to a phase shift in the waveshape of the background.</description>

It also connects exact classical solutions of Abelian gauge and gravitational theories in a small number of specific examples, known as classical double copies. These have a number of special properties, such as being algebraically special, and it remains an open question whether examples exist for algebraically general spacetimes or with nontrivial dynamics. Here we provide a novel framework for understanding classical double copies at the level of the metric, both organizing the known examples and exploring their properties under a new lens. Utilizing Killing vectors as natural gauge fields on a spacetime, we propose a procedure for generating new classical double copies. As a proof of concept, we provide a flat-space single copy for the Kasner metric, an algebraically general spacetime. This example is also a double copy at the level of its curvature, and provides the first type-$I$ Weyl double copy on flat spacetime, confirming expectations from perturbation theory. This provides a promising avenue for extending exact double copies to a broader class of general, physically relevant spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: We show that scattering amplitudes on any gauge theory background admitting a coherent state description double copy to amplitudes in a curved spacetime. The metric of the spacetime is built from the gauge background using a notion of classical double copy which emerges naturally at the amplitude level. In the self-dual sector this map relates backgrounds which are exact vacuum solutions in gauge theory and gravity.</description>

      <title>Simple holographic dual of the Maxwell-Cattaneo model &amp; the fate of KMS symmetry for non-hydrodynamic modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion, as described by Fick's laws, governs the spreading of particles, information, data, and even financial fluctuations. However, due to its parabolic structure, the diffusion equation leads to an unphysical prediction: any localized disturbance instantaneously affects the entire system. The Maxwell-Cattaneo (MC) model, originally introduced to address relativistic heat conduction, refines the standard diffusion framework by incorporating a finite relaxation time $\tau$, associated with the onset of local equilibrium. This modification yields physically relevant consequences, including the emergence of propagating shear waves in liquids and second sound in solids. Holographic methods have historically provided powerful tools for describing the hydrodynamics of strongly correlated systems. However, they have so far failed to capture the dynamics governed by the MC model, limiting their ability to model intermediate time-scale phenomena. In this work, we construct a simple holographic dual of the Maxwell-Cattaneo model and rigorously establish its equivalence through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. As an important byproduct of our analysis, and contrary to previous ad-hoc assumptions, we find that effective field theories featuring non-hydrodynamic modes exhibit a generalized form of Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry, which reduces to the canonical form only in the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Fermionic S-matrix and cosmological correlators: T-violation at O(H)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Bunch-Davies (BD) and Unruh-de Witt (UdW) de Sitter S-matrices in the presence of spin-$1/2$ fermions. Building on recent work, this enables us to correlate the de Sitter S-matrix with cosmological correlators. We consider a finite-time version of the UdW S-matrix to study $O(H)$ corrections to some typical particle physics processes such as beta decay. Owing to the lack of time-reversal symmetry in the expanding Poincar\'e patch, we find signatures of intrinsic T-violation in polarized beta decay. The observable we study begins at $O(H)$. The possibility of T-violation was examined theoretically in the 1950's by Jackson, Treiman, and Wyld in flat space and has been probed more recently in the emiT experiment, with the purpose of examining fundamental T-violation coming from additional interactions in the Lagrangian. Our analysis places a lower bound on the intrinsic T-violation in the expanding Poincar\'e patch. At $O(H)$, we find both energy conserving and energy non-conserving contributions. Surprisingly, the energy-violating piece, in principle, can give large T-violation at fine-tuned values of the kinematical variables.</description>

Abstract: We compute template formulae of all four-loop $\beta$-functions and anomalous dimensions of arbitrary renormalisable quantum field theories with fermions and scalar fields in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme. Using these results, novel contributions to the $\beta$-functions of the Higgs and top coupling are extracted. We discuss how four loops present a challenge to dimensional continuation from four to three dimensions and propose a solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fate of global symmetries at the late-time boundary of de Sitter space. In anti-de Sitter space, bulk gauge symmetries generally correspond to conserved global currents on the boundary. We show that in de Sitter space such currents tend to acquire anomalous dimensions due to multiplet recombination with composite operators, which is a consequence of the shadow structure of the boundary operator spectrum. As a result, global symmetries are generically (weakly) broken. This mechanism is transparent in the EAdS reformulation of dS late-time correlators given in arXiv:2007.09993 and arXiv:2109.02725, where Dirichlet modes mix with composites and acquire small masses, while Neumann modes remain protected by gauge invariance. We demonstrate this mechanism explicitly in scalar QED, Yang-Mills theory, and Einstein gravity, and argue that it extends to higher-spin and partially massless fields.</description>

Abstract: Quiver Yangians are infinite-dimensional algebras capturing the BPS structure of a large class of supersymmetric models. Quiver theories related by Seiberg duality are expected to have isomorphic quiver Yangians, and this isomorphism has previously been shown for quivers corresponding to generalised conifold geometries. In this work, we present an explicit isomorphism for the two Seiberg dual phases of the F0 quiver theory, which falls outside of the above class. Some aspects of our construction are similar to the known cases, while others appear to be specific to the F0 quiver. In particular, the map involves square roots of operators bilinear in the fermionic fields of the mode being dualised.</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and Algebraic Structures in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kerr-Schild double copy is celebrated for producing exact gravitational spacetimes from gauge fields, yet the preservation of symmetry content remains largely unexplored. We investigate the fate of residual symmetries in the Kerr-Schild double copy, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution. On the gauge theory side, we derive the residual transformations that preserve the Abelian and non-Abelian Kerr-Schild ansatz\"e, finding they both form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra parameterized by arbitrary null functions. On the gravity side, we analyze the resulting residual diffeomorphisms of the Kerr-Schild Schwarzschild metric. Restricting our focus to the Killing vector class of solutions, we find that the only surviving diffeomorphisms are the finite-dimensional global isometries of Schwarzschild, reducing the residual gauge algebra to the Poincar\'e subalgebra containing exclusively time translations and spatial rotations. This finding confirms a fundamental structural mismatch: the infinite-dimensional algebra of the gauge side admits no analogous structure in this gravitational sector. We formalize this by showing that the BRST operator for the residual symmetry is trivialized under the Killing condition, establishing the consistency of this algebraic reduction within a quantum field theoretic framework. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In Part II, we complete this analysis by examining the more complex proper conformal Killing vector class of solutions and formulating a unified BRST framework.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Covariant Quantum Spacetime with Fuzzy Extra Dimensions in the IKKT model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general $k=-1$ FLRW covariant quantum spacetimes $\mathcal{M}^{3,1} \times \mathcal{K}$ with fuzzy extra dimensions $\mathcal{K}$ as classical solutions of the IKKT matrix model. The coupled equations of motion are recast in terms of conservation laws, which allow to determine the evolution of spacetime in a transparent way. We show that $\mathcal{K}$ is stabilized as a classical solution in the presence of a large $R$ charge, corresponding to internal angular momentum. This provides a mechanism to maintain a large hierarchy between UV and IR scales. We also argue that the evolution of spacetime is determined by a balance between classical and quantum effects, leading to a cosmic scale factor $a(t) \sim t$ and constant dilaton at late times. On such a background, the undeformed IKKT model leads to a higher-spin gauge theory including gravity.</description>

      <title>Slaying Axion-Like Particles via Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes from Supercooled Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from density fluctuations due to supercooled phase transitions (PTs) triggered in an axion-like particle (ALP) model. We find that the mass of the PBHs is inversely correlated with the ALP decay constant $f_a$. For instance, for $f_a$ varying from ${\cal O}$(100 MeV) to ${\cal O}$($10^{12}$ GeV), the PBH mass varies between $(10^{3} - 10^{-24}) M_{\odot}$. We then identify the ALP parameter space where the PBH can account for the entire (or partial) dark matter fraction of the Universe, in a single (multi-component) dark matter scenario, with the ALP being the other dark matter candidate. The PBH parameter space ruled out by current cosmological and microlensing observations can thus be directly mapped onto the ALP parameter space, thus providing new bounds on ALPs, complementary to the laboratory and astrophysical ALP constraints. Similarly, depending on the ALP couplings to other Standard Model particles, the ALP constraints on $f_a$ can be translated into a lower bound on the PBH mass scale. Moreover, the supercooled PT leads to a potentially observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal at future GW observatories, such as aLIGO, LISA and ET, that acts as another complementary probe of the ALPs, as well as of the PBH dark matter. Finally, we show that the recent NANOGrav signal of stochastic GW in the nHz frequency range can be explained in our model with $f_a\simeq (10~{\rm GeV}-1~{\rm TeV})$.</description>

Abstract: We explore indefinite causal order between events in the context of quasiclassical spacetimes in superposition. We introduce several new quantifiers to measure the degree of indefiniteness of the causal order for an arbitrary finite number of events and spacetime configurations in superposition. By constructing diagrammatic and knot-theoretic representations of the causal order between events, we find that the definiteness or maximal indefiniteness of the causal order is topologically invariant. This reveals an intriguing connection between the field of quantum causality and knot theory. Furthermore, we provide an operational encoding of indefinite causal order and discuss how to incorporate a measure of quantum coherence into our classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16243v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar and tensor modes of the gravitational perturbation in the presence of a scalar field which describes inflation. We investigate the back-reaction of the perturbations to the background by studying the effective energy-momentum tensor (2EMT) which is the second order constructed by the quadratic terms of the linear perturbations. 2EMT is gauge dependent due to the scalar mode. We obtain 2EMT in the slow-roll stage of inflation, and get its cosmological expressions in three (longitudinal, spatially flat, and comoving) gauge conditions. We find that the pure scalar-mode part in 2EMT is stronger in the short-wavelength limit, while the parts involved with the tensor mode (the pure tensor-mode part and the scalar-tensor coupled part) are stronger in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the exclusive semilpetonic decays of $\Lambda^{+}_{c}\to (\Lambda/n) \ell^{+} \nu_{\ell}~(\ell=e,\mu)$ within the standard model by using the light-front quark model (LFQM). The form factor behaviors are obtained from the effective treatment of nonvalence contributions in addition to the valence ones in the Drell-Yan-West frame due to the Bethe-Salpeter formalism. Based on these form factors, we find that the decay branching ratios of $\Lambda^{+}_{c}\to (\Lambda e^{+} \nu_{e},\,\Lambda \mu^{+} \nu_{e} ,\, n e^{+} \nu_{e},\, n \mu^{+} \nu_{e})$ are about $ (3.39,\,3.21,\,0.36,\,0.35)\%$ with the non-valence contributions, which are consistent with the recent experimental measurements at BESIII. Furthermore, we use the experimental data to fit the $\beta$ parameters in the baryonic distribution amplitudes under the LFQM, resulting in ($\beta_{\Lambda_{c}},\beta_{\Lambda}, \beta_{n})= (0.58\pm0.08, 0.52\pm0.08,0.44\pm0.04)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study general properties of confinement phase transitions in the early universe. An observable gravitational wave signal from such transitions requires significant supercooling. However, in almost all understood examples of confining gauge theories the degree of supercooling is too small to give interesting gravitational wave signals. We review and highlight the evidence why supercooling is not generic in confining gauge theories. The exceptions are Randall-Sundrum models which define a strongly coupled gauge theory holographically by a 5D gravitational theory. We construct a simple illustrative model of a 4D gauge theory inspired by features of the Randall-Sundrum model. It is a large-$N$ gauge theory in the conformal window coupled to a weakly coupled scalar field which undergoes a supercooled phase transition that breaks the conformal symmetry and triggers confinement. We show that there are interesting features in the gravitational wave spectra that can carry the imprint of the confining gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We presented a complete calculation of the one-loop fermionic correction to the effective coupling between axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons within a constant, homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary strength. This interaction, responsible for the Primakoff effect, is central to detecting axion-like particles in astrophysical settings and terrestrial experiments like helioscopes and haloscopes. Accurately predicting the interaction rate requires accounting for quantum corrections. Our work tackles this by employing magnetically field-dressed fermion propagators derived using Schwinger's proper time method and a systematic Lorentz decomposition using the Ritus basis.

      <title>Fermions in a loop quantum cosmological spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed Hamiltonian treatment of an inhomogeneous fermionic perturbation propagating on a closed FLRW spacetime quantized via LQC. Expanding the fermion in spinor harmonics on spatial 3-sphere and truncating at quadratic order, we derive a decoupled, mode-by-mode Hamiltonian, where each mode behaves as a time-dependent Fermi oscillator. This framework naturally facilitates a Schrodinger-picture evolution for fermionic perturbations on a quantum-corrected background. Under the test-field approximation, each massive mode sees its own dressed metric, akin to bosonic perturbations, but with distinctive Planck-scale modifications in both temporal and spatial components. Massless modes, by contrast, experience an equivalent class of conformal backgrounds: quantum corrections drop out of the spatial sector, while the temporal component alone is dressed by quantum gravity corrections. Extending beyond the test-field regime via a Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we incorporate fermionic backreaction self-consistently. Each mode's energy (depending on the either vacuum or pair states they occupied) sources a mode-dependent shift of the background Hamiltonian, resulting in a rainbow metric. In the deep Planck regime, vacuum occupation yields a positive fermionic perturbation term in the Hamiltonian, raising the effective minisuperspace potential and delaying the bounce to higher density in the contracting branch. Excited occupation flips the perturbation sign, lowering the barrier and advancing the bounce to lower density. At large volumes, massive fermion backreaction settles into a constant energy density -- an emergent cosmological constant -- capable of driving late-time acceleration, whereas massless modes remain dynamically inert postbounce. These effects break the exact time-reversal symmetry of the quantum bounce and generate asymmetric pre- and postbounce trajectories.</description>

      <title>Anomaly of conserved and nonconserved axial charges in Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the axial anomaly in Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. The definition of axial charge operators is ambiguous, especially between conserved and nonconserved axial charges. While these charges appear to differ only by a higher-order term in lattice spacing, they do not coincide in the continuum limit. We demonstrate, through analytical and numerical calculations in 1+1 dimensions, that the conserved axial charge correctly reproduces the axial anomaly relation in continuous spacetime. Our finding would serve as a valuable lesson about doubler artifact in Hamiltonian time evolution of lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Dark higher-form portals and duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scalar or vector particles are among the most studied dark matter candidates. Yet, those are always described as scalar or vector fields. In this paper, we explore instead the embedding of the scalar particle in an antisymmetric rank-three tensor field, and the dark photon into an antisymmetric rank-two tensor field (a so-called Kalb-Ramond field), and construct minimal bases of effective interactions with Standard Model fields. Then, keeping phenomenological applications as our main objective, a number of theoretical aspects are clarified, in particular related to the impact of existing dualities among the corresponding free theories, and concerning their Stueckelberg representations. Besides, for the rank-two field, we present for the first time its full propagator, accounting for the possible presence of a pseudoscalar mass term. Thanks to these results, and with their different kinematics, gauge-invariant limits, and Lorentz properties, we show that these higher-form fields provide genuine alternative frameworks, with different couplings and expected signatures at low-energy or at colliders.</description>

      <title>Axion electrodynamics of Weyl superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy effective description of Weyl semimetals is defined by the axion electrodynamics, which captures the effects arising due to the presence of nodes of opposite chirality in the electronic structure. Here we explore the magnetoelectric response of time-reversal breaking (TRB) Weyl superconductors in the London regime. The influence of the axion contribution leads to an increase in the London penetration depth$-$a behavior that can be anticipated by first considering the photon spectrum of a TRB Weyl semimetal. Moreover, we find that both the Meissner state and the vortex phase feature an interplay between the electric and magnetic fields. This leads to a nonvanishing electromagnetic angular momentum, which we calculate for a number of geometrical configurations.</description>

      <title>Instability of regular planar black holes in four dimensions arising from an infinite sum of curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories derived via dimensional regularization with a conformal rescaling of the metric, we study the stability of planar black holes (BHs) whose horizons are described by two-dimensional compact Einstein spaces with vanishing curvature. By taking an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, it is possible to construct BH solutions whose metric components remain nonsingular at $r=0$, with a scalar-field derivative given by $\phi'(r)=1/r$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. We show that such BH solutions suffer from a strong coupling problem, where the kinetic term of the even-parity scalar-field perturbation associated with the timelike coordinate vanishes everywhere. Moreover, we find that these BHs are subject to both ghost and Laplacian instabilities for odd-parity perturbations near $r=0$. Consequently, the presence of these pathological features rules out regular planar BHs with the scalar-field profile $\phi'(r)=1/r$ as physically viable and stable configurations.</description>

      <title>Extended black hole thermodynamics in a DGP braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop extended black-hole thermodynamics on a Dvali--Gabadadze--Porrati (DGP) brane by promoting the brane tension \(\sigma\) to a thermodynamic variable within the extended Iyer--Wald framework. The brane tension acts as a localized vacuum energy with pressure \(P_\sigma \equiv -\sigma\), yielding a new work term \(V_\sigma\,\mathrm{d}P_\sigma\) in the first law and the corresponding Smarr relation. For static, spherically symmetric black holes we show that the conjugate volume equals the geometric volume \(V_\sigma=\tfrac{4\pi}{3}r_h^3\); for stationary, axisymmetric solutions it admits a covariant, slice-independent definition and evaluates to \(V_\sigma=\tfrac{4\pi}{3}\!\left(r_+^3+a^2 r_+\right)\). Working on the ghost-free normal branch, the brane is asymptotically flat with a single horizon, so the construction avoids de Sitter obstructions. Along a flat-brane path, asymptotic flatness is preserved by co-varying the bulk cosmological constant, and induced-gravity effects are suppressed by \(r_h/r_c\). These results establish a consistent flat-braneworld realization of black-hole chemistry in which brane tension provides the physically motivated pressure variable.</description>

      <title>Penrose Process Efficiency and Irreducible Mass in Rotating Einstein-Born-Infeld Black Holes with Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extraction of rotational energy from rotating Einstein-Born-Infeld (EBI) black holes, where nonlinear electrodynamics introduces a radius-dependent effective charge modifying the spacetime geometry. Focusing on neutral test particles in the equatorial plane, we derive analytic expressions for their kinematics and establish conditions for negative energy orbits essential to the Penrose process using the near-horizon limit and Wald inequality. We present a closed-form expression for maximal energy extraction efficiency as a function of spin, charge, and the Born-Infeld parameter $\beta$. Our numerical survey reveals that increasing charge and nonlinear Born-Infeld effects generally reduce horizon radius and ergoregion size, suppressing energy extraction efficiency compared to Kerr and often Kerr-Newman black holes. However, at certain spins and \$beta$, the EBI geometry can enhance efficiency beyond Kerr-Newman. We also compute the irreducible mass, showing how nonlinear electromagnetic dynamics reduce the horizon area and the associated entropy proxy. These results provide a unified picture linking nonlinear electrodynamics, horizon structure, and energy extraction efficiency across relevant parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we propose a conjecture that clarifies the relationship between the number of degree d elliptic curves in complex four-dimensional projective Fano hypersurfaces and their degree d elliptic Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants.

      <description>arXiv:2509.25276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard model of particle physics is usually cast in symmetry-first terms. Recently, a geometry-first picture has been proposed, in which the relevant symmetries do not appear explicitly at the ground level of ontology. In this paper I extend this approach to two central mechanisms of the standard model: spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Yukawa coupling, both essential for particles to acquire mass. These reformulations offer alternative explanations cast in purely geometric terms. For example, a particle's quantum numbers correspond to the internal space it inhabits and to the geometric type of object it is (e.g. an $(n,m)$-tensor). I argue that a symmetry-first account in terms of principal and associated bundles admits a genuine geometry-first counterpart only when the group's representation coincides with the automorphism group of the fibre -- a condition that cuts the slack tolerated by the symmetry-first view.</description>

      <title>Probing the Critical Point (CritPt) of AI Reasoning: a Frontier Physics Research Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular &amp; optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</description>
