      <title>Conformal Uncertainty Quantification of Electricity Price Predictions for Risk-Averse Storage Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a risk-averse approach to energy storage price arbitrage, leveraging conformal uncertainty quantification for electricity price predictions. The method addresses the significant challenges posed by the inherent volatility and uncertainty of real-time electricity prices, which create substantial risks of financial losses for energy storage participants relying on future price forecasts to plan their operations. The framework comprises a two-layer prediction model to quantify real-time price uncertainty confidence intervals with high coverage. The framework is distribution-free and can work with any underlying point prediction model. We evaluate the quantification effectiveness through storage price arbitrage application by managing the risk of participating in the real-time market. We design a risk-averse policy for profit-maximization of energy storage arbitrage to find the safest storage schedule with very minimal losses. Using historical data from New York State and synthetic price predictions, our evaluations demonstrate that this framework can achieve good profit margins with less than $35\%$ purchases.</description>

      <title>A linear-quadratic partially observed Stackelberg stochastic differential game with multiple followers and its application to multi-agent formation control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a linear-quadratic partially observed Stackelberg stochastic differential game problem in which a single leader and multiple followers are involved. We consider more practical formulation for partial information that none of them can observed the complete information and the followers know more than the leader. Some completely different methods including orthogonal decomposition are applied to overcome the difficulties caused by partially observability which improves the tools and relaxes the constraint condition imposed on admissible control in the existing literature. More precisely, the followers encounter the standard linear-quadratic partially observed optimal control problems, however, a kind of forward-backward indefinite linear-quadratic partially observed optimal control problem is considered by the leader. Instead of maximum principle of forward-backward control systems, inspired by the existing work related to definite case and classical forward control system, some distinct forward-backward linear-quadratic decoupling techniques including the completing the square technique are applied to solve the leader's problem. More interestingly, we develop the deterministic formation control in multi-agent system with a framework of Stackelberg differential game and extend it to the stochastic case. The optimal strategies are obtained by our theoretical result suitably.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the system coefficients for coupled harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical models often contain unknown functions and relations. In order to gain more insights into the nature of physical processes, these unknown functions have to be identified or reconstructed. Mathematically, we can formulate this research question within the framework of inverse problems. In this work, we consider optimization techniques to solve the inverse problem using Tikhonov regularization and data from laboratory experiments. We propose an iterative strategy that eliminates the need for laboratory experiments. Our method is applied to identify the coupling and damping coefficients in a system of oscillators, ensuring an efficient and experiment-free approach. We present our results and compare them with those obtained from an alternative, purely experimental approach. By employing our proposed strategy, we demonstrate a significant reduction in the number of laboratory experiments required.</description>

      <title>Gearing Gaussian process modeling and sequential design towards stochastic simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter presents specific aspects of Gaussian process modeling in the presence of complex noise. Starting from the standard homoscedastic model, various generalizations from the literature are presented: input varying noise variance, non-Gaussian noise, or quantile modeling. These approaches are compared in terms of goal, data availability and inference procedure. A distinction is made between methods depending on their handling of repeated observations at the same location, also called replication.  The chapter concludes with the corresponding adaptations of the sequential design procedures. These are illustrated in an example from epidemiology.</description>

      <title>A smoothing Anderson acceleration algorithm for nonsmooth fixed point problem with linear convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Anderson acceleration method for solving the contractive fixed point problem, which is nonsmooth in general. We define a class of smoothing functions for the original nonsmooth fixed point mapping, which can be easily formulated for many cases (see section3). Then, taking advantage of the Anderson acceleration method, we proposed a Smoothing Anderson(m) algorithm, in which we utilized a smoothing function of the original nonsmooth fixed point mapping and update the smoothing parameter adaptively. In theory, we first demonstrate the r-linear convergence of the proposed Smoothing Anderson(m) algorithm for solving the considered nonsmooth contractive fixed point problem with r-factor no larger than c, where c is the contractive factor of the fixed point mapping. Second, we establish that both of the Smoothing Anderson(1) and the Smoothing EDIIS(1) algorithms are q-linear convergent with q-factor no larger than c. Finally, we present three numerical examples with practical applications from elastic net regression, free boundary problems for infinite journal bearings and non-negative least squares problem to illustrate the better performance of the proposed Smoothing Anderson(m) algorithm comparing with some popular methods.</description>

      <title>Fast Online $L_0$ Elastic Net Subspace Clustering via A Novel Dictionary Update Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of data volume and the increasing demand for real-time analysis, online subspace clustering has emerged as an effective tool for processing dynamic data streams. However, existing online subspace clustering methods often struggle to capture the complex and evolving distribution of such data due to their reliance on rigid dictionary learning mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel $\ell_0$ elastic net subspace clustering model by integrating the $\ell_0$ norm and the Frobenius norm, which owns the desirable block diagonal property. To address the challenges posed by the evolving data distributions in online data, we design a fast online alternating direction method of multipliers with an innovative dictionary update strategy based on support points, which are a set of data points to capture the underlying distribution of the data. By selectively updating dictionary atoms according to the support points, the proposed method can dynamically adapt to the evolving data characteristics, thereby enhancing both adaptability and computational efficiency. Moreover, we rigorously prove the convergence of the algorithm. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering performance and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time and large-scale data processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Noisy phase retrieval from subgaussian measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to address the phase retrieval problem from subgaussian measurements with arbitrary noise, with a focus on devising robust and efficient algorithms for solving non-convex problems. To ensure uniqueness of solutions in the subgaussian setting, we explore two commonly used assumptions: either the subgaussian measurements satisfy a fourth-moment condition or the target signals exhibit non-peakiness. For each scenario, we introduce a novel spectral initialization method that yields robust initial estimates. Building on this, we employ leave-one-out arguments to show that the classical Wirtinger flow algorithm achieves a linear rate of convergence for both real-valued and complex-valued cases, provided the sampling complexity $m\ge O(n \log^3 m)$, where $n$ is the dimension of the underlying signals. In contrast to existing work, our algorithms are regularization-free, requiring no truncation, trimming, or additional penalty terms, and they permit the algorithm step sizes as large as $O(1)$, compared to the $O(1/n)$ in previous literature. Furthermore, our results accommodate arbitrary noise vectors that meet certain statistical conditions, covering a wide range of noise scenarios, with sub-exponential noise as a notable special case. The effectiveness of our algorithms is validated through various numerical experiments. We emphasize that our findings provide the first theoretical guarantees for recovering non-peaky signals using non-convex methods from Bernoulli measurements, which is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the relations between the Kalman Theorem and the Chow-Rashevskji Theorem or, more precisely, the general theory of flows tangent to non-integrable distributions. The main results consist of two proofs of the Kalman Theorem, which are alternative to the most common ones and which enlighten the above relations and stimulate generalisations in various directions.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Performance Evaluation of Quantum, Classical and Hybrid Solvers for the Max-Cut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of quantum, classical, and hybrid solvers on the NP-hard Max-Cut and QUBO problems, examining their solution quality relative to the global optima and their computational efficiency. We benchmark the new fast annealing D-Wave quantum processing unit (QPU) and D-Wave Hybrid solver against the state-of-the-art classical simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and Toshiba's simulated bifurcation machine (SBM). Our study leverages three datasets encompassing 139 instances of the Max-Cut problem with sizes ranging from 100 to 10,000 nodes. For instances below 251 nodes, global optima are known and reported, while for larger instances, we utilize the best-known solutions from the literature. Our findings reveal that for the smaller instances where the global optimum is known, the Hybrid solver and SA algorithm consistently achieve the global optimum, outperforming the QPU. For larger instances where global optima are unknown, we observe that the SBM and the slower variant of SA deliver competitive solution quality, while the Hybrid solver and the faster variant of SA performed noticeably worse. Although computing time varies due to differing underlying hardware, the Hybrid solver and the SBM demonstrate both efficient computation times, while for SA reduction in computation time can be achieved at the expense of solution quality.</description>

      <title>Improving the Robustness of the Projected Gradient Descent Method for Nonlinear Constrained Optimization Problems in Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm is a widely used and efficient first-order method for solving constrained optimization problems due to its simplicity and scalability in large design spaces. Building on recent advancements in the PGD algorithm where an inertial step component has been introduced to improve efficiency in solving constrained optimization problems this study introduces two key enhancements to further improve the algorithm's performance and adaptability in large-scale design spaces. First, univariate constraints (such as design variable bounds constraints) are directly incorporated into the projection step via the Schur complement and an improved active set algorithm with bulk constraints manipulation, avoiding issues with min-max clipping. Second, the update step is decomposed relative to the constraint vector space, enabling a post-projection adjustment based on the state of the constraints and an approximation of the Lagrangian, significantly improving the algorithm's robustness for problems with nonlinear constraints. Applied to a topology optimization problem for heat sink design, the proposed PGD algorithm demonstrates performance comparable to or exceeding that of the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA), with minimal parameter tuning. These results position the enhanced PGD as a robust tool for complex optimization problems with large variable space, such as topology optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Branching Rules with Optimal Complexity for the Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The branching algorithm is a fundamental technique for designing fast exponential-time algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems exactly. It divides the entire solution space into independent search branches using predetermined branching rules, and ignores the search on suboptimal branches to reduce the time complexity. The complexity of a branching algorithm is primarily determined by the branching rules it employs, which are often designed by human experts. In this paper, we show how to automate this process with a focus on the maximum independent set problem. The main contribution is an algorithm that efficiently generate optimal branching rules for a given sub-graph with tens of vertices. Its efficiency enables us to generate the branching rules on-the-fly, which is provably optimal and significantly reduces the number of branches compared to existing methods that rely on expert-designed branching rules. Numerical experiment on 3-regular graphs shows an average complexity of O(1.0441^n) can be achieved, better than any previous methods.</description>

      <title>A Massively Parallel Interior-Point-Method for Arrowhead Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practice, non-specialized interior point algorithms often cannot utilize the massively parallel compute resources offered by modern many- and multi-core compute platforms. However, efficient distributed solution techniques are required, especially for large-scale linear programs. This article describes a new decomposition technique for systems of linear equations implemented in the parallel interior-point solver PIPS-IPM++. The algorithm exploits a matrix structure commonly found in optimization problems: a doubly-bordered block-diagonal or arrowhead structure. This structure is preserved in the linear KKT systems solved during each iteration of the interior-point method. We present a hierarchical Schur complement decomposition that distributes and solves the linear optimization problem; it is designed for high-performance architectures and scales well with the availability of additional computing resources. The decomposition approach uses the border constraints' locality to decouple the factorization process. Our approach is motivated by large-scale unit commitment problems. We demonstrate the performance of our method on a set of mid-to large-scale instances, some of which have more than 10^9 nonzeros in their constraint matrix.</description>

      <title>Autonomy in the Real-World: Autonomous Trajectory Planning for Asteroid Reconnaissance via Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of an optimization-based autonomous trajectory planning algorithm for the asteroid reconnaissance phase of a deep-space exploration mission. The reconnaissance phase is a low-altitude flyby to collect detailed information around a potential landing site. Although such autonomous deep-space exploration missions have garnered considerable interest recently, state-of-the-practice in trajectory design involves a time-intensive ground-based open-loop process that forward propagates multiple trajectories with a range of initial conditions and parameters to account for uncertainties in spacecraft knowledge and actuation. In this work, we introduce a stochastic trajectory optimization-based approach to generate trajectories that satisfy both the mission and spacecraft safety constraints during the reconnaissance phase of the Deep-space Autonomous Robotic Explorer (DARE) mission concept, which seeks to travel to and explore a near-Earth object autonomously, with minimal ground intervention. We first use the Multi-Spacecraft Concept and Autonomy Tool (MuSCAT) simulation framework to rigorously validate the underlying modeling assumptions for our trajectory planner and then propose a method to transform this stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic one tailored for use with an off-the-shelf nonlinear solver. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithmic approach through extensive numerical experiments and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-practice benchmark used for representative missions.</description>

      <title>The Oracle Complexity of Simplex-based Matrix Games: Linear Separability and Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of solving matrix games of the form $\max_{\mathbf{w}\in\mathcal{W}}\min_{\mathbf{p}\in\Delta}\mathbf{p}^{\top}A\mathbf{w}$, where $A$ is some matrix and $\Delta$ is the probability simplex. This problem encapsulates canonical tasks such as finding a linear separator and computing Nash equilibria in zero-sum games. However, perhaps surprisingly, its inherent complexity (as formalized in the standard framework of oracle complexity [Nemirovski and Yudin, 1983]) is not well-understood. In this work, we first identify different oracle models which are implicitly used by prior algorithms, amounting to multiplying the matrix $A$ by a vector from either one or both sides. We then prove complexity lower bounds for algorithms under both access models, which in particular imply a separation between them. Specifically, we start by proving that algorithms for linear separability based on one-sided multiplications must require $\Omega(\gamma_A^{-2})$ iterations, where $\gamma_A$ is the margin, as matched by the Perceptron algorithm. We then prove that accelerated algorithms for this task, which utilize multiplications from both sides, must require $\tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{A}^{-2/3})$ iterations, establishing the first oracle complexity barrier for such algorithms. Finally, by adapting our lower bound to $\ell_1$ geometry, we prove that computing an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^{-2/5})$ iterations, which is an exponential improvement over the previously best-known lower bound due to Hadiji et al. [2024].</description>

      <title>Lyapunov stability of compact sets in locally compact metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic exposition of Lyapunov stability for compact sets in locally compact metric spaces. We explore foundational concepts, including neighborhoods of compact sets, invariant sets, and the properties of dynamical systems, and establish key results on the relationships between attraction, invariance, and stability. The work explores Lyapunov stability within the context of dynamical systems, highlighting equivalent formulations and related criteria. Central to the exposition is a proof of the fundamental theorem linking Lyapunov functions to the asymptotic stability of compact sets. This expository piece consolidates results from several classical texts to provide a unified and accessible framework for understanding stability in metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Domain Walls for Notched Ferromagnetic Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a simple model of notched ferromagnetic nanowires using tools from calculus of variations and critical point theory. Specifically, we focus on the case of a single unimodal notch and establish the existence and uniqueness of the critical point of the energy. This is achieved through a lifting argument, which reduces the problem to a generalized Sturm-Liouville equation. Uniqueness is demonstrated via a Mountain-Pass argument, where the assumption of two distinct critical points leads to a contradiction. Additionally, we show that the solution corresponds to a system of magnetic spins characterized by a single domain wall localized in the vicinity of the notch. We further analyze the asymptotic decay of the solution at infinity and explore the symmetric case using rearrangement techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimizing quasi-dissipative evolution equations with the moment-SOS hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is no relaxation gap between a quasi-dissipative nonlinear evolution equation in a Hilbert space and its linear Liouville equation reformulation on probability measures. In other words, strong and generalized solutions of such equations are unique in the class of measure-valued solutions. As a major consequence, non-convex numerical optimization over these non-linear partial differential equations can be carried out with the infinite-dimensional moment-SOS hierarchy with global convergence guarantees. This covers in particular all reaction-diffusion equations with polynomial nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Boltzmann densities with physics informed low-rank formats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our method proposes the efficient generation of samples from an unnormalized Boltzmann density by solving the underlying continuity equation in the low-rank tensor train (TT) format. It is based on the annealing path commonly used in MCMC literature, which is given by the linear interpolation in the space of energies. Inspired by Sequential Monte Carlo, we alternate between deterministic time steps from the TT representation of the flow field and stochastic steps, which include Langevin and resampling steps. These adjust the relative weights of the different modes of the target distribution and anneal to the correct path distribution. We showcase the efficiency of our method on multiple numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can one lift a functional defined on maps from a space X to a space Y into a functional defined on maps from X into P(Y) the space of probability distributions over Y? Looking at measure-valued maps can be interpreted as knowing a classical map with uncertainty, and from an optimization point of view the main gain is the convexification of Y into P(Y). We will explain why trying to single out the largest convex lifting amounts to solve an optimal transport problem with an infinity of marginals which can be interesting by itself. Moreover we will show that, to recover previously proposed liftings for functionals depending on the Jacobian of the map, one needs to add a restriction of additivity to the lifted functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of projecting a convex set onto a subspace, or equivalently formulated, the problem of computing a set obtained by applying a linear mapping to a convex feasible set. This includes the problem of approximating convex sets by polyhedrons. The existing literature on convex projections provides methods for bounded convex sets only, in this paper we propose a method that can handle both bounded and unbounded problems. The algorithms we propose build on the ideas of inner and outer approximation. In particular, we adapt the recently proposed methods for solving unbounded convex vector optimization problems to handle also the class of projection problems.</description>

      <title>Risk Quadrangle and Robust Optimization Based on Extended $\varphi$-Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fundamental Risk Quadrangle (FRQ) is a unified framework linking risk management, statistical estimation, and optimization. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) based on $\varphi$-divergence minimizes the maximal expected loss, where the maximum is over a $\varphi$-divergence ambiguity set. This paper introduces the \emph{extended} $\varphi$-divergence and the extended $\varphi$-divergence quadrangle, which integrates DRO into the FRQ framework. We derive the primal and dual representations of the quadrangle elements (risk, deviation, regret, error, and statistic). The dual representation provides an interpretation of classification, portfolio optimization, and regression as robust optimization based on the extended $\varphi$-divergence. The primal representation offers tractable formulations of these robust optimizations as convex optimization. We provide illustrative examples showing that many common problems, such as least-squares regression, quantile regression, support vector machines, and CVaR optimization, fall within this framework. Additionally, we conduct a case study to visualize the optimal solution of the inner maximization in robust optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Reachability of 3-Dimensional Paths with a Prescribed Curvature Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept of an equivalence relation between the set of optimal control problems. By leveraging this concept, we show that the boundary of the reachability set can be constructed by the solutions of time optimal problems. Alongside, a more generalized equivalence theorem is presented together. The findings facilitate the use of solution structures from a certain class of optimal control problems to address problems in corresponding equivalent classes. As a byproduct, we state and prove the construction methods of the reachability sets of three-dimensional curves with prescribed curvature bound. The findings are twofold: Firstly, we prove that any boundary point of the reachability set, with the terminal direction taken into account, can be accessed via curves of H, CSC, CCC, or their respective subsegments, where H denotes a helicoidal arc, C a circular arc with maximum curvature, and S a straight segment. Secondly, we show that any boundary point of the reachability set, without considering the terminal direction, can be accessed by curves of CC, CS, or their respective subsegments. These findings extend the developments presented in literature regarding planar curves, or Dubins car dynamics, into spatial curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For higher dimensions, we confirm that the problem of identifying the reachability set of curvature bounded paths subsumes the well-known Markov-Dubins problem. These advancements in understanding the reachability of curvature bounded paths in $\mathbb{R}^3$ hold significant practical implications, particularly in the contexts of mission planning problems and time optimal guidance.</description>

      <title>On existence of solutions to non-convex minimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new sufficient conditions for the finiteness of the optimal value and existence of solutions to a general problem of minimizing a proper closed function over a nonempty closed set. The conditions require an asymptotically bounded decay of a function, a relaxation of p-supercoercivity, and a certain relation for the asymptotic cone of the constraint set and the asymptotic function of the objective function. Our analysis combines these conditions with a regularization technique. We refine the notion of retractive directions of a set, extend its definition to functions, and establish some basic relations for such directions for both sets and functions. Using these tools, we provide existence of solutions results that generalize many of the results in the literature for both non-convex and convex problems.</description>

      <title>Two-Timescale Optimization Framework for Sparse-Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11168v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $\mathcal{H}_2$-guaranteed sparse-feedback linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control with convex parameterization and convex-bounded uncertainty is studied in this paper, where $\ell_0$-penalty is added into the $\mathcal{H}_2$ cost to penalize the number of communication links among distributed controllers. Then, the sparse-feedback gain is investigated to minimize the modified $\mathcal{H}_2$ cost together with the stability guarantee, and the corresponding main results are of three parts. First, the $\ell_1$ relaxation sparse-feedback LQ problem is of concern, and a two-timescale algorithm is developed based on proximal coordinate descent and primal-dual splitting approach. Second, piecewise quadratic relaxation sparse-feedback LQ control is investigated, which exhibits an accelerated convergence rate. Third, sparse-feedback LQ problem with $\ell_0$-penalty is directly studied through BSUM (Block Successive Upper-bound Minimization) framework, and precise approximation method and variational properties are introduced.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose simple yet effective empirical improvements to the algorithms of the LIPO family, introduced in [Malherbe2017], that we call LIPO+ and AdaLIPO+. We compare our methods to the vanilla versions of the algorithms over standard benchmark functions and show that they converge significantly faster. Finally, we show that the LIPO family is very prone to the curse of dimensionality and tends quickly to Pure Random Search when the dimension increases. We give a proof for this, which is also formalized in Lean mathematical language. Source codes and a demo are provided online.</description>

      <title>Learning to Select Cutting Planes in Mixed Integer Linear Programming Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cutting planes (cuts) are crucial for solving Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. Advanced MILP solvers typically rely on manually designed heuristic algorithms for cut selection, which require much expert experience and cannot be generalized for different scales of MILP problems. Therefore, learning-based methods for cut selection are considered a promising direction. State-of-the-art learning-based methods formulate cut selection as a sequence-to-sequence problem, easily handled by sequence models. However, the existing sequence models need help with the following issues: (1) the model only captures cut information while neglecting the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation; (2) the sequence model utilizes positional information of the input sequence, which may influence cut selection. To address these challenges, we design a novel learning model HGTSM for better select cuts. We encode MILP problem state as a heterogeneous tripartite graph, utilizing heterogeneous graph networks to fully capture the underlying structure of MILP problems. Simultaneously, we propose a novel sequence model whose architecture is tailored to handle inputs in different orders. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms heuristic methods and learning-based baselines on multiple challenging MILP datasets. Additionally, the model exhibits stability and the ability to generalize to different types of problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We frame dynamic persuasion in a partial observation stochastic control Leader-Follower game with an ergodic criterion. The Receiver controls the dynamics of a multidimensional unobserved state process. Information is provided to the Receiver through a device designed by the Sender that generates the observation process. The commitment of the Sender is enforced. We develop this approach in the case where all dynamics are linear and the preferences of the Receiver are linear-quadratic. We prove a verification theorem for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the HJB equation satisfied by the Receiver's value function. An extension to the case of persuasion of a mean field of interacting Receivers is also provided. We illustrate this approach in two applications: the provision of information to electricity consumers with a smart meter designed by an electricity producer; the information provided by carbon footprint accounting rules to companies engaged in a best-in-class emissions reduction effort. In the first application, we link the benefits of information provision to the mispricing of electricity production. In the latter, we show that information provision is a substitute for best-in-class objective.</description>

      <title>Neo-FREE: Policy Composition Through Thousand Brains And Free Energy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally composing a set of primitives to tackle control tasks. To address this problem, we introduce Neo-FREE: a control architecture inspired by the Thousand Brains Theory and Free Energy Principle from cognitive sciences. In accordance with the neocortical (Neo) processes postulated by the Thousand Brains Theory, Neo-FREE consists of functional units returning control primitives. These are linearly combined by a gating mechanism that minimizes the variational free energy (FREE). The problem of finding the optimal primitives' weights is then recast as a finite-horizon optimal control problem, which is convex even when the cost is not and the environment is nonlinear, stochastic, non-stationary. The results yield an algorithm for primitives composition and the effectiveness of Neo-FREE is illustrated via in-silico and hardware experiments on an application involving robot navigation in an environment with obstacles.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning via Linear-Programming with Error-Bound Induced Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find an optimal policy for Markov decision processes (MDPs) using a pre-collected dataset. In this work, we revisit the linear programming (LP) reformulation of Markov decision processes for offline RL, with the goal of developing algorithms with optimal $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ sample complexity, where $n$ is the sample size, under partial data coverage and general function approximation, and with favorable computational tractability. To this end, we derive new \emph{error bounds} for both the dual and primal-dual formulations of the LP, and incorporate them properly as \emph{constraints} in the LP reformulation. We then show that under a completeness-type assumption, $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ sample complexity can be achieved under standard single-policy coverage assumption, when one properly \emph{relaxes} the occupancy validity constraint in the LP. This framework can readily handle both infinite-horizon discounted and average-reward MDPs, in both general function approximation and tabular cases. The instantiation to the tabular case achieves either state-of-the-art or the first sample complexities of offline RL in these settings. To further remove any completeness-type assumption, we then introduce a proper \emph{lower-bound constraint} in the LP, and a variant of the standard single-policy coverage assumption. Such an algorithm leads to a $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ sample complexity with dependence on the \emph{value-function gap}, with only realizability assumptions. Our properly constrained LP framework advances the existing results in several aspects, in relaxing certain assumptions and achieving the optimal $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ sample complexity, with simple analyses. We hope our results bring new insights into the use of LP formulations and the equivalent primal-dual minimax optimization for offline RL, through the error-bound induced constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel non-parametric learning paradigm for the identification of drift and diffusion coefficients of multi-dimensional non-linear stochastic differential equations, which relies upon discrete-time observations of the state. The key idea essentially consists of fitting a RKHS-based approximation of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation to such observations, yielding theoretical estimates of non-asymptotic learning rates which, unlike previous works, become increasingly tighter when the regularity of the unknown drift and diffusion coefficients becomes higher. Our method being kernel-based, offline pre-processing may be profitably leveraged to enable efficient numerical implementation, offering excellent balance between precision and computational complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of space debris in LEO has become a major concern for the space industry. With the growing interest in space exploration, the prediction of potential collisions between objects in orbit has become a crucial issue. It is estimated that, in orbit, there are millions of fragments a few millimeters in size and thousands of inoperative satellites and discarded rocket stages. Given the high speeds that these fragments can reach, even fragments a few millimeters in size can cause fractures in a satellite's hull or put a serious crack in the window of a space shuttle. The conventional method proposed by Akella and Alfriend in 2000 remains widely used to estimate the probability of collision in short-term encounters. Given the small period of time, it is assumed that, during the encounter: (1) trajectories are represented by straight lines with constant velocity; (2) there is no velocity uncertainty and the position exhibits a stationary distribution throughout the encounter; and (3) position uncertainties are independent and represented by Gaussian distributions. This study introduces a novel derivation based on first principles that naturally allows for tight and fast upper and lower bounds for the probability of collision. We tested implementations of both probability and bound computations with the original and our formulation on a real CDM dataset used in ESA's Collision Avoidance Challenge. Our approach reduces the calculation of the probability to two one-dimensional integrals and has the potential to significantly reduce the processing time compared to the traditional method, from 80% to nearly real-time.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization in Engineering Design</title>

Abstract: Resided at the intersection of multi-fidelity optimization (MFO) and Bayesian optimization (BO), MF BO has found a niche in solving expensive engineering design optimization problems, thanks to its advantages in incorporating physical and mathematical understandings of the problems, saving resources, addressing exploitation-exploration trade-off, considering uncertainty, and processing parallel computing. The increasing number of works dedicated to MF BO suggests the need for a comprehensive review of this advanced optimization technique. In this paper, we survey recent developments of two essential ingredients of MF BO: Gaussian process (GP) based MF surrogates and acquisition functions. We first categorize the existing MF modeling methods and MFO strategies to locate MF BO in a large family of surrogate-based optimization and MFO algorithms. We then exploit the common properties shared between the methods from each ingredient of MF BO to describe important GP-based MF surrogate models and review various acquisition functions. By doing so, we expect to provide a structured understanding of MF BO. Finally, we attempt to reveal important aspects that require further research for applications of MF BO in solving intricate yet important design optimization problems, including constrained optimization, high-dimensional optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and multi-objective optimization.</description>

      <title>Collective rhythm design in coupled mixed-feedback systems through dominance and bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of mixed-feedback systems provides an effective framework for the design of robust and tunable oscillations in nonlinear systems characterized by interleaved fast positive and slow negative feedback loops. The goal of this paper is to extend the mixed-feedback oscillation design framework to networks. To this aim, we introduce a network model of coupled mixed-feedback systems, ask under which conditions it exhibits a collective oscillatory rhythm, and if, and how, this rhythm can be shaped by network design. In the proposed network model, node dynamics are nonlinear and defined by a tractable realization of the mixed-feedback structure. Coupling between nodes is also nonlinear and defined by a tractable abstraction of synaptic coupling between neurons. We derive constructive conditions under which the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix fully and explicitly determine both the emergence of a stable network rhythm and its detailed rhythmic profile, i.e., the pattern of relative oscillation amplitudes and phase differences. Our theoretical developments are grounded on ideas from dominant systems and bifurcation theory. They provide a new framework for the analysis and design of nonlinear network rhythms.</description>

      <title>Parallel Batch Scheduling With Incompatible Job Families Via Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the incompatible case of parallel batch scheduling, where compatible jobs belong to the same family, and jobs from different families cannot be processed together in the same batch. Existing constraint programming (CP) models for this problem fail to synchronize the processing of the jobs within their batch, resulting in batch interruptions. In the context of the diffusion area in the semiconductor manufacturing process, these interrupted solutions would disrupt the thermal stability required for a uniform dopant distribution on the wafers. This paper proposes three new CP models that directly tackle these interruptions in the formulation, including two adaptions of existing models and a novel Redundant Synchronized (RS) model. These existing and novel models are compared on standard test cases, demonstrating the superiority of the RS model in finding optimal or near-optimal solutions quickly.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Posterior Samples for Bayesian Optimization via Rootfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization devolves the global optimization of a costly objective function to the global optimization of a sequence of acquisition functions. This inner-loop optimization can be catastrophically difficult if it involves posterior sample paths, especially in higher dimensions. We introduce an efficient global optimization strategy for posterior samples based on global rootfinding. It provides gradient-based optimizers with two sets of judiciously selected starting points, designed to combine exploration and exploitation. The number of starting points can be kept small without sacrificing optimization quality. Remarkably, even with just one point from each set, the global optimum is discovered most of the time. The algorithm scales practically linearly to high dimensions, breaking the curse of dimensionality. For Gaussian process Thompson sampling (GP-TS), we demonstrate remarkable improvement in both inner- and outer-loop optimization, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like EI and GP-UCB in most cases. Our approach also improves the performance of other posterior sample-based acquisition functions, such as variants of entropy search. Furthermore, we propose a sample-average formulation of GP-TS, which has a parameter to explicitly control exploitation and can be computed at the cost of one posterior sample. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/UQUH/TSRoots .</description>

      <title>Robust Markov Decision Processes: A Place Where AI and Formal Methods Meet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a standard model for sequential decision-making problems and are widely used across many scientific areas, including formal methods and artificial intelligence (AI). MDPs do, however, come with the restrictive assumption that the transition probabilities need to be precisely known. Robust MDPs (RMDPs) overcome this assumption by instead defining the transition probabilities to belong to some uncertainty set. We present a gentle survey on RMDPs, providing a tutorial covering their fundamentals. In particular, we discuss RMDP semantics and how to solve them by extending standard MDP methods such as value iteration and policy iteration. We also discuss how RMDPs relate to other models and how they are used in several contexts, including reinforcement learning and abstraction techniques. We conclude with some challenges for future work on RMDPs.</description>
