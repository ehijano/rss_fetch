      <title>Waves drive the rise and fall of 2D flows in rotating turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence follows a few well-known organizational principles, rooted in conservation laws. One such principle states that a system conserving two sign-definite invariants self-organizes into large-scale structures. Ordinary three-dimensional turbulence does not fall within this paradigm. However, when subject to rotation, 3D turbulence is profoundly altered: rotation produces 3D inertial waves, while also sustaining emergent two-dimensional structures and favoring domain-scale flows called condensates. This interplay raises a fundamental question: why and when are 2D flows sustained even when only 3D waves are excited? Using extensive numerical simulations of the rotating 3D Navier-Stokes equations together with a quasi-linear wave-kinetic theory, we show that near-resonant interactions between 3D waves and a large-scale 2D flow impose an additional conservation law: inertial waves must conserve their helicity separately for each helicity sign. This emergent sign-definite invariant constrains the waves to transfer their energy to large-scale 2D motions. However, as rotation increases, resonance conditions become more restrictive and the energy transfer from 3D to 2D progressively vanishes, leading to a transition from condensate-dominated turbulence to pure inertial-wave turbulence for the 3D modes. We derive analytical expressions for this 3D-2D energy transfer as a function of rotation, Reynolds number and domain geometry, and verify them numerically. Together, these results establish a mechanism underlying two-dimensionalization in rotating turbulence, and, more broadly, illustrate how wave-mean flow interactions can drive large-scale self-organization.</description>

      <title>EarthquakeNPP: A Benchmark for Earthquake Forecasting with Neural Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, classical point process models, such as the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, have been widely used for forecasting the event times and locations of earthquakes. Recent advances have led to Neural Point Processes (NPPs), which promise greater flexibility and improvements over such classical models. However, the currently-used benchmark for NPPs does not represent an up-to-date challenge in the seismological community, since it contains data leakage and omits the largest earthquake sequence from the region. Additionally, initial earthquake forecasting benchmarks fail to compare NPPs with state-of-the-art forecasting models commonly used in seismology. To address these gaps, we introduce EarthquakeNPP: a collection of benchmark datasets to facilitate testing of NPPs on earthquake data, accompanied by an implementation of the state-of-the-art forecasting model: ETAS. The datasets cover a range of small to large target regions within California, dating from 1971 to 2021, and include different methodologies for dataset generation. Benchmarking experiments, using both log-likelihood and generative evaluation metrics widely recognised in seismology, show that none of the five NPPs tested outperform ETAS. These findings suggest that current NPP implementations are not yet suitable for practical earthquake forecasting. Nonetheless, EarthquakeNPP provides a platform to foster future collaboration between the seismology and machine learning communities.</description>

      <title>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for scaling: An application for deducing hydrologic connectivity at watershed scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been applied to interpret deep learning model results. However, applications that integrate XAI with established hydrologic knowledge for process understanding remain limited. Here we show that XAI method, applied at point-scale, could be used for cross-scale aggregation of hydrologic responses, a fundamental question in scaling problems, using hydrologic connectivity as a demonstration. Soil moisture and its movement generated by physically based hydrologic model were used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, whose impacts of inputs were evaluated by XAI methods. Our results suggest that XAI-based classification can effectively identify the differences in the functional roles of various sub-regions at watershed scale. The aggregated XAI results could be considered as an explicit and quantitative indicator of hydrologic connectivity development, offering insights to hydrological organization. This framework could be used to facilitate aggregation of other geophysical responses to advance process understandings.</description>

      <title>The Gradient of Mean Molecular Weight Across the Radius Valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-evaporation shapes the observed radii of small exoplanets and constrains the underlying distributions of atmospheric and core masses. However, the diversity of atmospheric chemistries corresponding to these distributions remains unelucidated. We develop a first-principles carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-sulfur-silicon (CHOSSi) outgassing model that accounts for non-ideal gas behavior (via fugacities) at high pressures, as well as the tendency for water and hydrogen to dissolve in melt (via solubility laws). We use data-driven radius valley constraints to establish the relationship between the atmospheric surface pressures and melt temperatures of sub-Neptunes. Sub-Neptunes with less massive rocky cores retain less of their primordial hydrogen envelopes, which leads to less heat retention and diminished melt temperatures at the surfaces of these cores. Lower melt temperatures lead thermodynamically to the dominance of carbon-, oxygen-, sulfur- and silicon-bearing molecules over molecular hydrogen, which naturally produce a diversity of mean molecular weights. Our geochemical outgassing calculations robustly predict a gradient of mean molecular weight across the radius valley, where the strength of this gradient is primarily driven by the oxygen fugacity of the molten cores and not by the carbon enrichment (or "metallicity") of the atmosphere. Smaller sub-Neptunes are predicted to have less hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The precise relationship between the observed and outgassed chemistries requires an understanding of how convection near the core interacts with large-scale atmospheric circulation (driven by stellar heating) near the photosphere, as well as the influence of photochemistry.</description>

      <title>The Transparent Earth: A Multimodal Foundation Model for the Earth's Subsurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on Earth.</description>
