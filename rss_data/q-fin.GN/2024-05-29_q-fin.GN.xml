      <title>Empirical Evidence for the New Definitions in Financial Markets and Equity Premium Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents empirical evidence to support the validity of new definitions in financial markets. The author develops a new method to determine investors' risk attitudes in financial markets. The risk attitudes of investors in US financial markets from 1889-1978 are analyzed and the results indicate that equity investors who invested in the composite S&amp;P 500 index were risk-averse in 1977. Conversely, risk-free asset investors who invested in US Treasury bills were found to exhibit not enough risk-loving behavior, which can be considered a type of risk-averse behavior. These findings suggest that the new definitions in financial markets accurately reflect the behavior of investors and should be considered in investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Proofs for the New Definitions in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructing theorems can help to determine the shape of certain utility curves that make up the new definitions in financial markets. The aim of this study was to present proofs for these theorems. Basic thoughts of new alternative definitions emerge from the decision-making under uncertainty in economics and finance. Shape of the certain utility curve is central to standard definitions in determining risk attitudes of investors. Shape alone determines risk behavior of investors in standard theory. Although the terms risk-averse, risk-loving, and risk-neutral are equivalent to strict concavity, strict convexity, and linearity, respectively, in standard theory, strict concavity or strict convexity, or linearity are valid for certain new definitions, not being the same as standard theory. Hence, it can be stated that new alternative definitions are broader than standard definitions from the viewpoint of shape. For instance, the certain utility curve of a risk-averse investor can be strictly concave or strictly convex, or linear in alternative definitions.</description>
