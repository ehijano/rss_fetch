      <title>Minimum volumes of tropical rational functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a tropical rational function \varphi on R^n is given, we can represent it as \varphi=f-g with tropical polynomials f and g. We develop the duality theorem for tropical rational functions to define the volume of the pair (f, g). We show that when n=1, we can find a representation of \varphi(x) \neq -\infty as f(x)-g(x) with the pair (f, g) of minimum volume. The dual subdivision of f(x) \oplus (yg(x)) is unique up to translation, but when n=2 this is not true.</description>

      <title>Moment varieties of the inverse Gaussian and gamma distributions are nondefective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the parameters of a $k$-mixture of inverse Gaussian or gamma distributions are algebraically identifiable from the first $3k-1$ moments, and rationally identifiable from the first $3k+2$ moments. Our proofs are based on Terracini's classification of defective surfaces, careful analysis of the intersection theory of moment varieties, and a recent result on sufficient conditions for rational identifiability of secant varieties by Massarenti--Mella.</description>

      <title>Two remarks on asymptotically log Fano pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotically log Fano pairs were introduced by Cheltsov and Rubinstein, generalising a definition of Maeda. They have received attention in the last decade within the theory of K-stability, as they approximate log Calabi Yau pairs while staying in the log Fano setting. In this note, written for the ZAG Proceedings, we summarise our talk on 1st September 2020 (Day of Knowledge) given on Zoom during the 24-hour ZAG Marathon. In the talk, we reported on joint work with P. Cascini and Y. Rubinstein, on the classification of the two-dimensional case, known as asymptotically log del Pezzo pairs.</description>

Abstract: We characterize directs sums of twists of symmetric powers of the universal quotient bundle over the Grassmannian of lines. We use a method that could be used for analogue results on any arbitrary variety, and that should give stronger results than using the standard technique of Beilinson's spectral sequence.</description>

      <title>Equivariant K-theory, affine Grassmannian and perfection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study torus-equivariant algebraic $K$-theory of affine Schubert varieties in the perfect affine Grassmannians over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We further compare it to the torus-equivariant Hochschild homology of perfect complexes, which has a geometric description in terms of global functions on certain fixed-point schemes. We prove that $\mathbb{F}_p$-linearly, this comparison is an isomorphism. Our approach is quite constructive, resulting in new computations of these $K$-theory rings. We establish various structural results for equivariant perfect algebraic $K$-theory on the way; we believe these are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Elliptic-elliptic surfaces and the Hesse pencil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of elliptic surfaces with $p_g=q=1$ that arise from base change of the Hesse pencil. We identify explicitly a component of the higher Noether-Lefschetz locus with positive Mordell-Weil rank, and a particular surface having maximal Picard number and defined over $\mathbb Q$. These examples satisfy the infinitesimal Torelli theorem, providing a second proof of the dominance of period map, which was first obtained by Engel-Greer-Ward. A third proof is provided using the Shioda modular surface associated with $\Gamma_0(11)$. Finally, we find birational models for the degenerations at the boundary of the one-dimensional Noether-Lefschetz locus, and extend the period map at those limit points.</description>

      <title>Lower Order Biases in Moment Expansions of One Parameter Families of Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a fixed elliptic curve $E$ without complex multiplication, $a_p := p+1 - \#E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is $O(\sqrt{p})$ and $a_p/2\sqrt{p}$ converges to a semicircular distribution. Michel proved that for a one-parameter family of elliptic curves $y^2 = x^3 + A(T)x + B(T)$ with $A(T), B(T) \in \mathbb{Z}[T]$ and non-constant $j$-invariant, the second moment of $a_p(t)$ is $p^2 + O(p^{{3}/{2}})$. The size and sign of the lower order terms has applications to the distribution of zeros near the central point of Hasse-Weil $L$-functions and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. S. J. Miller conjectured that the highest order term of the lower order terms of the second moment that does not average to zero is on average negative. Previous work on the conjecture has been restricted to a small set of highly nongeneric families. We create a database and a framework to quickly and systematically investigate biases in the second moment of any one-parameter family. When looking at families which have so far been beyond current theory, we find several potential violations of the conjecture for $p \leq 250,000$ and discuss new conjectures motivated by the data.</description>

      <title>Deformation quantization generates all multiple zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Banks--Panzer--Pym have shown that the volume integrals appearing in Kontsevich's deformation quantization formula always evaluate to integer-linear combinations of multiple zeta values (MZVs). We prove a sort of converse, which they conjectured in their work, namely that with the logarithmic propagator: (1) the coefficients associated to the graphs appearing at order $\hbar^n$ in the quantization formula generate the Q-vector space of weight-$n$ MZVs, and (2) the set of all coefficients generates the Z-module of MZVs. In order to prove this result, we develop a new technique for integrating Kontsevich graphs using polylogarithms and apply it to an infinite subset of Kontsevich graphs. Then, using the binary string representation of MZVs and the Lyndon word decomposition of binary strings, we show that this subset of graphs generates all MZVs.</description>

      <title>X-arability of mixed quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of determining when entanglement is present in a quantum system is one of the most active areas of research in quantum physics. Depending on the setting at hand, different notions of entanglement (or lack thereof) become relevant. Examples include separability (of bosons, fermions, and distinguishable particles), Schmidt number, biseparability, entanglement depth, and bond dimension. In this work, we propose and study a unified notion of separability, which we call X-arability, that captures a wide range of applications including these. For a subset (more specifically, an algebraic variety) of pure states X, we say that a mixed quantum state is X-arable if it lies in the convex hull of X. We develop unified tools and provable guarantees for X-arability, which already give new results for the standard separability problem. Our results include:
  -- An X-tension hierarchy of semidefinite programs for X-arability (generalizing the symmetric extensions hierarchy for separability), and a new de Finetti theorem for fermionic separability.
  -- A hierarchy of eigencomputations for optimizing a Hermitian operator over X, with applications to X-tanglement witnesses and polynomial optimization.
  -- A hierarchy of linear systems for the X-tangled subspace problem, with improved polynomial time guarantees even for the standard entangled subspace problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.05529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of a d-critical locus is an ingredient in the definition of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants by [BJM19]. In this paper we show that there is a d-critical locus structure on the Hilbert scheme of dimension zero subschemes on some local toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We also show that using this d-critical locus structure and a choice of orientation data, the resulting motivic invariants agree with the definition given by the previous work of [BBS13].</description>

      <title>Revisiting Dwork cohomology: Visibility and divisibility of Frobenius eigenvalues in rigid cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Frobenius eigenvalues of the compactly supported rigid cohomology of a variety defined over a finite field of $q$ elements via Dwork's method. A couple of arithmetic consequences will be drawn from this study. As the first application, we show that the zeta functions for finitely many related affine varieties are capable of witnessing all Frobenius eigenvalues of the rigid cohomology of the variety up to Tate twist. This result does not seem to be known for $\ell$-adic cohomology. As the second application, we prove several $q$-divisibility lower bounds for Frobenius eigenvalues of the rigid cohomology of the variety in terms of the multi-degrees of the defining equations. These divisibility bounds for rigid cohomology are generally better than what is suggested from the best known divisibility bounds in $\ell$-adic cohomology, both before and after the middle cohomological dimension.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we show that Bloch's higher cycle class map with finite coefficients for quasi-projective equi-dimensional schemes over a field fits naturally in a long exact sequence involving Schreieder's refined unramified cohomology. We also show that the refined unramified cohomology satisfies the localization sequence. Using this we conjecture in the end that refined unramified cohomology is a motivic homology theory and explain how this is related to the aforementioned results.</description>

      <title>Linear Chern-Hopf-Thurston conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $X$ is a closed $2n$-dimensional aspherical manifold, i.e., the universal cover of $X$ is contractible, then the Chern-Hopf-Thurston conjecture predicts that $(-1)^n\chi(X)\geq 0$. We prove this conjecture when $X$ is a complex projective manifold whose fundamental group admits an almost faithful linear representation over any field. In fact, we prove a much stronger statement that if $X$ is a complex projective manifold with large fundamental group and $\pi_1(X)$ admits an almost faithful linear representation, then $\chi(X, \mathcal{P})\geq 0$ for any perverse sheaf $\mathcal{P}$ on $X$.
  To prove this, we introduce a vanishing cycle functor of multivalued one-forms and apply techniques from non-abelian Hodge theory, both in archimedean and non-archimedean settings. These techniques allow us to deduce the desired positivity from the geometric properties of pure and mixed period maps.</description>

In the even-dimensional cases, we introduce a modified version of stringy $E$-functions and obtain interesting relations between the modified stringy $E$-functions on the two sides. We use them to make numerical predictions on the Lefschetz decompositions of the categorical crepant resolutions of Pfaffian varieties.</description>

      <title>The Laplace Transform and Quantum Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Laplace transform that maps the topological recursion (TR) wavefunction to its $x$-$y$ swap dual is defined. This transform is then applied to the construction of quantum curves. General results are obtained, including a formula for the quantisation of many spectral curves of the form $e^xP_2(e^y) - P_1(e^y) = 0$ where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are coprime polynomials; an important class that contains interesting spectral curves related to mirror symmetry and knot theory that have, heretofore, evaded the general TR-based methods previously used to derive quantum curves. Quantum curves known in the literature are reproduced, and new quantum curves are derived. In particular, the quantum curve for the $T$-equivariant Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathbb{P}(a,b)$ is obtained.</description>

Abstract: A powerful approach to computing Feynman integrals or cosmological correlators is to consider them as solution to systems of differential equations. Often these can be chosen to be Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) systems. However, their naive construction introduces a significant amount of unnecessary complexity. In this paper we present an algorithm which allows for reducing these GKZ systems to smaller subsystems if a parameter associated to the GKZ systems is resonant. These simpler subsystems can then be solved separately resulting in solutions for the full system. The algorithm makes it possible to check when reductions happen and allows for finding the associated simpler solutions. While originating in the mathematical theory of D-modules analyzed via exact sequences of Euler-Koszul homologies, the algorithm can be used without knowledge of this framework. We motivate the need for such reduction techniques by considering cosmological correlators on an FRW space-time and solve the tree-level single-exchange correlator in this way. It turns out that this integral exemplifies an interesting relation between locality and the reduction of the differential equations.</description>
