      <title>ChartEditor: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Robust Chart Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chart editing reduces manual effort in visualization design. Typical benchmarks limited in data diversity and assume access to complete chart code, which is seldom in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we present ChartEditVista, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 7,964 samples spanning 31 chart categories. It encompasses diverse editing instructions and covers nearly all editable chart elements. The inputs in ChartEditVista include only the original chart image and natural language editing instructions, without the original chart codes. ChartEditVista is generated through a fully automated pipeline that produces, edits, and verifies charts, ensuring high-quality chart editing data. Besides, we introduce two novel fine-grained, rule-based evaluation metrics: the layout metric, which evaluates the position, size and color of graphical components; and the text metric, which jointly assesses textual content and font styling. Building on top of ChartEditVista, we present ChartEditor, a model trained using a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a novel rendering reward to simultaneously enforce code executability and visual fidelity. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we demonstrate that ChartEditVista provides a robust evaluation, while ChartEditor consistently outperforms models with similar-scale and larger-scale on chart editing tasks.</description>

      <title>OTCR: Optimal Transmission, Compression and Representation for Multimodal Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Information Extraction (MIE) requires fusing text and visual cues from visually rich documents. While recent methods have advanced multimodal representation learning, most implicitly assume modality equivalence or treat modalities in a largely uniform manner, still relying on generic fusion paradigms. This often results in indiscriminate incorporation of multimodal signals and insufficient control over task-irrelevant redundancy, which may in turn limit generalization. We revisit MIE from a task-centric view: text should dominate, vision should selectively support. We present OTCR, a two-stage framework. First, Cross-modal Optimal Transport (OT) yields sparse, probabilistic alignments between text tokens and visual patches, with a context-aware gate controlling visual injection. Second, a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) compresses fused features, filtering task-irrelevant noise to produce compact, task-adaptive representations. On FUNSD, OTCR achieves 91.95% SER and 91.13% RE, while on XFUND (ZH), it reaches 91.09% SER and 94.20% RE, demonstrating competitive performance across datasets. Feature-level analyses further confirm reduced modality redundancy and strengthened task signals. This work offers an interpretable, information-theoretic paradigm for controllable multimodal fusion in document AI.</description>

      <title>Efficient Constraining of Transcoding in DNA-Based Image Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA has emerged as a promising alternative for long-term data storage due to its high capacity, durability, and low-energy potential. However, storing data in DNA presents several challenges. First, it requires complex and costly biochemical processes, making efficient compression crucial to reducing DNA synthesis time and cost. Second, these processes are prone to errors that must be avoided and/or corrected. In particular, homopolymers (repetitions of the same nucleotide) are a wellknown source of errors during the sequencing step. Avoiding such repetitions helps mitigate errors but introduces a constraint that may increase the data compression rate. In this paper, we propose two transcoding methods that address these two key challenges: reducing data rate and minimizing errors. The first method strictly enforces the error-minimization constraint by eliminating homopolymers of a certain length, at the cost of an increased data rate. In contrast, the second method accepts a slight increase in homopolymers. However, we show that these increases remain limited (2.14% increase in compression rate for the first method and 0.39% homopolymer rate for the second). These two approaches demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently constrain transcoding while balancing error minimization and compression performance.</description>

      <title>CPSL: Representing Volumetric Video via Content-Promoted Scene Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volumetric video enables immersive and interactive visual experiences by supporting free viewpoint exploration and realistic motion parallax. However, existing volumetric representations from explicit point clouds to implicit neural fields, remain costly in capture, computation, and rendering, which limits their scalability for on-demand video and reduces their feasibility for real-time communication.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Content-Promoted Scene Layers (CPSL), a compact 2.5D video representation that brings the perceptual benefits of volumetric video to conventional 2D content. Guided by per-frame depth and content saliency, CPSL decomposes each frame into a small set of geometry-consistent layers equipped with soft alpha bands and an edge-depth cache that jointly preserve occlusion ordering and boundary continuity. These lightweight, 2D-encodable assets enable parallax-corrected novel-view synthesis via depth-weighted warping and front-to-back alpha compositing, bypassing expensive 3D reconstruction. Temporally, CPSL maintains inter-frame coherence using motion-guided propagation and per-layer encoding, supporting real-time playback with standard video codecs. Across multiple benchmarks, CPSL achieves superior perceptual quality and boundary fidelity compared with layer-based and neural-field baselines while reducing storage and rendering cost by several folds. Our approach offer a practical path from 2D video to scalable 2.5D immersive media.</description>

      <title>An Event-triggered System for Social Persuasion and Danger Alert in Elder Home Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study, the physical state and mental state of elders are both considered, and an event-triggered system has developed to detect events: watch dog, danger notice and photo link. By adopting GMM background modeling, the motion behavior of visitors and elders can be detected in the watch dog event and danger notice event respectively. Experiments set in home scenarios and 5 families participated in the experiments for detecting and recording three types of events from their life activities. In addition, the captured images were analyzed using SVM machine learning. For lack of technical experiences of elders, an intuitive operation as normal life activity was designed to create communication between elder and relatives via social media.</description>

      <title>Towards Unbiased Cross-Modal Representation Learning for Food Image-to-Recipe Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of learning representations for recipes and food images in the cross-modal retrieval problem. As the relationship between a recipe and its cooked dish is cause-and-effect, treating a recipe as a text source describing the visual appearance of a dish for learning representation, as the existing approaches, will create bias misleading image-and-recipe similarity judgment. Specifically, a food image may not equally capture every detail in a recipe, due to factors such as the cooking process, dish presentation, and image-capturing conditions. The current representation learning tends to capture dominant visual-text alignment while overlooking subtle variations that determine retrieval relevance. In this paper, we model such bias in cross-modal representation learning using causal theory. The causal view of this problem suggests ingredients as one of the confounder sources and a simple backdoor adjustment can alleviate the bias. By causal intervention, we reformulate the conventional model for food-to-recipe retrieval with an additional term to remove the potential bias in similarity judgment. Based on this theory-informed formulation, we empirically prove the oracle performance of retrieval on the Recipe1M dataset to be MedR=1 across the testing data sizes of 1K, 10K, and even 50K. We also propose a plug-and-play neural module, which is essentially a multi-label ingredient classifier for debiasing. New state-of-the-art search performances are reported on the Recipe1M dataset.</description>

      <title>UniAV: Unified Audio-Visual Perception for Multi-Task Video Event Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video event localization tasks include temporal action localization (TAL), sound event detection (SED) and audio-visual event localization (AVEL). Existing methods tend to over-specialize on individual tasks, neglecting the equal importance of these different events for a complete understanding of video content. In this work, we aim to develop a unified framework to solve TAL, SED and AVEL tasks together to facilitate holistic video understanding. However, it is challenging since different tasks emphasize distinct event characteristics and there are substantial disparities in existing task-specific datasets (size/domain/duration). It leads to unsatisfactory results when applying a naive multi-task strategy. To tackle the problem, we introduce UniAV, a Unified Audio-Visual perception network to effectively learn and share mutually beneficial knowledge across tasks and modalities. Concretely, we propose a unified audio-visual encoder to derive generic representations from multiple temporal scales for videos from all tasks. Meanwhile, task-specific experts are designed to capture the unique knowledge specific to each task. Besides, instead of using separate prediction heads, we develop a novel unified language-aware classifier by utilizing semantic-aligned task prompts, enabling our model to flexibly localize various instances across tasks with an impressive open-set ability to localize novel categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniAV, with its unified architecture, significantly outperforms both single-task models and the naive multi-task baseline across all three tasks. It achieves superior or on-par performances compared to the state-of-the-art task-specific methods on ActivityNet 1.3, DESED and UnAV-100 benchmarks.</description>

      <title>U2UData+: A Scalable Swarm UAVs Autonomous Flight Dataset for Embodied Long-horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Embodied Long-Horizon (ELH) tasks is crucial for advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world deployment for ELH tasks. ELH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks, requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining embodied persistent states, and adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData+, the first large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for ELH tasks and the first scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous collaborative flights for ELH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120 hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames. This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes, and ELH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData+ also introduces an ELH task for wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models. U2UData+ can be found at https://fengtt42.github.io/U2UData-2/.</description>

      <title>Cross Modal Fine-Grained Alignment via Granularity-Aware and Region-Uncertain Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained image-text alignment is a pivotal challenge in multimodal learning, underpinning key applications such as visual question answering, image captioning, and vision-language navigation. Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.</description>

      <title>To Align or Not to Align: Strategic Multimodal Representation Alignment for Optimal Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning often relies on aligning representations across modalities to enable effective information integration, an approach traditionally assumed to be universally beneficial. However, prior research has primarily taken an observational approach, examining naturally occurring alignment in multimodal data and exploring its correlation with model performance, without systematically studying the direct effects of explicitly enforced alignment between representations of different modalities. In this work, we investigate how explicit alignment influences both model performance and representation alignment under different modality-specific information structures. Specifically, we introduce a controllable contrastive learning module that enables precise manipulation of alignment strength during training, allowing us to explore when explicit alignment improves or hinders performance. Our results on synthetic and real datasets under different data characteristics show that the impact of explicit alignment on the performance of unimodal models is related to the characteristics of the data: the optimal level of alignment depends on the amount of redundancy between the different modalities. We identify an optimal alignment strength that balances modality-specific signals and shared redundancy in the mixed information distributions. This work provides practical guidance on when and how explicit alignment should be applied to achieve optimal unimodal encoder performance.</description>
