      <title>Plasma Frequency of Wire Medium Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits a model for the plasma frequency of a simple wire medium formed by a square lattice of parallel metallic wires. We provide a comparative analysis of existing formulas for estimating the plasma frequency and derive a new expression taking into account the second-order correction by the period to wavelength ratio. The proposed formula demonstrates superior accuracy for thin wires, with a relative error of less than $0.16\%$ for ratio of wires radii to period smaller than $0.13$, significantly outperforming previously known results in this range.</description>

      <title>The Upward-Driven Disk, a Steadily Forced Chaotic Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An "upward-driven disk" is a novel mechanical device built from LEGO parts. A circular disk is suspended from the point where it is sandwiched between two wheels, making it free to oscillate as a pendulum, but the location of that suspension point on the disk changes with time due to a steady upward driving force applied by rotation of one of the wheels. The pendulum can dynamically flip between hanging downward and being inverted. Depending on the upward drive and the initial conditions, the disk can exhibit steady rotation, periodic motion, or chaotic motion (and some of these for the same drive). This device serves as an easy-to-visualize analog of chaotic phenomena in other physical systems. Most notably, the upward driven disk mimics a simplified version of the celebrated Lorenz equations that are frequently used to describe fluid convection.</description>

      <title>Weak solution for granular model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is devoted to questions concerning the existence of solutions for partial differential equation problems modeling granular flows. The models studied take into account the complex threshold rheology of these flows, as well as the dilatance effects. It is the coupling of these two physical phenomena that ensures stability and the existence of dissipated energy. The key point of the article is to understand how this energy can ensure the existence of a weak solution. We first establish a complete result on a simplified model, then demonstrate how it can be extended to more general cases. This work represents a real breakthrough in the mathematical analysis of this type of models for complex flows.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained entropy balance of the Szilard engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to reconcile the entropy reduction of a system through external interventions that are linked to a measurement with the second law of thermodynamics, there are two main proposals: (i) The entropy reduction is compensated by the entropy increase as a result of the measurement on the system (``Szilard principle"). (ii) The entropy reduction is compensated by the entropy increase as a result of the erasure of the measurement results (``Landauer/Bennett principle"). It seems that the LB principle is widely accepted in the scientific debate. In contrast, in this paper we argue for a modified S principle and criticize the LB principle with regard to various points. Our approach is based on the concept of ``conditional action", which is developed in detail. To illustrate our theses, we consider the entropy balance of a variant of the well-known Szilard engine, understood as a classical mechanical system.</description>
