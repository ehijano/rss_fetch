      <title>Lightning declines over shipping lanes following regulation of fuel sulfur emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosol interactions with clouds represent a significant uncertainty in our understanding of the Earth system. Deep convective clouds may respond to aerosol perturbations in several ways that have proven difficult to elucidate with observations. Here, we leverage the two busiest maritime shipping lanes in the world, which emit aerosol particles and their precursors into an otherwise relatively clean tropical marine boundary layer, to make headway on the influence of aerosol on deep convective clouds. The recent seven-fold change in allowable fuel sulfur by the International Maritime Organization allows us to test the sensitivity of the lightning to changes in ship plume aerosol size distributions. We find that, across a range of atmospheric thermodynamic conditions, the previously documented enhancement of lightning over the shipping lanes has fallen by over 40\%. The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment.</description>

      <title>Spatial Microclimatic Characterization of a Parisian "Oasis" Schoolyard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the aftermath of the 2003 heatwave, and with growing concern over climate change, Paris City Hall has been implementing several heat mitigation strategies. One of these is the OASIS Schoolyard Strategy which aims to transform Parisian schoolyards into cool islands. Within this framework, the EU-funded ERDF UIA OASIS Project aims to study the transformation of ten schoolyards, including an evaluation of their microclimatic performance.The present article presents case study results from one schoolyard using GIS data and fixed and mobile microclimatic measurements. An analysis method for mobile measurement data is proposed, tested and discussed on the basis of this case study.</description>

      <title>Interpolation of mountain weather forecasts by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13983v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in numerical simulation methods based on physical models and their combination with machine learning have improved the accuracy of weather forecasts. However, the accuracy decreases in complex terrains such as mountainous regions because these methods usually use grids of several kilometers square and simple machine learning models. While deep learning has also made significant progress in recent years, its direct application is difficult to utilize the physical knowledge used in the simulation. This paper proposes a method that uses machine learning to interpolate future weather in mountainous regions using forecast data from surrounding plains and past observed data to improve weather forecasts in mountainous regions. We focus on mountainous regions in Japan and predict temperature and precipitation mainly using LightGBM as a machine learning model. Despite the use of a small dataset, through feature engineering and model tuning, our method partially achieves improvements in the RMSE with significantly less training time.</description>

      <title>Robust and accurate simulations of flows over orography using non-conforming meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07759v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically validate the static local mesh refinement capabilities of a recently proposed IMEX-DG scheme implemented in the framework of the deal.II library. Non-conforming meshes are employed in atmospheric flow simulations to increase the resolution around complex orography. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks with idealized as well as real orography profiles demonstrate that simulations with the refined mesh are stable for long lead times and no spurious effects arise at the interfaces of mesh regions with different resolutions. Moreover, correct values of the momentum flux are retrieved and the correct large-scale orographic response is established. Hence, large-scale orography-driven flow features can be simulated without loss of accuracy using a much lower total amount of degrees of freedom. In a context of spatial resolutions approaching the hectometric scale in numerical weather prediction models, these results support the use of locally refined, non-conforming meshes as a reliable and effective tool to greatly reduce the dependence of atmospheric models on orographic wave drag parametrizations.</description>

      <title>MetMamba: Regional Weather Forecasting with Spatial-Temporal Mamba Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Learning based Weather Prediction (DLWP) models have been improving rapidly over the last few years, surpassing state of the art numerical weather forecasts by significant margins. While much of the optimization effort is focused on training curriculum to extend forecast range in the global context, two aspects remains less explored: limited area modeling and better backbones for weather forecasting. We show in this paper that MetMamba, a DLWP model built on a state-of-the-art state-space model, Mamba, offers notable performance gains and unique advantages over other popular backbones using traditional attention mechanisms and neural operators. We also demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning based limited area modeling via coupled training with a global host model.</description>
