      <title>Unifying Different Theories of Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for understanding the methodology and theory behind several different methods in the conformal prediction literature, which includes standard conformal prediction (CP), weighted conformal prediction (WCP), nonexchangeable conformal prediction (NexCP), and randomly-localized conformal prediction (RLCP), among others. At the crux of our framework is the idea that conformal methods are based on revealing partial information about the data at hand, and positing a conditional distribution for the data given the partial information. Different methods arise from different choices of partial information, and of the corresponding (approximate) conditional distribution. In addition to recovering and unifying existing results, our framework leads to both new theoretical guarantees for existing methods, and new extensions of the conformal methodology.</description>

      <title>Fermat Distance-to-Measure: a robust Fermat-like metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a probability measure with density, Fermat distances and density-driven metrics are conformal transformation of the Euclidean metric that shrink distances in high density areas and enlarge distances in low density areas. Although they have been widely studied and have shown to be useful in various machine learning tasks, they are limited to measures with density (with respect to Lebesgue measure, or volume form on manifold). In this paper, by replacing the density with the Distance-to-Measure, we introduce a new metric, the Fermat Distance-to-Measure, defined for any probability measure in R^d. We derive strong stability properties for the Fermat Distance-to-Measure with respect to the measure and propose an estimator from random sampling of the measure, featuring an explicit bound on its convergence speed.</description>

      <title>The Markov approximation of the periodic multivariate Poisson autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a periodic multivariate Poisson autoregression with potentially infinite memory, with a special focus on the network setting. Using contraction techniques, we study the stability of such a process and provide upper bounds on how fast it reaches the periodically stationary regime. We then propose a computationally efficient Markov approximation using the properties of the exponential function and a density result. Furthermore, we prove the strong consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator for the Markov approximation and empirically test its robustness in the case of misspecification. Our model is applied to the prediction of weekly Rotavirus cases in Berlin, demonstrating superior performance compared to the existing PNAR model.</description>

      <title>Universal Log-Optimality for General Classes of e-processes and Sequential Hypothesis Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sequential hypothesis testing by betting. For a general class of composite testing problems -- which include bounded mean testing, equal mean testing for bounded random tuples, and some key ingredients of two-sample and independence testing as special cases -- we show that any $e$-process satisfying a certain sublinear regret bound is adaptively, asymptotically, and almost surely log-optimal for a composite alternative. This is a strong notion of optimality that has not previously been established for the aforementioned problems and we provide explicit test supermartingales and $e$-processes satisfying this notion in the more general case. Furthermore, we derive matching lower and upper bounds on the expected rejection time for the resulting sequential tests in all of these cases. The proofs of these results make weak, algorithm-agnostic moment assumptions and rely on a general-purpose proof technique involving the aforementioned regret and a family of numeraire portfolios. Finally, we discuss how all of these theorems hold in a distribution-uniform sense, a notion of log-optimality that is stronger still and seems to be new to the literature.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the complier causal hazard ratio under dependent censoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in studying the causal effect of an endogenous binary treatment on a dependently censored duration outcome. By dependent censoring, it is meant that the duration time ($T$) and right censoring time ($C$) are not statistically independent of each other, even after conditioning on the measured covariates. The endogeneity issue is handled by making use of a binary instrumental variable for the treatment. To deal with the dependent censoring problem, it is assumed that on the stratum of compliers: (i) $T$ follows a semiparametric proportional hazards model; (ii) $C$ follows a fully parametric model; and (iii) the relation between $T$ and $C$ is modeled by a parametric copula, such that the association parameter can be left unspecified. In this framework, the treatment effect of interest is the complier causal hazard ratio (CCHR). We devise an estimation procedure that is based on a weighted maximum likelihood approach, where the weights are the probabilities of an observation coming from a complier. The weights are estimated non-parametrically in a first stage, followed by the estimation of the CCHR. Novel conditions under which the model is identifiable are given, a two-step estimation procedure is proposed and some important asymptotic properties are established. Simulations are used to assess the validity and finite-sample performance of the estimation procedure. Finally, we apply the approach to estimate the CCHR of both job training programs on unemployment duration and periodic screening examinations on time until death from breast cancer. The data come from the National Job Training Partnership Act study and the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York experiment respectively.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry of Receiver Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves in binary classification problems. The key finding is that many of the most commonly used binary classification metrics are merely functions of the composition function $G := F_p \circ F_n^{-1}$, where $F_p(\cdot)$ and $F_n(\cdot)$ are the class-conditional cumulative distribution functions of the classifier scores in the positive and negative classes, respectively. This geometric perspective facilitates the selection of operating points, understanding the effect of decision thresholds, and comparison between classifiers. It also helps explain how the shapes and geometry of ROC/PR curves reflect classifier behavior, providing objective tools for building classifiers optimized for specific applications with context-specific constraints. We further explore the conditions for classifier dominance, present analytical and numerical examples demonstrating the effects of class separability and variance on ROC and PR geometries, and derive a link between the positive-to-negative class leakage function $G(\cdot)$ and the Kullback--Leibler divergence. The framework highlights practical considerations, such as model calibration, cost-sensitive optimization, and operating point selection under real-world capacity constraints, enabling more informed approaches to classifier deployment and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Testing independence and conditional independence in high dimensions via coordinatewise Gaussianization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new statistical tests, in high-dimensional settings, for testing the independence of two random vectors and their conditional independence given a third random vector. The key idea is simple, i.e., we first transform each component variable to standard normal via its marginal empirical distribution, and we then test for independence and conditional independence of the transformed random vectors using appropriate $L_\infty$-type test statistics. While we are testing some necessary conditions of the independence or the conditional independence, the new tests outperform the 13 frequently used testing methods in a large scale simulation comparison. The advantage of the new tests can be summarized as follows: (i) they do not require any moment conditions, (ii) they allow arbitrary dependence structures of the components among the random vectors, and (iii) they allow the dimensions of random vectors diverge at the exponential rates of the sample size. The critical values of the proposed tests are determined by a computationally efficient multiplier bootstrap procedure. Theoretical analysis shows that the sizes of the proposed tests can be well controlled by the nominal significance level, and the proposed tests are also consistent under certain local alternatives. The finite sample performance of the new tests is illustrated via extensive simulation studies and a real data application.</description>

      <title>Computing High-dimensional Confidence Sets for Arbitrary Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a high-density region of an arbitrary distribution over $\mathbb{R}^d$. Given a target coverage parameter $\delta$, and sample access to an arbitrary distribution $D$, we want to output a confidence set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $S$ achieves $\delta$ coverage of $D$, i.e., $\mathbb{P}_{y \sim D} \left[ y \in S \right] \ge \delta$, and the volume of $S$ is as small as possible. This is a central problem in high-dimensional statistics with applications in finding confidence sets, uncertainty quantification, and support estimation.
  In the most general setting, this problem is statistically intractable, so we restrict our attention to competing with sets from a concept class $C$ with bounded VC-dimension. An algorithm is competitive with class $C$ if, given samples from an arbitrary distribution $D$, it outputs in polynomial time a set that achieves $\delta$ coverage of $D$, and whose volume is competitive with the smallest set in $C$ with the required coverage $\delta$. This problem is computationally challenging even in the basic setting when $C$ is the set of all Euclidean balls. Existing algorithms based on coresets find in polynomial time a ball whose volume is $\exp(\tilde{O}( d/ \log d))$-factor competitive with the volume of the best ball.
  Our main result is an algorithm that finds a confidence set whose volume is $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{2/3}))$ factor competitive with the optimal ball having the desired coverage. The algorithm is improper (it outputs an ellipsoid). Combined with our computational intractability result for proper learning balls within an $\exp(\tilde{O}(d^{1-o(1)}))$ approximation factor in volume, our results provide an interesting separation between proper and (improper) learning of confidence sets.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Tailed NGG Mixture Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy tails are often found in practice, and yet they are an Achilles heel of a variety of mainstream random probability measures such as the Dirichlet process (DP). The first contribution of this paper focuses on characterizing the tails of the so-called normalized generalized gamma (NGG) process. We show that the right tail of an NGG process is heavy-tailed provided that the centering distribution is itself heavy-tailed; the DP is the only member of the NGG class that fails to obey this convenient property. A second contribution of the paper rests on the development of two classes of heavy-tailed mixture models and the assessment of their relative merits. Multivariate extensions of the proposed heavy-tailed mixtures are devised here, along with a predictor-dependent version, to learn about the effect of covariates on a multivariate heavy-tailed response. The simulation study suggests that the proposed method performs well in various scenarios, and we showcase the application of the proposed methods in a neuroscience dataset.</description>

      <title>Multiple Testing under High-dimensional Dynamic Factor Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07631v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale multiple testing under static factor models is widely used to detect sparse signals in high-dimensional data. However, static factor models are arguably too stringent because they ignore serial correlation, which seriously distorts error rate control in large-scale inference. In this manuscript, we propose a new multiple testing procedure under dynamic factor models that is robust to nonlinear serial dependence. The idea is to integrate a new sample-splitting strategy based on chronological order and a two-pass Fama--Macbeth regression to form a series of test statistics with marginal symmetry properties and then to use these properties to obtain a data-driven threshold. We show that our procedure can control the false discovery rate asymptotically under high-dimensional dynamic factor models. {As a byproduct of independent interest, we establish a new exponential-type deviation inequality for the sum of random variables over various functionals of linear and nonlinear processes.} Our numerical results, including a case study on hedge fund selection, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Contextual Dynamic Pricing: Algorithms, Optimality, and Local Differential Privacy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study contextual dynamic pricing problems where a firm sells products to $T$ sequentially-arriving consumers, behaving according to an unknown demand model. The firm aims to minimize its regret over a clairvoyant that knows the model in advance. The demand follows a generalized linear model (GLM), allowing for stochastic feature vectors in $\mathbb R^d$ encoding product and consumer information. We first show the optimal regret is of order $\sqrt{dT}$, up to logarithmic factors, improving existing upper bounds by a $\sqrt{d}$ factor. This optimal rate is materialized by two algorithms: a confidence bound-type algorithm and an explore-then-commit (ETC) algorithm. A key insight is an intrinsic connection between dynamic pricing and contextual multi-armed bandit problems with many arms with a careful discretization. We further study contextual dynamic pricing under local differential privacy (LDP) constraints. We propose a stochastic gradient descent-based ETC algorithm achieving regret upper bounds of order $d\sqrt{T}/\epsilon$, up to logarithmic factors, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the privacy parameter. The upper bounds with and without LDP constraints are matched by newly constructed minimax lower bounds, characterizing costs of privacy. Moreover, we extend our study to dynamic pricing under mixed privacy constraints, improving the privacy-utility tradeoff by leveraging public data. This is the first time such setting is studied in the dynamic pricing literature and our theoretical results seamlessly bridge dynamic pricing with and without LDP. Extensive numerical experiments and real data applications are conducted to illustrate the efficiency and practical value of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Local Learning for Covariate Selection in Nonparametric Causal Effect Estimation with Latent Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16315v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects from nonexperimental data is a fundamental problem in many fields of science. A key component of this task is selecting an appropriate set of covariates for confounding adjustment to avoid bias. Most existing methods for covariate selection often assume the absence of latent variables and rely on learning the global network structure among variables. However, identifying the global structure can be unnecessary and inefficient, especially when our primary interest lies in estimating the effect of a treatment variable on an outcome variable. To address this limitation, we propose a novel local learning approach for covariate selection in nonparametric causal effect estimation, which accounts for the presence of latent variables. Our approach leverages testable independence and dependence relationships among observed variables to identify a valid adjustment set for a target causal relationship, ensuring both soundness and completeness under standard assumptions. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series with a Directed Acyclic Graphical Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multivariate time series analysis, understanding the underlying causal relationships among variables is often of interest for various applications. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a powerful framework for representing causal dependencies. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach for modeling multivariate time series where conditional independencies and causal structure are encoded by a DAG. The proposed model allows structural properties such as stationarity to be easily accommodated. Given the application, we further extend the model for matrix-variate time series. We take a Bayesian approach to inference, and a ``projection-posterior'' based efficient computational algorithm is developed. The posterior convergence properties of the proposed method are established along with two identifiability results for the unrestricted structural equation models. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and real data analysis.</description>
