      <title>Conjunctive Table Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conjunctive table algebras are introduced and axiomatically characterized. A conjunctive table algebra is a variant of SPJR algebra (a weaker form of relational algebra), which corresponds to conjunctive queries with equality. The table operations relate to logical operations (e.g. column deletion corresponds to existential quantification). This enables a connection between database theory and algebraic logic, particularly cylindric algebras. A comparison shows which cylindric algebra axioms hold in conjunctive table algebras, which ones are modified, and which ones hold in addition.</description>

      <title>Locally tabular products of modal logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the product $L_1\times L_2$ of two Kripke complete consistent logics, local tabularity of $L_1$ and $L_2$ is necessary for local tabularity of $L_1\times L_2$. However, it is not sufficient: the product of two locally tabular logics can be not locally tabular. We provide extra semantic and axiomatic conditions which give criteria of local tabularity of the product of two locally tabular logics. Then we apply them to identify new families of locally tabular products.</description>

      <title>The ZOO of combinatorial Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Banach spaces induced by families of finite sets in the most natural (Schreier-like) way, that is, we consider the completion $X_\mc{F}$ of $c_{00}$ with respect to the norm $\sup\{\sum_{k\in F}|x(k)|:F\in\mc{F}\}$ where $\mc{F}$ is an arbitrary (not necessarily compact) family of finite sets covering $\mbb{N}$.
  Among other results, we discuss the following:
  (1) Structure theorems bonding the combinatorics of $\mc{F}$ and the geometry of $X_\mc{F}$ including possible characterizations and variants of the Schur property, $\ell_1$-saturation, and the lack of copies of $c_0$ in $X_\mc{F}$.
  (2) A plethora of examples including a relatively simple $\ell_1$-saturated combinatorial space which does not satisfy the Schur property, as well as a new presentation of Pe\l czy\'nski's universal space.
  (3) The complexity of the family $\{H\subseteq\NN:X_{\mc{F}\upharpoonright H}$ does not contain $c_0\}$.</description>

      <title>Growth of regular partitions 3: strong regularity and the vertex partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is Part 3 in a series of papers about the growth of regular partitions in $3$-uniform hypergraphs. We consider here the strong regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. This type of regular decomposition comes with two components, a partition of vertices, and a partition of pairs of vertices. We define two corresponding growth functions associated to a hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs: $T_{\mathcal{H}}$ which measures the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}$ which measures the size of the pairs component. In this paper, we give an almost complete description of the possible growth rates for $T_{\mathcal{H}}$: constant, polynomial, between single and double exponential, or wowzer. The only existing lower bound constructions for this type of hypergraph regularity were due to Moshkovitz and Shapira, who constructed examples requiring a wowzer-type lower bound on the vertex component in a weaker type of hypergraph regularity. The results of this paper rely crucially on the fact that a slightly simpler construction can be used to produce a wowzer type lower bound for $T_{\mathcal{H}}$. The key ingredient in this simpler example is a lower bound construction for strong graph regularity due to Conlon and Fox.</description>

      <title>Growth of regular partitions 4: strong regularity and the pairs partition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the fourth in a series of papers on the growth of regular partitions in $3$-uniform hypergraphs. In this paper, we consider a form of regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs which was developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. Regular decompositions of this type involve two components, a partition on the vertex set and a partition on the pairs of vertices. To each hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs, we associate two corresponding growth functions: $T_{\mathcal{H}}$ for the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}$ for the size of the pairs component. In this paper we consider the behavior of the function $L_{\mathcal{H}}$. We show any such function is either constant, bounded above and below by a polynomial, or bounded below by an exponential.</description>

      <title>Model theory of differential-henselian pre-$H$-fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.12171v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-$H$-fields are ordered valued differential fields satisfying some basic axioms coming from transseries and Hardy fields. We study pre-$H$-fields that are differential-Hensel-Liouville closed, that is, differential-henselian, real closed, and closed under exponential integration, establishing an Ax--Kochen/Ershov theorem for such structures: the theory of a differential-Hensel-Liouville closed pre-$H$-field is determined by the theory of its ordered differential residue field; this result fails if the assumption of closure under exponential integration is dropped. In a two-sorted setting with one sort for a differential-Hensel-Liouville closed pre-$H$-field and one sort for its ordered differential residue field, we eliminate quantifiers from the pre-$H$-field sort, from which we deduce that the ordered differential residue field is stably embedded and if it has NIP, then so does the two-sorted structure. Similarly, the one-sorted theory of differential-Hensel-Liouville closed pre-$H$-fields with closed ordered differential residue field has quantifier elimination, is the model completion of the theory of pre-$H$-fields with gap~$0$, and is complete, distal, and locally o-minimal.</description>

      <title>Oligomorphic groups and tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an oligomorphic group $G$ and a measure $\mu$ for $G$ (in a sense that we introduce), we define a rigid tensor category $\underline{\mathrm{Perm}}(G; \mu)$ of "permutation modules," and, in certain cases, an abelian envelope $\underline{\mathrm{Rep}}(G; \mu)$ of this category. When $G$ is the infinite symmetric group, this recovers Deligne's interpolation category. Other choices for $G$ lead to fundamentally new tensor categories. For example, we construct the first known semi-simple pre-Tannakian categories in positive characteristic with super-exponential growth. One interesting aspect of our construction is that, unlike previous work in this direction, our categories are concrete: the objects are modules over a ring, and the tensor product receives a universal bi-linear map. Central to our constructions is a novel theory of integration on oligomorphic groups, which could be of more general interest. Classifying the measures on an oligomorphic group appears to be a difficult problem, which we solve in only a few cases.</description>

Abstract: We describe two systems currently being developed that use large language models for the automatized correction of (i) exercises in translating back and forth between natural language and the languages of propositional logic and first-order predicate logic and (ii) exercises in writing simple arguments in natural language in non-mathematical scenarios.</description>
