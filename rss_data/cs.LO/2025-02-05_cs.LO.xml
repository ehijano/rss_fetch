      <title>Relators and Notions of Simulation Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations and bisimulations are ubiquitous in the study of concurrent systems and modal logics of various types. Besides classical relational transition systems, relevant system types include, for instance, probabilistic, weighted, neighbourhood-based, and game-based systems. Universal coalgebra abstracts system types in this sense as set functors. Notions of (bi)simulation then arise by extending the functor to act on relations in a suitable manner, turning it into what may be termed a relator. We contribute to the study of relators in the broadest possible sense, in particular in relation to their induced notions of (bi)similarity. Specifically, (i) we show that every functor that preserves a very restricted type of pullbacks (termed 1/4-iso pullbacks) admits a sound and complete notion of bisimulation induced by the coBarr relator; (ii) we establish equivalences between properties of relators and closure properties of the induced notion of (bi)simulation, showing in particular that the full set of expected closure properties requires the relator to be a lax extension, and that soundness of (bi)simulations requires preservation of diagonals; and (iii) we show that functors preserving inverse images admit a greatest lax extension. In a concluding case study, we apply (iii) to obtain a novel highly permissive notion of twisted bisimulation on labelled transition systems.</description>

      <title>On the Existential Theory of the Reals Enriched with Integer Powers of a Computable Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates ER(r^Z), that is the extension of the existential theory of the reals by an additional unary predicate r^Z for the integer powers of a fixed computable real number r &gt; 0. If all we have access to is a Turing machine computing r, it is not possible to decide whether an input formula from this theory satisfiable. However, we show an algorithm to decide this problem when: 1. r is known to be transcendental, or 2. r is a root of some given integer polynomial (that is, r is algebraic).
  In other words, knowing the algebraicity of r suffices to circumvent undecidability. Furthermore, we establish complexity results under the proviso that r enjoys what we call a polynomial root barrier. Using this notion, we show that the satisfiability problem of ER(r^Z) is 1. in EXPSPACE if r is an algebraic number, and 2. in 3EXP if r is a logarithm of an algebraic number, Euler's e, or the number pi, among others.
  To establish our results, we first observe that the satisfiability problem of ER(r^Z) reduces in exponential time to the problem of solving quantifier-free instances of the theory of the reals where variables range over r^Z. We then prove that these instances have a small witness property: only finitely many integer powers of r must be considered to find whether a formula is satisfiable. Our complexity results are shown by relying on well-established machinery from Diophantine approximation and transcendental number theory, such as bounds for the transcendence measure of numbers.
  As a by-product of our results, we are able to remove the appeal to Schanuel's conjecture from the proof of decidability of the entropic risk threshold problem for stochastic games with rational probabilities, rewards and threshold [Baier et al., MFCS'23]: when the base of the entropic risk is Euler's e and the aversion factor is a fixed algebraic number, the problem is in EXP.</description>

      <title>Petri Nets and Higher-Dimensional Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Petri nets and their variants are often considered through their interleaved semantics, i.e. considering executions where, at each step, a single transition fires. This is clearly a miss, as Petri nets are a true concurrency model. This paper revisits the semantics of Petri nets as higher-dimensional automata (HDAs) as introduced by van Glabbeek, which methodically take concurrency into account. We extend the translation to include some common features. We consider nets with inhibitor arcs, under both concurrent semantics used in the literature, and generalized self-modifying nets. Finally, we present a tool that implements our translations.</description>

      <title>Finitely accessible arboreal adjunctions and Hintikka formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arboreal categories provide an axiomatic framework in which abstract notions of bisimilarity and back-and-forth games can be defined. They act on extensional categories, typically consisting of relational structures, via arboreal adjunctions. In many cases, equivalence of structures in fragments of infinitary first-order logic can be captured by transferring the bisimilarity relation along the adjunction.
  In most applications, the categories involved are locally finitely presentable and the adjunctions are finitely accessible. Our main result identifies the expressive power of this class of adjunctions. We show that the ranks of back-and-forth games in the arboreal category are definable by formulae \`a la Hintikka, and thus the relation between extensional objects induced by bisimilarity is always coarser than equivalence in infinitary first-order logic.
  Our approach leverages Gabriel-Ulmer duality for locally finitely presentable categories, and Hodges' word-constructions.</description>

      <title>Tree algebras and bisimulation-invariant MSO on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that the bisimulation invariant fragment of MSO over finite transition systems is expressively equivalent over finite transition systems to modal mu-calculus, a question that had remained open for several decades. The proof goes by translating the question to an algebraic framework, and showing that the languages of regular trees that are recognized by finitary tree algebras whose sorts zero and one are finite are the regular ones, ie. the ones expressible in mu-calculus. This corresponds for trees to a weak form of the key translation of Wilke algebras to omega-semigroup over infinite words, and was also a missing piece in the algebraic theory of regular languages of infinite trees for twenty years.</description>

      <title>Verified and Optimized Implementation of Orthologic Proof Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the development of an optimized and verified decision procedure for orthologic equalities and inequalities. This decision procedure is quadratic-time and is used as a sound, efficient and predictable approximation to classical propositional logic in automated reasoning tools. We formalize, in the Coq proof assistant, a proof system in sequent-calculus style for orthologic. We then prove its soundness and completeness with respect to the algebraic variety of ortholattices, and we formalize a cut-elimination theorem (in doing so, we discover and fix a missing case in a previously published proof).
  We then implement and verify a complete proof search procedure for orthologic. A naive implementation is exponential, and to obtain an optimal quadratic runtime, we optimize the implementation by memoizing its results and simulating reference equality testing. We leverage the resulting correctness theorem to implement a reflective Coq tactic. We present benchmarks showing the procedure, under various optimizations, matches its theoretical complexity.
  Finally, we develop tactics including normalization with respect to orthologic and a boolean solver, which we also benchmark. We make tactics available as a standalone Coq plugin.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Plurimorphisms: Algebraic Approach to Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the success of the so-called algebraic approach to the study of decision constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), exact optimization of valued CSPs, and most recently promise CSPs, we propose an algebraic framework for valued promise CSPs.
  To every valued promise CSP we associate an algebraic object, its so-called valued minion. Our main result shows that the existence of a homomorphism between the associated valued minions implies a polynomial-time reduction between the original CSPs. We also show that this general reduction theorem includes important inapproximability results, for instance, the inapproximability of almost solvable systems of linear equations beyond the random assignment threshold.</description>

      <title>A Semantic Search Engine for Mathlib4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interactive theorem prover Lean enables the verification of formal mathematical proofs and is backed by an expanding community. Central to this ecosystem is its mathematical library, mathlib4, which lays the groundwork for the formalization of an expanding range of mathematical theories. However, searching for theorems in mathlib4 can be challenging. To successfully search in mathlib4, users often need to be familiar with its naming conventions or documentation strings. Therefore, creating a semantic search engine that can be used easily by individuals with varying familiarity with mathlib4 is very important. In this paper, we present a semantic search engine (https://leansearch.net/) for mathlib4 that accepts informal queries and finds the relevant theorems. We also establish a benchmark for assessing the performance of various search engines for mathlib4.</description>

      <title>Correspondences between codensity and coupling-based liftings, a practical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kantorovich distance is a widely used metric between probability distributions. The Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality states that it can be defined in two equivalent ways: as a supremum, based on non-expansive functions into [0, 1], and as an infimum, based on probabilistic couplings. Orthogonally, there are categorical generalisations of both presentations proposed in the literature, in the form of codensity liftings and what we refer to as coupling-based liftings. Both lift endofunctors on the category Set of sets and functions to that of pseudometric spaces, and both are parameterised by modalities from coalgebraic modal logic. A generalisation of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality has been more nebulous-it is known not to work in some cases. In this paper we propose a compositional approach for obtaining such generalised dualities for a class of functors, which is closed under coproducts and products. Our approach is based on an explicit construction of modalities and also applies to and extends known cases such as that of the powerset functor.</description>

      <title>STP: Self-play LLM Theorem Provers with Iterative Conjecturing and Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in formal theorem proving by LLMs is the lack of high-quality training data. Although reinforcement learning or expert iteration partially mitigates this issue by alternating between LLM generating proofs and finetuning them on correctly generated ones, performance quickly plateaus due to the scarcity of correct proofs (sparse rewards). To keep improving the models with limited data, we draw inspiration from mathematicians, who continuously develop new results, partly by proposing novel conjectures or exercises (which are often variants of known results) and attempting to solve them. We design the Self-play Theorem Prover (STP) that simultaneously takes on two roles, conjecturer and prover, each providing training signals to the other. The conjecturer is trained iteratively on previously generated conjectures that are barely provable by the current prover, which incentivizes it to generate increasingly challenging conjectures over time. The prover attempts to prove the conjectures with standard expert iteration. We evaluate STP with both Lean and Isabelle formal versifiers. With 19.8 billion tokens generated during the training in Lean, STP proves 26.3% of the statements in the LeanWorkbook dataset, doubling the previous best result of 13.2% achieved through expert iteration. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance among whole-proof generation methods on miniF2F-test (61.1%, pass@3200), Proofnet-test (23.1%, pass@3200) and PutnamBench (8/644, pass@64).</description>
