      <title>Analytical Green's Function of Multidimensional Boltzmann Transport Equation for Modeling Hydrodynamic Second Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic second sound can be generated by heat pulses when the phonon-phonon interaction is dominantly momentum conserving, and the propagation of the temperature field becomes wavelike rather than diffusive. While the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) has been widely applied to study phonon dynamics and thermal transport at the nanoscale, modeling the hydrodynamic transport regime remains challenging. The widely used relaxation time approximation (RTA) treats all phonon interactions as resistive without considering momentum conservation, resulting in the absence of phonon hydrodynamics. Rigorously solving BTE by inverting the full scattering matrix, however, is extremely computationally demanding and has been only applied to model one-dimensional temperature variations. Here, we present an analytical Green's function formalism for solving multidimensional Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) using phonon properties from first-principles calculations. This formalism involves Callaway's scattering approximation with separate relaxation times for momentum-conserving and momentum-destroying scattering events. The Green's function captures phonon dynamics in a wide range of temperature, spatial, and temporal scales, and successfully reproduces the transition from ballistic, hydrodynamic, to diffusive transport regimes. Our method avoids the computationally demanding inversion of large scattering matrices and shows good accuracies in predicting the temperature oscillation in ultrafast pump-probe characterizations with different geometries of thermal excitation.</description>

      <title>Effects of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Thermal Expansion on the Phonon-limited Resistivity of Pb from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using density functional theory calculations with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we report on the temperature-dependent thermodynamical properties of Pb: electrical resistivity, thermal expansion (TE), heat capacity, bulk modulus and its pressure derivative. For the former, we employed the state-of-the-art ab initio Boltzmann Transport Equation formalism, and we calculated the effect of TE. In accordance with previous work, we show that SOC improves the description of the phonon dispersion and the resistivity. We argue that this is caused by a joint mutual effect of an increase in the electronic nesting and an increase in the electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, including TE incorporates non-linearity into the resistivity at high temperatures, whose magnitude depends on whether SOC is included or not. We suggest that mechanisms beyond the quasi-harmonic approximation should be considered to get a better description of Pb with SOC at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Terahertz electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of the electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals induced by an intense single-cycle terahertz pulse. The effect reveals itself as a transient change of the polarization state of a femtosecond laser pulse reflected from the crystal that is exposed to the terahertz electric field. The corresponding experimental signal is apparently instantaneous with respect to the field and contains a linear (Pockels) and a quadratic (Kerr) components of comparable magnitude. The latter does not depend on the crystal orientation, while the former demonstrates three-fold rotational symmetry in agreement with the trigonal symmetry of the crystal surface. The electro-optic effect vanishes upon phase transition to the non-topological metal state induced by indium doping and also can be quenched by a femtosecond pre-pulse. We associate this effect with surface Dirac electronic states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and discuss its possible mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Dislocation Glides in Granular Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic crystals with dislocations deform plastically at low stresses via dislocation glide. Whether dislocation glide occurs in macroscopic frictional granular media has remained unknown. The discrete element method is employed to simulate the structural and mechanical responses of a granular crystal with an edge dislocation. We find that dislocation glide occurs at low interparticle friction, resulting in significantly lower yield stresses than in dislocation-free crystals. Yield stress varies linearly with interparticle friction, attributed to both Peierls stress and frictional effect.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Raman Spectrum Calculations in Defective 2D Materials using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning prediction workflow to study the impact of defects on the Raman response of 2D materials. By combining the use of machine-learned interatomic potentials, the Raman-active $\Gamma$-weighted density of states method and splitting configurations in independant patches, we are able to reach simulation sizes in the tens of thousands of atoms, with diagonalization now being the main bottleneck of the simulation. We apply the method to two systems, isotopic graphene and defective hexagonal boron nitride, and compare our predicted Raman response to experimental results, with good agreement. Our method opens up many possibilities for future studies of Raman response in solid-state physics.</description>

      <title>Design of novel organic proton-transfer acid-base (anti-)ferroelectric salts with crystal structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic molecular ferroelectrics, including organic proton-transfer ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics, are potentially attractive in organic electronics and have significant chemical tunability. Among these, acid-base proton transfer (PT) salts stand out due to their low coercive fields and the possibility to tune their properties with different acid-base combinations. Using crystal structure prediction, combining small acid and base organic molecular species, we here predict three novel acid-base PT ferroelectric salts with higher polarization than existing materials. We also report two combinations that form antiferroelectric crystal structures. However, some combinations also result in unfavorable packing or the formation of co-crystal or in one case a divalent salt. The protonation state is found to be highly linked to the crystal structure, with cases where salt crystal structures have the same energetic preferability as co-crystals with a different crystalline packing.</description>

      <title>Observation of Temperature-Dependent Capture Cross-Section for Main Deep-Levels in $\beta$-Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct observation of capture cross-section is challenging due to the need of extremely short filling pulses in the two-gate Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS). Simple estimation of cross-section can be done from DLTS and Admittance Spectroscopy (AS) data, but it is not feasible to distinguish temperature dependence of pre-exponential and exponential parts of the emission rate equation with sufficient precision conducting a single experiment. This paper presents experimental data of deep-levels in $\beta$-Ga2O3 that has been gathered by our group since 2017. Based on the gathered data we propose a derivation of apparent activation energy ($E_a^m$) and capture cross-section ($\sigma_n^m$) assuming temperature dependent capture via multiphonon emission model, which resulted in strong correlation between $E_a^m$ and $\sigma_n^m$ according to Meyer-Neldel rule, which allowed us to estimate low- and high-temperature capture coefficients $C_0$ and $C_1$ as well as capture barrier $E_b$. It also has been shown that without considering the temperature dependence of capture cross-section, the experimental values of $\sigma_n$ are overestimated by 1-3 orders of magnitude. A careful consideration of the data also allows to be more certain identifying deep-levels by their "fingerprints" ($E_a$ and $\sigma_n$) considering two additional parameters ($E_{MN}$ and $\sigma_{00}$) and to verify the density functional theory (DFT) computation of deep-level recombination properties.</description>

      <title>A steady-state frictional crack in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analogy between frictional cracks, propagating along interfaces in frictional contact, and ordinary cracks in bulk materials is important in various fields. We consider a stress-controlled frictional crack propagating at a velocity $c_{\rm r}$ along an interface separating two strips, each of height $H$, the frictional counterpart of the classical problem of a displacement-controlled crack in a strip, which played central roles in understanding material failure. We show that steady-state frictional cracks in a strip geometry require a nonmonotonic dependence of the frictional strength on the slip velocity and, in sharp contrast to their classical counterparts, feature a vanishing stress drop. Here, rupture is driven by energy flowing to its edge from behind, generated by an excess power of the external stress, and to be accompanied by an increase in the stored elastic energy, in qualitative contrast to the classical counterpart that is driven by the release of elastic energy stored ahead of the propagating edge. Finally, we derive a complete set of mesoscopic and macroscopic scaling relations for frictional cracks in a strip geometry and demonstrate that the stress singularity near their edges is proportional to $(\Delta{v}/c_{\rm r})\sqrt{H}$, where $\Delta{v}$ is the slip velocity rise accompanying their propagation.</description>

      <title>Manipulating ferroelectric topological polar structures with twisted light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic control of novel states of matter beyond thermodynamic equilibrium is a fundamental pursuit in condensed matter physics. Intense terahertz fields have enabled metal-insulator transitions, superconductivity, quantum paraelectric ferroelectricity, and room-temperature magnetization via circularly polarized terahertz electric fields. These effects hinge on the excitation of infrared-active soft phonon modes by terahertz fields. Expanding this concept, recent theory suggests that ferroelectric polarization may be manipulated through terahertz twisted light, transferring orbital angular momentum to create ferroelectric skyrmions. Our study experimentally demonstrates that such control is possible in quasi-2D ferroelectric CsBiNb2O7 using twisted UV light with orbital angular momentum (OAM). By resonantly exciting both the ferroelectric mode and the octahedral tilting mode, twisted UV light dynamically modulates the ferroelectric polarization. We employ in-situ X-ray Bragg coherent diffractive imaging, twisted optical Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory to three-dimensionally resolve ionic displacement fields and polarization texture changes. Our observations reveal deterministic, reversible twisted light-induced strain and ionic displacements within the unit cell, causing substantial microscopic polarization changes. This interaction between twisted photons, phonon modes, and induced ionic displacements breaks symmetry and stabilizes a non-equilibrium ferroelectric phase with topological solitons. These findings offer a new path to control ferroelectricity and magnetism, opening avenues for novel optoelectronic devices such as ultrafast non-volatile memory switches by using light to coherently control ferroic states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference and Optical Tuning of Self-Trapped Exciton State in Double Halide Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-trapped excitons (STEs), renowned for their unique radiative properties, have been harnessed in diverse photonic devices. Yet, a full comprehension and manipulation of STEs remain elusive. In this study, we present novel experimental and theoretical evidence of the hybrid nature and optical tuning of the STEs state in Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6InCl6. The detection of Fano resonance in the laser energy-dependent Raman and photoluminescence spectra indicates the emergence of an exciton-phonon hybrid state, a result of the robust quantum interference between the discrete phonon and continuous exciton states. Moreover, we showcase the ability to continuously adjust this hybrid state with the energy and intensity of the laser field. These significant findings lay the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of the nature of STE and its potential for state control.</description>

      <title>Effect of antisite disorder on the magnetic and transport properties of a quarternary Heusler alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin gapless semiconductors based Heusler alloys are the special class of materials due to their unique band structure, high spin polarization and high Curie temperature. These materials exhibit a distinct electronic structure: a nonzero band gap in one spin channel while the other spin channel remains gapless, making them highly suitable for tunable spintronics. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of structural, magnetic, thermoelectric, and transport properties of the quaternary Heusler alloy CoFeMnSn is conducted. X-ray diffraction and Neutron diffraction analyses confirm a well ordered structure with partial antisite disorder between Co, Fe and Mn, Sn atoms. Magnetic studies show that the material exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, with a Curie temperature of around 660 K. Notably, we observe an anomalous Hall effect linked to intrinsic mechanisms driven by Berry curvature, underscoring the intricate relationship between structural disorder and electronic behavior. Transport measurements also highlight the impact of antisite disorder on the systems, with resistivity decreasing as temperature increases. These insights position CoFeMnSn as a promising material for future spintronic devices and advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Characterization of Thermoelectric Properties in Selenium-Doped Bismuth Telluride Ultra Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectricity in telluride materials is often improved by replacing telluride with selenium in its crystal. Most work, however, focuses on bulk crystal and leaves the 2D thin films intact. In this paper, we optimize the fabrication of selenium-doped bismuth telluride (Bi$_2$Te$_{3-\rm{x}}$Se$_{\rm{x}}$) thin films using a 3-source thermal co-evaporation. Thermoelectric properties, including the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity, are systematically characterized to evaluate the material's performance for thermoelectric applications near room temperature. The thin films were deposited under carefully controlled conditions, with the evaporation rates of bismuth, tellurium, and selenium precisely monitored to achieve the desired stoichiometry and crystalline phase. Finally, thermoelectricity in Bi$_2$Te$_{3-\rm{x}}$Se$_{\rm{x}}$ at the ultra-thin regime is investigated. We consistently obtain films with thickness near 30 nm with a Seebeck coefficient of 400 $\mu$V/K and a power factor of 1 mW/mK$^2$.</description>

      <title>Solid Solubility in Metallic Hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen in its metallic form is the most common material in our solar system, found under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions found in giant planets. Such conditions are inaccessible to experiment and consequently, theoretical work has typically led experiment. Many remarkable properties are proposed for metallic hydrogen, which is expected to exist in solid form down to low temperatures. Relevant here is that solid metallic hydrogen is not expected to have a close-packed structure, even at extreme pressures. The predicted crystal structure has a packing fraction of only 0.44 compared with 0.74 for fcc. Alloying with other metallic elements can form compounds with atomic hydrogen and much reduced metallization pressure. Here, we investigate the possible solid solubility of a representative range of elements (Be, B, Mg, S, Fe, La) in metallic atomic hydrogen near 500GPa. Zero point energy is highly significant in all cases. The metallic elements Be, Mg, Fe, and La have a well-defined clathrate-style first neighbour shell at 300K, while the non-metallic B and S have more open arrangements. All the elements considered are soluble, in sites substituting for more than one hydrogen atom. The solid solubility of such a wide range of ambient bonding types: simple metals, covalent materials, transition metals, lanthanides, which gives a strong indication that most elements will dissolve in solid metallic hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of piezoelectric response in V doped LiNbO3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiNbO3 films doped with vanadium (V) were deposited using RF magnetron sputtering technique. To realize doping with a wider range of V concentration, a 30 mm V metal inlaid target asymmetrically embedded in the 150 mm lithium niobate target was used. The V concentration in the deposited films was a decreasing function of the distance from the V target. The V/Nb ratio decreased from 0.155 to 0.024, corresponding to a change in the composition of thin films from LiNb0.866V0.134O3 to LiNb0.977V0.023O3, respectively. Surface and inner morphology and structure, phase and element composition, microstructure, and ferroelectric properties of the undoped and V doped LiNbO3 films were studied. The measured maximal d33 constant of the LiNb0.935V0.065O3 film was about three times higher than that of the undoped LiNbO3 film, 14 pC/N and 4.76 pC/N, respectively. The optimal composition in the deposition geometry used was within the range of LiNb0.885V0.115O3 to LiNb0.952V0.048O3. Undoped and V doped LiNbO3 thin films were used as bulk acoustic wave ultrasonic transducers deposited on stainless steel plates to generate longitudinal waves and compare their ultrasonic performance.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of carbohydrate stereochemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbohydrates, essential biological building blocks, exhibit functional mechanisms tied to their intricate stereochemistry. Subtle stereochemical differences, such as those between the anomers maltose and cellobiose, lead to distinct properties due to their differing glycosidic bonds; the former is digestible by humans, while the latter is not. This underscores the importance of precise structural determination of individual carbohydrate molecules for deeper functional insights. However, their structural complexity and conformational flexibility, combined with the high spatial resolution needed, have hindered direct imaging of carbohydrate stereochemistry. Here, we employ non-contact atomic force microscopy integrated with a data-efficient, multi-fidelity structure search approach accelerated by machine learning integration to determine the precise 3D atomic coordinates of two carbohydrate anomers. We observe that glycosidic bond stereochemistry regulates on-surface chiral selection in carbohydrate self-assemblies. The reconstructed models, validated against experimental data, provide reliable atomic-scale structural evidence, uncovering the origin of on-surface chirality from carbohydrate anomerism. Our study confirms that nc-AFM is a reliable technique for real-space discrimination of carbohydrate stereochemistry at the single-molecule level, providing a pathway for bottom-up investigations into the structure-property relationships of carbohydrates in biological research and materials science.</description>

      <title>High-order van Hove singularities and nematic instability in a kagome superconductor CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ (A = Cs or Rb) are emerging topological kagome metals that exhibit superconductivity and nematicity without intertwining translational symmetry-breaking charge orders. In this work, we explore the Fermionology of their titanium kagome electrons and identify a set of sublattice-pure, high-order van Hove singularities (VHSs) that can suppress charge ordering and enhance electronic correlations and superconductivity. Our calculations of charge susceptibility for kagome bands with both normal and high-order VHSs emphasize the role of these VHSs in driving electronic nematicity in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Additionally, we compute the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon interactions for CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pristine, doped, and kagome-exposed surface conditions, revealing its robustness against structural instabilities while enhancing the superconducting transition temperature. Our work positions ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ as a key platform for investigating superconductivity and electronic nematicity without translational symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Origin of Oxygen Partial Pressure-Dependent Conductivity in SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrTiO3 (STO) displays a broad spectrum of physical properties, including superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and photoconductivity, making it a standout semiconductor material. Despite extensive researches, the oxygen partial pressure-dependent conductivity in STO has re-mained elusive. This study leverages first-principles calculations, and systematically investigates the intrinsic defect properties of STO. The results reveal that VO, VSr, and TiSr are the dominant intrinsic defects, influencing STO's conductivity under varying O chemical potentials (oxygen partial pressures). Under O-poor condition, VO is the predominant donor, while VSr is the main acceptor. As the oxygen pressure increases, TiSr emerges as a critical donor defect under O-rich condition, significantly affecting conductivity. Additionally, the study elucidates the abnormal phenomenon where VTi, typically an acceptor, exhibits donor-like behavior due to the formation of O-trimer. This work offers a comprehensive understanding of how intrinsic defects tune the Fermi level, thereby altering STO's conductivity from n-type to p-type across different O chemical potentials. These insights resolve the long-standing issue of oxygen partial pressure-dependent conductivity and explain the observed metallic conductivity in oxygen-deficient STO.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Guided Prediction Toward Quantum Materials Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of inorganic crystalline materials is essential for modern technology, especially in quantum materials development. However, designing efficient synthesis workflows remains a significant challenge due to the precise experimental conditions and extensive trial and error. Here, we present a framework using large language models (LLMs) to predict synthesis pathways for inorganic materials, including quantum materials. Our framework contains three models: LHS2RHS, predicting products from reactants; RHS2LHS, predicting reactants from products; and TGT2CEQ, generating full chemical equations for target compounds. Fine-tuned on a text-mined synthesis database, our model raises accuracy from under 40% with pretrained models, to under 80% using conventional fine-tuning, and further to around 90% with our proposed generalized Tanimoto similarity, while maintaining robust to additional synthesis steps. Our model further demonstrates comparable performance across materials with varying degrees of quantumness quantified using quantum weight, indicating that LLMs offer a powerful tool to predict balanced chemical equations for quantum materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum impact on light scattering by phonons tested experimentally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized Raman spectra of piezoelectric bismuth germanate single crystal were recorded using vortex light in order to verify the predicted symmetry selection rules for Raman scattering of photons with nonzero orbital angular momentum. At first, the phonon spectrum is fully characterized by the infrared reflectivity and Raman scattering with ordinary light. Then, vortex light Raman spectra were compared with the ordinary ones, but no influence of the orbital momentum on the Raman spectra of Bi$_4$Ge$_3$O$_{12}$ was observed. In particular, we experimentally negate the theoretical prediction that Raman scattering using vortex light can yield frequencies of the silent optic modes of Bi$_4$Ge$_3$O$_{12}$. We also have not seen evidence for the predicted symmetry-lowering of the Raman scattering tensors of $E$ modes. We propose that the orbital momentum effects are inaccessible to the ordinary Raman spectroscopy experiments because of the tiny magnitudes of typical phonon coherence lengths.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Tracking of Local and Collective Defects Dynamics in Metals Under Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals owe their unique mechanical properties to how defects emerge and propagate within their crystal structure under stress. However, the mechanisms leading from the early emerging (local) defects to the amplification of dislocations (collective plastic events) are not easy to track. Here, using tensile-stress atomistic simulations of a Copper lattice as a case study, we revisit this classical problem under a new perspective based on local dynamics rather than on purely structural arguments. We use a data-driven approach that allows tracking how local fluctuations emerge and accumulate in the atomic lattice in space and time, anticipating/determining the emergence of local or collective structural defects during deformation. Building solely on the general concepts of local fluctuations and spatiotemporal fluctuation correlations, this approach allows characterizing in a unique way the evolution through the elastic, plastic, and fracture phases, describing metals as complex systems where collective phenomena originate from local dynamical triggering events.</description>

      <title>Long-term stability and oxidation of ferroelectric AlScN devices: An operando HAXPES study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N) is a promising material for ferroelectric devices due to its large remanent polarization, scalability, and compatibility with semiconductor technology. By doping AlN with Sc, the bonds in the polar AlN structure are weakened, which enables ferroelectric switching below the dielectric breakdown field. However, one disadvantage of Sc doping is that it increases the material's tendency towards oxidation. In the present study, the oxidation process of tungsten-capped and uncapped Al$_{0.83}$Sc$_{0.17}$N thin films is investigated by hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). The samples had been exposed to air for either two weeks or 6 months. HAXPES spectra indicate the replacement of nitrogen by oxygen, and the tendency of oxygen to favor oxidation with Sc rather than Al. The appearance of an N$_2$ spectral feature thus can be directly related to the oxidation process. We present an oxidation model that mimics these spectroscopic results of the element-specific oxidation processes within Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N. Finally, in operando HAXPES data of uncapped and capped AlScN-capacitor stacks are interpreted using the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in magnetoelastic effects of YCo5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the phenomenological theory for uniaxial ferromagnets, and derive explicit formulae for their magnetostriction (MS) and magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) generated by the magnetoelastic (ME) effects. An analysis of the experimental results for the MS in hexagonal YCo$_{5}$ using the formulae obtained reveals that 1) an elastic anomaly should appear in the elastic constant $c_{33}$, and 2) the MAE caused by the ME effects could be non-negligible. The calculated results of electronic structure under lattice deformation indicate that the particular arrangement of Co atoms in the lattice is related to the anisotropy of MS in YCo$_{5}$. It is suggested that the anisotropic MS observed for various Y-compounds could be interpreted in a similar manner.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent Wannier functions were initially proposed as a means for calculating the polarization current in crystals driven by external fields. In this work, we present a simple gauge where Wannier states are defined based on the maximally localized functions at the initial time, and are propagated using the time-dependent Bloch states obtained from established first-principles calculations, avoiding the costly Wannierization at ech time step. We show that this basis efficiently describes the time-dependent polarization of the laser driven system through the analysis of the motion of Wannier centers. We use this technique to analyze highly nonlinear and non-perturbative responses such as high harmonic generation in solids, using the hexagonal boron nitride as an illustrative example, and we show how it provides an intuitive picture for the physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Impact of the NO annealing duration on the SiO2/4H-SiC interface properties in lateral MOSFETs: the energetic profile of the near-interface-oxide traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the effects of the duration of the post deposition annealing (PDA) in nitric oxide (NO) on the properties of SiO2/4H-SiC interfaces in n-channel lateral MOSFETs are investigated, with a special focus on the modifications of the energy profile of near-interface-oxide traps (NIOTs). For this purpose, the electrical characteristics of lateral MOSFETs were studied in strong inversion conditions, monitoring the threshold voltage variations due to charge trapping effects. To determine the energetic position of the NIOTs with respect of the SiO2 conduction band edge, the Fermi level position in the insulating layer was evaluated by TCAD simulations of the band diagrams. PDAs of the gate oxide of different duration resulted into similar shape of the energetic profile of the traps inside the insulator with respect of the SiO2 conduction band edge, but with different magnitude. Finally, the effective decrease of the insulator traps is demonstrated despite a saturation of the interface state density under prolonged PDAs and in particular the charge trapped at the NIOTs is reduced from 1-2 x 1011 cm-2 down to 3 x 1011 cm-2 varying the PDA duration from 10 up to 120 min in NO at 1175 degree C.</description>

      <title>Combined concurrent Physical and Chemical model for accelerated weathering damages of polyurethane-based coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paints and coatings undergo a variety of physical and chemical changes under environmental exposures. Accurate prediction of these changes is important for the applications of coatings. This work presents a novel approach to modeling accelerated weathering of coating by combining concurrent physical and chemical processes. The model integrates key factors influencing coating degradation and employs a multi-scale framework to capture macro-scale physical changes and micro-level chemical transformations. The chemical component/model simulates photo-degradation reactions using kinetic equations, while the physical component uses Monte Carlo simulations where repeated random events develop surface erosion. The surface topography and chemistry of coating is generated statistically through the physical model. The variations in surface topography and chemistry of coating are correlated with the chemical changes from the chemical model, resulting in estimation of both physical and chemical changes in the coating during real accelerated weathering time. Results demonstrate accurate predictions of chemistry changes, surface degradation profiles, roughness, gloss loss, and relative fracture toughness, which are validated successfully with the experimentally available data. This integrated approach provides insight into coating failure mechanisms, enabling accurate service life prediction, and serve as a tool for formulating durable coatings and optimizing testing protocols.</description>

      <title>Materials Screening Approach to Thermochemically Stable Thin Film Optical Emitters for Thermophotovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) have the potential to exhibit higher power conversion efficiencies than traditional photovoltaics (PVs), with a broad range of applicability from waste recovery systems to aerospace solutions. They operate by preferentially radiating above bandgap photons via a high temperature optical emitter, whose spectrum is tuned through choice of materials and geometry. For TPV to be practically implemented, the emitters must be designed with a simple optical structure while remaining thermally stable. Here, we demonstrate coating/substrate bilayer thin films as a solution to these design criteria. With the optical data of 53 high melting point materials, we simulate the bilayer emissivity as a function of coating thickness for each thermochemically stable emitter operating at 1,800 {\deg}C. Emitter-cell systems are characterized by the cell power density and TPV conversion efficiency, constituting a TPV performance metric space. For a given bilayer and bandgap these coating thickness parameterized figures of merit form a performance metric curve, with the best points defining a tradeoff zone. We screen the resulting performance metric curves, identifying trends based on optical properties of the system, finding a high degree of tunability through the material selection step. For GaSb cells, &gt;49% efficiency is achieved using AlN/W, a 5.6% increase over bulk W. By calculating the figures of merit for all systems with varying bandgap, we find unique emitter choices per PV cell for achieving the highest potential efficiency. Our materials screening approach uses physical data to identify improvements to emitters for experimental TPV designs.</description>

      <title>Upsampling DINOv2 features for unsupervised vision tasks and weakly supervised materials segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The features of self-supervised vision transformers (ViTs) contain strong semantic and positional information relevant to downstream tasks like object localization and segmentation. Recent works combine these features with traditional methods like clustering, graph partitioning or region correlations to achieve impressive baselines without finetuning or training additional networks. We leverage upsampled features from ViT networks (e.g DINOv2) in two workflows: in a clustering based approach for object localization and segmentation, and paired with standard classifiers in weakly supervised materials segmentation. Both show strong performance on benchmarks, especially in weakly supervised segmentation where the ViT features capture complex relationships inaccessible to classical approaches. We expect the flexibility and generalizability of these features will both speed up and strengthen materials characterization, from segmentation to property-prediction.</description>

      <title>Microscopic dynamics of collective acoustic excitations in simple liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we systematically investigate the microscopic dynamics of collective vibrational excitations in simple liquids. The thermodynamic states of simple liquids are unified to the mean atomic free volume. Our results show that longitudinal acoustic collective vibrational excitations are always observed in simple liquids even when the liquids are viscous, in which the atomic free volume is larger than the cross point of the corresponding mean propagation length and the atomic diffusion limit. This is because some long-wavelength longitudinal acoustic collective vibrational excitations can still propagate in viscous liquids. However, transverse acoustic collective vibrational excitations in viscous liquids become localized since both short- and long-wavelength transverse acoustic collective vibrational excitations have propagation lengths smaller than the atomic diffusion limit. Therefore, transverse acoustic collective vibrational excitations may not be detected in simple liquids. The propagation length of macroscopic elastic and shear waves which are the mechanical response of long-wavelength longitudinal and transverse collective vibrational excitations, respectively, is further calculated to quickly determine the propagation-to-localization crossover of collective vibrational excitations in simple liquids. Our findings here advance the understanding of the microscopic dynamics of collective vibrational excitations in simple liquids.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Final Phosphorus Content of Steel in a Scrap-Based Electric Arc Furnace Using Artificial Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scrap-based electric arc furnace process is expected to capture a significant share of the steel market in the future due to its potential for reducing environmental impacts through steel recycling. However, managing impurities, particularly phosphorus, remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a machine learning model to estimate the steel phosphorus content at the end of the process based on input parameters. Data were collected over two years from a steel plant, focusing on the chemical composition and weight of the scrap, the volume of oxygen injected, and process duration. After preprocessing the data, several machine learning models were evaluated, with the artificial neural network (ANN) emerging as the most effective. The best ANN model included four hidden layers. The model was trained for 500 epochs with a batch size of 50. The best model achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.000016, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.0049998, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 99.96%, and a correlation coefficient (r) of 99.98%. Notably, the model achieved a 100% hit rate for predicting phosphorus content within +-0.001 wt% (+-10 ppm). These results demonstrate that the optimized ANN model offers accurate predictions for the steel final phosphorus content.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband THz Conductivity of Gated Graphene In- and Out-of-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ ultrabroadband terahertz (THz) spectroscopy to expose the high-frequency transport properties of Dirac fermions in monolayer graphene. By controlling the carrier concentration via tunable electrical gating, both equilibrium and transient optical conductivities are obtained for a range of Fermi levels. The frequency-dependent equilibrium response is determined through a combination of time-domain THz and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy for energies up to the near-infrared, which also provides a measure of the gate-voltage dependent Fermi level. Transient changes in the real and imaginary parts of the graphene conductivity are electro-optically resolved for frequencies up to 15 THz after near-infrared femtosecond excitation, both at the charge-neutral point and for higher electrostatic-doping levels. Modeling of the THz response provides insight into changes of the carrier spectral weights and scattering rates, and reveals an additional broad-frequency ($\approx$ 8 THz) component to the photo-induced response, which we attribute to the zero-momentum mode of quantum-critical transport observed here in large-area CVD graphene.</description>

      <title>Embedded Nonlocal Operator Regression (ENOR): Quantifying model error in learning nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal, integral operators have become an efficient surrogate for bottom-up homogenization, due to their ability to represent long-range dependence and multiscale effects. However, the nonlocal homogenized model has unavoidable discrepancy from the microscale model. Such errors accumulate and propagate in long-term simulations, making the resultant prediction unreliable. To develop a robust and reliable bottom-up homogenization framework, we propose a new framework, which we coin Embedded Nonlocal Operator Regression (ENOR), to learn a nonlocal homogenized surrogate model and its structural model error. This framework provides discrepancy-adaptive uncertainty quantification for homogenized material response predictions in long-term simulations. The method is built on Nonlocal Operator Regression (NOR), an optimization-based nonlocal kernel learning approach, together with an embedded model error term in the trainable kernel. Then, Bayesian inference is employed to infer the model error term parameters together with the kernel parameters. To make the problem computationally feasible, we use a multilevel delayed acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo (MLDA-MCMC) method, enabling efficient Bayesian model calibration and model error estimation. We apply this technique to predict long-term wave propagation in a heterogeneous one-dimensional bar, and compare its performance with additive noise models. Owing to its ability to capture model error, the learned ENOR achieves improved estimation of posterior predictive uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Driven Microstructure Characterization and Vickers Hardness Prediction of Mg-Gd Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of materials science, exploring the relationship between composition, microstructure, and properties has long been a critical research focus. The mechanical performance of solid-solution Mg-Gd alloys is significantly influenced by Gd content, dendritic structures, and the presence of secondary phases. To better analyze and predict the impact of these factors, this study proposes a multimodal fusion learning framework based on image processing and deep learning techniques. This framework integrates both elemental composition and microstructural features to accurately predict the Vickers hardness of solid-solution Mg-Gd alloys. Initially, deep learning methods were employed to extract microstructural information from a variety of solid-solution Mg-Gd alloy images obtained from literature and experiments. This provided precise grain size and secondary phase microstructural features for performance prediction tasks. Subsequently, these quantitative analysis results were combined with Gd content information to construct a performance prediction dataset. Finally, a regression model based on the Transformer architecture was used to predict the Vickers hardness of Mg-Gd alloys. The experimental results indicate that the Transformer model performs best in terms of prediction accuracy, achieving an R^2 value of 0.9. Additionally, SHAP analysis identified critical values for four key features affecting the Vickers hardness of Mg-Gd alloys, providing valuable guidance for alloy design. These findings not only enhance the understanding of alloy performance but also offer theoretical support for future material design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Neural rendering enables dynamic tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interrupted X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) has been the common way to observe the deformation of materials during an experiment. While this approach is effective for quasi-static experiments, it has never been possible to reconstruct a full 3d tomography during a dynamic experiment which cannot be interrupted. In this work, we propose that neural rendering tools can be used to drive the paradigm shift to enable 3d reconstruction during dynamic events. First, we derive theoretical results to support the selection of projections angles. Via a combination of synthetic and experimental data, we demonstrate that neural radiance fields can reconstruct data modalities of interest more efficiently than conventional reconstruction methods. Finally, we develop a spatio-temporal model with spline-based deformation field and demonstrate that such model can reconstruct the spatio-temporal deformation of lattice samples in real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Spectra and pseudospectra in the evaluation of material stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vectorvalued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the phase field. In the presence of non-normality, the spectral analysis of such a matrix when (unknown or uncertain or time-dependent) constitutive parameters vary is generically not decisive to evaluate the material stability. We thus need to look at the pseudospectrum, that is, the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in an {\epsilon}-neighborhood of the matrix of interest. As a case study, we look at quasicrystals and evaluate through spectra and pseudospectra the influence of a microstructural self-action on the material stability. This approach allows us to reliably determine thresholds where stable-unstable transitions in the material behavior occur.</description>

      <title>Orbital Topology of Chiral Crystals for Orbitronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and manifests in a wide range of phenomena including chemical reactions, biological processes, and quantum transport of electrons. In quantum materials, the chirality of fermions, given by the relative directions between the electron spin and momentum, is connected to the band topology of electronic states. Here, we show that in structurally chiral materials like CoSi, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) serves as the main driver of a nontrivial band topology in this new class of unconventional topological semimetals, even when spin-orbit coupling is negligible. A nontrivial orbital-momentum locking of multifold chiral fermions in the bulk leads to a pronounced OAM texture of the helicoid Fermi arcs at the surface. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of the orbital degree of freedom for the chirality and topology of electron states, in general, and pave the way towards the application of topological chiral semimetals in orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Ionic-Bonded Structures in NiSe Nanowire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional van der Waals (1D vdW) materials, characterized by atomic chains bonded ionically or covalently in one direction and held together by van der Waals interactions in the perpendicular directions, have recently gained intensive attention due to their exceptional functions. In this work, we report the discovery of 1D ionic-bonded structures in NiSe nanowires. Utilizing aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, we identified four distinct structural phases composed of two fundamental 1D building blocks: a triangle-shaped unit and a parallelogram-shaped unit. These phases can transform into one another through topotactic combinations of the structural units. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these structural units are bound by ionic bonds, unlike the van der Waals forces typically found in 1D vdW materials. The diverse arrangements of these building blocks may give rise to unique electronic structures and magnetic properties, paving the way for designing advanced materials with novel functionalities.</description>

Abstract: Janus transition metal-dichalcogenide (JTMD) materials have attracted a great deal of attention due to their remarkable physical properties arising from the two-dimensional geometry and the breakdown of the out-of-plane symmetry. Using first-principles density functional theory, we investigated the phase stability, strain-enhanced phase stability, and superconductivity of Janus WSeH and WSH. In addition, we investigated the contribution of the phonon linewidths from the phonon energy spectrum responsible for the superconductivity, and the electron-phonon coupling as a function of phonon wave vectors and modes. Previous work has examined hexagonal 2H and tetragonal 1T structures, but we found that neither is a ground state structure. The metastable 2H phase of WSeH is dynamically stable with Tc around 11.60K, similar to WSH. Compressive biaxial strain - the 2D equivalent of pressure - can stabilize the 1T structures of WSeH and WSH with Tc around 9.23K and 10.52K, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry plays an important role in determining the physical properties in condensed matter physics, as the symmetry operations of any physical property must include the symmetry operations of the point group of the crystal. As a consequence, crystallographic polarity and chirality are expected to have an impact on the Cooper pairing in a superconductor. While superconductivity with crystallographic polarity and chirality have both been found in a few crystalline phases separately; however, their coexistence and material realizations have not been studied. Here, by utilizing transport, Raman scattering, and transmission electron microscopy, we unveil a unique realization of superconductivity in single-crystalline Mo3Al2C (superconducting Tc=8K) with a polar charge-density-wave phase and well-defined crystallographic chirality. We show that the intriguing charge density wave order leads to a noncentrosymmetric-nonpolar to polar transition below T*=155K via breaking both the translational and rotational symmetries. Superconductivity emerges in this polar and chiral crystal structure below Tc=8K. Our results establish that Mo3Al2C is a superconductor with crystallographic polarity and chirality simultaneously, and motivate future studies of unconventional superconductivity in this category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces that combine high-index materials with optical nonlinearities are widely recognized for their potential in various quantum and classical nanophotonic applications. However, the fabrication of high-quality metasurfaces poses significant material-dependent challenges, as their designs are often susceptible to disorder, defects, and scattering losses, which are particularly prone to occur at the edges of nanostructured features. Additionally, the choice of the material platforms featuring second-order optical nonlinearities, $\chi^{(2)}$, is limited to broken-inversion symmetry crystals such as GaAs, GaP, LiNbO$_3$, and various bulk van der Waals materials, including GaSe and NbOCl$_2$. Here, we use a combination of top-down lithography and anisotropic wet etching of a specially stacked van der Waals crystal -- 3R-MoS$_2$, which exhibits both a high refractive index and exceptional $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity, to produce metasurfaces consisting of perfect equilateral triangle nanoholes with atomically precise zigzag edges. Due to the geometry of the triangle, the etching process is accompanied by a transition from an in-plane $C_4$ symmetric structure to a broken-in-plane symmetry configuration, thereby allowing for the realization of the quasi-bound-state-in-the-continuum (q-BIC) concept. The resulting ultrathin metasurface ($\sim$ 20-25 nm) demonstrates a remarkable enhancement in second-harmonic generation (SHG) -- over three orders of magnitude at specific wavelengths and linear polarization directions compared to a host flake.</description>

Abstract: Based on the superposition of incremental frictional surface tractions that, in the case of an incompressible elastic half-space, correspond to a rigid tangential translation of a circular contact domain, the stress and displacement fields in the surface are determined in closed analytic form for an elastic half-space under the action of a constant shear traction over a circular contact domain on the surface. The obtained exact solutions can serve as benchmarks for numerical models, or can be used for the deeper contact-mechanical analysis of adhesive sliding contacts of soft materials.</description>

Abstract: The introduction of a twist between two layers of two-dimensional materials has opened up a new and exciting field of research known as twistronics. In these systems, the phonon dispersions show significant renormalization and enhanced electron-phonon interactions as a function of the twist angle. However, the large system size of the resulting moir\'e patterns in these systems makes phonon calculations computationally challenging. In this paper, we present PARPHOM, a powerful code package designed to address these challenges. PARPHOM enables the generation of force constants, computation of phononic band structures, and determination of density of states in twisted 2D material systems. Moreover, PARPHOM provides essential routines to investigate the finite temperature dynamics in these systems and analyze the chirality of the phonon bands. This paper serves as an introduction to PARPHOM, highlighting its capabilities and demonstrating its utility in unraveling the intricate phononic properties of twisted 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Quantitative mapping of smooth topographic landscapes produced by thermal scanning-probe lithography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a powerful technique for mapping nanoscale surface properties through tip-sample interactions. Thermal scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) is an advanced SPM variant that uses a silicon tip on a heated cantilever to sculpt and measure polymer films with nanometer precision. The surfaces produced by tSPL-smooth topographic landscapes-allow mathematically defined contours to be fabricated on the nanoscale, enabling sophisticated functionalities for photonic, electronic, chemical, and biological technologies. Evaluating the physical effects of a landscape requires fitting arbitrary mathematical functions to SPM datasets, however, this capability does not exist in standard analysis programs. Here, we provide an open-source software package (FunFit) to fit analytical functions to SPM data and develop a fabrication and characterization protocol based on this analysis. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach by patterning periodic and quasiperiodic landscapes in a polymer resist with tSPL, which we transfer to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes with high fidelity via reactive-ion etching. The topographic landscapes in polymers and hBN are measured with tSPL and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. Within the FunFit program, the datasets are corrected for artefacts, fit with analytical functions, and compared, providing critical feedback on the fabrication procedure. Beyond application to tSPL, this protocol can improve analysis, reproducibility, and process development for a broad range of SPM experiments. The protocol can be performed within a working day by an inexperienced user, where fabrication and characterization take a few hours and software analysis takes a few minutes.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Diffusion Tensor in Microstructured Perovskites</title>

Abstract: Understanding energy transport in semiconductors is critical for design of electronic and optoelectronic devices. Semiconductor material properties such as charge carrier mobility or diffusion length are commonly measured in bulk crystals and determined using models that describe transport behavior in homogeneous media, where structural boundary effects are minimal. However, most emerging semiconductors exhibit nano and microscale heterogeneity. Therefore, experimental techniques with high spatial resolution paired with models that capture anisotropy and domain boundary behavior are needed. We develop a diffusion tensor-based framework to analyze experimental photoluminescence (PL) diffusion maps accounting for material nano and microstructure. Specifically, we quantify both carrier transport and recombination in single crystal and polycrystalline lead halide perovskites by globally fitting diffusion maps, with spatial, temporal, and PL intensity data. We reveal a 29% difference in principal diffusion coefficients and alignment between electronically coupled grains for CH3NH3PbI3 polycrystalline films. This framework allows for understanding and optimizing anisotropic energy transport in heterogeneous materials.</description>

      <title>X-type antiferromagnetic stacking for spintronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical phenomena in condensed matter normally arise from the collective effect of all atoms, while selectively addressing a lone atomic sublattice by external stimulus is elusive. The later functionality may, however, be useful for different applications due to a possible response being different from that occurring when the external stimulus affects the whole solid. Here, we introduce cross-chain antiferromagnets, where the stacking of two magnetic sublattices form a pattern of intersecting atomic chains, supportive to the sublattice selectivity. We dub this antiferromagnetic (AFM) stacking X-type and demonstrate that it reveals unique spin-dependent transport properties not present in conventional magnets. Based on high-throughput analyses and computations, we unveil three prototypes of X-type AFM stacking and identify 18 X-type AFM candidates. Using $\beta$-Fe$_{2}$PO$_{5}$ as a representative example, we predict the sublattice-selective spin-polarized transport driven by the X-type AFM stacking, where one magnetic sublattice is conducting, while the other is not. As a result, a spin torque can be exerted solely on a single sublattice, leading to unconventional ultrafast dynamics of the N\`eel vector capable of deterministic switching of the AFM order parameter. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked type of magnetic moment stacking and reveals sublattice-selective physical properties promising for high-performance spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In van der Waals materials, coupling between adjacent layers is weak, and consequently interlayer interactions are weakly screened. This opens the possibility to profoundly modify the electronic structure, e.g., by applying electric fields or with adsorbates. Here, we show for the case of the topologically trivial semimetal 1Tprime-MoTe2 that potassium dosing at room temperature significantly transforms its band structure. With a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory we show that i) for small concentrations of K, 1Tprime-MoTe2 undergoes a Lifshitz transition with the electronic structure shifting rigidly, and ii) for larger K concentrations 1Tprime-MoTe2 undergoes significant band structure transformation. Our results demonstrate that the origin of this electronic structure change stems from alkali metal intercalation.</description>

      <title>On the equilibrium limit of liquid stability in pressurized aqueous systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase stability, and the limits thereof, are a central concern of materials thermodynamics. However, the temperature limits of equilibrium liquid stability in chemical systems have only been widely characterized under constant (typically atmospheric) pressure conditions, whereunder the limit is represented by the eutectic. At higher pressures, this limit will shift in both temperature and chemical composition, opening a wide thermodynamic parameter space over which the absolute limit, i.e., the limit under arbitrary values of the thermodynamic forces at play (here pressure and concentration), might exist. In this work, we use isochoric freezing to measure this absolute limit for the first time in several binary aqueous brines, and, nodding to the etymology of "eutectic", we name this limit the "cenotectic" (from Greek " ", "universal-melt"). We observe that when no solute-bearing high-pressure phases exist, the cenotectic occurs consistently 22 +/- 2K below the 1 bar eutectic and at approximately 213 +/- 3 MPa, suggesting domination by the liquidus behaviors of the icy phases present. In charting the T-P evolution of each eutectic configuration, we also encounter several unreported high-pressure hydrates of NaHCO2, MgCl2, and NaCl, and we find that these high-pressure phases can produce complex multi-phase configurations involving the liquid that may remain metastable to significantly lower temperatures. We discuss the implications of these findings for ocean worlds of our solar system and cold ocean exoplanets; estimate thermodynamic limits on ice crust thickness and final ocean depth ("endgame") using the cenotectic pressure; and finally provide a generalized thermodynamic perspective on (and definition for) this fundamental thermodynamic invariant point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating force constants for crystal structures is crucial for calculating various phonon-related properties. However, this task becomes particularly challenging when dealing with a large number of atoms or when third- and higher-order force constants are required. In this study, we propose an efficient approach that involves constructing a complete orthonormal basis set for the force constants. We formulate this approach using projection matrices and their eigenvectors to meet the requirements for the force constants. This basis set enables precise inference of the force constants from displacement-force datasets. Our efficient algorithms for basis-set construction and force constant estimation are implemented in the symfc code. Furthermore, several applications demonstrated in this study indicate that the current approach facilitates the efficient and accurate determination of force constants.</description>

Abstract: Optimizing grain boundary characteristics in polycrystalline materials can improve their properties. Many processing methods have been developed for grain boundary manipulation, including the use of intense radiation in certain applications. In this work, we used X-ray free electron laser pulses to irradiate single-crystalline bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) and observed grain boundary formation and subsequent grain rotation in response to the X-ray radiation. Our observations with simultaneous transmission X-ray microscopy and X-ray diffraction demonstrate how intense X- ray radiation can rapidly change size and texture of grains.</description>

Abstract: Previous studies on natural samples of pampaloite (AuSbTe) revealed the crystal structure of a potentially cleavable and/or exfoliable material, while studies on natural and synthetic montbrayite (Sb-containing Au$_2$Te$_3$) claimed various chemical compositions for this low symmetry compound. Few investigations of synthetic samples have been reported for both materials, leaving much of their chemical, thermal and electronic characteristics unknown. Here, we investigate the stability, electronic properties and synthesis of the gold antimony tellurides AuSbTe and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ (montbrayite). Differential thermal analysis and $\textit{in situ}$ powder x-ray diffraction revealed that AuSbTe is incongruently melting, while Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ is congruently melting. Calculations of the band structures and four-point resistivity measurements showed that AuSbTe is a semiconductor and Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$ a metal. Various synthesis attempts confirmed the limited stable chemical composition of Au$_{1.9}$Sb$_{0.46}$Te$_{2.64}$, identified successful methods to synthesize both compounds, and highlighted the challenges associated with single crystal synthesis of AuSbTe.</description>

      <title>Crystal Structure Prediction and Phase Stability in Highly Anharmonic Silver-Based Chalcohalide Anti-Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silver-based chalcohalide anti-perovskites (CAP), Ag$_{3}$BC (B = S, Se; C = Cl, Br, I), represent an emerging family of energy materials with intriguing optoelectronic, vibrational and ionic transport properties. However, the structural features and phase stability of CAP remain poorly investigated to date, hindering their fundamental understanding and potential integration into technological applications. Here we employ theoretical first-principles methods based on density functional theory to fill this knowledge gap. Through crystal structure prediction techniques, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and quasi-harmonic free energy calculations, we unveil a series of previously overlooked energetically competitive phases and temperature-induced phase transitions for all CAP. Specifically, we identify a new cubic $P2_{1}3$ structure as the stable phase of all CAP containing S both at zero temperature and $T \neq 0$ K conditions. Consequently, our calculations suggest that the cubic $Pm\overline{3}m$ phase identified in room-temperature X-ray diffraction experiments is likely to be metastable. Furthermore, for CAP containing Se, we propose different orthorhombic ($Pca2_{1}$ and $P2_{1}2_{1}2_{1}$) and cubic ($I2_{1}3$) structures as the ground-state phases and reveal several phase transformations induced by temperature. This theoretical investigation not only identifies new candidate ground-state phases and solid-solid phase transformations for all CAP but also provides insights into potential stability issues affecting these highly anharmonic superionic materials.</description>

      <title>Density-Based Long-Range Electrostatic Descriptors for Machine Learning Force Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a long-range descriptor for machine learning force fields (MLFFs) that maintains translational and rotational symmetry, similar to short-range descriptors while being able to incorporate long-range electrostatic interactions. The proposed descriptor is based on an atomic density representation and is structurally similar to classical short-range atom-centered descriptors, making it straightforward to integrate into machine learning schemes. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through comparative analysis with the long-distance equivariant (LODE) descriptor. In a toy model with purely electrostatic interactions, our model achieves errors below 0.1%, worse than LODE but still very good. For real materials, we perform tests for liquid NaCl, rock salt NaCl, and solid zirconia. For NaCl, the present descriptors improve on short-range density descriptors, reducing errors by a factor of two to three and coming close to message-passing networks. However, for solid zirconia, no improvements are observed with the present approach, while message-passing networks reduce the error by almost a factor of two to three. Possible shortcomings of the present model are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>An extended Rice model for intergranular fracture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The plastic events occurring during the process of intergranular fracture in metals is still not well understood due to the complexity of grain boundary (GB) structures and their interactions with crack-tip dislocation plasticity. By considering the local GB structural transformation after dislocation emission from a GB in the Peierls-type Rice-Beltz model, herein we established a semi-analytical transition-state-theory-based framework to predict the most probable Mode-I stress intensity factor (SIF) for dislocation emission from a cracked GB. Using large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we studied the fracture behaviors of bi-crystalline Fe samples with 12 different symmetric tilt GBs inside. The MD results demonstrate that the presence of GB could significantly change the SIF required for the activation of plastic events, confirming the theoretical predictions that attributes this to the energy change caused by the transformation of GB structure. Both the atomistic simulation and the theoretical model consistently indicate that, the critical dynamic SIF ($K_{I}^{c}(t)$) at which the dynamic SIF $K_{I}(t)$ deviates from the linearity with respect to the strain ${\epsilon}$, increases with the increasing loading rate. However, the classical Rice model underestimates the $K_{I}^{c}(t)$ due to its failure to consider the effects of localized fields. The present theoretical model provides a mechanism-based framework for the application of grain boundary engineering in the design and fabrication of nano-grained metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of issues arising in materials science is a behavior of non-equilibrium point defects in the atomic lattice, which defines the rates of chemical reactions and relaxation processes as well as affects the physical properties of solids. It is previously theoretically predicted that melting and rapid solidification of metals and alloys provides a vacancy concentration in the quenched material, which can be comparable to that quantity at the point of melting. Here, the vacancy behavior is studied exerimentally in thin films of the near equiatomic Fe-Al alloy subjected to nanosecond laser annealing with intensities up to film ablation. The effects of laser irradiation are studied by monitoring magneto-optically the ordering kinetics in the alloy at the very ablation edge, within a narrow (micron-scale) ring-shaped region around the ablation zone. Quantitatively, the vacancy supersaturation in the quenched alloy has been estimated by fitting a simulated temporal evolution of the long-range chemical order to the obtained experimental data. Laser quenching (LQ) of alloys and single-element materials would be a tool for obtaining novel phase states within a small volume of the crystal.</description>

      <title>Orientational disorder and molecular correlations in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites: From fundamental insights to technological applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIP) have emerged in recent years as highly promising semiconducting materials for a wide range of optoelectronic and energy applications. Nevertheless, the rotational dynamics of the organic components and many molecule interdependencies, which may strongly impact the functional properties of HOIP, are not yet fully understood. In this study, we quantitatively analyze the orientational disorder and molecular correlations in the archetypal perovskite CH$_{3}$NH$_{3}$PbI$_{3}$ (MAPI) by performing comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations and entropy calculations. We found that, in addition to the usual vibrational and orientational contributions, rigid molecular rotations around the C-N axis and correlations between neighboring molecules noticeably contribute to the entropy increment associated with the temperature-induced order-disorder phase transition in MAPI, $\Delta S_{t}$. Molecular conformational changes are equally infrequent in the low-$T$ ordered and high-$T$ disordered phases and have a null effect on $\Delta S_{t}$. Conversely, the couplings between the angular and vibrational degrees of freedom are substantially reinforced in the high-$T$ disordered phase and significantly counteract the phase-transition entropy increase resulting from other factors. Furthermore, the tendency for neighboring molecules to be orientationally ordered is markedly local, consequently inhibiting the formation of extensive polar nanodomains both at low and high temperatures. This theoretical investigation not only advances the fundamental knowledge of HOIP but also establishes physically insightful connections with contemporary technological applications like photovoltaics and solid-state cooling.</description>

Abstract: Magneto-conductance in thin wires often exhibits complicated patterns due to the quantum interference of conduction electrons. These patterns reflect microscopic structures in the wires, such as defects or potential distributions. In this study, we propose an inverse design method to automatically generate a microscopic structure that exhibits desired magneto-conductance patterns. We numerically demonstrate that our method accurately generates defect positions in wires and can be effectively applied to various complicated patterns. We also discuss techniques for designing structures that facilitate experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>The pathway to chirality in elemental tellurium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral crystals, like chiral molecules, cannot be superimposed onto their mirror images -- a fundamental property that has been linked to interesting physical behavior and exploited in functional devices. Among the simplest inorganic systems with crystallographic chirality, elemental tellurium adopts crystal structures with right- or left-handed chains. However, understanding the formation mechanisms of those structures has been difficult due to the rapid crystallization of Te, which reaches the spatial and temporal resolution limits of even the most advanced experiments. Here, we report ultra-large-scale, quantum-mechanically accurate simulations that reveal mechanisms of crystallization and the origin of crystallographic chirality in solid Te. We identify a characteristic, disordered cube-like structural motif -- a transient bonding environment with only nanosecond lifetime -- that enables both the rapid crystallization of Te and mediates chirality transfer. Based on the resulting microscopic understanding, we are able to explain the switching behavior of Te-based electrical devices.</description>

      <title>Homogenized Models of Mechanical Metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of mechanical metamaterials are prohibitively expensive due to the separation of scales between the lattice and the macrostructural size. Hence, multiscale continuum analysis plays a pivotal role in the computational modeling of metastructures at macroscopic scales. In the present work, we assess the continuum limit of mechanical metamaterials via homogenized models derived rigorously from variational methods. It is shown through multiple examples that micropolar-type effective energies, derived naturally from analysis, properly capture the kinematics of discrete lattices in two and three dimensions. Moreover, the convergence of the discrete energy to the continuum limit is shown numerically. We provide open-source computational implementations for all examples, including both discrete and homogenized models.</description>

      <title>Significant Impact of Quantum and Anharmonic Effects on the Structural Stability and Superconductivity of NbH3 at High Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-principles calculations combined with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation reveal significant effects of the quantum ionic fluctuations and lattice anharmonicity on the dynamical stability of NbH3 under high pressures. Previous theoretical predictions, which ignored ionic fluctuations and relied on the harmonic approximation, suggested that the I43d phase is the most thermodynamically favorable structure between 33 and 400 GPa, with the Fm3m phase considered thermodynamically metastable. However, recent experiments at 187 GPa identified the Fm3m phase, conflicting with the prediction. In contrast, the present study indicates that the Fm3m phase remains dynamically stable down to at least 145 GPa, approximately 145 GPa lower than harmonic estimates, while the I43d phase is dynamically unstable at 187 GPa, consistent with the experimental findings. Furthermore, systematic calculations are performed on the structural, vibrational and superconducting properties of Fm3m NbH3 under pressures ranging from 100 to 300 GPa, revealing dramatic modifications due to the quantum and anharmonic effects. The calculated superconducting critical temperature (Tc) from the McMillan equation for Fm3m NbH3 at 187 GPa is 44 K, with mu set at 0.15, close to the measured value. These findings highlight the crucial role of quantum anharmonic effects in stabilizing the Fm3m phase.</description>

      <title>Electronic Bound States in the Continuum in a 2D Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are quantum states that remain localized despite existing within a continuum of extended, delocalized states. They defy conventional wave theories and could be instrumental for quantum technologies that rely on the precise control of quantum states. While optical BICs have been realized in photonic systems, achieving electronic bound states in a metallic background remains an ongoing challenge. Here, we observe two defect states that remain localized within the metallic continuum of Pd5AlI2, a two-dimensional van der Waals metal. The emergence of these states is a manifestation of the hopping interference in the Pd5AlI2 lattice. This interference results in a (quasi) flat band and spatially localized eigenstates that are orthogonal to the metallic continuum thus avoiding hybridization with extended states.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in Hamiltonian formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A host of elastic systems consisting of active components exhibit path-dependent elastic behaviors not found in classical elasticity, which is known as odd elasticity. Odd elasticity is characterized by antisymmetric (odd) elastic modulus tensor. Here, from the perspective of geometry, we construct the Hamiltonian formalism to show the origin of the antisymmetry of the elastic modulus that is intrinsically anisotropic. Furthermore, both non-conservative stress and the associated nonlinear constitutive relation naturally arise. This work also opens the promising possibility of exploring the physics of odd elasticity in dynamical regime by Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Composite quadrupole order in ferroic and multiferroic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03312v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism of composite and intertwined orders has been remarkably successful in discussing the complex phase diagrams of strongly correlated materials and high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here, we propose that composite orders are also realized in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials when lattice anisotropy is taken into account. This composite order emerges above the ferroic phase transition, and its existence is determined by the easy axis of magnetization or polarization, respectively. In multiferroic materials, where polarization and magnetization are coupled, composites of both orders are possible. This formalism of composite orders naturally accounts for magnetoelectric monopole, toroidal, and quadrupole orders. More broadly, composite orders may explain precursor phenomena in incipient (multi)ferroic materials, arising at temperatures above the ferroic phase transition and potentially contributing to the characterization of currently hidden orders.</description>

      <title>Signature of pressure-induced topological phase transition in ZrTe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The layered van der Waals material ZrTe$_5$ is known as a candidate topological insulator (TI), however its topological phase and the relation with other properties such as an apparent Dirac semimetallic state is still a subject of debate. We employ a semiclassical multicarrier transport (MCT) model to analyze the magnetotransport of ZrTe$_5$ nanodevices at hydrostatic pressures up to 2 GPa. The temperature dependence of the MCT results between 10 and 300 K is assessed in the context of thermal activation, and we obtain the positions of conduction and valence band edges in the vicinity of the chemical potential. We find evidence of the closing and re-opening of the band gap with increasing pressure, which is consistent with a phase transition from weak to strong TI. This matches expectations from ab initio band structure calculations, as well as previous observations that CVT-grown ZrTe$_5$ is a weak TI in ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Fractal Surface States in Three-Dimensional Topological Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study topological states of matter in quasicrystals, which do not rely on crystalline orders. In the absence of a bandstructure description and spin-orbit coupling, we show that a three-dimensional quasicrystal can nevertheless form a topological insulator. It relies on a combination of noncrystallographic rotational symmetry of quasicrystals and electronic orbital space symmetry, which is the quasicrystalline counterpart of topological crystalline insulator. The resulting topological state obeys a non-trivial twisted bulk-boundary correspondence and lacks a good metallic surface. The topological surface states, localized on the top and bottom planes respecting the quasicrystalline symmetry, exhibit a new kind of multifractality with probability density concentrates mostly on high symmetry patches. They form a near-degenerate manifold of 'immobile' states whose number scales proportionally with the macroscopic sample size. This can open the door to a novel platform for topological surface physics distinct from the crystalline counterpart.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Density Scaling: Coarse-Graining in Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure and dynamics of liquids is pivotal for the study of larger spatiotemporal processes, especially in glass-forming materials at low temperatures. Density scaling, observed in many molecular systems through experiments, offers an efficient means for exploring a vast range of time scales along a one-dimensional phase diagram. However, the theoretical foundation provided by isomorph theory is of limited use for molecular systems, since currently no first-principles theory exists that can explain the origins of density scaling or make predictions based on it. In this work, we propose a first-principles framework employing coarse-graining in space and time. Spatial coarse-graining reduces a molecule to a center-of-mass-level description by eliminating fast degrees of freedom, while temporal coarse-graining involves averaging fluctuations or correlation functions over characteristic time scales. We show that both approaches enable ab initio estimation of the density scaling coefficient for ortho-terphenyl, consistent with experimental values. Building on these findings, we employ excess entropy scaling to derive a microscopic theory that underpins density scaling from fully atomistic simulations. Our results illuminate the role of coarse-graining in assessing slow fluctuations in molecules and unravel the microscopic nature of density scaling. Ultimately, our proposed framework enables systematic bottom-up approaches for predicting transport coefficients that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible and computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>Separate and Detailed Treatment of Absolute Signal and Noise Enables NMR Under Adverse Circumstances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When deploying a spectrometer in an adverse environment, such as during a typical ODNP experiment or experiments that require low-volume low-field measurements, a clear and modern protocol for characterizing and quantifying the absolute signal and noise levels proves essential. This paper provides such a protocol. It also highlights the clarity and insight that comes from (1) discussing NMR signal intensities in (conserved) units of square root instantaneous power that are derived from a theory and notation developed initially for ESR spectroscopy; as well as (2) characterizing the spectral distribution of the noise.
  Crucially, the strategy introduced here applies not only to ODNP measurements, but to all low-field NMR. Low-field NMR offers immense flexibility: it enables integration with other instrumentation and deploys in practical applications not accessible to higher-field instrumentation. More generally, the protocol introduced here should apply to a wide range of instruments, and should prove especially useful in cases subject to design constraints that requires integration with multiple other modules that are not dedicated to NMR but that control other forms of spectroscopy or other crucial aspects of the measurement. However, in the specific case of ODNP, this protocol demonstrates that the absolute signal and noise level can be estimated from the clarified theory presented here, and uses that theory to identify the inefficient distribution of fields in the hairpin loop probe as the main remaining bottleneck for the improvement of low-field low-volume ODNP SNR.</description>

      <title>Crystallization morphology and self-assembly of polyacrylamide solutions during evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the crystallization and self-assembly phenomena of polyacrylamide (PAM) solutions during evaporation. While traditional thin-film fabrication methods such as spin coating and drop casting are commonly used, this study utilizes a simple evaporation approach to gain insights into the self-assembly processes of PAM solutions. We examined PAM solutions with varying concentrations (1%, 2%, and 5%) and observed the resulting crystalline structures and morphological changes during evaporation. Spectroscopic absorbance measurements were employed to analyze concentration gradients and crystallization patterns. The findings reveal that the concentration gradient during evaporation significantly impacts the crystallization behavior of PAM solutions. The 2% solution exhibited the clearest and most regular crystalline patterns, whereas the 1% and 5% solutions displayed more complex and irregular morphologies. These observations provide new insights into how solution concentration influences PAM crystallization, contributing to a better understanding of polymer thin-film self-assembly. The novelty of this study lies in exploring PAM self-assembly through controlled evaporation, offering valuable insights for the development of polymer films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that flat bands and van Hove singularities near the magic angle can be stabilized against angle disorder in the twisted Kane-Mele model. With continuum model and maximally localized Wannier function approaches, we identify a quadratic dispersion relationship between the bandwidth, interaction parameters versus the twist angle, in contrast to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Introducing Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling to TBG greatly reduces the fractional Chern insulator indicator and enhances the stability of fractional Chern states near the magic angle, as confirmed by exact diagonalization calculations. Moreover, in twisted bilayer Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ with intrinsic Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling, we identify a topological flat band at a large twist angle around 4 degrees.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations in the van der Walls material $\rm NiPS_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the magnetic excitation spectrum of the quantum magnet $\rm NiPS_3$ near the zig-zag ground state of a minimal honeycomb spin Hamiltonian that includes bilinear and biquadratic spin interactions. Our analysis, using a multi-boson generalized spin wave theory suited for spin S=1 systems, revealed two normal modes at the linear level. The one at lower energy corresponds to a single magnon mode, consistent with results from spectroscopy experiments. Without single-ion anisotropy, this mode features a Goldstone mode at the corner of the Brillouin zone. When single ion anisotropy is introduced, the zig-zag phase's global U(1) invariance is broken, resulting in a gap. The higher energy mode corresponds to two-magnon fluctuations, which appear at the harmonic level in the generalized spin wave theory. This mode forms a gapped flat band due to bilinear spin interactions and becomes dispersive when biquadratic interactions are considered. The higher energy dispersion is related to quadrupolar fluctuations, which are feasible in magnets where the order parameter fluctuates in the SU(3) space. The spectrum analysis yielded quantum corrections to the order parameter and detected instabilities in the $\rm NiPS_3$ dipolar phases. Identifying the highest energy branch in experiments could provide insight into hidden nematic orders in $\rm NiPS_3$ and other van der Waals magnets.</description>

      <title>Frustrated S = 1/2 Chains in One-Dimensional Correlated Metal Ti4MnBi2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic correlations lead to heavy quasiparticles in three-dimensional metals, and their collapse can destabilize magnetic moments. It is an open question whether there is an analogous instability in one-dimensional (1D) systems, unanswered due to the lack of metallic spin chains. We report neutron scattering measurements and Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations establishing spinons in the correlated metal Ti4MnBi2, confirming it is 1D. Ti4MnBi2 is inherently frustrated, forming near a quantum critical point separating two T = 0 phases of the J1-J2 XXZ model. The lack of magnetic order above 0.3 K results from these quantum critical fluctuations, potentially compounded by Kondo moment compensation. Ti4MnBi2 provides the first experimental evidence that 1D magnetism, previously the exclusive domain of insulators, persists in metallic systems with moderate correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$). Strain-induced $T_c$ enhancement is demonstrated with an example case for Zr$_2$NCl$_2$. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which are likely influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>
