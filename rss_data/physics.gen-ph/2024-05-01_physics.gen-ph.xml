      <title>Does there exist the applicability limit of PDE to describe physical phenomena? -- A personal survey of Quantization, QED, Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What does it mean to study PDE(=Partial Differential Equation)? How and what to do "to claim proudly that I'm studying a certain PDE"? Newton mechanic uses mainly ODE(=Ordinary Differential Equation) and describes nicely movements of Sun, Moon and Earth etc. Now, so-called quantum phenomenum is described by, say Schr\"odinger equation, PDE which explains both wave and particle characters after quantization of ODE. The coupled Maxwell-Dirac equation is also "quantized" and QED(=Quantum Electro-Dynamics) theory is invented by physicists. Though it is said this QED gives very good coincidence between theoretical and experimental observed quantities, but what is the equation corresponding to QED? Or, is it possible to describe QED by "equation" in naive sense?</description>

      <title>Vortexes as systems specific to the Acoustic World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the properties of vortexes, as systems specific to the Acoustic World, using both hydrodynamic theory and the corresponding hydrodynamic Maxwell equations. According to this study, it follows that the vortex behaves like an acoustic dipole that has intrinsic/internal angular momentum. The system of two identical vortices also has orbital angular momentum and behaves, at distances much greater than the distance between the axes of the vortices, as a single vortex. With the help of Maxwell's hydrodynamic equations for the vortex we deduced the force between two vortices and obtained the expression of the equivalent mass of the vortex and the permittivity of the electroacoustic field. We also obtained and interpreted the expression for the energy density of the acoustic field. The density and pressure variations induced by the vortex cause the change in the propagation speed of the acoustic waves and the acoustic lensing property of the vortex.</description>

      <title>Generalized Four-momentum for Continuously Distributed Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A four-dimensional differential Euler-Lagrange equation for continuously distributed materials is derived based on the principle of least action, and instead of Lagrangian, this equation contains the Lagrangian density. This makes it possible to determine the density of generalized four-momentum in covariant form as derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to four-velocity of typical particles of a system taken with opposite sign, and then calculate the generalized four-momentum itself. It is shown that the generalized four-momentum of all typical particles of a system is an integral four-vector and therefore should be considered as a special type of four-vectors. The presented expression for generalized four-momentum exactly corresponds to the Legendre transformation connecting the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian. The obtained formulas are used to calculate generalized four-momentum of stationary and moving relativistic uniform systems for the Lagrangian with particles and vector fields, including electromagnetic and gravitational fields, acceleration field and pressure field. It turns out that the generalized four-momentum of a moving system depends on the total mass of particles, on the Lorentz factor and on the velocity of the systems center of momentum. Besides, an additional contribution is made by the scalar potentials of the acceleration field and the pressure field at the center of system. The direction of the generalized four-momentum coincides with the direction of four-velocity of the system under consideration, while the generalized four-momentum is part of the relativistic four-momentum of the system.</description>

      <title>On the Electromagnetic Mass Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a charged sphere moving at a constant velocity $v$ exhibits a mass due to electromagnetic radiation, expressed as $4/(3+(v/c)^2) (E/c^2)$, where $E$ is the electromagnetic energy and $c$ the speed of light in vacuum. Our finding reconciles the longstanding mismatch between the electromagnetic mass calculated from the classical electrodynamics' $4/3 (E/c^2)$ and the relativistic theory.</description>
