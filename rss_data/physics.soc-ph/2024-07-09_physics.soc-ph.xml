      <title>Multiplexity is temporal: effects of social times on network structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale social networks constructed using contact metadata have been invaluable tools for understanding and testing social theories of society-wide social structures. However, multiplex relationships explaining different social contexts have been out of reach of this methodology, limiting our ability to understand this crucial aspect of social systems. We propose a method that infers latent social times from the weekly activity of large-scale contact metadata, and reconstruct multilayer networks where layers correspond to social times. We then analyze the temporal multiplexity of ties in a society-wide communication network of millions of individuals. This allows us to test the propositions of Feld's social focus theory across a society-wide network: We show that ties favour their own social times regardless of contact intensity, suggesting they reflect underlying social foci. We present a result on strength of monoplex ties, which indicates that monoplex ties are bridging and even more important for global network connectivity than the weak, low-contact ties. Finally, we show that social times are transitive, so that when egos use a social time for a small subset of alters, the alters use the social time among themselves as well. Our framework opens up a way to analyse large-scale communication as multiplex networks and uncovers society-level patterns of multiplex connectivity.</description>

      <title>Minimum-regret hydrogen supply chain strategies to foster the energy transition of European hard-to-abate industries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-carbon hydrogen (H2) is envisioned to play a central role in decarbonizing European hard-to-abate industries, such as refineries, ammonia, methanol, steel, and cement. To enable its widespread use, H2 supply chain (HSC) infrastructure is required. Mature and economically viable low-carbon H2 production pathways include steam methane reforming (SMR) of natural gas coupled with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), water-electrolysis from renewable electricity, biomethane reforming, and biomass gasification. However, uncertainties surrounding demand and feedstock availabilities hamper their proliferation. Here, we investigate the impact of uncertainty in H2 demand and biomass availability on the optimal HSC design. The HSC is modeled as a network of H2 production and consumption sites that are interconnected with H2 and biomass transport technologies. A CCS supply chain is modeled alongside the HSC. The cost-optimal HSC design is determined based on a linear optimization problem that considers a regional resolution and a multi-year time horizon (2022-2050). We adopt a scenario-based uncertainty quantification approach and define discrete H2 demand and biomass availability scenarios. Applying a minimum-regret strategy, we show that sufficiently large low-carbon H2 production capacities (about 9.6 Mt/a by 2030) are essential to flexibly scale up HSCs and accommodate H2 demands of up to 35 Mt/a by 2050. While biomass-based H2 production emerges as the most cost-efficient low-carbon H2 production pathway, investments are not recommended unless the availability of biomass feedstocks is guaranteed. Instead, investments in SMR-CCS and electrolysis often offer greater flexibility. In addition, we highlight the importance of CCS infrastructure, which is required across scenarios.</description>

      <title>Design of a multisensory planetarium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and the prototype of a multisensory planetarium. The goal of this project is to offer a common perceptual and cognitive framework to all users, both sighted, deaf, and blind or visually impaired, concerning the experience of observing the night sky, but also to provide all equal access to scientific data regarding the observed objects, going beyond what can be sensed. The planetarium will consist of a Plexiglas hemisphere on which stars up to the fourth magnitude are represented by a brass bar that, when touched, activates visual, haptic, and acoustic stimuli. We mapped the magnitude of stars on acoustic and visual stimuli, while the distance of the star from us is mapped on a vibration. All the stimuli have been evaluated in pilot experiments using Plexiglas tablets representing some constellations, to assess their usability, intelligibility, and consistency with possible intuitive interpretations.</description>

      <title>Energy and environmental impacts of air-to-air heat pumps in a mid-latitude city</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat pumps (HPs) have emerged as a key technology for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. This study evaluates the potential switch to air-to-air HPs (AAHPs) in Toulouse, France, where conventional space heating is split between electric and gas sources. In this context, we find that AAHPs reduce heating energy consumption by 57% to 76%, with electric heating energy consumption decreasing by 6% to 47%, resulting in virtually no local heating-related CO$_{2}$ emissions. We observe a slight reduction in near-surface air temperature of up to 0.5 {\deg}C during cold spells, attributable to a reduction in sensible heat flux, which is unlikely to compromise AAHPs operational efficiency. While Toulouse's heating energy mix facilitates large energy savings, electric energy consumption may increase in cities where gas or other fossil fuel sources prevail. Furthermore, as AAHPs efficiency varies with internal and external conditions, their impact on the electrical grid is more complex than conventional heating systems. The results underscore the importance of matching heating system transitions with sustainable electricity generation to maximize environmental benefits. The study highlights the intricate balance between technological advancements in heating and their broader environmental and policy implications, offering key insights for urban energy policy and sustainability efforts.</description>

      <title>Inter-city infections and the role of size heterogeneity in containment strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effectiveness of regional lockdown strategies to mitigate the spread of a pathogen across regional units, in the following called cities, within a country or region for a single infection wave. The heterogeneity in the epidemically relevant connectivity is defined via a random network model with cities as nodes, where the city's sizes determine their connectivity via a gravity type kernel function. Isolation of a whole city is initiated when infection numbers surpass defined thresholds. We consider two basic strategies for the lockdowns. Strategy~$(P)$ isolates cities based on a proportional threshold of infections, while stra\-tegy~\((U)\) uses a uniform infection threshold for all cities. Given the heavy-tailed distribution of city sizes, strategy \((P)\) can potentially result in more secondary infections from larger cities than strategy \((U)\). As an efficiency measure we use the ratio of individuals under lockdown and the number of infected individuals. Additionally, we analytically derive formulas for the basic reproduction numbers and prevalences. Our model is fitted to mobility data from France, Japan, and Poland, and validated through simulations. The findings indicate that while the model aligns well with data from France and Poland, it deviates in Japan, highlighting the importance of geographical nuances in pathogen spread modeling. Furthermore, it suggests that for France (and Japan) both strategies perform equally well, while for Poland strategy \((U)\) outperforms strategy \((P)\).</description>

      <title>Connectivity Aware and Energy Efficient Self-Organizing Distributed IoT Topology Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things has pervaded every area of modern life. From a research and industry standpoint, there has been an increasing demand and desire in recent years to develop Internet of Things networks with distributed structure. Wireless communication under emergency circumstances is one of the important applications that distributed Internet of Things can have. In order for a network to be functional in this scenario, it must be developed without the aid of a pre-established or centralized structure and operated in a self-organized manner to accommodate the communication requirements of the time. Although the design and development of such networks can be highly advantageous, they frequently confront difficulties, the most significant of which is attaining and maintaining effective connectivity to have reliable communications despite the requirement to optimize energy usage. In this study, we present a model for self-organizing topology control for ad hoc-based Internet of Things networks that can address the aforementioned challenges. The model that will be presented employs the notion of the Hamiltonian function in classical mechanics and has two key objectives: regulating the network's topology and dynamics to enhance connectivity to a desirable level while requiring the least amount of energy possible. The results of the simulation indicate that the proposed model satisfactorily fulfills the goals of the problem.</description>
