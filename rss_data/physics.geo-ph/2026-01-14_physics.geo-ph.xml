      <title>Large earthquakes follow highly unequal ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was conjectured for a long time that the tectonic plates are in a self-organized state of criticality and that the Gutenberg-Richter (power) law is a manifestation of that. It was recently shown that for a system near criticality, the inequality of their responses toward external driving could indicate proximity to the critical point. In this work, we show with numerical simulations and seismic data analysis that large earthquake events have a tendency to follow events that are highly unequal. We have applied this framework to various tectonically active regions, such as North America, Southern Japan, parts of South-East Asia and Indonesia.</description>

      <title>Collapse of statistical equilibrium in large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At scales larger than the forcing scale, some out-of-equilibrium turbulent systems (such as hydrodynamic turbulence, wave turbulence, and nonlinear optics) exhibit a state of statistical equilibrium where energy is equipartitioned among large-scale modes, in line with the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Key open questions now pertain to either the emergence, decay, collapse, or other nonstationary evolutions from this state. Here, we experimentally investigate the free decay of large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves, initially in a regime of statistical equilibrium. Using space- and time-resolved measurements, we show that the total energy of these large-scale tensional waves decays as a power law in time. We derive an energy decay law from the theoretical initial equilibrium spectrum and the linear viscous damping, as no net energy flux is carried. Our prediction then shows a good agreement with experimental data over nearly two decades in time, for various initial effective temperatures of the statistical equilibrium state. We further identify the dissipation mechanism and confirm it experimentally. Our approach could be applied to other decaying turbulence systems, with the large scales initially in statistical equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spherical dynamos exhibiting a small-scale MAC balance</title>

Abstract: Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</description>

      <title>A Model of UV-Blue Absorbance in Bulk Liquid of Venusian Cloud Aerosols Is Consistent with Efficient Organic Absorbers at High Concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At visible wavelengths, Venus appears serene and pale-yellow, but since the 1920s, observers have noted high-contrast features in the ultraviolet. These features track the about 4-day superrotation of the upper cloud deck and vary widely over time and space. The identity of the UV absorber(s), active between at least 280 and 500 nm, remains unknown, as no proposed candidate fully matches all observational data. From remote observations of Venus, and accounting for light scattering by sub-micrometer droplets, we modeled the 365-455 nm absorbance per cm of the bulk liquids forming Venus's clouds. Assuming a uniform distribution in mode 1 and 2 particles across a 6 km layer below the cloud top at 65 km, we constrain the bulk absorbance with a peak at A375 nm is 2942 per cm. This extremely high absorbance implies the presence of a highly efficient absorber, for example, conjugated organics, at relatively high concentration, e.g., approx. 25 g/L for porphyrin-type pigments with molar absorption coefficient of approx. 100,000 per mole per cm. Inorganic absorbers, typically below 10,000 per mole per cm, would either need to constitute a large portion of the aerosols or still not be sufficiently light-absorbing, even in pure form. We emphasize that all candidate absorbers must be evaluated against Venus's reflectance curve using (i) known molar absorption coefficients, (ii) realistic atmospheric distributions, and (iii) appropriate particle size distributions. The upcoming Rocket Lab mission will test the hypothesis of organics in Venus's clouds.</description>
