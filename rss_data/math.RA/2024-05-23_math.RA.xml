      <title>A classification of automorphic Lie algebras on complex tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the automorphic Lie algebras of equivariant maps from a complex torus to $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$. For each case we compute a basis in a normal form. The automorphic Lie algebras correspond precisely to two disjoint families of Lie algebras parametrised by the modular curve of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, apart from four cases, which are all isomorphic to Onsager's algebra.</description>

      <title>Groups of singular alternating sign matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate multiplicative groups consisting entirely of singular alternating sign matrices (ASMs), and present several constructions of such groups. It is shown that every finite group is isomorphic to a group of singular ASMs, with a singular idempotent ASM as its identity element. The relationship between the size, the rank, and the possible multiplicative orders of singular ASMs is explored.</description>

      <title>Partial actions of inverse categories and their algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce partial and global actions of inverse categories on posets in two variants, fibred actions and actions by symmetries. We study in detail actions of an inverse category $\mathcal{C}$ on specific subposets of the poset of finite subsets of $\mathcal{C}$, the Bernoulli actions. We show that to each fibred action of an inverse category on a poset there corresponds another inverse category, the semidirect product associated to the action. The Bernoulli actions give rise to the Szendrei expansions of $\mathcal{C}$, which define a endofunctor of the category of inverse categories. We extend the concept of enlargement from inverse semigroup theory to, and we show that if $\mathcal{D}$ is an enlargement of $\mathcal{C}$ then their Cauchy completions are equivalent categories; in particular, some pairs corresponding to partial and global Bernoulli actions are enlargements. We conclude by studying convolution algebras of finite inverse categories and showing that if $\mathcal{D}$ is an enlargement of $\mathcal{C}$ then their convolution algebras are Morita equivalent. Furthermore, using Kan extensions we also analyze the infinite case.</description>

      <title>Towards a refinement of the Bloch-Kato conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rost and Voevodsky proved the Bloch-Kato conjecture relating Milnor $k$-theory and Galois cohomology. Their result implies that for a field $F$ containing a primitive $p$th root of unity, the Galois cohomology ring of $F$ with $\mathbb{F}_p$ coefficients is generated by elements of degree 1 as an $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra. Therefore, for a given Galois extension $K/F$ and an element $\alpha$ in $H^*(\text{Gal}(K/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ there exits a Galois extension $L/F$ containing $K/F$ such that the inflation of $\alpha$ in $H^*(\text{Gal}(L/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ belongs to an $\mathbb{F}_p$-subalgebra of $H^*(\text{Gal}(L/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ generated by $1$-dimensional classes. It is interesting to find relatively small explicit Galois extensions $L/F$ with the above property for a given $\alpha$ in $H^*(\text{Gal}(K/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ as above. In this paper, we provide some answers to this question for cohomology classes in degree two, thus setting the first step toward refining the Bloch-Kato conjecture. We illustrate this refinement by explicitly computing the cohomology rings of superpythagorean and $p$-rigid fields. Additionally, as a byproduct of our work, we characterize elementary abelian $2$-groups as the only finite $p$-groups whose mod-$p$ cohomology ring is generated by degree-one elements. This provides additional motivation for studying refinements of the Bloch-Kato conjecture and exploring the connections between group cohomology and Galois theory.</description>

      <title>The Ziegler spectrum for enriched ringoids and schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ziegler spectrum for categories enriched in closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck categories is defined and studied in this paper. It recovers the classical Ziegler spectrum of a ring. As an application, the Ziegler spectrum as well as the category of generalised quasi-coherent sheaves of a reasonable scheme is introduced and studied. It is shown that there is a closed embedding of the injective spectrum of a coherent scheme endowed with the tensor fl-topology (respectively of a noetherian scheme endowed with the dual Zariski topology) into its Ziegler spectrum. It is also shown that quasi-coherent sheaves and generalised quasi-coherent sheaves are related to each other by a recollement.</description>

Abstract: A complete description of all possible multiplicative groups of finite skew left braces whose additive group has trivial centre is shown. As a consequence, some earlier results of Tsang can be improved and an answer to an open question set by Tsang at Ischia Group Theory 2024 Conference is provided.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture as a first-order formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ be a (reduced) root system. Let $\mathsf{k}$ be an algebraically closed field of zero characteristic, and consider the corresponding semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathsf{k}, \Sigma}$. Then there is a first-order sentence $\phi_\Sigma$ in the language $\mathcal{L}=(1,0,+,*,-)$ of rings such that, for any algebraically closed field $\mathsf{k}$ of characteristic 0, the validity of the Gelfand-Kirillov Conjecture for $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathsf{k}, \Sigma}$ is equivalent to $ACF_0 \vdash \phi_\Sigma$.</description>

      <title>Tropical friezes and cluster-additive functions via Fock-Goncharov duality and a conjecture of Ringel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tropical friezes and cluster-additive functions associated to symmetrizable generalized Cartan matrices in the framework of Fock-Goncharov duality in cluster algebras. In particular, we generalize and prove a conjecture of C. M. Ringel on cluster-additive functions associated to arbitrary Cartan matrices of finite type. For a Fock-Goncharov dual pair of positive spaces of finite type, we use tropical friezes and cluster-additive functions to explicitly express the Fock-Goncharov pairing between their tropical points and the bijections between global monomials on one and tropical points of the other.</description>

      <title>Global Representation Ring and Knutson Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18498v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global representation rings were discovered by Sarah Witherspoon in 1995 and the Knutson Index was introduced by the second author in 2022. In the present paper we introduce the Knutson Index for general commutative rings and study it for Burnside rings and global representation rings. We also introduce the global table of a finite group, that encompasses both the character table and the Burnside table of marks. We discuss what properties of a group can be recovered from its global table.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative differential geometry on crossed product algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a differential structure on arbitrary cleft extensions $B:=A^{\mathrm{co}H}\subseteq A$ for an $H$-comodule algebra $A$. This is achieved by constructing a covariant calculus on the corresponding crossed product algebra $B\#_\sigma H$ from the data of a bicovariant calculus on the structure Hopf algebra $H$ and a calculus on the base algebra $B$, which is compatible with the $2$-cocycle and measure of the crossed product. The result is a quantum principal bundle with canonical strong connection and we describe the induced bimodule covariant derivatives on associated bundles of the crossed product. It is proven that connections of the quantum principal bundle are in bijection with connection $1$-forms. All results specialize to trivial extensions and smash product algebras $B\#H$ and we give a characterization of the smash product calculus in terms of the differentials of the cleaving map $j\colon H\to A$ and the inclusion $B\hookrightarrow A$. The construction is exemplified for pointed Hopf algebras. In particular, the case of Radford Hopf algebras $H_{(r,n,q)}$ is spelled out in detail.</description>
