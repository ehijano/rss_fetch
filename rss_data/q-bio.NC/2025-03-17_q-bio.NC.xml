      <title>Optimal Transport for Brain-Image Alignment: Unveiling Redundancy and Synergy in Neural Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is inspired by the structure of the human brain, and in turn, ANNs offer a potential means to interpret and understand brain signals. Existing methods primarily align brain signals with real-world signals using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which solely focuses on local point-wise alignment, and ignores global matching, leading to coarse interpretations and inaccuracies in brain signal decoding.
  In this paper, we address these issues through optimal transport (OT) and theoretically demonstrate why OT provides a more effective alignment strategy than MSE. Specifically, we construct a transport plan between brain voxel embeddings and image embeddings, enabling more precise matching. By controlling the amount of transport, we mitigate the influence of redundant information. We apply our alignment model directly to the Brain Captioning task by feeding brain siginals into a large language model (LLM) instead of images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten evaluation metrics, surpassing the previous best method by an average of 6.11\% in single-subject training and 3.81\% in cross-subject training. Additionally, we have uncovered several insightful conclusions that align with existing brain research. We unveil the redundancy and synergy of brain information processing through region masking and data dimensionality reduction visualization experiments. We believe our approach paves the way for a more precise understanding of brain signals in the future. The code is available soon.</description>

      <title>Auto-Associative Memories for Direct Signalling of Visual Angle During Object Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being hit by a ball is usually not a pleasant experience. While a ball may not be fatal, other objects can be. To protect themselves, many organisms, from humans to insects, have developed neuronal mechanisms to signal approaching objects such as predators and obstacles. The study of these neuronal circuits is still ongoing, both experimentally and theoretically. Many computational proposals rely on temporal contrast integration, as it encodes how the visual angle of an approaching object changes with time. However, mechanisms based on contrast integration are severely limited when the observer is also moving, as it is difficult to distinguish the background-induced temporal contrast from that of an approaching object. Here, I present results of a new mechanism for signaling object approaches, based on modern content-addressable (auto-associative) memories. Auto-associative memories were first proposed by Hopfield in 1982, and are a class of simple neuronal networks which transform incomplete or noisy input patterns to complete and noise-free output patterns. The memory holds different sizes of a generic pattern template that is efficient for segregating an approaching object from irrelevant background motion. Therefore, the model's output correlates directly with angular size. Generally, the new mechanism performs on a par with previously published models. The overall performance was systematically evaluated based on the network's responses to artificial and real-world video footage.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Categorical Restructuring large Or How AIs Gradually Extract Efficient Regularities from Their Experience of the World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do language models segment their internal experience of the world of words to progressively learn to interact with it more efficiently? This study in the neuropsychology of artificial intelligence investigates the phenomenon of synthetic categorical restructuring, a process through which each successive perceptron neural layer abstracts and combines relevant categorical sub-dimensions from the thought categories of its previous layer. This process shapes new, even more efficient categories for analyzing and processing the synthetic system's own experience of the linguistic external world to which it is exposed. Our genetic neuron viewer, associated with this study, allows visualization of the synthetic categorical restructuring phenomenon occurring during the transition from perceptron layer 0 to 1 in GPT2-XL.</description>

      <title>OPTIMUS: Predicting Multivariate Outcomes in Alzheimer's Disease Using Multi-modal Data amidst Missing Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with neural, genetic, and proteomic factors while affecting multiple cognitive and behavioral faculties. Traditional AD prediction largely focuses on univariate disease outcomes, such as disease stages and severity. Multimodal data encode broader disease information than a single modality and may, therefore, improve disease prediction; but they often contain missing values. Recent "deeper" machine learning approaches show promise in improving prediction accuracy, yet the biological relevance of these models needs to be further charted. Integrating missing data analysis, predictive modeling, multimodal data analysis, and explainable AI, we propose OPTIMUS, a predictive, modular, and explainable machine learning framework, to unveil the many-to-many predictive pathways between multimodal input data and multivariate disease outcomes amidst missing values. OPTIMUS first applies modality-specific imputation to uncover data from each modality while optimizing overall prediction accuracy. It then maps multimodal biomarkers to multivariate outcomes using machine-learning and extracts biomarkers respectively predictive of each outcome. Finally, OPTIMUS incorporates XAI to explain the identified multimodal biomarkers. Using data from 346 cognitively normal subjects, 608 persons with mild cognitive impairment, and 251 AD patients, OPTIMUS identifies neural and transcriptomic signatures that jointly but differentially predict multivariate outcomes related to executive function, language, memory, and visuospatial function. Our work demonstrates the potential of building a predictive and biologically explainable machine-learning framework to uncover multimodal biomarkers that capture disease profiles across varying cognitive landscapes. The results improve our understanding of the complex many-to-many pathways in AD.</description>

      <title>System 0/1/2/3: Quad-process theory for multi-timescale embodied collective cognitive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.</description>
