      <title>Microwave-field quantum metrology with error correction enabled by Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing and metrology present one of the most promising near-term applications in the field of quantum technologies, with quantum sensors enabling unprecedented precision in measurements of electric, magnetic or gravitational fields and displacements. Experimental loss at the detection stage remains one of the key obstacles to achieve a truly quantum advantage in many practical scenarios. Here we combine capabilities of Rydberg atoms to both sense external fields and to be used for quantum information processing to largely overcome the issue of detection losses. While using the large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms in an ensemble to achieve a $39\ \mathrm{nV}/\mathrm{cm}\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity we employ the inter-atomic dipolar interactions to execute an error-correction protocol, that protects sensing information against conventional losses at the detection stage. Counterintuitively, the idea of the protocol is based on introduction of additional non-linear lossy quantum channel, which results in enhancement of Fisher information by a factor of 3.3. The presented results open up a path towards broader usage of quantum-information-inspired error correction in practical quantum metrology and communication, without the need for a general-purpose quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Towards an experimental implementation of entanglement harvesting in superconducting circuits: effect of detector gap variation on entanglement harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the prospect of experimental implementations of entanglement harvesting in superconducting circuits, we propose a model of variable-gap particle detector that aims to bridge some of the gaps between Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) models and realistic implementations. Using parameters tailored to potential experimental setups, we investigate entanglement harvesting in both spacelike-separated and causally connected scenarios. Our findings reveal that while variations in the energy gap reduce the ability to harvest entanglement for spacelike-separated detectors, detectors in causal contact can still become entangled through their interaction with the field. Notably, our analysis shows that (due to the derivative coupling nature of the model) even for causally connected detectors, the entanglement primarily originates from the field's correlations. This demonstrates the potential for genuine entanglement harvesting in the lab and opens the door to near-future entanglement harvesting experiments in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Chirality-bolstered quantum Zeno effect enhances radical pair-based magnetoreception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radical pairs in the flavoprotein cryptochrome are central to various magnetically sensitive biological processes, including the proposed mechanism of avian magnetoreception. Cryptochrome's molecular chirality has been hypothesized to enhance magnetic field effects via the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, yet the mechanism underlying this enhancement remains unresolved. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of CISS on the directional magnetic sensitivity of prototypical radical pair reactions, analyzing two distinct models--one generating spin polarization and, for the first time, one generating coherence. We find that CISS-induced spin polarization significantly enhances magnetic sensitivity by introducing triplet character into the initial state and reinforcing the quantum Zeno effect, paralleling enhancements observed in triplet-born radical pairs subject to strongly asymmetric recombination. In contrast, CISS-generated spin coherence does not provide a significant improvement in sensitivity. These findings indicate that CISS is not itself a universal enhancer of sensitivity or coherence in radical-pair reactions, and its influence must be evaluated case by case, particularly in relation to the quantum Zeno effect. Additionally, we provide a unified interpolation scheme for modeling CISS-influenced initial states and recombination dynamics, encompassing the principal models currently discussed in the literature for singlet and triplet precursors.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation with sum-of-squares spectral amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present sum-of-squares spectral amplification (SOSSA), a framework for improving quantum simulation relevant to low-energy problems. We show how SOSSA can be applied to problems like energy and phase estimation and provide fast quantum algorithms for these problems that significantly improve over prior art. To illustrate the power of SOSSA in applications, we consider the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, a representative strongly correlated system, and demonstrate asymptotic speedups over generic simulation methods by a factor of the square root of the system size. Our results reinforce those observed in [G.H. Low \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2502.15882 (2025)], where SOSSA was used to achieve state-of-the-art gate costs for phase estimation of real-world quantum chemistry systems.</description>

      <title>Boomerang quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the emergence of the quantum boomerang effect in discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) subjected to random phase disorder. Our analysis shows that this effect can arise solely from the intrinsic momentum dynamics of the DTQW, without requiring external bias or asymmetry. We explore the evolution of the mean position of the quantum walker, denoted as $\overline{X}(t)$, under various initial conditions of the walker and quantum coin operators. The results indicate a significant dependence of the observed phenomena on the choice of initial state, enabling the selective induction of the quantum boomerang effect in both or only one portion of the wavepacket associated with specific internal states. By varying the quantum coin parameter $\theta$, we find that the maximum mean position follows a power-law decay near the Pauli-Z coin, characterized by $X_{\text{Max}} \sim \theta^{-2}$. Additionally, we identify a scaling behavior $X_{\text{Max}} \sim W^{-2}$, which is consistent with the localization length observed in disordered quantum systems. Such a selective nature of the boomerang effect related to internal states reveals valuable insights for controlling quantum transport, which could lead to applications in quantum state management, spatial separation of quantum information carriers, and targeted information retrieval.</description>

      <title>Entropy-based analysis of single-qubit Otto and Carnot heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From an entropy-based formulation of the first law of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, we investigate the performance of Otto-like and Carnot-like engines for a single-qubit working medium. Within this framework, the first law includes an additional contribution -- coherence work -- that quantifies the energetic cost of deviating the quantum trajectory from its natural unitary evolution. We focus on the efficiency of the heat-to-coherence work conversion and show that the Carnot cycle achieves the classical Carnot efficiency, while the performance of the Otto cycle is upper-bounded by the Carnot efficiency corresponding to the extreme temperatures of the cycle. We identify entropy generation during the isochoric stages as the key source of irreversibility limiting the Otto cycle's efficiency.</description>

      <title>Information-acquiring von Neumann architecture of a computer: Functionality and subjectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design the information-acquiring von Neumann architecture of a computer in a fine-grained or coarse-grained model, where information is carried by classical bits. This architecture can proceed both a Hamiltonian process converting a given input pure state to another output pure state of the system to be considered (functionality) and a physical process to acquire information (subjectivity). The latter process is identified with the projection hypothesis in projective quantum measurement in the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>A low-loss, 24-mode laser-written universal photonic processor in a glass-based platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the fabrication of the first 24-mode universal photonic processor (UPP) realized through femtosecond laser writing (FLW), marking the most complex UPP demonstrated to date. Optimized for quantum dot emission at 925 nm, the device exhibits total insertion losses averaging only 4.35 dB, enabling its direct application in advanced multi-photon quantum experiments. Leveraging the versatility of FLW, we introduce suspended waveguides and precisely engineered 2D and 3D microstructures, significantly enhancing thermal isolation and minimizing power dissipation. As a result, our processor operates efficiently at less than 10 W, requiring only a simple thermo-electric cooler for stable thermal management. The device exhibits exceptional performance after calibration, implementing Haar-random unitary transformations with an amplitude fidelity of 99.5 %. This work establishes FLW-based integrated photonics as a scalable and robust platform for advancing quantum computing, communication, and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Assisted Vehicle Routing: Realizing QAOA-based Approach on Gate-Based Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a crucial optimization challenge with significant economic and environmental implications, particularly in logistics and transportation planning. While classical algorithms struggle to efficiently solve large-scale instances of VRP due to its combinatorial complexity, quantum computing presents a promising alternative for tackling such problems. In this work, we explore the application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve instances of VRP, analyzing its effectiveness and scalability. We formulate VRP as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem by encoding the constraints into a single cost function suitable for QAOA. Our study investigates the impact of problem size on quantum circuit complexity and evaluate the feasibility of executing QAOA-based VRP solutions on near-term quantum hardware. The results indicate that while QAOA demonstrates potential for solving VRP, the primary limitation lies in circuit depth and noise-induced errors, which critically affect performance on current quantum processors. Overcoming these challenges will require advancements in error mitigation techniques and more efficient quantum circuit designs to realize the full potential of quantum computing for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Divide-and-Conquer Simulation of Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the promises of quantum computing is to simulate physical systems efficiently. However, the simulation of open quantum systems - where interactions with the environment play a crucial role - remains challenging for quantum computing, as it is impossible to implement deterministically non-unitary operators on a quantum computer without auxiliary qubits. The Stinespring dilation can simulate an open dynamic but requires a high circuit depth, which is impractical for NISQ devices. An alternative approach is parallel probabilistic block-encoding methods, such as the Sz.-Nagy and Singular Value Decomposition dilations. These methods result in shallower circuits but are hybrid methods, and we do not simulate the quantum dynamic on the quantum computer. In this work, we describe a divide-and-conquer strategy for preparing mixed states to combine the output of each Kraus operator dilation and obtain the complete dynamic on quantum hardware with a lower circuit depth. The work also introduces a balanced strategy that groups the original Kraus operators into an expanded operator, leading to a trade-off between circuit depth, CNOT count, and number of qubits. We perform a computational analysis to demonstrate the advantages of the new method and present a proof-of-concept simulation of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson dynamic on current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup for Hypergraph Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph sparsification serves as a foundation for many algorithms, such as approximation algorithms for graph cuts and Laplacian system solvers. As its natural generalization, hypergraph sparsification has recently gained increasing attention, with broad applications in graph machine learning and other areas. In this work, we propose the first quantum algorithm for hypergraph sparsification, addressing an open problem proposed by Apers and de Wolf (FOCS'20). For a weighted hypergraph with $n$ vertices, $m$ hyperedges, and rank $r$, our algorithm outputs a near-linear size $\varepsilon$-spectral sparsifier in time $\widetilde O(r\sqrt{mn}/\varepsilon)$. This algorithm matches the quantum lower bound for constant $r$ and demonstrates quantum speedup when compared with the state-of-the-art $\widetilde O(mr)$-time classical algorithm. As applications, our algorithm implies quantum speedups for computing hypergraph cut sparsifiers, approximating hypergraph mincuts and hypergraph $s$-$t$ mincuts.</description>

      <title>The construction of a universal quantum gate set for the SU(2)k anyon models via a numerical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematic study numerical method into constructing a universal quantum gate set for topological quantum computation using SU(2)k anyon models. The values of F-symbols and R-symbols were computed through the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2), enabling precise determination of elementary braiding matrices (EBMs) for SU(2)k anyon systems. Quantum gates were subsequently derived from these EBMs through systematic implementations. One-qubit gates were synthesized using a genetic algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), while two-qubit gates were constructed through brute-force search or GA optimization to approximate local equivalence classes of the CNOT gate. Implementing this framework for SU(2)5, SU(2)6, and SU(2)7 models successfully generated the canonical universal gate set {H-gate, T-gate, CNOT-gate}. Comparative benchmarking against the Fibonacci anyon model demonstrated that SU(2)5,6,7 implementations achieve comparable or superior fidelity in gate construction. These numerical results provide conclusive verification of the universal quantum computation capabilities inherent in SU(2)k anyon models. Furthermore, we get exact implementations of the local equivalence class [SWAP] using nine EBMs in each SU(2)5, SU(2)6, and SU(2)7 configuration.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-energy teleportation (QET) has so far only been realised on a two-qubit platform. Real-world communication, however, typically involves multiple parties. Here we design and experimentally demonstrate the first multi-qubit QET protocol using a robust W-state multipartite entanglement. Three-, four- and five-qubit circuits were executed both on noiseless simulators and on IBM superconducting hardware. In every case a single sender injects an energy E0 that is then deterministically and decrementally harvested by several remote receivers, confirming that energy introduced at one node can be redistributed among many entangled subsystems at light-speed-limited classical latency. Our results open a practical route toward energy-aware quantum networks.</description>

      <title>MolQAE: Quantum Autoencoder for Molecular Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Quantum Molecular Autoencoder, a novel approach that integrates quantum computing with molecular representation learning. While conventional molecular representation methods face computational bottlenecks when processing high-dimensional data, quantum computing offers a promising alternative through its inherent parallelism and quantum superposition properties. We present a quantum circuit-based autoencoder architecture that maps SMILES molecular representations into quantum state space, employs parameterized quantum circuits for dimensional reduction, and utilizes SWAP tests to evaluate encoding quality. Theoretically, our approach preserves essential molecular features in exponentially smaller spaces while maintaining similarity relationships between molecules. Experimental results demonstrate that quantum autoencoders effectively capture molecular structures and chemical properties. The proposed framework not only establishes a quantum pathway for molecular representation learning but also opens new possibilities for applications in drug discovery and materials design. As the first investigation at the intersection of molecular representation learning and quantum computing, this research lays both theoretical and practical foundations for the advancement of cheminformatics.</description>

      <title>Interference in complex canonical variables is not quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formally represent the quantum interference of a single qubit embodied by a photon in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer using the classical Hamiltonian framework but with complex canonical variables. Although all operations on a single qubit can be formally expressed using the complex classical Hamiltonian dynamics, we show that the resulting system is still not a proper qubit. The reason is that it is not capable of getting entangled to another bona fide qubit and hence it does not have the information-processing capacity of a fully-fledged quantum system. This simple example powerfully illustrates the failure of all hybrid quantum-classical models in accounting for the full range of behaviour of even a single quantum bit.</description>

Abstract: Quantum states of light with many entangled photons are key resources for photonic quantum computing and quantum communication. In this work, we exploit a highly resource-efficient generation scheme based on a linear optical circuit embedding a fibered delay loop acting as a quantum memory. The single photons are generated with a bright single-photon source based on a semiconductor quantum dot, allowing to perform the entangling scheme up to 6 photons. We demonstrate $2$, $3$, $4$ and $6$-photon entanglement generation at respective rates of $6$kHz, $120$Hz, $2.2$Hz, and $2$mHz, corresponding to an average scaling ratio of $46$. We introduce a method for real-time control of entanglement generation based on partially post-selected measurements. The visibility of such measurements carries faithful information to monitor the entanglement process, an important feature for the practical implementation of photonic measurement-based quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-body Simulations from a Reinforcement-Learned Exponential Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving for the many-body wavefunction represents a significant challenge on both classical and quantum devices because of the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with system size. While the complexity of the wavefunction can be reduced through conventional ans\"{a}tze (e.g., the coupled cluster ansatz), it can still grow rapidly with system size even on quantum devices. An exact, universal two-body exponential ansatz for the many-body wavefunction has been shown to be generated from the solution of the contracted Schr\"odinger equation (CSE), and recently, this ansatz has been implemented without classical approximation on quantum simulators and devices for the scalable simulation of many-body quantum systems. Here we combine the solution of the CSE with a form of artificial intelligence known as reinforcement learning (RL) to generate highly compact circuits that implement this ansatz without sacrificing accuracy. As a natural extension of CSE, we reformulate the wavefunction update as a Markovian decision process and train the agent to select the optimal actions at each iteration based upon only the current CSE residual. Compact circuits with high accuracy are achieved for H3 and H4 molecules over a range of molecular geometries.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Mechanical Wigner Negativity via Nonlinear Cavity Quantum Optomechanics in the Unresolved-Sideband Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, it is commonly held that deterministic preparation of mechanical Wigner negativity in the unresolved-sideband regime is not possible, as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this, by accounting for the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.</description>

      <title>Generation of 95-qubit genuine entanglement and verification of symmetry-protected topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are fundamental features of cluster states, serving as key resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). Generating large-scale cluster states and verifying their SPT phases are essential steps toward practical MBQC, which however still presents significant experimental challenges. In this work, we address these challenges by utilizing advanced superconducting hardware with optimized gate operations, enhanced readout fidelity, and error mitigation techniques. We successfully generate and verify 95-qubit one-dimensional and 72-qubit two-dimensional genuine entangled cluster states, achieving fidelities of $0.5603 \pm 0.0084$ and $0.5519 \pm 0.0054$, respectively. Leveraging these high-fidelity cluster states, we investigate SPT phases through quantum teleportation across all 95 qubits and demonstrate input-state-dependent robustness against symmetry-breaking perturbations, highlighting the practicality and intrinsic robustness of MBQC enabled by the SPT order. Our results represent a significant advancement in large-scale entanglement generation and topological phase simulation, laying the foundation for scalable and practical MBQC using superconducting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Quantum Mpemba Effect in Isolated System by Initial State Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in isolated, non-integrable quantum systems, where relaxation dynamics depend on structure of the initial states. By analyzing the distribution of initial states across symmetrical subspaces, we identify a tunable mechanism that influences the emergence of QME, showing faster relaxation from certain out-of-equilibrium states. Additionally, we propose an experimentally realizable quantum circuit, which requires no complex controls on quantum simulator platforms and serves to verify our theoretical predictions. These results establish symmetry-resolved state engineering as a practical tool for manipulating non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Neural-network-based design and implementation of fast and robust quantum gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a continuous-time, neural-network-based approach to optimal control in quantum systems, with a focus on pulse engineering for quantum gates. Leveraging the framework of neural ordinary differential equations, we construct control fields as outputs of trainable neural networks, thereby eliminating the need for discrete parametrization or predefined bases. This allows for generation of smooth, hardware-agnostic pulses that can be optimized directly using differentiable integrators. As a case study we design, and implement experimentally, a short and detuning-robust $\pi/2$ pulse for photon parity measurements in superconducting transmon circuits. This is achieved through simultaneous optimization for robustness and suppressing the leakage outside of the computational basis. These pulses maintain a fidelity greater than $99.9\%$ over a detuning range of $\approx \pm 20\mathrm{MHz}$, thereby outperforming traditional techniques while retaining comparable gate durations. This showcases its potential for high-performance quantum control in experimentally relevant settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transduction: Enabling Quantum Networking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and storage impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum nodes for scalable and fast quantum computing is the superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. Whereas, for communicating at distances of practical interest beyond few meters, quantum links operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow the interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as quantum transducer, able to convert one type of qubit to another is required. In this paper, we analyse the quantum transduction from a communication perspective, by shedding the light on its fundamental role within quantum network design and deployment. This analysis reveals that there exist different types of transduction, including the one allowing a transducer to act as entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in the communication performances. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.</description>

      <title>Robustness Enhancement of Universal Noncyclic Geometric Gates via Evolution Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of nonadiabatic noncyclic geometric quantum computation (NNGQC) breaks the constraint of cyclic conditions and allows the system to evolve on acyclic paths, which greatly extends the possibilities of quantum computation. By precisely controlling the evolution of quantum parameters along the acyclic path of the Bloch sphere, NNGQC is able to realize quantum logic gates under non-adiabatic conditions, which not only improves the speed of the operation, but also increases the path degrees of freedom, providing more operational flexibility and robustness for quantum computation. However, past work on NNGQC has not given a universal solution for different gate constructions, meanwhile due to the inability to optionally avoid some trajectory segments seriously affected by systematic errors, the performance of arbitrary geometric gate is still unsatisfactory. Here we give the general scheme of NNGQC, and also summarize the optimal gate construction corresponding to different schemes, and it is worth mentioning that we creatively introduce the universal robust control. Numerical simulations verifies that it is perfectly compatible with all types of noise terms and outperforms the transmission dynamic gates and quantum logic gates in the NGQC framework in terms of gate fidelity and robustness performance. Thus, our scheme can give the ideal quantum gate construction under noncyclic conditions, which sheds light on future large-scale quantum computation.</description>

      <title>R\'{e}nyi Markov length in one-dimensional non-trivial mixed state phases and mixed state phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering and classifying non-trivial mixed states and mixed state phase transitions are some of the most important current issues in condensed matter and quantum information. In this study, we investigate some non-trivial mixed states and phase transitions between them by using the second R\'{e}nyi conditional mutual information (CMI). The CMI can measure mixed state ``gap'', estimated by the exponential decay rate of the second R\'{e}nyi CMI under a tripartition of system, which provides the second R\'{e}nyi version of the Markov length. We introduce an efficient numerical scheme for the calculation of the second R\'{e}nyi CMI based on the doubled Hilbert space formalism, and study the classification of non-trivial mixed states and the emergence of mixed state phase transitions for (i) the cluster model under odd-site local $Z$ decoherence and (ii) transverse field Ising model under both $ZZ$ and $X$ decoherence. The second R\'{e}nyi CMI is a powerful measure to study non-trivial mixed ``gapped" quantum matters and mixed phase transitions. In addition to this, the present study shows that the second R\'{e}nyi CMI exhibits specific behavior for the transition to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking mixed phase.</description>

      <title>Realization of universal nonadiabatic holonomic quantum gates in trapped ion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of holonomic quantum computation is meaningful. We can effectively resist local and collective noise in the process of physical implementation by using the advantage of non-Abelian geometric phase. In this paper, we set out from the simplest and most fundamental Jaynes-Cummings model of ion trap system to implement single-qubit logical operations, and taking advantage of the interaction of two ions with a pair of laser pulses to implement two-qubit logical operations, respectively. Compared with the previous proposal, the whole process of our proposal are in tunable way and the universal holonomic quantum qubit gates can be made robust to systematic error and decay which pushes the gate fidelities in the presence of decoherence and systematic error to well high level. Thus our scheme affords an experimentally feasible and simple way to make realizing the robust nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States for Gauge-Invariant Quantum Computation and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Packaged quantum states are gauge-invariant states in which all internal quantum numbers (IQNs) form an inseparable block. This feature gives rise to novel packaged entanglements that encompass all IQNs, which is important both for fundamental physics and for quantum technology. Here we develop a framework for gauge-invariant quantum information processing based on packaged quantum states. We propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for a valid packaged superposition state of a single particle and multi-particle. We then present the details of constructing gauge-invariant packaged qubits (or qudits), packaged gates, and packaged circuits (which commute with the total charge operator). These serve as alternative foundation for gauge-invariant quantum information science. We then adapt conventional quantum error-correction codes, quantum algorithms, and quantum communication protocols to the ($d \times D$)-dimensional hybrid-packaged subspace. This high-dimensional hybrid-packaged subspace is flexible for pruning and scaling to match available physics systems. Thus, packaged quantum information processing becomes feasible and testable. 
Our results show that the gauge-invariant packaged quantum states may provide a possible route toward robust, fault-tolerant, and secure quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Bounds of Wavefront Shaping of Spatially Entangled Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping enables control of classical light through scattering media. Extending these techniques to spatially entangled photons promises new quantum applications, but their fundamental limits, especially when both photons scatter, remain unclear. Here, we theoretically and numerically investigate the enhancement of two-photon correlations through thick scattering media. We analyze configurations where a spatial light modulator shapes one or both photons, either before or after the medium, and show that the optimal enhancement differs fundamentally from classical expectations. For a system with $N$ modes, we show that shaping one photon yields the classical enhancement $\eta \approx (\pi/4)N$, while shaping both photons before the medium reduces it to $\eta \approx (\pi/4)^2N$. However, in some symmetric detection schemes, when both photons are measured at the same mode, perfect correlations are restored with $\eta \approx N$, resembling digital optical phase conjugation. Conversely, shaping both photons after the medium leads to a complex, NP-hard-like optimization problem, yet achieves superior enhancements, up to $\eta \approx 4.6N$. These results reveal unique quantum effects in complex media and identify strategies for quantum imaging and communication through scattering environments.</description>

      <title>CONQURE: A Co-Execution Environment for Quantum and Classical Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutting edge classical computing today relies on a combination of CPU-based computing with a strong reliance on accelerators. In particular, high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) rely heavily on acceleration via GPUs for numerical kernels. In the future, acceleration via quantum devices may complement GPUs for kernels where algorithms provide quantum advantage, i.e., significant speedups over classical algorithms. Computing with quantum kernels mapped onto quantum processing units (QPUs) requires seamless integration into HPC and ML. However, quantum offloading onto HPC/cloud lacks open-source software infrastructure. For classical algorithms, parallelization standards, such as OpenMP, MPI, or CUDA exist. In contrast, a lack of quantum abstractions currently limits the adoption of quantum acceleration in practical applications creating a gap between quantum algorithm development and practical HPC integration. Such integration needs to extend to efficient quantum offloading of kernels, which further requires scheduling of quantum resources, control of QPU kernel execution, tracking of QPU results, providing results to classical calling contexts and coordination with HPC scheduling. This work proposes CONQURE, a co-execution environment for quantum and classical resources. CONQURE is a fully open-source cloud queue framework that presents a novel modular scheduling framework allowing users to offload OpenMP quantum kernels to QPUs as quantum circuits, to relay results back to calling contexts in classical computing, and to schedule quantum resources via our CONQURE API. We show our API has a low overhead averaging 12.7ms in our tests, and we demonstrate functionality on an ion-trap device. Our OpenMP extension enables the parallelization of VQE runs with a 3.1X reduction in runtime.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a 3D Integrated Superconducting Quantum Chip Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a combined analytical and simulation-based study of a 3D-integrated quantum chip architecture. We model a flip-chip-inspired structure by stacking two superconducting qubits fabricated on separate high-resistivity silicon substrates through a dielectric interlayer. Utilizing \emph{rigorous} Ansys High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) simulations and analytical models from microwave engineering and quantum theory, we evaluate key quantum metrics such as eigenfrequencies, Q-factors, decoherence times, anharmonicity, cross-Kerr, participation ratios, and qubit coupling energy to describe the performance of the quantum device as a function of integration parameters. The integration parameters include the thickness and the quality of the dielectric interlayer. For detuned qubits, these metrics remain mostly invariant with respect to the substrate separation. However, introducing dielectric interlayer loss decreases the qubit quality factor, which consequentially degrades the relaxation time of the qubit. It is found that for the structure studied in this work, the stacked chip distance can be as small as $0.5 \text{mm}$. These findings support the viability of 3D quantum integration as a scalable alternative to planar architectures, while identifying key limitations in qubit coherence preservation due to lossy interlayer materials.</description>

      <title>Information geometry and entanglement under phase-space deformation through nonsymplectic congruence transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao (FR) information matrix is a central object in multiparameter quantum estimation theory. The geometry of a quantum state can be envisaged through the Riemannian manifold generated by the FR-metric corresponding to the quantum state. Interestingly, any congruence transformation $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$ in phase-space leaves the FR-distance for Gaussian states invariant. In the present paper, we investigate whether this isometry affects the entanglement in the bipartite system. It turns out that, even a simple choice of a congruence transformation, induces the entanglement in a bipartite Gaussian system.
  To make our study relevant to physical systems, we choose Bopp's shift in phase-space as an example of $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$, so that the results can be interpreted in terms of noncommutative (NC) phase-space deformation. We explicitly provide a quantitative measure of the dependence of separability on NC parameters. General expressions for the metric structure are also provided.
  The crucial point in the present piece of study is the identification of the connection of phase-space deformation-induced entanglement through a general class of congruence transformation and the identification of a trade-off relationship between the initial correlations and deformation parameters.</description>

      <title>Electric Power Demand Portfolio Optimization by Fermionic QAOA with Self-Consistent Local Field Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) have been actively developed, among which Fermionic QAOA (FQAOA) has been successfully applied to financial portfolio optimization problems. We improve FQAOA and apply it to the optimization of electricity demand portfolios aiming to procure a target amount of electricity with minimum risk. Our new algorithm, FQAOA-SCLFM, allows approximate integration of constraints on the target amount of power by utilizing self-consistent local field modulation (SCLFM) in a driver Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that this approach performs better than the currently widely used $XY$-QAOA and the previous FQAOA in all instances subjected to this study.</description>

      <title>On Selecting Paths for End-to-End Entanglement Creation in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal routing is a fundamental challenge in quantum networking, with several approaches proposed to identify the most efficient path for end-to-end (e2e) entanglement generation between pairs of nodes. In this paper, we show that \textit{prior entanglements} -- entanglements generated in a previous network cycle but not yet utilized -- are an important consideration in optimal path selection due to the dynamic nature of quantum networks. Specifically, we investigate whether a longer path with pre-existing entanglements can outperform a shorter path that starts from scratch. We account for key quantum constraints, including noisy entanglement generation and swapping, fidelity decay, probabilistic operations, and link discarding upon swap failure. Simulations reveal that longer paths with prior entanglements can establish e2e entanglement faster than shorter paths under certain conditions. We further introduce the notion of \textit{entanglement diversity}, where multiple paths can be used to improve performance -- either by selecting the first successful path to minimize time or using both paths to enhance fidelity through distillation. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating prior entanglements into path selection strategies for optimizing quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Purification in Quantum Networks: Guaranteed Improvement and Optimal Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the concept of entanglement purification protocols (EPPs) is straightforward, the integration of EPPs in network architectures requires careful performance evaluations and optimizations that take into account realistic conditions and imperfections, especially probabilistic entanglement generation and quantum memory decoherence. It is important to understand what is guaranteed to be improved from successful EPP with arbitrary non-identical input, which determines whether we want to perform the EPP at all. When successful EPP can offer improvement, the time to perform the EPP should also be optimized to maximize the improvement. In this work, we study the guaranteed improvement and optimal time for the CNOT-based recurrence EPP, previously shown to be optimal in various scenarios. We firstly prove guaranteed improvement for multiple figures of merit, including fidelity and several entanglement measures when compared to practical baselines as functions of input states. However, it is noteworthy that the guaranteed improvement we prove does not imply the universality of the EPP as introduced in arXiv:2407.21760. Then we prove robust, parameter-independent optimal time for typical error models and figures of merit. We further explore memory decoherence described by continuous-time Pauli channels, and demonstrate the phenomenon of optimal time transition when the memory decoherence error pattern changes. Our work deepens the understanding of EPP performance in realistic scenarios and offers insights into optimizing quantum networks that integrate EPPs.</description>

      <title>Quantum-assited anomaly detection with multivariate Gaussian distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection with multivariate Gaussian distribution, termed Gassian anomaly detection (GAD), is a prominent problem in data mining and machine learning, in which all training data points of a given dataset are assumed to be drawn from an unknown multivariate Gassian distribution and those points with low probability density function values are deemed anomalies. Hence, the central task of GAD is to calculate the probability density function of a new data point by retrieving its mean values and covariance matrix, which could be time-consuming when addressing a large dataset. Recently, several quantum algorithms have been proposed to for GAD, which have been shown significantly faster than the classical counterparts under certain conditions. However, they all require quantum phase estimation as a key subroutine that may have exponentially high quantum circuit depth and is not desirable in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this paper, we propose a new quantum algorithm for GAD without phase estimation, whose quantum circuit has depth only linear in the number of qubits, which is relatively more friendly on NISQ devices. Specifically, building on arithmetic-free black-box quantum state preparation (AFBBQSP), our quantum algorithm outputs the estimates of the mean values and the covariance matrix both in the classical form, so that anomaly detection of any data point can be done immediately on a classical computer at little cost. It is shown that our quantum algorithm is highly efficient when handling low-dimensional datasets with well-conditioned data matrices. Moreover, unlike prior quantum algorithms for GAD which require the input data to be quantum, mean centered, or feature correlated, our quantum algorithm release these constraints and thus is more data practical. Our work highlights the role of AFBBQSP in bringing quantum machine learning closer to reality.</description>

      <title>Flux-Trapping Fluxonium Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of superconducting quantum computing, fluxonium qubits have recently garnered attention for their large anharmonicity and high coherence at the sweet spot. Towards the large-scale integration of fluxonium qubits, a major obstacle is the need for precise external magnetic flux bias: To achieve high performance at its sweet spot, each qubit requires a DC bias line. However, such lines inductively coupled to the qubits bring in additional wiring overhead, crosstalk, heating, and decoherence, necessitating measures for mitigating the problems. In this work, we propose a flux-trapping fluxonium qubit, which, by leveraging fluxoid quantization, enables the optimal phase biasing without using external magnetic flux control at the operating temperature. We introduce the design and working principle, and demonstrate the phase biasing achieved through fluxoid quantization.</description>

      <title>Near-perfect broadband quantum memory enabled by intelligent spinwave compaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum memory, a pivotal hub in quantum information processing, is expected to achieve high-performance storage and coherent manipulation of quantum states, with memory efficiency exceeding 90% and quantum fidelity surpassing the non-cloning limit. However, the current performance falls short of these requirements due to the inherent trade-off between memory efficiency enhancement and noise amplification, which not only imposes significant demands on quantum purification but also fundamentally impedes continuous-variable quantum information processing. In this paper, we break through these constraints, enabling high-performance quantum memory and unlocking new possibilities for quantum technologies. We unveil a Hankel-transform spatiotemporal mapping for light-spinwave conversion in quantum memory, and propose an intelligent light-manipulated strategy for adaptive spinwave compaction, which can maximize the conversion efficiency and simultaneously suppress the excess noise. This strategy is experimentally demonstrated for a Raman quantum memory in warm 87Rb atomic vapor with an efficiency up to 94.6% and a low noise level of only 0.026 photons/pulse. The unconditional fidelity reaches 98.91% with an average of 1.0 photons/pulse for a 17-ns input signal. Our results successfully demonstrate a practical benchmark for broadband quantum memory, which may facilitate advancements in high-speed quantum networks, quantum state manipulation, and scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Algorithms for Simulating Gaussian Boson Sampling on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is a promising candidate for demonstrating quantum computational advantage and can be applied to solving graph-related problems. In this work, we propose Markov chain Monte Carlo-based algorithms to simulate GBS on undirected, unweighted graphs. Our main contribution is a double-loop variant of Glauber dynamics, whose stationary distribution matches the GBS distribution. We further prove that it mixes in polynomial time for dense graphs using a refined canonical path argument. Numerically, we conduct experiments on graphs with 256 vertices, larger than the scales in former GBS experiments as well as classical simulations. In particular, we show that both the single-loop and double-loop Glauber dynamics improve the performance of original random search and simulated annealing algorithms for the max-Hafnian and densest $k$-subgraph problems up to 10x. Overall, our approach offers both theoretical guarantees and practical advantages for classical simulations of GBS on graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though quantum information theory gives advantage over classical information theory, these two information theories have a structural similarity that many exponet rates of information tasks asymptotically equal to entropic quantities. A typical example is Stein's Lemma, which many researchers still keep interested in. In this paper, in order to analyze the mathemtaical roots of the structural similarity, we investigate mathematically minimum structure where Stein's Lemma holds. We focus on the structure of Euclidean Jordan Algebras (EJAs), which is a generalization of the algebraic structure in quantum theory, and we investigate the properties of general models of General Probabilistic Theories (GPTs) generated by EJAs. As a result, we prove Stein's Lemma in any model of GPTs generated by EJAs by establishing a generalization of information theoretical tools from the mathematical properties of EJAs.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity and memory enhancement in Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Featuring memory of past inputs is a fundamental requirement for machine learning models processing time-dependent data. In quantum reservoir computing, all architectures proposed so far rely on Markovian dynamics, which, as we prove, inherently lead to an exponential decay of past information, thereby limiting long-term memory capabilities. We demonstrate that non-Markovian dynamics can overcome this limitation, enabling extended memory retention. By analytically deriving memory bounds and supporting our findings with numerical simulations, we show that non-Markovian reservoirs can outperform their Markovian counterparts, particularly in tasks that require a coexistence of short- and long-term correlations. We introduce an embedding approach that allows a controlled transition from Markovian to non-Markovian evolution, providing a path for practical implementations. Our results establish quantum non-Markovianity as a key resource for enhancing memory in quantum machine learning architectures, with broad implications in quantum neural networks.</description>

      <title>Fast initialization of Bell states with Schr\"odinger cats in multi-mode systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger cat states play an important role for applications in continuous variable quantum information technologies. As macroscopic superpositions they are inherently protected against certain types of noise making cat qubits a promising candidate for quantum computing. It has been shown recently that cat states occur naturally in driven Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) as degenerate ground states with even and odd parity that are adiabatically connected to the respective lowest two Fock states by switching off the drive. To perform operations with several cat qubits one crucial task is to create entanglement between them. Here, we demonstrate efficient transformations of multi-mode cat states through adiabatic and diabatic switching between Kerr-type Hamiltonians with degenerate ground state manifolds. These transformations can be used to directly initialize the cats as entangled Bell states in contrast to initializing them from entangled Fock states.</description>

      <title>Exponential improvement in quantum simulations of bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers requires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of truncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the complexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example, a truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of $Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings required to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an exponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For lattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several Hamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in recent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the exponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Specifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit, or, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained with circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like $\mathcal{O}(\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as an exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework, advocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators provides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit complexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian is advantageous. We also point out that Hamiltonian formulations based on a gauge-invariant Hilbert space require an exponential increase in the resource requirement with respect to using an extended Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Coherent states of an accelerated particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct generalized coherent states (GCS) of a massive accelerated particle. This example is an important step in studying coherent states (CS) for systems with an unbounded motion and a continuous spectrum. First, we represent quantum states of the accelerated particle both known and new ones obtained by us using the method of non-commutative integration of linear differential equations. A complete set of non-stationary states for the accelerated particle is obtained. This set is expressed via elementary functions and is characterized by a continuous real parameter $\eta$, which corresponds to the initial momentum of the particle. A connection is obtained between these solutions and stationary states, which are determined by the Airy function. We solved the problem of constructing GCS, in particular, semiclassical states describing the accelerated particle, within the framework of the consistent method of integrals of motion. We have found different representations, coordinate one and in a Fock space, analyzing in detail all the parameters entering in these representations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement islands in 1D and 2D lattices with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial structure of quantum entanglement in one- and two-dimensional lattice systems containing structural defects, using the Time-Dependent Quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method. By constructing reduced density matrices from ensembles of guide waves, we resolve spatial variations in both Coulomb-mediated entanglement and coherence without requiring full many-body wavefunctions. This approach reveals localized regions, entanglement islands, where quantum correlations are enhanced or suppressed due to the presence of vacancies or interaction inhomogeneities. In 1D systems, entanglement tends to concentrate near defects, while in 2D we observe bridge-like and radially symmetric domains. Our results demonstrate that TDQMC offers a scalable and physically transparent framework for real-space quantum information analysis, with implications for quantum materials, entanglement-based sensing, and coherent state engineering.</description>

      <title>Faithful and secure distributed quantum sensing under general-coherent attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology and cryptography can be combined in a distributed and/or remote sensing setting, where distant end-users with limited quantum capabilities can employ quantum states, transmitted by a quantum-powerful provider via a quantum network, to perform quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in a private fashion. Previous works on the subject have been limited by restricted assumptions on the capabilities of a potential eavesdropper and the use of abort-based protocols that prevent a simple practical realization. Here we introduce, theoretically analyze, and experimentally demonstrate single- and two-way protocols for distributed sensing combining several unique and desirable features: (i) a safety-threshold mechanism that allows the protocol to proceed in low-noise cases and quantifying the potential tampering with respect to the ideal estimation procedure, effectively paving the way for wide-spread practical realizations; (ii) equivalence of entanglement-based and mutually-unbiased-bases-based formulations; (iii) robustness against collective attacks via a LOCC-de-Finetti theorem, for the first time to our knowledge. Finally, we demonstrate our protocols in a photonic-based implementation, observing that the possibility of guaranteeing a safety threshold may come at a significant price in terms of the estimation bias, potentially overestimating the effect of tampering in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed collective dynamics in waveguide QED and bosonic quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a theoretical framework to model the collective dynamics of quantum emitters in highly non-Markovian environments, interacting through the exchange of photons with significant retardations. The formalism consists on a set of coupled delay differential equations for the emitter's polarizations $\sigma^\pm_i$, supplemented by input-output relations that describe the field mediating the interactions. These equations capture the dynamics of both linear (bosonic) and nonlinear (two-level) emitter arrays. It is exact in some limits$-$e.g., bosonic emitters or generic systems with up to one collective excitation$-$and can be integrated to provide accurate results for larger numbers of photons. These equations support a study of collective spontaneous emission of emitter arrays in open waveguide-QED environments. This study uncovers an effect we term cascaded super- and sub-radiance, characterized by light-cone-limited propagation and increasingly correlated photon emission across distant emitters. The collective nature of this dynamics for two-level systems is evident both in the enhancement of collective emission rates, as well as in a superradiant burst with a faster than linear growth. While these effects should be observable in existing circuit QED devices or slight generalizations thereof, the formalism put forward in this work can be extended to model other systems such as network of quantum emitters or the generation of correlated photon states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive some properties of the hydrogen atom inside a box with an impenetrable wall that have not been discussed before. Suitable scaling of the Hamiltonian operator proves to be useful for the derivation of some general properties of the eigenvalues. The radial part of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is conditionally solvable and the exact polynomial solutions provide useful information. There are accidental degeneracies that take place at particular values of the box radius, some of which can be determined from the conditionally-solvable condition. Some of the roots stemming from the conditionally-solvable condition appear to converge towards the critical values of the model parameter. This analysis is facilitated by the Rayleigh-Ritz method that provides accurate eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain correction terms for the standard Hamiltonian of 2 transmons driven by microwaves in cross resonance. Data is obtained from a real transmon system, namely ibm kyiv on the IBM quantum platform. Various data points obtained correspond to different microwave amplitudes and evolution times. We have an ansatz for the correction term and a correction operator whose matrix elements are parameters to be optimized for. We use adjoint sensitivity and gradient descent to obtain these parameters. We see a good fit in the predictions from the corrected Hamiltonian and hardware results demonstrating the effectiveness of scientific machine learning for fine tuning theoretical models to faithfully reproduce observed data on time evolution multiple qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient and high-fidelity entanglement in cavity QED without high cooperativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called state-carving protocol generates high-fidelity entangled states at an atom-cavity interface without requiring high cavity cooperativity. However, this protocol is limited to 50\% efficiency, which restricts its applicability. We propose a simple modification to the state-carving protocol to achieve efficient entanglement generation, with unit probability in principle. Unlike previous two-photon schemes, ours employs only one photon which interacts with the atoms twice - avoiding separate photon detections which causes irrecoverable probability loss. We present a detailed description and performance evaluation of our protocol under non-ideal conditions. High fidelity of 0.999 can be achieved with cavity cooperativity of only 34. Efficient state-carving paves the way for large-scale entanglement generation at cavity-interfaces for modular quantum computing, quantum repeaters and creating arbitrary shaped atomic graph states, essential for one-way quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Chiral Gain-Induced Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light offers a powerful approach to tailor light-matter interactions in quantum systems with chiral properties. While chirality has been extensively studied in passive platforms, the role of optical gain in controlling chiral quantum dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of qubits interacting with structured gain environments, where amplification depends on the light's polarization or momentum. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in linear bianisotropic media with gain and extending the Lindblad formalism to these settings, we derive a master equation governing the qubit's irreversible evolution. We show that chiral gain can break time-reversal symmetry and drive the system toward a symmetry-broken steady state with nonreciprocal properties. This effect is illustrated in detail for moving plasmonic substrates, which exhibit inherently chiral gain that selectively amplifies transitions of a given handedness. Our results establish chiral gain as a novel mechanism for engineering nonreciprocal quantum steady states.</description>

      <title>Finite-Speed-of-Light Effects in Atom Interferometry: Diffraction Mechanisms and Resonance Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-pulse atom interferometers serve as tools for high-precision metrology and are targeting measurements of relativistic effects. This development is facilitated by extended interrogation times and large-momentum-transfer techniques generating quantum superpositions of both interferometer arms on large distances. Due to the finite speed of light, diffracting light pulses cannot interact simultaneously with both arms, inducing phase perturbations that compromise the accuracy of the sensor -- an effect that becomes progressively important as spatial separations increase. For a consistent framework, we develop a theory for finite-speed-of-light effects in atom interferometers alongside with other relativistic effects such as the mass defect. Our analysis shows that their magnitude depends crucially on the diffraction mechanism and the specific interferometer geometry. We demonstrate that the velocity of the atomic cloud at the mirror pulse of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is less critical than the precise tuning of the lasers for resonant diffraction. Finally, we propose an experiment to test our predictions based on recoilless transitions and discuss mitigation strategies to reduce the bias in gravimetric applications.</description>

      <title>Sensing Birefringence and Diattenuation with Undetected Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing advanced technologies for sensing and imaging biological samples is crucial for medical applications, making quantum-enhanced methods particularly valuable, as they promise significant benefits over classical techniques. An important aspect of biological imaging is the characterization of tissue, which often involves resolving complex structural information such as birefringence and diattenuation. These measures require polarization-sensitive sensing which remains largely unaddressed in quantum-imaging techniques with undetected light. However, the bicolor nature and supreme phase sensitivity of nonlinear interferometers make them particularly advantageous for biological sensing. Hence, we theoretically introduce controllable polarizations of the interrogating light in a quantum-imaging setup and show the potential of nonlinear interferometers to simultaneously sense birefringence and diattenuation with undetected light while discussing both the low- and high-gain regime.</description>

      <title>Lumped-element broadband SNAIL parametric amplifier with on-chip pump filter for multiplexed readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a SNAIL-based parametric amplifier that integrates a lumped-element impedance matching network for increased bandwidth and an on-chip pump-port filter for efficient pump delivery. The amplifier is fabricated using a single-layer optical lithography step, followed by a single-layer electron beam lithography step. We measure a flat 20 dB gain profile with less than 1 dB ripple across a bandwidth of up to 250 MHz on multiple devices, demonstrating robust performance against variations arising from fabrication and packaging. We characterize the amplifier's linearity by analyzing gain compression and intermodulation distortion under simultaneous multi-tone excitation. We show that the intermodulation products remain suppressed by more than 23 dB relative to the signal tones, even at the 1 dB gain compression point. We further validate its utility by performing simultaneous high-fidelity readout of two transmon qubits, achieving state assignment fidelities of 99.51% and 98.55%. The combination of compact design, fabrication simplicity, and performance robustness makes this amplifier a practical device for quantum experiments with superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Hyperinductance based on stacked Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superinductances are superconducting circuit elements that combine a large inductance with a low parasitic capacitance to ground, resulting in a characteristic impedance exceeding the resistance quantum $R_Q = h/(2e)^2 \simeq 6.45 \mathrm{k}\Omega$. In recent years, these components have become key enablers for emerging quantum circuit architectures. However, achieving high characteristic impedance while maintaining scalability and fabrication robustness remains a major challenge. In this work, we present two fabrication techniques for realizing superinductances based on vertically stacked Josephson junctions. Using a multi-angle Manhattan (MAM) process and a zero-angle (ZA) evaporation technique -- in which junction stacks are connected pairwise using airbridges -- we fabricate one-dimensional chains of stacks that act as high-impedance superconducting transmission lines. Two-tone microwave spectroscopy reveals the expected $\sqrt{n}$ scaling of the impedance with the number of junctions per stack. The chain fabricated using the ZA process, with nine junctions per stack, achieves a characteristic impedance of $\sim 16 \mathrm{k}\Omega$, a total inductance of $5.9 \mathrm{\mu H}$, and a maximum frequency-dependent impedance of $50 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ at 1.4 GHz. Our results establish junction stacking as a scalable, robust, and flexible platform for next-generation quantum circuits requiring ultra-high impedance environments.</description>

      <title>i-QLS: Quantum-supported Algorithm for Least Squares Optimization in Non-Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an iterative quantum-assisted least squares (i-QLS) optimization method that leverages quantum annealing to overcome the scalability and precision limitations of prior quantum least squares approaches. Unlike traditional QUBO-based formulations, which suffer from a qubit overhead due to fixed discretization, our approach refines the solution space iteratively, enabling exponential convergence while maintaining a constant qubit requirement per iteration. This iterative refinement transforms the problem into an anytime algorithm, allowing for flexible computational trade-offs. Furthermore, we extend our framework beyond linear regression to non-linear function approximation via spline-based modeling, demonstrating its adaptability to complex regression tasks. We empirically validate i-QLS on the D-Wave quantum annealer, showing that our method efficiently scales to high-dimensional problems, achieving competitive accuracy with classical solvers while outperforming prior quantum approaches. Experiments confirm that i-QLS enables near-term quantum hardware to perform regression tasks with improved precision and scalability, paving the way for practical quantum-assisted machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>What is a Gaussian channel, and when is it physically implementable using a multiport interferometer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Gaussian channels are fundamental models for communication and information processing in continuous-variable quantum systems. This work addresses both foundational aspects and physical implementation pathways for these channels. Firstly, we provide a rigorous, unified framework by formally proving the equivalence of three principal definitions of quantum Gaussian channels prevalent in the literature, consolidating theoretical understanding. Secondly, we investigate the physical realization of these channels using multiport interferometers, a key platform in quantum optics. The central research contribution is a precise characterization of the channel parameters that correspond to Gaussian channels physically implementable via linear optical multiport interferometers. This characterization bridges the abstract mathematical description with concrete physical architectures. Along the way, we also resolve some questions posed by Parthasarathy (Indian J. Pure Appl. Math. 46, (2015)).</description>

We have analyzed how light behaves in a negative index metamaterial (NIM), allowing us to develop a transfer matrix and identify the essential conditions for the occurrence of spectral singularities. These findings are crucial for fine-tuning system parameters that will drive the development of metamaterial slab lasers and coherent perfect absorber (CPA) systems. Overall, our research demonstrates the enormous potential of metamaterials and their significant role in driving innovation in various technology areas.</description>

      <title>Fully Integrated Vacuum-based Quantum Random Number Generator</title>

Abstract: Quantum random number generators play a crucial role in securing high-demand information contexts by producing true random numbers. Nevertheless, the large volume and high-cost limit their widespread use. Here, we propose a system on chip that fully leverages the advantages of different photonic integrated platforms, where the interference optical paths and photodiodes are integrated on a standard silicon process, while the laser source on-chip is realized on a III-V platform. Using micro-lens coupling package technology, which contributes to a topnotch coupling loss lower than 2dB, the components on different platforms are combined and packaged with the amplifier circuits in a 42mm* 24mm footprint in a butterfly form. This complete miniaturized and cost-effective entropy source enables outputting a vacuum noise signal with a 3dB bandwidth of over 500MHz. After sampling and post-processing, a random number generation rate of up to 6.57Gbps is achieved. The results show a feasible way of overcoming the laser integration problem with silicon-based integrated quantum photonics. Foreseeable, commercial applications on a large scale are significantly promoted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics generated by Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians with long-ranged (power law) terms. We prove two ballistic propagation bounds for suitable initial states: (i) A bound on all moments of the local particle number for all power law exponents $\alpha&gt;d+1$ in $d$ dimensions, the sharp condition. (ii) The first thermodynamically stable Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) for these Hamiltonians. To handle the long-ranged and unbounded terms, we further develop the multiscale ASTLO (adiabatic space time localization observables) method introduced in our recent work [arXiv:2310.14896].</description>

      <title>Chemical hydrodynamics of nuclear spin states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical equations of motion are strictly linear in state descriptors, such as wavefunctions and density matrices, but equations describing chemical kinetics and hydrodynamics may be non-linear in concentrations. This incompatibility is fundamental, but special cases can be handled - for example, in magnetic resonance where nuclear spin interactions may be too weak influence concentration dynamics. For processes involving single spins and first-order chemical reactions, this is a well-researched topic, but time evolution of complex nuclear spin systems in the presence of second-order kinetics, diffusion, and flow has so far remained intractable. This creates obstacles in microfluidics, homogeneous catalysis, and magnetic resonance imaging of metabolic processes.
  In this communication we report a numerically stable formalism for time-domain quantum mechanical description of nuclear spin dynamics and decoherence in the simultaneous presence of diffusion, flow, and second-order chemical reactions. The formalism is implemented in versions 2.11 and later of the open-source Spinach library. As an illustration, we use Diels-Alder cycloaddition of acrylonitrile to cyclopentadiene, yielding endo- and exo-norbornene carbonitrile, in the presence of diffusion and flow in the detection chamber of a microfluidic NMR probe (a finite element model with thousands of Voronoi cells) with a spatially localised stripline radiofrequency coil.</description>

      <title>Construction of First Principle Based Adiabatic and Diabatic Hamiltonian for TiO$_6^{8-}$ unit of BaTiO$_3$ Crystal: Photoemission Spectra and Ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ferroelectric property of BaTiO$_3$ crystal arises from the strong Pseudo Jahn-Teller (PJT) interactions between the non-degenerate ground electronic state, $^1A_{1g}$ and the degenerate $^1T_{1u}$ symmetry states through the nuclear distortions of $t_{1u}$ modes in TiO$_6^{8-}$ unit. In a $d^0$ electronic configuration of $Ti^{4+}$ ion, the PJT interaction leads to a stabilization effect, which has been explored using Beyond Born-Oppenheimer (BBO) theory. The $^1T_{1u}$ excited states form a three-state degeneracy, exhibiting feeble Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions over the $t_{2g}$ planes. For the first time, we compute \textit{ab initio} adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) and non-adiabatic coupling terms (NACTs), and thereafter, diabatic PESs and couplings for the perovskite unit, TiO$_6^{8-}$. Using a Time-Dependent Discrete Variable Representation (TDDVR) approach, the theoretical photoemission spectra exhibit good agreement with the experimental ones. Moreover, the experimental observation on order parameter associated with ferroelectric properties of BaTiO$_3$ crystal show close resemblance with present and other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the topological surface states (TSS) of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a 3D topological insulator, epitaxially grown on twisted bilayer graphene (tBG). The moir\'e potential induced by tBG folds the TSS Dirac cone into the moir\'e Brillouin zone (MBZ), resulting in mini-gap openings, band flattening, and the potential emergence of secondary Dirac points. Using effective field theory, symmetry analysis, and higher-order perturbation theory, we analyze both commensurate and incommensurate twist angles, revealing significant band structure reconstruction in periodic systems and quasi-periodic effects in incommensurate ones. This work provides deep insights into the interplay between topological protection and moir\'e modulation, offering a pathway to engineer novel topological phases.</description>

      <title>Unified exact WKB framework for resonance -- Zel'dovich and complex-scaling regularizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for analyzing quantum mechanical resonances using the exact WKB method. The non-perturbative formulation based on the exact WKB method works for incorporating both the Zel'dovich regularization and the complex scaling method. While previous studies have demonstrated the exact WKB analysis in bound state problems, our work extends its application to quasi-stationary states. By examining the inverted Rosen-Morse potential, we illustrate how the exact WKB analysis captures resonant phenomena in a rigorous manner. We explore the equivalence and complementarity of different well-established regularizations \`a la Zel'dovich and complex scaling within this framework. This offers a deeper understanding of resonant states and their analytic structures. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of the non-perturbative accuracy of exact WKB methods in unstable quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intense simulation activity on hole-spin qubits in Ge has focused so far on singly occupied quantum dots. Here, we theoretically investigate three-hole qubits in germanium and show that their performances compare well with those of their single-hole counterparts, both in strained and unstrained systems. In particular, enhancements of the gating times by two orders of magnitude are obtained in slightly elongated quantum dots. We show that, depending on the confinement anisotropy, such an enhancement is driven either by the occupation of excited spin-orbitals (Pauli principle), or by a Coulomb-induced charge rearrangement.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Intervalley Coherence with Emergent Kekul\'e Orbitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $p$-orbital doublet in a honeycomb lattice is concretely studied with interacting spinless fermions at half filling. The Dirac fermions with linear dispersion at $\pm K$ valleys govern the non-interacting low-energy physics. In the weak-coupling regime, the Dirac fermions are gaped due to the spontaneous generation of mass terms through a uniform axial orbital ordering, rendering the system into the quantum anomalous Hall insulator phase with a nonzero Chern number. Surprisingly, the intermediate many-particle interaction produces the intervalley coherence between $\pm K$ valleys by developing complex polar orbital orderings in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell. This phase is shown to have a deep connection with the low-energy physical behavior described by the orbital exchange model in the Mott insulating phase. The classical ground-state manifold in the Mott regime enjoys a continuous symmetry characterized by the intervalley coherent phase. Finally, the quantum fluctuation selects a unique ground state with emergent Kekul\'e orbitons through the order-by-disorder mechanism. Our findings provide insights for a direction of searching for Kekul\'e distortion in correlated multi-orbital systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>

      <title>Escaping the Krylov space during finite precision Lanczos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm, introduced by Cornelius Lanczos, has been known for a long time and is widely used in computational physics. While often employed to approximate extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectores of an operator, recently interest in the sequence of basis vectors produced by the algorithm rose in the context of Krylov complexity. Although it is generally accepted and partially proven that the procedure is numerically stable for approximating the eigenvalues, there are numerical problems when investigating the Krylov basis constructed via the Lanczos procedure. In this paper, we show that loss of orthogonality and the attempt of reorthoganalization fall short of understanding and addressing the problem. Instead, the numerical sequence of eigenvectors in finite precision arithmetic escapes the true vector space spanned by the exact Lanczos vectors. This poses the real threat to an interpretation in view of the operator growth hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: The Gutzwiller projection of fermionic wave functions is a well-established method for generating variational wave functions describing exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We investigate the conditions under which a projected wave function constructed from fermionic partons can be rigorously shown to possess topological order. We demonstrate that these conditions can be precisely determined in the case of projected Majorana stabilizer codes. We then use matrix product states to study states that interpolate between two distinct Majorana fermion codes, one yielding a $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquid and the other a trivial polarized state upon projection. While the free-fermion states are adiabatically connected, we find that the projected states undergo a phase transition detected by the topological entanglement entropy. Our work underscores the profound impact of the Gutzwiller projection and cautions against inferring properties of quantum spin liquids solely from their unprojected counterparts.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that Hermitian, nonlocal parametric pairing processes can induce non-Hermitian topology and skin modes, offering a simple alternative to complex bath engineering. Our model, stabilized by local dissipation and operating in the continuum limit, reveals exceptional points that spawn a tilted diabolical line in the dispersion. Local dissipation prevents instabilities, while a bulk anomaly signals unscreened current response. Upon opening the boundaries, we observe a non-Hermitian skin effect with localized edge modes. Through bulk winding indices and non-Bloch theory, we establish a robust bulk-boundary correspondence, highlighting parametric drives as a scalable route to non-Hermitian topology in bosonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pauli crystals are unique geometric structures of non-interacting fermions, resembling crystals, that emerge solely from Fermi statistics and confinement. Unlike genuine quantum crystals that arise from interparticle interactions, Pauli crystals do not break translation symmetry but nonetheless exhibit nontrivial many-body correlations. In this Letter, we explore Pauli crystal formation in a cavity-fermion setup. We analytically show that when coupled to a cavity, degeneracy in Pauli crystals can trigger zero-threshold transitions to superradiance. This superradiance is accompanied by the emergence of a genuine quantum crystalline state, wherein the atomic density is periodically modulated. We substantiate our findings using state-of-the-art numerical simulations. The combined interplay between statistics, confinement geometry and interactions mediated by light thus facilitates a novel pathway to quantum crystallization.</description>

Abstract: Complex dynamics when occurring autonomously, i.e. without external driving, is usually associated with everyday length scales and classical physics, e.g. living organisms. This dynamics is \emph{not} quantum coherent. Quantum coherent dynamics is, by contrast, assumed to be either simple periodic oscillation in particular when autonomous, e.g. spin precession, or random quantum fluctuations. Combining autonomous complex and quantum coherent dynamics on microscopic length-scales could allow for novel coherent quantum machines working without external time-dependent driving. Motivated by this, here we provide an exact theoretical condition for a system to display complex quantum coherent dynamics on both microscopic and macroscopic length scales that we call a \emph{dynamical quantum algebraic thread} (D-QAT). Due to D-QATs our autonomous quantum coherent dynamics is robust to realistic imperfections (including low-doped disorder) and present for generic initial states, allowing for potential realisations in experiments. We give an example of a \emph{spin lace} model structurally similar to magnetic azurite and certain recently experimentally realized large single-molecular magnets with long coherence times. Our work opens the possibility for many potential applications including ultra-dense storage and manipulation of quantum memories, creating \emph{giant} quantum coherent qubits, or microscopic quantum mechanism perform complicated motion.</description>

      <title>Super-resolving collective quantum measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.00986v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for super-resolving signals encoded as finite mixtures of bosonic modes using collective measurements that exploit permutation symmetry. Specifically, we use multiple copies of the state $\rho$ of the finite mixture to extract an estimate for the purity of $\rho$ via a spectrum measurement -- the weak Schur-sampling measurement. Depending on the outcome we then further fine-grain the measurement to optimally extract an estimate of the relative intensity between the two incoherent mixtures. Our protocol furnishes simultaneous estimates for both the relative intensity and the separation of incoherent signals saturating the multi-parameter Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, and is robust against misalignment errors. We also provide viable experimental avenues for implementing such collective measurements in different set-ups.</description>

      <title>Tensor Factorized Hamiltonian Downfolding To Optimize The Scaling Complexity Of The Electronic Correlations Problem on Classical and Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new variant of post-Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian downfolding-based quantum chemistry methods with optimized scaling for high-cost simulations like coupled cluster (CC), full configuration interaction (FCI), and multi-reference CI (MRCI) on classical and quantum hardware. This improves the applicability of these calculations to practical use cases. High-accuracy quantum chemistry calculations, such as CC, involve memory and timeintensive tensor operations, which are the primary bottlenecks in determining the properties of many-electron systems. The complexity of these operations scales exponentially with the system size. We aim to find properties of chemical systems by optimizing this scaling through mathematical transformations on the Hamiltonian and the state space. By defining a bi-partition of the many-body Hilbert space into electronoccupied and electron-unoccupied blocks for a given orbital, we perform a downfolding transformation that decouples the electron-occupied block from its complement. We factorize high-rank electronic integrals and cluster amplitude tensors into low-rank tensor factors of a downfolding transformation, mapping the full many-body Hamiltonian into a smaller dimensional block-Hamiltonians. This reduces the computational complexity of solving the residual equations for Hamiltonian downfolding from O(N7) for CCSD(T) and O(N9) - O(N10) for CI and MRCI to O(N3). This operations can be implemented as a family of tensor networks solely made from two-rank tensors. Additionally, we create block-encoding quantum circuits of the tensor networks, generating circuits of O(N2) depth with O(logN) qubits. We demonstrate super-quadratic speedups of expensive quantum chemistry algorithms on both classical and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Security of high-speed quantum key distribution with imperfect sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imperfect encoders compromise the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems via modulation flaws, side channels and inter-pulse correlations, which invalidate standard security proofs. Existing results addressing such imperfections suffer from critical limitations: they either consider only specific flaws, offer an unreasonably poor performance, or require the protocol to be run very slowly. Here, we present a finite-key security proof approach against coherent attacks that incorporates general encoding imperfections while achieving significantly better performances and requiring only partial characterization.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum-Dependent Spectral Shift in Chiral Vacuum Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a hybrid light-matter unitary transformation for cavity quantum electrodynamics, we investigate the spectral shift of an atom induced by quantum fluctuations in a chiral vacuum cavity. Remarkably, we find an intriguing angular momentum-dependent shift in the spectra of bound states. Our approach shows promise in going beyond traditional perturbative methods and demonstrates effectiveness even in the strong-coupling limit, as evidenced by our numerical benchmarks in the case of a two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. In addition, we establish a cavity-interaction picture for calculating the chiral vacuum Rabi oscillation in the strong-coupling limit for a generic central potential. The anomalous spectral shift revealed in this study possesses both fundamental and practical significance and could be readily observed in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02075v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of learning quantum processes from quantum statistical queries. We focus on two fundamental learning tasks in this new access model: shadow tomography of quantum processes and process tomography with respect to diamond distance. For the former, we present an efficient average-case algorithm along with a nearly matching lower bound with respect to the number of observables to be predicted. For the latter, we present average-case query complexity lower bounds for learning classes of unitaries. We obtain an exponential lower bound for learning unitary 2-designs and a doubly exponential lower bound for Haar-random unitaries. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our access model by applying our learning algorithm to attack an authentication protocol using Classical-Readout Quantum Physically Unclonable Functions, partially addressing an important open question in quantum hardware security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks are of high interest nowadays and a quantum internet has been long envisioned. Network-entanglement adapts the notion of entanglement to the network scenario and network-entangled states are considered to be a resource to overcome the limitations of a given network structure. In this work, we introduce measures of quantum network-entanglement that are well-defined within the general framework of quantum resource theories, which at the same time have a clear operational interpretation characterizing the extra resources necessary to prepare a targeted quantum state within a given network. In particular, we define the network communication cost and the network round complexity, which turn out to be intimately related to graph-theoretic parameters. We also provide methods to estimate these measures by introducing novel witnesses of network-entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the capacity of quantum circuits through the lens of approximation theory is essential for evaluating the complexity of quantum circuits required to solve various problems in scientific computation. We design quantum circuits capable of approximating d-dimensional functions within the Korobov function space. This is achieved by leveraging the quantum signal processing (QSP) and the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) algorithms to build quantum circuits that output Chebyshev polynomials. We also present a quantitative analysis of the approximation error rates and evaluates the computational complexity of implementing the proposed circuits. Since the Korobov function space is a subspace of the certain Sobolev spaces, our work develops a theoretical foundation for implementing a large class of functions suitable for applications on a quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase estimation is known to be a robust method for single-qubit gate calibration in quantum computers, while Bayesian estimation is widely used in devising optimal methods for learning in quantum systems. We present Bayesian phase estimation methods that adaptively choose a control phase and the time of coherent evolution based on prior phase knowledge. In the presence of noise, we find near-optimal performance with respect to known theoretical bounds, and demonstrate some robustness of the estimates to noise that is not accounted for in the model of the estimator, making the methods suitable for calibrating operations in quantum computers. We determine the utility of control parameter values using functions of the prior probability of the phase that quantify expected knowledge gain either in terms of expected narrowing of the posterior or expected information gain. In particular, we find that by maximising the rate of expected gain we obtain phase estimates having standard deviation a factor of 1.43 larger than the Heisenberg limit using a classical sequential strategy. The methods provide optimal solutions accounting for available prior knowledge and experimental imperfections with minimal effort from the user. The effect of many types of noise can be specified in the model of the measurement probabilities, and the rate of knowledge gain can easily be adjusted to account for times included in the measurement sequence other than the coherent evolution leading to the unknown phase, such as times required for state preparation or readout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum systems, generative quantum machine learning (QML) offers the potential to outperform classical learning models. Current generative QML algorithms mostly rely on general-purpose models that, while being very expressive, face several training challenges. One potential way to address these setbacks is by constructing problem-informed models that are capable of more efficient training on structured problems. In particular, probabilistic graphical models provide a flexible framework for representing structure in generative learning problems and can thus be exploited to incorporate inductive bias into QML algorithms. In this work, we propose a problem-informed quantum circuit Born machine Ansatz for learning the joint probability distribution of random variables, with independence relations efficiently represented by a Markov network (MN). We further demonstrate the applicability of the MN framework in constructing generative learning benchmarks and compare our model's performance to previous designs, showing that it outperforms problem-agnostic circuits. Based on a preliminary analysis of trainability, we narrow down the class of MNs to those exhibiting favourable trainability properties. Finally, we discuss the potential of our model to offer quantum advantage in the context of generative learning.</description>

Abstract: A quadrillion dimensional Hilbert space hosted by a quantum processor with over 50 physical qubits has been expected to be powerful enough to perform computational tasks ranging from simulations of many-body physics to complex financial modeling. Despite few examples and demonstrations, it is still not clear how we can utilize such a large Hilbert space as a computational resource; in particular, how a simple and small quantum system could solve non-trivial computational tasks. In this paper, we show a simple Ising model capable of performing such non-trivial computational tasks in a quantum neural network model. An Ising spin chain as small as ten qubits can solve a practical image classification task with high accuracy. To evaluate the mechanism of its computation, we examine how the symmetries of the Hamiltonian would affect its computational power. We show how the interplay between complexity and integrability/symmetries of the quantum system dictates the performance as quantum neural network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, analog quantum simulators have reached unprecedented quality, both in qubit numbers and coherence times. Most of these simulators natively implement Ising-type Hamiltonians, which limits the class of models that can be simulated efficiently. We propose a method to overcome this limitation and simulate the time-evolution of a large class of spinless fermionic systems in 1D using simple Ising-type Hamiltonians with local transverse fields. Our method is based on domain wall encoding, which is implemented via strong (anti-)ferromagnetic couplings $|J|$. We show that in the limit of strong $|J|$, the domain walls behave like spinless fermions in 1D. The Ising Hamiltonians are one-dimensional chains with nearest-neighbor and, optionally, next-nearest-neighbor interactions. As a proof-of-concept, we perform numerical simulations of various 1D-fermionic systems using domain wall evolution and accurately reproduce the systems' properties, such as topological edge states, Anderson localization, quantum chaotic time evolution and time-reversal symmetry breaking via Floquet-engineering. Our approach makes the simulation of a large class of fermionic many-body systems feasible on analogue quantum hardware that natively implements Ising-type Hamiltonians with transverse fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity quantum gates is crucial for reliable quantum computing. However, decoherence and control pulse imperfections pose significant challenges in realizing the theoretical fidelity of quantum gates in practical systems. To address these challenges, we propose the meta-reinforcement learning quantum control algorithm (metaQctrl), which leverages a two-layer learning framework to enhance robustness and fidelity. The inner reinforcement learning network focuses on decision making for specific optimization problems, while the outer meta-learning network adapts to varying environments and provides feedback to the inner network. Our comparative analysis regarding realization of universal quantum gates demonstrates that metaQctrl achieves higher fidelity with fewer control pulses than conventional methods in the presence of uncertainties. These results can contribute to the exploration of the quantum speed limit and facilitate the implementation of quantum circuits with system imperfections involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In stochastic modeling, the excess entropy -- the mutual information shared between a processes past and future -- represents the fundamental lower bound of the memory needed to simulate its dynamics. However, this bound cannot be saturated by either classical machines or their enhanced quantum counterparts. Simulating a process fundamentally requires us to store more information in the present than what is shared between past and future. Here we consider a hypothetical generalization of hidden Markov models beyond classical and quantum models, referred as n-machines, that allow for negative quasiprobabilities. We show that under the collision entropy measure of information, the minimal memory of such models can equalize the excess entropy. Our results hint negativity as a necessary resource for memory-advantaged stochastic simulation -- mirroring similar interpretations in various other quantum information tasks.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel authenticated Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol employing maximally entangled qubit pairs. In the absence of noise, we securely authenticate the well-known BB84 QKD scheme under two assumptions: first, adversaries cannot simultaneously access pre-shared and non-pre-shared secret classical information, and second, adversaries cannot simultaneously access pre-shared secret classical information and quantum memories held by legitimate parties. The main strength of this noiseless result is that access to all secretly pre-shared classical information is insufficient for breaching our scheme. Additionally, our protocol desirably allows for pre-shared secrecy reusage, leading to secret-key growing.
  In order to address noise, we simulate a photonic implementation of our scheme, together with a storage model that aims to replicate the performance of cavity-enhanced Atomic-Frequency Comb (AFC) memories. Two methods are used to distinguish authentic entities from forgery attempts: on the one hand, a statistical approach is used after calibration of its defining parameter $\mu$. Alternatively, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is designed and trained to learn the underlying different structure of that input data coming from adversaries in comparison to that one coming from legitimate parties. Both methods achieve a correct classification rate larger than 0.80 for memory storage time of 150 $\mu \mathrm{s}$ and a 1 $\mathrm{km}$ distance between parties.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting and photonic technologies are envisioned to play a key role in the Quantum Internet. However the hybridization of these technologies requires functional quantum transducers for converting superconducting qubits, exploited in quantum computation, into ``flying'' qubits, able to propagate through the network (and vice-versa). In this paper, quantum transduction is theoretically investigated for a key functionality of the Quantum Internet, namely, multipartite entanglement distribution. Different communication models for quantum transduction are provided, in order to make the entanglement distribution possible. The proposed models departs from the large heterogeneity of hardware solutions available in literature, abstracting from the particulars of the specific solutions with a communication engineering perspective. Then, a performance analysis of the proposed models is conducted through key communication metrics, such as quantum capacity and entanglement generation probability. The analysis reveals that -- although the considered communication metrics depend on transduction hardware parameters for all the proposed models -- the particulars of the considered transduction paradigm play a relevant role in the overall entanglement distribution performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonclassicality in composite quantum systems depicts several puzzling manifestations, with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement, Schr\"odinger steering, and Bell nonlocality being the most celebrated ones. In addition to those, an unentangled quantum state can also exhibit nonclassicality, as evidenced from notions such as quantum discord and work deficit. In this work, we present a general framework for exploring quantumness of correlations in multipartite quantum states. By exploiting the different signatures reflected on observable quantities depending on whether subsystems of a composite systems are probed jointly or independently, we introduce an operational quantifier of nonclassicality, termed {\em ergodiscord}. As we show, this newly proposed quantifier faithfully captures nonclassicality in any bipartite quantum state, while being fundamentally distinct from the original quantum discord. Moreover, ergodiscord uncovers an intriguing phenomenon called `nonlocal energy locking', where a useful form of energy (i.e. work) gets locked in correlations of nonclassical states. We also show that a mixed nonclassical state can lock more work than the maximally entangled state of the corresponding system, establishing an interesting super-additivity phenomenon of nonlocal energy locking. The present work may inspire novel designs of quantum energy storage devices by utilizing nonclassical correlations in composite quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Slow decay rate of correlations induced by long-range extended Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the impact of long-range Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in the extended $XY$ model on the phase diagram as well as the static and dynamical properties of quantum and classical correlation functions. It is known that in the nearest-neighbor $XY$ model with DM interaction, the transition from the gapless chiral phase to a gapped one occurs when the strengths of the DM interaction and anisotropy coincide. We exhibit that the critical line gets modified with the range of interactions which decay according to power-law. Specifically, instead of being gapless in the presence of a strong DM interaction, a gapped region emerges which grows with the increase of the moderate fall-off rate (quasi-long range regime) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The gapless chiral phase can also be separated from a gapped one by the decay patterns of quantum mutual information and classical correlation with distant sites of the ground state which are independent of the fall-off rate in the gapless zone. We observe that the corresponding critical lines that depend on the fall-off rate can also be determined from the effective central charge involved in the scaling of entanglement entropy. We illustrate that in a non-equilibrium setting, the relaxation dynamics of classical correlation, the decay rate of total correlation, and the growth rate of entanglement entropy can be employed to uncover whether the evolving Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the initial state are gapped or gapless.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum system with a tunable bath temperature provides an additional degree of freedom for quantum simulators. Such a system can be realized by parametrically modulating the coupling between the system and the bath. Here, by coupling a transmon qubit to a lossy Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement (SNAIL) mode, we experimentally create a tunable bath for the qubit mode. The effective temperature of this bath can be precisely controlled, ranging from negative to positive values. We show that the qubit can be thermalized to equilibrium with different population distributions under different parametric pumping conditions. We further extend our method to the third level of the transmon, demonstrating its potential utility beyond the two-level case. Our results provide a useful tool that can be readily integrated with quantum simulators that would benefit from a nontrivial photon population distribution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo and Stabilizer States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum-Monte-Carlo technique known as the Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) relies on a crucial no-branching condition: the SSE sampling is carried out in the computational basis, and the no-branching assumption ensures that superpositions of basis-states do not appear when operators are applied. Without this proviso, the number of complex amplitudes would grow exponentially with the number of qubits and would eventually overwhelm the memory and processing power of a classical computer. However, the action of Clifford group elements on stabilizer states can be very efficiently described without resorting to an amplitude description. We explore how stabilizer states allow an extension of the SSE technique, and we give an example of a toy model that can be studied in this way. The method is also illustrated using the Transverse-Field Ising model.</description>

      <title>State learning from pairs of states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose you receive a sequence of qubits where each qubit is guaranteed to be in one of two pure states, but you do not know what those states are. Your task is to determine the states. This can be viewed as a kind of quantum state learning -- or quantum state estimation. A problem is that, without more information, all that can be determined is the density matrix of the sequence and, in general, density matrices can be decomposed into pure states in many different ways. To solve the problem, additional information, either classical or quantum, is required. We show that if an additional copy of each qubit is supplied -- that is, one receives pairs of qubits, both in the same state, rather than single qubits -- the task can be accomplished. This is possible because the mixed two-qubit state has a unique decomposition into pure product states. For illustration, we simulate numerically the symmetric, informationally complete measurement of a sequence of qubit pairs and show that the unknown states and their respective probabilities of occurrence can be inferred from the data with high accuracy. Finally, we propose an experiment that employs a product measurement and can be realized with existing technology, and we demonstrate how the data tell us the states and their probabilities. We find that it is enough to detect a few thousand qubit pairs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Purity Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum purity amplification (QPA) provides a novel approach to counteracting the pervasive noise that degrades quantum states. We present the optimal QPA protocol for general quantum systems and global noise, resolving a two-decade open problem. Under strong depolarization, our protocol achieves an exponential reduction in sample complexity over the best-known methods. We provide an efficient implementation of the protocol based on generalized quantum phase estimation. Additionally, we introduce SWAPNET, a sparse and shallow circuit that enables QPA for near-term experiments. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol applied to quantum simulation of Hamiltonian evolution, enhancing the fidelity of input states even under circuit-level noise. Our findings suggest that QPA could improve the performance of quantum information processing tasks, particularly in the context of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, where reducing the effect of noise with limited resources is critical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses frequency crowding in SNAIL-based superconducting quantum modules. First, we present design constraints by describing a physical model for realizable gates within a module, and building a fidelity model using error budgeting derived from device characteristics. Second, we tackle the allocation problem by analyzing the impact of frequency crowding on gate fidelity as the radix of the module increases. We explore whether the heuristic gate fidelity can be optimized with a discrete set of qubit frequencies while adhering to defined separation thresholds. By leveraging a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we demonstrate scalable frequency allocation strategies that minimize spectator-induced errors. Our results further indicate that removing edges leads to improved gate fidelities while maintaining sufficient connectivity, suggesting that edge density is not a limiting factor for NISQ-scale benchmarks. The findings have implications for designing robust, high-fidelity quantum systems with practical constraints on hardware and connectivity.</description>

Abstract: By examining the internal energy and the heat capacity of a harmonically trapped ideal Bose gas within the Dunkl formalism, we show that the Wigner parameter influences the slopes of these thermodynamic functions in the critical region, reflecting its role in modifying the statistical properties of the system. However, despite these modifications, the phase transition itself retains the same order and critical exponents as in the standard case, in accordance with symmetry arguments. Furthermore, upon analyzing the classical behavior, we establish both upper and lower bounds for the Wigner parameter by ensuring thermodynamic consistency in different temperature regimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars beyond the PXP model in Rydberg simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent revivals recently observed in Rydberg atom simulators have challenged our understanding of thermalization and attracted much interest to the concept of quantum many-body scars (QMBSs). QMBSs are non-thermal highly excited eigenstates that coexist with typical eigenstates in the spectrum of many-body Hamiltonians, and have since been reported in multiple theoretical models, including the so-called PXP model, approximately realized by Rydberg simulators. At the same time, questions of how common QMBSs are and in what models they are physically realized remain open. In this Letter, we demonstrate that QMBSs exist in a broader family of models that includes and generalizes PXP to longer-range constraints and states with different periodicity. We show that in each model, multiple QMBS families can be found. Each of them relies on a different approximate $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra, leading to oscillatory dynamics in all cases. However, in contrast to the PXP model, their observation requires launching dynamics from weakly entangled initial states rather than from a product state. QMBSs reported here may be experimentally probed using Rydberg atom simulator in the regime of longer-range Rydberg blockades.</description>

      <title>Assessing non-Gaussian quantum state conversion with the stellar rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23721v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State conversion is a fundamental task in quantum information processing. Quantum resource theories allow to analyze and bound conversions that use restricted sets of operations. In the context of continuous-variable systems, state conversions restricted to Gaussian operations are crucial for both fundamental and practical reasons -- particularly in state preparation and quantum computing with bosonic codes. However, previous analysis did not consider the relevant case of approximate state conversion. In this work, we introduce a framework for assessing approximate Gaussian state conversion by extending the stellar rank to the approximate stellar rank, which serves as an operational measure of non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds for Gaussian state conversion under both approximate and probabilistic conditions, yielding new no-go results for non-Gaussian state preparation and enabling a reliable assessment of the performance of generic Gaussian conversion protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wineland parameter aims at detecting metrologically useful entangled states, called spin-squeezed states, from expectations and variances of total angular momenta. {However, efficient strategies for estimating this parameter in practice have yet to be determined and in particular, the effects of a finite number of measurements remain insufficiently addressed. We formulate the detection of spin squeezing as a hypothesis-testing problem, where the null hypothesis assumes that the experimental data can be explained by non-spin-squeezed states. Within this framework, we derive upper and lower bounds on the p-value to quantify the statistical evidence against the null hypothesis.} By applying our statistical test to data obtained in multiple experiments, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that non-spin squeezed states were measured with a p-value of 5\% or less in most cases. We also find an explicit non-spin squeezed state according to the Wineland parameter reproducing most of the observed results with a p-value exceeding 5\%. More generally, our results provide a rigorous method to establish robust statistical evidence of spin squeezing from the Wineland parameter in future experiments,accounting for finite statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian (NH) skin effect is a truly NH feature, which manifests itself as an accumulation of states, known as skin states, on the boundaries of a system. In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Beyond reviewing necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect, we discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, stemming from the spectral topology, and show how skin states can be distinguished from topological boundary states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in one-dimensional non-interacting systems, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in many-body systems are highlighted. Lastly, experimental signatures and applications are discussed, and an outlook is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum symmetrization is the task of transforming a non-strictly increasing list of $n$ integers into an equal superposition of all permutations of the list (or more generally, performing this operation coherently on a superposition of such lists). This task plays a key role in initial state preparation for first-quantized simulations. Motivated by an application to fermionic systems, various algorithms have been proposed to solve a weaker version of symmetrization in which the input list is strictly increasing, but the general symmetrization problem with repetitions in the input list has not been well studied. We present the first efficient quantum algorithms for the general symmetrization problem. If $m$ is the greatest possible value of the input list, our first algorithm symmetrizes any single classical input list using $\tilde{O}(\log n)$ depth and $O(n\log n + \log m)$ ancilla qubits, and our second algorithm symmetrizes an arbitrary superposition of input lists using $\tilde{O}(\log^3 n)$ depth and $O(n\log n)$ ancilla qubits. Our algorithms enable efficient simulation of bosonic quantum systems in first quantization and can prepare (superpositions of) Dicke states of any Hamming weight in $\tilde{O}(\log n)$ depth (respectively, $\tilde{O}(\log^3 n)$ depth) using $O(n\log n)$ ancilla qubits. We also propose an $\tilde{O}(\log^3 n)$-depth quantum algorithm to transform second-quantized states to first-quantized states. Using this algorithm, QFT-based quantum telescope arrays can image brighter photon sources, extending quantum interferometric imaging systems to a new regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model for a finite-size particle detector, which allows us to derive its stress-energy tensor. This tensor is obtained from a covariant Lagrangian that describes not only the quantum field that models the detector, $\phi_{\text{d}}$, but also the systems responsible for its localization: a complex scalar field, $\psi_{\text{c}}$, and a perfect fluid. The local interaction between the detector and the complex field ensures the square integrability of the detector modes, while the fluid serves to define the spatial profile of $\psi_{\text{c}}$, localizing it in space. We then demonstrate that, under very general conditions, the resulting energy tensor -- incorporating all components of the system -- is physically reasonable and satisfies the energy conditions.</description>

Abstract: We analyze how non-relativistic effective models for the magnetic coupling of a spin to the electromagnetic field (proportional to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}\cdot \boldsymbol{B}$) emerge from a full quantum field theoretical description of charged fermionic fields with the quantum electromagnetic field. This allows us to keep track of relativistic corrections to the models commonly used in experimental spin physics. We discuss how this interaction compares to the usual simplified models used in relativistic quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits incorporating Josephson elements represent a promising hardware platform for quantum technologies. Potential applications include scalable quantum computing, microwave quantum networks, and quantum-limited amplifiers. However, progress in Josephson junction-based quantum technologies is facing the ongoing challenge of minimizing loss channels. This is also true for parametric superconducting devices based on nonlinear Josephson resonators. In this work, we report on the fabrication and characterization of low-loss Josephson parametric devices operated in the GHz frequency range, showing record internal quality factors. Specifically, we achieve internal quality factors $Q_\mathrm{int}$ significantly exceeding $10^5$ for both Josephson parametric converters and Josephson parametric amplifiers in the single-photon regime by fitting the scattering data. We confirm the extracted $Q_\mathrm{int}$ values by analyzing purity of squeezed vacuum states generated by these devices. These low-loss devices mark a significant step forward in realizing high-performance quantum circuits, enabling further advancements in superconducting quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>The effect of curvature on local observables in quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the leading order corrections to the expected value of the squared field amplitude of a massless real scalar quantum field due to curvature in a localized region of spacetime. We use Riemann normal coordinates to define localized field operators in a curved spacetime that are analogous to their flat space counterparts, and the Hadamard condition to find the leading order curvature corrections to the field correlations. We then apply our results to particle detector models, quantifying the effect of spacetime curvature in localized field probes.</description>

      <title>Singular transport in non-equilibrium strongly internal-coupled 1D tilted field spin-1/2 chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium spin-chain systems have been attracting increasing interest in energy transport. This work studies a one-dimensional non-equilibrium Ising chain immersed in a tilted magnetic field, every spin contacts a Boson reservoir with the dissipative system-environment interaction. We analytically investigate the dynamics and the steady-state energy transport taking advantage of the Born-Markov-secular master equation. In the longitudinal field, one can find that the non dissipative $N^\prime$ spins decompose the spin chain into $N^\prime +1$ independent subchains and block the heat currents from the hot end to the cool end. Moreover, for the non-dissipative $\mu$th spin, its nearest two bulk spins become the nodal spins in the subchains and have the corresponding energy correction of $\pm J_{\mu-1,\mu}$ and $\pm J_{\mu,\mu+1}$ depending on the excited/ground state of the $\mu$th spin. Therefore, a magnetically controlled heat modulator can be designed by adjusting the direction of the magnetic field in which the non-dissipative spin is located. For the transverse field case, the whole Hilbert space of the chain can always be divided into two independent subspaces regardless of whether the bulk spin is dissipative. This work provides new insight into the dynamics and energy transport of the dissipative Ising model.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Lindblad dynamics via time-rescaling engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a universal method for accelerating Lindblad dynamics that preserves the original trajectory through Hilbert space. The technique provides exact fast processes analytically, which are Markovian and do not require manipulation of the environment properties, by time-rescaling a reference dynamics. In particular, the engineered control protocols are based only on local interactions, and no additional control fields are required compared to the reference protocol. We demonstrate the scheme with two examples: a driven two-level system in an amplitude damping channel and the dissipative transverse field Ising model. We also show that, by starting with a reference process which is the fastest connecting two states under a certain constraint, the method provides other optimal processes satisfying modified constraints. Our approach can help advance techniques for quantum control and computation towards more complex noisy systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics in an emergent quantum-like state space generated by a nonlinear classical network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work exploits a framework whereby a graph (in the mathematical sense) serves to connect a classical system to a state space that we call `quantum-like' (QL). The QL states comprise arbitrary superpositions of states in a tensor product basis. The graph plays a special dual role by directing design of the classical system and defining the state space. We study a specific example of a large, dynamical classical system -- a system of coupled phase oscillators -- that maps, via a graph, to the QL state space. We investigate how mixedness of the state diminishes or increases as the underlying classical system synchronizes or de-synchronizes respectively. This shows the interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of the variables of the classical system and the QL state space. We prove that maps from one time point to another in the state space are linear maps. In the limit of a strongly phase-locked classical network -- that is, where couplings between phase oscillators are very large -- the state space evolves according to unitary dynamics, whereas in the cases of weaker synchronization, the classical variables act as a hidden environment that promotes decoherence of superpositions. We examine how similar the properties of QL states are to quantum states. We find that during decoherence of the QL states, the off-diagonal density matrix elements decay and that this decay can be observed in any basis we choose for measurement. More surprisingly, we show that a no-cloning theorem (that is, a state of a QL bit cannot be copied) applies not only to the QL states, but also to the underlying classical system.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quantum mechanics with real-valued Schr\"{o}dinger equation,single-event quantum-path dynamics, Mauprtuis path in parameter space, and branching paths beyond semiclassics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics and the Schr\"{o}dinger function (or the so-called wavefunction) in the following four aspects. (1) The Schr\"{o}dinger equation is reconstructed from scratch in the real field only, without referring to Newtonian mechanics nor optics. Only the very simple conditions such as the space-time translational symmetry and the conservation of flux and energy are imposed on the factorization of the density distribution in configuration space, giving rise to a two-dimensional real vector. On returning to the original Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the imaginary number arises naturally. (2) Like the Langevin equation in a Brownian dynamics, we formulate a single-event path dynamics in quantum mechanics, contrasting with the Schr\"{o}dinger distribution function. The path thus attained is referred to as one-world path, which represents, for instance, a path of a singly launched electron in the double-slit experiment that leaves a spot at the measurement board, while many of accumulated spots give rise to the fringe pattern. We start from the Feynman-Kac formula to draw a relation between a stochastic dynamics and the parabolic differential equations, to one of which the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is transformed. (3) To highlight the roles of the flux and energy conservation in the Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics, we build that the quantum Maupertuis-Hamilton principle, which reveals the symplectic structure in the parameter space. (4) We track how the inherent quantum nature like the Huygens-principle-like properties is built. We show that classical trajectory components in semiclassics are demanded to branch into many coherent pieces beyond the semiclassical regime and dissolve into the deep dynamics of genuine full quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and theoretically demonstrate a technique that allows one to compensate for chromatic aberrations of traditional electron lenses in ultrafast electron microscopes. The technique is based on space- and time-dependent phase modulation of a pulsed electron beam using interaction with a shaped pulsed ponderomotive lens. The energy-selective focal distance is reached by combining the electron temporal chirp with the time-dependent size of the effective potential, with which the electrons interact. As a result, chromatic aberration can be reduced by up to a factor of seven. This approach paves the way for advanced transverse and longitudinal wavefront shaping of electrons in free space.</description>

      <title>Optimal control in phase space applied to minimal-time transfer of thermal atoms in optical traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.</description>

      <title>RBM-Based Simulated Quantum Annealing for Graph Isomorphism Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The graph isomorphism problem remains a fundamental challenge in computer science, driving the search for efficient decision algorithms. Due to its ambiguous computational complexity, heuristic approaches such as simulated annealing are frequently used, achieving high solution probabilities while avoiding exhaustive enumeration. However, traditional simulated annealing usually struggles with low sampling efficiency and reduced solution-finding probability in complex or large graph problems. In this study, we integrate the principles of quantum technology to address the graph isomorphism problem. By mapping the solution space to a quantum many-body system, we developed a parameterized model for variational simulated annealing. This approach emphasizes the regions of the solution space that are most likely to contain the optimal solution, thereby enhancing the search accuracy.Artificial neural networks were utilized to parameterize the quantum many-body system, leveraging their capacity for efficient function approximation to perform accurate sampling in the intricate energy landscapes of large graph problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time evolution of the one-point probability vector of stochastic processes and quantum processes for $N$-level systems have been unified. Hence, quantum states and quantum operations can be regarded as generalizations of the one-point probability vectors and stochastic matrices, respectively. More essentially, based on the unification, it has been proven that completely positive divisibility (CP-divisibility) for quantum operations is the natural extension of the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. It is thus shown that CP-divisibility is a necessary but insufficient condition for a quantum process to be specified as Markovian. The main results have been illustrated through a dichotomic Markov process.</description>

      <title>Bridging wire and gate cutting with ZX-calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit cutting refers to a series of techniques that allow one to partition a quantum computation on a large quantum computer into several quantum computations on smaller devices. This usually comes at the price of a sampling overhead, that is quantified by the $1$-norm of the associated decomposition. The applicability of these techniques relies on the possibility of finding decompositions of the ideal, global unitaries into quantum operations that can be simulated onto each sub-register, which should ideally minimize the $1$-norm. In this work, we show how these decompositions can be obtained diagrammatically using ZX-calculus expanding on the work of Ufrecht et al. [arXiv:2302.00387]. The central idea of our work is that since in ZX-calculus only connectivity matters, it should be possible to cut wires in ZX-diagrams by inserting known decompositions of the identity in standard quantum circuits. We show how, using this basic idea, many of the gate decompositions known in the literature can be re-interpreted as an instance of wire cuts in ZX-diagrams. Furthermore, we obtain improved decompositions for multi-qubit controlled-Z (MCZ) gates with $1$-norm equal to $3$ for any number of qubits and any partition, which we argue to be optimal. Our work gives new ways of thinking about circuit cutting that can be particularly valuable for finding decompositions of large unitary gates. Besides, it sheds light on the question of why exploiting classical communication decreases the 1-norm of a wire cut but does not do so for certain gate decompositions. In particular, using wire cuts with classical communication, we obtain gate decompositions that do not require classical communication.</description>

      <title>Protected phase gate for the $0$-$\pi$ qubit using its internal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protected superconducting qubits such as the $0$-$\pi$ qubit promise to substantially reduce physical error rates through a multi-mode encoding. This protection comes at the cost of controllability, as standard techniques for quantum gates are ineffective. We propose a protected phase gate for the $0$-$\pi$ qubit that utilises an internal mode of the circuit as an ancilla. The gate is achieved by varying the qubit-ancilla coupling via a tunable Josephson element. Our scheme is a modified version of a protected gate proposed by Brooks, Kitaev and Preskill that uses an external oscillator as an ancilla. We find that our scheme is compatible with the protected regime of the $0$-$\pi$ qubit, and does not suffer from spurious coupling to additional modes of the $0$-$\pi$ circuit. Through numerical simulations, we study how the gate error scales with the circuit parameters of the $0$-$\pi$ qubit and the tunable Josephson element that enacts the gate.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the use of driven qubits coupled to a harmonic oscillator to implement a $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$-gate. By dressing the qubits through an external driving field, the qubits and the harmonic oscillator can be selectively coupled, leading to effective qubit-qubit interactions. We analyze a qubit readout mechanism based on the detection of a shift of the harmonic oscillator's resonance frequency, and demonstrate that when coupled to low-frequency resonators, dressed qubits provide a more robust readout than bare qubits in the presence of damping and thermal effects. Furthermore, we study the impact of various system parameters on the fidelity of the two-qubit gate, identifying an optimal range for quantum computation. Our findings guide the implementation of high-fidelity quantum gates in experimental setups, for example those employing nanoscale mechanical resonators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum transduction of an rf/microwave signal to the optical domain, and vice versa, paves the way for technologies that exploit the advantages of each domain to perform quantum operations. Since electro-optomechanical devices implement a simultaneous coupling of a mechanical oscillator to both an rf/microwave field and an optical field, they are suitable for the realization of a quantum transducer. The membrane-in-the-middle setup is a possible solution, once its vibrational mode is cooled down to ultra cryogenic temperature for achieving quantum operation. This work is focused on the mechanical characterization via an optical interferometric probe, down to T=18mK, of a loss-shielded metalized membrane designed for this purpose. A stroboscopic technique has been exploited for revealing a mechanical quality factor up to 64 millions at the lowest temperature. In fact, with continuous illumination and a cryostat temperature below 1K, the heat due to optical absorption is not efficiently dissipated anymore, and the membrane remains hotter than its environment.</description>

      <title>Efficient mutual magic and magic capacity with matrix product states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are extensively utilized as quantum sensors for imaging fields at the nanoscale. The ultra-high sensitivity of NV magnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron spins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics, spintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond sensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that can be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this study, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted signal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation technique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2) layer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin density aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the diamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of $2,000$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our NV sensors ($200$~$\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo coherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a comprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV coherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the observed spin dynamics. Our findings are directly transferable to other quantum platforms, including nanoscale solid state qubits and superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Thermal Noise as a Window into the Quantum Vacuum: Spatial Patterns Revealed by Simple Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the spatial structure of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, predicted by quantum electrodynamics, can be indirectly observed using thermal noise at radio frequencies. Using simple lab equipment like coaxial cables and RF splitters, we detect a clear suppression of thermal noise near conducting boundaries, mirroring the expected modulation of vacuum modes. This provides accessible, experimental evidence for quantum vacuum behavior without requiring advanced optics or cryogenics.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of interacting bosons with propagating waveguide photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical networks composed of interconnected waveguides are a versatile platform to simulate bosonic physical phenomena. Significant work in the non-interacting regime has demonstrated the capabilities of this platform to simulate many exotic effects such as photon transport in the presence of gauge fields, dynamics of quantum walks, and topological transition and dissipation phenomena. However, the extension of these concepts to simulating interacting quantum many-body phenomena such as the Bose-Hubbard and the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) physics has remained elusive. In this work, we address this problem and demonstrate a framework for quantum many-body simulation as well as drive and dissipation in photonic waveguides. Specifically, we show that for waveguide photons, a tunable on-site interaction can be simulated using a photon-number-selective phase gate. We propose an implementation of such a phase gate based on a three-level-atom-mediated photon subtraction and addition. We apply this approach to bosonic lattice models and propose circuits that can accurately simulate the Bose-Hubbard and FQH Hamiltonian as benchmarking examples. Moreover, we show how to simulate the Lindbladian evolution with engineered dissipators such that the steady state of the Lindbadlian corresponds to the ground state of desired Hamiltonians. Our scheme extends the waveguide photonic simulation platform to the strongly interacting quantum many-body regime while retaining all of its crucial advantages, such as single-site addressability, Hamiltonian parameter controllability, and hardware efficiency.</description>

Abstract: The Wigner function of a free quantum particle propagating on a plane is derived.
  Two options are discussed. First the particle with fixed components of the momentum is mentioned. Then the particle of given energy and angular momentum is considered. The analysis does not refer to the Hilbert space formulation of the problem at all. One starts from
  a choice of coordinates on the symplectic space $(\mathbb{R}^{4},\,\omega)$ suitable for representation of eigenstates of the discussed particle. Then the Moyal $\star_{(\text{M})}$ -- product on the phase space is derived with the use of the Fedosov algorithm adapted to curvilinear coordinates on a flat phase space. Next the eigenvalue equations for the Wigner eigenfunction are solved. Finally the physically acceptable solutions are identified.</description>

      <title>Coherent State Assisted Entanglement Generation Between Quantum Memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating entanglement deterministically at a capacity-approaching rate is critical for next-generation quantum networks. We propose weak-coherent-state-assisted protocols that can generate entanglement near-deterministically between reflective-cavity-based quantum memories at a success rate that exceeds the 50\% limit associated with single-photon-mediated schemes. The most pronounced benefit is shown in the low-channel-loss regime and persists even with moderate noise. We extend our protocols to entangle an array of memories in a GHZ state, and infer that it yields an exponential speed-up compared to previous single-photon-based protocols.</description>

      <title>A note on the quantum Wielandt inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that the index of primitivity of any primitive unital Schwarz map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, where $D$ is the dimension of the underlying matrix algebra. This inequality was first proved by Rahaman for Schwarz maps which were both unital and trace preserving. As we show, the assumption of unitality is basically innocuous, but in general not all primitive unital Schwarz maps are trace preserving. Therefore, the precise purpose of this note is to showcase how to apply the method of Rahaman to unital primitive Schwarz maps that don't preserve trace. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, so in particular this bound holds for arbitrary primitive completely positive maps. We briefly discuss of how this relates to a conjecture of Perez-Garcia, Verstraete, Wolf and Cirac.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanics of inverted potential well -- Hermitian Hamiltonian with imaginary eigenvalues, quantum-classical correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We in this paper study the quantization of a particle in an inverted potential well. The Hamiltonian is Hermitian, while the potential is unbounded below. Classically the particle moves away acceleratingly from the center of potential top. The existing eigenstates must be unstable with imaginary eigenvalues, which characterize the decay rate of states. We solve the Hamiltonian problem of inverted potential well by the algebraic method with imaginary-frequency raising and lowering boson operators similar to the normal oscillator case. The boson number operator is non-Hermitian, while the integer-number eigenvalues are, of course, real. Dual sets of eigenstates, denoted by "bra" and "ket", are requested corresponding respectively to the complex conjugate number-operators. Orthonormal condition exists between the "bra" and "ket" states. We derive a spatially non-localized generating function, from which $n$-th eigenfunctions can be generated by the raising operators in coordinate representation. The "bra" and "ket" generating functions are mutually normalized with the imaginary integration measure. The probability density operators defined between the "bra" and "ket" states are non-Hermitian invariants, which lead to the Schr\H{o}dinger equations respectively for the "bra" and "ket" states. While probabilities of "bra" and "ket" states themselves are not conserved quantities because of the decay. The imaginary-frequency boson coherent states are defined as eigenstates of lowering operators. The minimum uncertainty relation is proved explicitly in the coherent states. Finally the probability average of Heisenberg equation in the coherent states is shown precisely in agreement with the classical equation of motion. The quantum-classical correspondence exists in the imaginary eigenvalue system.</description>

      <title>Engineering CSS surgery: compiling any CNOT in any code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for implementing logic in CSS-style quantum error correction codes, building on the surgery methods of Cowtan and Burton [CB24]. Our approach offers a systematic methodology for designing and analysing surgery protocols. At the physical level, we introduce the concept of subcodes, which encapsulate all the necessary data for performing surgery. At the logical level, leveraging homological algebra, subcodes enable us to track the logical operations induced by any surgery protocol, regardless of the choice of logical operator basis. In particular, we make no assumptions on the structure of the logical operators of the code, thereby eschewing the irreducibility assumption that has been necessary in other formulations of surgery for CSS codes [Coh+22; Cro+24; ZL24]. As a proof of concept, we develop a surgery protocol inspired by lattice surgery that implements a logical CNOT gate between any two logical qubits. Applicable to any CSS code, this protocol is highly versatile and facilitates the process of fault-tolerant design.</description>

      <title>Quadrature-Dependent Lattice Dynamics of Dissipative Microcombs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of coupled networks with parametric amplification of the vacuum fluctuations has garnered increasing interest due to its intricate physics and potential applications. In these systems, parametric interactions lead to beam-splitter coupling and two-mode squeezing, creating quadrature-dependent dynamics. These systems can be modeled as bosonic networks, arrays or lattices, exhibiting exotic effects such as unidirectional amplification and non-Hermitian chiral transport which influence multimode squeezing. However, exploring and controlling these network dynamics experimentally in all-optical systems remains challenging. Recent advancements in integrated nonlinear micro-resonators, known as Kerr microcombs, enable the generation and control of broadband high-repetition pulses on microchips. Kerr microcombs exhibit intriguing nonlinear dynamics, where coherent photons occupy discrete spectral lines, leading to multimode squeezed vacuum states. In this work, we explore the lattice dynamics of vacuum fluctuations driven by dissipative Kerr microcombs. We design a photonic chip where a spontaneously emergent pair of pulses creates extended multimode states of parametrically amplified vacuum fluctuations. These states exhibit oscillatory dynamics, with implications on squeezing and secondary comb formation. By employing integrated micro-heaters, we tune the vacuum fluctuations to eliminate the oscillations, establishing a fundamental connection between non-Hermitian lattice symmetries and Kerr combs, paving the way for exotic quadrature-dependent optical networks with broad implications for quantum and classical photonic technologies.</description>

Abstract: We use an exact Moreau-Yosida regularized formulation to obtain the exchange-correlation potential for periodic systems. We reveal a profound connection between rigorous mathematical principles and efficient numerical implementation, which marks the first computation of a Moreau-Yosida-based inversion for physical systems. We develop a mathematically rigorous inversion algorithm which is demonstrated for representative bulk materials, specifically bulk silicon, gallium arsenide, and potassium chloride. Our inversion algorithm allows the construction of rigorous error bounds that we are able to verify numerically. This unlocks a new pathway to analyze Kohn-Sham inversion methods, which we expect in turn to foster mathematical approaches for developing approximate functionals.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A holographic CFT description of asymptotically flat spacetimes inherits vacuum degeneracies and IR divergences from its gravitational dual. We devise a Quantum Error Correcting (QEC) framework to encode both effects as correctable fluctuations on the CFT dual. The framework is physically motivated by embedding a chain of qudits in the so-called Klein spacetime and then taking a continuum $N\to \infty$ limit. At finite $N$ the qudit chain 1) enjoys a discrete version of celestial symmetries and 2) supports a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code. The limit results in hard states with quantized BMS hair in the celestial torus forming the logical subspace, robust under errors induced by soft radiation. Technically, the construction leverages the recently studied $w_{1+\infty}$ hierarchy of soft currents and its realization from a sigma model in twistor space.</description>

Abstract: This study proposes an explicit construction method for quantum quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes with a girth of 12. The proposed method designs parity-check matrices that maximize the girth while maintaining an orthogonal structure suitable for quantum error correction. By utilizing algebraic techniques, short cycles are eliminated, which improves error correction performance. Additionally, this method is extended to non-binary LDPC codes and spatially-coupled LDPC codes, demonstrating that both the girth and orthogonality can be preserved. The results of this study enable the design of high-performance quantum error-correcting codes without the need for random search.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of $X$ states in the long-time response of a locally perturbed many-body quantum impurity model. The emergence of the double-qubit state is heralded by the lack of decay of the response function as well as the out-of-time order correlator, signifying the trapping of excitations and hence information in edge modes. Surprisingly, after carrying out a quantum information theory characterization, we show that such states exhibit genuine quantum correlations.</description>

Abstract: Every state on the algebra $M_n$ of complex nxn matrices restricts to a state on any matrix system. Whereas the restriction to a matrix system is generally not open, we prove that the restriction to every *-subalgebra of $M_n$ is open.

      <title>Emergent Hydrodynamic Mode on SU(2) Plaquette Chains and Quantum Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Because of the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width approximately proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant Casimir-Polder repulsion with a monolayer topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force acting on a metastable polarized state of a two-level atomic system with a right-circularly polarized electric dipole transition in the presence of a monolayer topological insulator inhabiting an anomalous quantum Hall insulator state with a negative Chern number, finding that the force can be repulsive for a certain range within the far-field region. By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics across the first-order quantum transitions of one-dimensional quantum Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising models in a transverse field $g$, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field $h$ across their {\em magnetic} first-order quantum transition at $h=0$, for sufficiently small values of $|g|$. We consider nearest-neighbor Ising chains of size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. We focus on the out-of-equilibrium behavior arising from Kibble-Zurek protocols, in which $h$ is varied linearly in time with time scale $t_s$, i.e., $h(t)=t/t_s$. The system starts from the ground state at $h_i\equiv h(t_i)&lt;0$, where the longitudinal magnetization $M$ is negative. Then it evolves unitarily up to positive values of $h(t)$, where $M(t)$ becomes eventually positive. We identify several scaling regimes characterized by a nontrivial interplay between the size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$, which can be observed when the system is close to one of the many avoided level crossings that occur for $h\ge 0$. In the $L\to\infty$ limit, all these crossings approach $h=0^+$, making the study of the thermodynamic limit, defined as the limit $L\to\infty$ keeping $t$ and $t_s$ constant, problematic. We study such limit numerically, by first determining the large-$L$ quantum evolution at fixed $t_s$, and then analyzing its behavior with increasing $t_s$. Our analysis shows that the system switches from the initial state with $M&lt;0$ to a positively magnetized state at $h = h_*(t_s)&gt;0$, where $h_*(t_s)$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, apparently as $h_*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. This suggests the existence of a scaling behavior in terms of the rescaled time $\Omega = t \ln t_s/t_s$. The numerical results also show that the system converges to a nontrivial stationary state in the large-$t$ limit, characterized by an energy significantly larger than that of the corresponding homogeneously magnetized ground state.</description>

      <title>Operatorial formulation of crimo-taxis phenomena in a street</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the ladder operators and a quantum-like approach are used to construct an operatorial version of a model dubbed crimo-taxis. In a classical framework, the crimo-taxis model is represented by reaction-diffusion partial differential equations describing a population divided into three interacting subgroups (ordinary citizens, drug users/dealers, and law enforcement personnel). In this new framework, the agents of the subgroups are modeled using annihilation, creation, and number fermionic operators, and their time evolution is assumed to be ruled by a Hermitian time-independent Hamiltonian operator suitable to capture the interactions among the subgroups. Furthermore, a recent extension of the standard Heisenberg view, namely $(\mathcal{H},\rho)$--induced dynamics, is also taken into account. Two scenarios, characterized by different initial spatial distributions of the subgroups, are considered. The results of some numerical simulations in a one--dimensional setting are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Circuit Cutting for Hybrid Quantum-Classical High-Performance Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most quantum computers today are constrained by hardware limitations, particularly the number of available qubits, causing significant challenges for executing large-scale quantum algorithms. Circuit cutting has emerged as a key technique to overcome these limitations by decomposing large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits that can be executed independently and later reconstructed. In this work, we introduce Qdislib, a distributed and flexible library for quantum circuit cutting, designed to seamlessly integrate with hybrid quantum-classical high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Qdislib employs a graph-based representation of quantum circuits to enable efficient partitioning, manipulation and execution, supporting both wire cutting and gate cutting techniques. The library is compatible with multiple quantum computing libraries, including Qiskit and Qibo, and leverages distributed computing frameworks to execute subcircuits across CPUs, GPUs, and quantum processing units (QPUs) in a fully parallelized manner. We present a proof of concept demonstrating how Qdislib enables the distributed execution of quantum circuits across heterogeneous computing resources, showcasing its potential for scalable quantum-classical workflows.</description>
