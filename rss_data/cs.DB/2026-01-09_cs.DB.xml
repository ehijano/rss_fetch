      <title>AHA: Scalable Alternative History Analysis for Operational Timeseries Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many operational systems collect high-dimensional timeseries data about users/systems on key performance metrics. For instance, ISPs, content distribution networks, and video delivery services collect quality of experience metrics for user sessions associated with metadata (e.g., location, device, ISP). Over such historical data, operators and data analysts often need to run retrospective analysis; e.g., analyze anomaly detection algorithms, experiment with different configurations for alerts, evaluate new algorithms, and so on. We refer to this class of workloads as alternative history analysis for operational datasets. We show that in such settings, traditional data processing solutions (e.g., data warehouses, sampling, sketching, big-data systems) either pose high operational costs or do not guarantee accurate replay. We design and implement a system, called AHA (Alternative History Analytics), that overcomes both challenges to provide cost efficiency and fidelity for high-dimensional data. The design of AHA is based on analytical and empirical insights about such workloads: 1) the decomposability of underlying statistics; 2) sparsity in terms of active number of subpopulations over attribute-value combinations; and 3) efficiency structure of aggregation operations in modern analytics databases. Using multiple real-world datasets and as well as case-studies on production pipelines at a large video analytics company, we show that AHA provides 100% accuracy for a broad range of downstream tasks and up to 85x lower total cost of ownership (i.e., compute + storage) compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Does Provenance Interact?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data provenance (the process of determining the origin and derivation of data outputs) has applications across multiple domains including explaining database query results and auditing scientific workflows. Despite decades of research, provenance tracing remains challenging due to computational costs and storage overhead. In streaming systems such as Apache Flink, provenance graphs can grow super-linearly with data volume, posing significant scalability challenges. Temporal provenance is a promising direction, attaching timestamps to provenance information, enabling time-focused queries without maintaining complete historical records. However, existing temporal provenance methods primarily focus on system-level debugging, leaving a gap in data management applications. This paper proposes an agenda that uses Temporal Interaction Networks (TINs) to represent temporal provenance efficiently. We demonstrate TINs' applicability across streaming systems, transportation networks, and financial networks. We classify data into discrete and liquid types, define five temporal provenance query types, and propose a state-based indexing approach. Our vision outlines research directions toward making temporal provenance a practical tool for large-scale dataflows.</description>

      <title>Structural Indexing of Relational Databases for the Evaluation of Free-Connex Acyclic Conjunctive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an index structure to boost the evaluation of free-connex acyclic conjunctive queries (fc-ACQs) over relational databases. The main ingredient of the index associated with a given database $D$ is an auxiliary database $D_{col}$. Our main result states that for any fc-ACQ $Q$ over $D$, we can count the number of answers of $Q$ or enumerate them with constant delay after a preprocessing phase that takes time linear in the size of $D_{col}$.
  Unlike previous indexing methods based on values or order (e.g., B+ trees), our index is based on structural symmetries among tuples in a database, and the size of $D_{col}$ is related to the number of colors assigned to $D$ by Scheidt and Schweikardt's "relational color refinement" (2025). In the particular case of graphs, this coincides with the minimal size of an equitable partition of the graph. For example, the size of $D_{col}$ is logarithmic in the case of binary trees and constant for regular graphs. Even in the worst-case that $D$ has no structural symmetries among tuples at all, the size of $D_{col}$ is still linear in the size of $D$.
  Given that the size of $D_{col}$ is bounded by the size of $D$ and can be much smaller (even constant for some families of databases), our index is the first foundational result on indexing internal structural symmetries of a database to evaluate all fc-ACQs with performance potentially strictly smaller than the database size.</description>

      <title>LGTD: Local-Global Trend Decomposition for Season-Length-Free Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series decomposition into trend, seasonal structure, and residual components is a core primitive for downstream analytics such as anomaly detection, change-point detection, and forecasting. However, most existing seasonal-trend decomposition methods rely on user-specified or estimated season lengths and implicitly assume stable periodic structure. These assumptions limit robustness and deployability in large, heterogeneous collections where recurring patterns may drift, appear intermittently, or exist at multiple time scales.
  We propose LGTD (Local-Global Trend Decomposition), a season-length-free decomposition framework that represents a time series as the sum of a smooth global trend, adaptive local trends whose recurrence induces implicit (emergent) seasonal structure, and a residual component. Rather than explicitly modeling seasonality through a fixed or estimated period, LGTD treats seasonal structure as an emergent property arising from repeated local trend regimes. Concretely, LGTD first estimates a global trend capturing long-term evolution, then applies AutoTrend, an adaptive error-driven local linear trend inference module, to segment the detrended signal into short-lived piecewise-linear regimes. Residuals are obtained after removing both global and local trends.
  By eliminating manual season-length specification, LGTD supports automated, low-touch deployment across time series with irregular, drifting, or weakly periodic structure. We analyze computational complexity and show that LGTD scales linearly with series length under mild conditions. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate robust and balanced decomposition performance across fixed, transitive, and variable season-length settings, especially where period-based methods degrade.</description>

      <title>Responsibility Measures for Conjunctive Queries with Negation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We contribute to the recent line of work on responsibility measures that quantify the contributions of database facts to obtaining a query result. In contrast to existing work which has almost exclusively focused on monotone queries, here we explore how to define responsibility measures for unions of conjunctive queries with negated atoms (UCQ${}^\lnot$). Starting from the question of what constitutes a reasonable notion of explanation or relevance for queries with negated atoms, we propose two approaches, one assigning scores to (positive) database facts and the other also considering negated facts. Our approaches, which are orthogonal to the previously studied score of Reshef et al., can be used to lift previously studied scores for monotone queries, known as drastic Shapley and weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS), to UCQ$^\lnot$. We investigate the data and combined complexity of the resulting measures, notably showing that the WSMS measures are tractable in data complexity for all UCQ${}^\lnot$ queries and further establishing tractability in combined complexity for suitable classes of conjunctive queries with negation.</description>

      <title>Rule Rewriting Revisited: A Fresh Look at Static Filtering for Datalog and ASP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static filtering is a data-independent optimisation method for Datalog, which generalises algebraic query rewriting techniques from relational databases. In spite of its early discovery by Kifer and Lozinskii in 1986, the method has been overlooked in recent research and system development, and special cases are being rediscovered independently. We therefore recall the original approach, using updated terminology and more general filter predicates that capture features of modern systems, and we show how to extend its applicability to answer set programming (ASP). The outcome is strictly more general but also more complex than the classical approach: double exponential in general and single exponential even for predicates of bounded arity. As a solution, we propose tractable approximations of the algorithm that can still yield much improved logic programs in typical cases, e.g., it can improve the performance of rule systems over real-world data in the order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>SciIF: Benchmarking Scientific Instruction Following Towards Rigorous Scientific Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from general knowledge retrieval to complex scientific discovery, their evaluation standards must also incorporate the rigorous norms of scientific inquiry. Existing benchmarks exhibit a critical blind spot: general instruction-following metrics focus on superficial formatting, while domain-specific scientific benchmarks assess only final-answer correctness, often rewarding models that arrive at the right result with the wrong reasons. To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Optimizing Acyclic Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most research on query optimization has centered on binary join algorithms like hash join and sort-merge join. However, recent years have seen growing interest in theoretically optimal algorithms, notably Yannakakis' algorithm. These algorithms rely on join trees, which differ from the operator trees for binary joins and require new optimization techniques. We propose three approaches to constructing join trees for acyclic queries. First, we give an algorithm to enumerate all join trees of an alpha-acyclic query by edits with amortized constant delay, which forms the basis of a cost-based optimizer for acyclic joins. Second, we show that the Maximum Cardinality Search algorithm by Tarjan and Yannakakis constructs a unique shallowest join tree, rooted at any relation, for a Berge-acyclic query; this tree enables parallel execution of large join queries. Finally, we prove that any connected left-deep linear plan for a gamma-acyclic query can be converted into a join tree by a simple algorithm, allowing reuse of optimization infrastructure developed for binary joins.</description>
