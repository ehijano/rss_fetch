      <title>Large Language Models Polarize Ideologically but Moderate Affectively in Online Political Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping how people engage in political discourse online. We examine how the release of ChatGPT altered ideological and emotional patterns in the largest political forum on Reddit. Analysis of millions of comments shows that ChatGPT intensified ideological polarization: liberals became more liberal, and conservatives more conservative. This shift does not stem from the creation of more persuasive or ideologically extreme original content using ChatGPT. Instead, it originates from the tendency of ChatGPT-generated comments to echo and reinforce the viewpoint of original posts, a pattern consistent with algorithmic sycophancy. Yet, despite growing ideological divides, affective polarization, measured by hostility and toxicity, declined. These findings reveal that LLMs can simultaneously deepen ideological separation and foster more civil exchanges, challenging the long-standing assumption that extremity and incivility necessarily move together.</description>

      <title>Bank Runs With and Without Bank Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the causes and consequences of bank runs using a novel dataset on bank runs in the United States from 1863 to 1934. Applying natural language processing to historical newspapers, we identify 4,049 runs on individual banks. Runs are considerably more likely in weak banks but also occur in strong banks, especially in response to negative news about the real economy or the broader banking system. However, runs typically only result in failure for banks with weak fundamentals. Strong banks survive runs through various mechanisms, including interbank cooperation, equity injections, public signals of strength, and suspension of convertibility. At the local level, bank failures (with and without runs) translate into substantially larger declines in deposits and lending than runs without failures. Our findings suggest that poor bank fundamentals are necessary for bank runs to translate into failure and for bank distress to generate severe economic consequences.</description>

      <title>Manipulation in Prediction Markets: An Agent-based Modeling Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction markets mobilize financial incentives to forecast binary event outcomes through the aggregation of dispersed beliefs and heterogeneous information. Their growing popularity and demonstrated predictive accuracy in political elections have raised speculation and concern regarding their susceptibility to manipulation and the potential consequences for democratic processes. Using agent-based simulations combined with an analytic characterization of price dynamics, we study how high-budget agents can introduce price distortions in prediction markets. We explore the persistence and stability of these distortions in the presence of herding or stubborn agents, and analyze how agent expertise affects market-price variance. Firstly we propose an agent-based model of a prediction market in which bettors with heterogeneous expertise, noisy private information, variable learning rates and budgets observe the evolution of public opinion on a binary election outcome to inform their betting strategies in the market. The model exhibits stability across a broad parameter space, with complex agent behaviors and price interactions producing self-regulatory price discovery. Second, using this simulation framework, we investigate the conditions under which a highly resourced minority, or ''whale'' agent, with a biased valuation can distort the market price, and for how long. We find that biased whales can temporarily shift prices, with the magnitude and duration of distortion increasing when non-whale bettors exhibit herding behavior and slow learning. Our theoretical analysis corroborates these results, showing that whales can shift prices proportionally to their share of market capital, with distortion duration depending on non-whale learning rates and herding intensity.</description>

      <title>Pricing Catastrophe: How Extreme Political Shocks Reprice Sovereign Risk, Beliefs, and Growth Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme political shocks may reshape economies not only through contemporaneous disruption but by altering beliefs about the distribution of future states. We study how such belief ruptures affect the cost of capital, expectations, and macroeconomic dynamics, using the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel as a precisely timed shock. Leveraging monthly data from 2008 to 2025 and a donor pool of advanced economies, we estimate counterfactual paths using a matrix completion design with rolling-window cross-validation and placebo-based inference, corroborated by synthetic difference-in-differences. We document three core findings. First, long-horizon sovereign risk of Israel is persistently repriced. Ten-year yields and spreads relative to the United States rise sharply and remain elevated. Second, household welfare beliefs deteriorate durably, as reflected in consumer confidence. Third, medium-run momentum improves, captured by a strong rise in the OECD composite leading indicator. These patterns reveal risk-growth decoupling where tail-risk premia rise even as medium-horizon activity expectations strengthen. Our results highlight belief-driven channels as a central mechanism through which extreme ruptures shape macro-financial outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Smoothed GMM for Dynamic Quantile Preferences Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper suggests methods for estimation of the $\tau$-quantile, $\tau\in(0,1)$, as a parameter along with the other finite-dimensional parameters identified by general conditional quantile restrictions. We employ a generalized method of moments framework allowing for non-linearities and dependent data, where moment functions are smoothed to aid both computation and tractability. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators are established under weak assumptions. Simulations illustrate the finite-sample properties of the methods. An empirical application using a quantile intertemporal consumption model with multiple assets estimates the risk attitude, which is captured by $\tau$, together with the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.</description>

      <title>Normative Equivalence in Human-AI Cooperation: Behaviour, Not Identity, Drives Cooperation in Mixed-Agent Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20487v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into human group settings raises essential questions about how these novel participants influence cooperative social norms. While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.</description>

      <title>Terrorism &amp; Democracy in Burkina-Faso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article examines the political consequences of terrorism in Burkina Faso. Using a dataset combining geolocated terrorist events from ACLED (from 2015 to 2024) with public opinion data from Afrobarometer, I compare the effect of successful terrorist attacks on public support for democracy and authoritarian alternatives. The results reveal that successful terrorist attacks significantly increase support for military regimes, one man regimes, and one party systems, while decreasing support for democratic governance. These changes are most pronounced immediately after the attacks and persist over time. This suggests that terrorism has triggered a trade-off in public preferences between security and freedom. The study also reveals that terrorism erodes perceptions of key democratic values, particularly civil liberties and freedom of movement. Robustness tests confirm that weak institutions or a lack of political knowledge are not driving the results. The article highlights how terrorism in fragile democracies can undermine democratic resilience and accelerate authoritarian drift.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Programming Decreases the Productivity of Experienced Developers by Increasing the Technical Debt and Maintenance Burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GenAI solutions like GitHub Copilot have been shown to increase the productivity of software developers. Yet prior work remains unclear on the quality of code produced and the challenges of maintaining it in software projects. If quality declines as volume grows, technical debt accumulates as experienced developers face increased workloads reviewing and reworking code from less-experienced contributors. We analyze developer activity in Open Source Software (OSS) projects following the introduction of GitHub Copilot. We find that productivity indeed increases. However, the increase in productivity is primarily driven by less-experienced (peripheral) developers. We also find that code written after the adoption of AI requires more rework to satisfy repository standards, indicating a potential increase in technical debt. Importantly, the added rework burden falls on the more experienced (core) developers, who review 6.5% more code after Copilot's introduction, but show a 19% drop in their original code productivity. More broadly, this finding raises caution that productivity gains of AI may mask the growing burden of maintenance on a shrinking pool of experts, together with increased technical debt for the projects. The results highlight a fundamental tension in AI-assisted software development between short-term productivity gains and long-term system sustainability.</description>

      <title>Marriage Discourse on Chinese Social Media: An LLM-assisted Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: China's marriage registrations have declined substantially, dropping from 13.47 million couples in 2013 to 6.1 million in 2024. This study examined sentiment and moral elements underlying 219,358 marriage-related posts from Weibo and Xiaohongshu using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral elements (autonomy, community, divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo leaned toward positive sentiment, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral elements were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking autonomy and community were predominantly negative, whereas divinity-framed posts tended toward positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations contribute to negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China, offering insights for culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic match classification model for sports tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing match classification models in the tournament design literature have two major limitations: a contestant is considered indifferent only if uncertain future results do never affect its prize, and competitive matches are not distinguished with respect to the incentives of the contestants. We propose a probabilistic framework to address both issues. For each match, our approach relies on simulating all other matches played simultaneously or later to compute the qualifying probabilities under the three main outcomes (win, draw, loss), which allows the classification of each match into six different categories. The suggested model is applied to the previous group stage and the new incomplete round-robin league, introduced in the 2024/25 season of UEFA club competitions. An incomplete round-robin tournament is found to contain fewer stakeless matches where both contestants are indifferent, and substantially more matches where both contestants should play offensively. However, the robustly higher proportion of potentially collusive matches can threaten with serious scandals.</description>
