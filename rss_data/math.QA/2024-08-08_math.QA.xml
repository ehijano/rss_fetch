      <title>Hopf q-braces structures on rank one pointed Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we determine all the Hopf q-brace structures on rank one pointed Hopf algebras and compute the socle of each one of them. We also identify which among them are Hopf skew-braces. Then we determine when two Hopf q-brace structures on rank one pointed Hopf algebras are isomorphic, and, finally, we compute all the weak braiding operators on these Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Representations of skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore linear representations of skew left braces, which are known to provide bijective non-degenerate set-theoretical solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation that are not necessarily involutive. A skew left brace $(A, \cdot, \circ)$ induces an action $\lambda^{\op}: (A, \circ) \to \Aut (A, \cdot)$, which gives rise to the group $\Lambda_{A^{\op}} = (A, \cdot) \rtimes_{\lambda^{\op}} (A, \circ)$. We prove that if $A$ and $B$ are isoclinic skew left braces, then $\Lambda_{A^{\op}}$ and $\Lambda_{B^{\op}}$ are also isoclinic under some mild restrictions on the centers of the respective groups. Our key observation is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of equivalence classes of irreducible representations of $(A, \cdot, \circ)$ and that of the group $\Lambda_{A^{\op}}$. We obtain a decomposition of the induced representation of the additive group $(A, \cdot)$ and of the multiplicative group $(A, \circ)$ corresponding to the regular representation of the group $\Lambda_{A^{\op}}$. As examples, we compute the dimensions of the irreducible representations for several skew left braces with prime power orders.</description>

      <title>A theory of locally convex Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the completed inductive, projective and injective tensor products of Grothendieck for locally convex topological vector spaces, we develop a systematic theory of locally convex Hopf algebras with an emphasis on Pontryagin-type dualities. We describe how classical Hopf algebras, real and complex Lie groups, as well as compact and discrete quantum groups, can all give rise to natural examples of this theory in a variety of different ways. We also show that the space of all continuous functions on a topological group $ G $ whose topological structures are compactly generated has an $ \varepsilon $-Hopf algebra structure, and we can recover $ G $ fully as a topological group from this locally convex Hopf algebra. The latter is done via a generalization of Gelfand duality, which is of its own interest. Certain projective and inductive limits are also considered in this framework, and it is shown that how this can lead to examples seemingly outside of the framework of locally compact quantum groups in the sense of Kustermans-Vaes. As an illustration, we propose a version of the infinite quantum permutation group $ S^{+}_{\infty} $, the free orthogonal group $ O^{+}_{\infty} $, and the free unitary group $ U^{+}_{\infty} $ as certain strict inductive limits, all of which still retain a nice duality. Combined with our duality theory, this may be seen as an alternative tentative approach to the Kac program of developing a Pontryagin-type duality to a wider class, while at the same time, we include many more interesting examples of classical and quantum groups.</description>

      <title>Osterwalder-Schrader axioms for unitary full vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Full Vertex Operator Algebras (full VOA) are extensions of two commuting Vertex Operator Algebras, introduced to formulate compact two-dimensional conformal field theory. We define unitarity, polynomial energy bounds and polynomial spectral density for full VOA. Under these conditions and local $C_1$-cofiniteness of the simple full VOA, we show that the correlation functions of quasi-primary fields define tempered distributions and satisfy a conformal version of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, including the linear growth condition.
  As an example, we show that a family of full extensions of the Heisenberg VOA satisfies all these assumptions.</description>
