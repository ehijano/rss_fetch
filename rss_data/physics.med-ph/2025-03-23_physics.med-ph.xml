      <title>ISIT-GEN: An in silico imaging trial to assess the inter-scanner generalizability of CTLESS for myocardial perfusion SPECT on defect-detection task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently proposed scatter-window and deep learning-based attenuation compensation (AC) method for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), namely CTLESS, demonstrated promising performance on the clinical task of myocardial perfusion defect detection with retrospective data acquired on SPECT scanners from a single vendor. For clinical translation of CTLESS, it is important to assess the generalizability of CTLESS across different SPECT scanners. For this purpose, we conducted a virtual imaging trial, titled in silico imaging trial to assess generalizability (ISIT-GEN). ISIT-GEN assessed the generalizability of CTLESS on the cardiac perfusion defect detection task across SPECT scanners from three different vendors. The performance of CTLESS was compared with a standard-of-care CT-based AC (CTAC) method and a no-attenuation compensation (NAC) method using an anthropomorphic model observer. We observed that CTLESS had receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curves similar to those of CTAC. Further, CTLESS was observed to significantly outperform the NAC method across three scanners. These results are suggestive of the inter-scanner generalizability of CTLESS and motivate further clinical evaluations. The study also highlights the value of using in silico imaging trials to assess the generalizability of deep learning-based AC methods feasibly and rigorously.</description>

      <title>CTorch: PyTorch-Compatible GPU-Accelerated Auto-Differentiable Projector Toolbox for Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces CTorch, a PyTorch-compatible, GPU-accelerated, and auto-differentiable projector toolbox designed to handle various CT geometries with configurable projector algorithms. CTorch provides flexible scanner geometry definition, supporting 2D fan-beam, 3D circular cone-beam, and 3D non-circular cone-beam geometries. Each geometry allows view-specific definitions to accommodate variations during scanning. Both flat- and curved-detector models may be specified to accommodate various clinical devices. CTorch implements four projector algorithms: voxel-driven, ray-driven, distance-driven (DD), and separable footprint (SF), allowing users to balance accuracy and computational efficiency based on their needs. All the projectors are primarily built using CUDA C for GPU acceleration, then compiled as Python-callable functions, and wrapped as PyTorch network module. This design allows direct use of PyTorch tensors, enabling seamless integration into PyTorch's auto-differentiation framework. These features make CTorch an flexible and efficient tool for CT imaging research, with potential applications in accurate CT simulations, efficient iterative reconstruction, and advanced deep-learning-based CT reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Design of 3D Non-Cartesian Trajectories for Fast Volumetric MRI via Analytic Coordinate Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D non-Cartesian trajectories offer several advantages over rectilinear trajectories for rapid volumetric imaging, including improved sampling efficiency and greater robustness to motion, flow, and aliasing artifacts. In this paper, we present a unified framework for designing three widely used non-Cartesian trajectories: 3D Radial, 3D Cones, and Stack-of-Spirals. Our approach is based on the idea that a non-Cartesian trajectory can be interpreted as a discretized version of an analytic coordinate defined by a set of template trajectories. Equivalently, the analytic coordinate is conceptualized as a non-Cartesian trajectory composed of an infinite number of copies of a set of template trajectories. The discretization is accomplished by constructing a continuous spiral path on a surface and sampling points along this path at unit intervals, leaving only the essential spokes/interleaves, thereby yielding the practical non-Cartesian trajectory from the analytic coordinate. One of the advantages of our approach is that the analytic density compensation factor can be readily derived using Jacobian determinants, which quantify changes in unit areas due to the transformation from the analytic coordinate to the Cartesian grid. Additionally, the proposed approach derives analytic formulae to compute the number of readouts based on prescribed parameters, allowing us to specify the trajectory's acceleration factor for a given total scan time. Furthermore, variable-density sampling can be easily incorporated, and spokes/interleaves are smoothly distributed in k-space along the derived spiral path, even for a small number of readouts. In a preliminary phantom study, the proposed method demonstrated improved sampling efficiency and image quality compared to the conventional approach.</description>

      <title>Discrete Dielectric Coatings for Length Control and Tunability of Half-Wave Dipole Antennas at 300 MHz Magnetic Resonance Imaging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel discretely dielectric material-coated (DDMC) dipole antenna design for ultra-high-field (UHF) MRI applications. This design improves frequency tuning, lowers electric field intensity, and reduces SAR by including discrete high-permittivity dielectric coatings at both ends of the dipole. The DDMC dipole's performance was compared to that of a fractionated dipole design using metrics such as inter-element coupling, B1 field distribution, and SNR. Simulations and experimental results showed that the DDMC dipole provided superior B1 field uniformity with significantly reduced B1 variation along the dipole conductor while reducing SAR, making it a safer and more efficient option for MR signal excitation and reception in UHF MR imaging. Furthermore, with its improved electromagnetic decoupling performance, the multichannel array made from the proposed DDMC dipoles shows promise for improving parallel imaging and imaging quality in UHF MRI, with future work focusing on material optimization and scalability for multi-channel arrays.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Adaptive Dynamic Subsampling and Reconstruction for Cardiac MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\textbf{Background:}$ Accelerating dynamic MRI is vital for advancing clinical applications and improving patient comfort. Commonly, deep learning (DL) methods for accelerated dynamic MRI reconstruction typically rely on uniformly applying non-adaptive predetermined or random subsampling patterns across all temporal frames of the dynamic acquisition. This approach fails to exploit temporal correlations or optimize subsampling on a case-by-case basis.
  $\textbf{Purpose:}$ To develop an end-to-end approach for adaptive dynamic MRI subsampling and reconstruction, capable of generating customized sampling patterns maximizing at the same time reconstruction quality.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We introduce the End-to-end Adaptive Dynamic Sampling and Reconstruction (E2E-ADS-Recon) for MRI framework, which integrates an adaptive dynamic sampler (ADS) that adapts the acquisition trajectory to each case for a given acceleration factor with a state-of-the-art dynamic reconstruction network, vSHARP, for reconstructing the adaptively sampled data into a dynamic image. The ADS can produce either frame-specific patterns or unified patterns applied to all temporal frames. E2E-ADS-Recon is evaluated under both frame-specific and unified 1D or 2D sampling settings, using dynamic cine cardiac MRI data and compared with vSHARP models employing standard subsampling trajectories, as well as pipelines where ADS was replaced by parameterized samplers optimized for dataset-specific schemes.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ E2E-ADS-Recon exhibited superior reconstruction quality, especially at high accelerations, in terms of standard quantitative metrics (SSIM, pSNR, NMSE).
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ The proposed framework improves reconstruction quality, highlighting the importance of case-specific subsampling optimization in dynamic MRI applications.</description>

      <title>Deep End-to-end Adaptive k-Space Sampling, Reconstruction, and Registration for Dynamic MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic MRI enables a range of clinical applications, including cardiac function assessment, organ motion tracking, and radiotherapy guidance. However, fully sampling the dynamic k-space data is often infeasible due to time constraints and physiological motion such as respiratory and cardiac motion. This necessitates undersampling, which degrades the quality of reconstructed images. Poor image quality not only hinders visualization but also impairs the estimation of deformation fields, crucial for registering dynamic (moving) images to a static reference image. This registration enables tasks such as motion correction, treatment planning, and quantitative analysis in applications like cardiac imaging and MR-guided radiotherapy. To overcome the challenges posed by undersampling and motion, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning (DL) framework that integrates adaptive dynamic k-space sampling, reconstruction, and registration. Our approach begins with a DL-based adaptive sampling strategy, optimizing dynamic k-space acquisition to capture the most relevant data for each specific case. This is followed by a DL-based reconstruction module that produces images optimized for accurate deformation field estimation from the undersampled moving data. Finally, a registration module estimates the deformation fields aligning the reconstructed dynamic images with a static reference. The proposed framework is independent of specific reconstruction and registration modules allowing for plug-and-play integration of these components. The entire framework is jointly trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised loss functions, enabling end-to-end optimization for improved performance across all components. Through controlled experiments and ablation studies, we validate each component, demonstrating that each choice contributes to robust motion estimation from undersampled dynamic data.</description>
