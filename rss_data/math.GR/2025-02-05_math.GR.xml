      <title>Quasi-isometric rigidity for lamplighters with lamps of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-isometry between two connected graphs is measure-scaling if one can control precisely the sizes of pre-images of finite subsets. Such a notion is motivated by the work of Eskin-Fysher-Whyte on lamplighters over $\mathbb{Z}$ and the work of Dymarz on biLipschitz equivalences of amenable groups, and led Genevois and Tessera to introduce the scaling group $\text{Sc}(X)$ of an amenable bounded degree graph $X$. The main result of our article is a rigidity property for quasi-isometries between lamplighters with lamps of polynomial growth. Under assumptions on $G$ and $H$, any such quasi-isometry $N\wr G\longrightarrow M\wr H$ must be measure-scaling for some scaling factor depending on the growth degrees of $N$ and $M$. In particular, the scaling group of such wreath products is reduced to $\lbrace 1\rbrace$. As applications, we obtain additional examples of pairs of quasi-isometric groups that are not biLipschitz equivalent. We also give applications to the quasi-isometric classification of some iterated wreath products, and we exhibit the first example of an amenable finitely generated group $H$ which is \textit{lamplighter-rigid}, in the sense that $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\wr H$ and $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}\wr H$ are quasi-isometric if and only if $n=m$.</description>

      <title>Finding Blocks of Imprimitivity When There is a Small-Base Action on Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a transitive permutation group G of degree n , we seek to determine whether or not G is primitive, and to find a system of blocks of imprimitivity in the case that G is imprimitive. An algorithm of Atkinson solves this problem in time O(n^2) , while a previous algorithm of ours runs in time O(n log^3|G|) , which is advantageous in the small-base case. A simpler algorithm of Schonert and Seress has the same asymptotic O(n log^3|G|) performance.
  In this paper we extend the small-base algorithms to work with imprimitive groups G which, while not small-base in the action on n points, possess a small-base action on a block system. Using a recent upper bound by Kelsey and Roney-Dougal on the size of a nonredundant base of a primitive group of a given degree, we obtain a time of O(n log^5 n) except in the case that G has a primitive action (either on the n points or on a block system) for which the socle is isomorphic to Alt(m)^d for some m at least 5 and d at least 1.
  A key component of our improvement is a new variant of sifting, which is a workhorse of permutation group algorithms.</description>

      <title>Character codegrees, kernels, and Fitting heights of solvable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an irreducible character $\chi$ of a finite group $G$, let $\mathrm{cod}(\chi):=|G: \ker(\chi)|/\chi(1)$ denote the codegree of $\chi$, and let $\mathrm{cod}(G)$ be the set of irreducible character codegrees of $G$. In this note, we prove that if $\ker(\chi)$ is not nilpotent,
  then there exists an irreducible character $\xi$ of $G$ such that
  $\ker(\xi)&lt;\ker(\chi)$ and $\mathrm{cod}(\xi)&gt; \mathrm{cod}(\chi)$.
  This provides a character codegree analogue of a classical theorem of Broline and Garrison.
  As a consequence, we obtain that for a nonidentity solvable group $G$,
  its Fitting height $\ell_{\mathbf{F}}(G)$ does not exceed $|\mathrm{cod}(G)|-1$.
  Additionally, we provide two other upper bounds for the Fitting height of a solvable group $G$ as follows: $\ell_{\mathbf{F}}(G)\leq \frac{1}{2}(|\mathrm{cod}(G)|+2)$, and $\ell_{\mathbf{F}}(G)\leq 8\log_2(|\mathrm{cod}(G)|)+80$.</description>

      <title>Free Semigroups of Large Critical Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a convergence group equipped with an expanding coarse-cocycle, we construct finitely generated free subsemigroups, which we call $\textit{Bishop--Jones}$ $\textit{semigroups}$, of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than the critical exponent of the ambient group. As an application, we show that for any lattice in the isometry group of the quaternionic hyperbolic space or the isometry group of the Cayley hyperbolic plane, there exist finitely generated free subsemigroups of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than that of the ambient lattice. This shows no critical exponent gap for discrete subsemigroups in the isometry group of the quaternionic hyperbolic space or the isometry group of the Cayley hyperbolic plane, which is in contrast with Corlette's renowned gap theorem concerning infinite co-volume discrete subgroups of these rank one Lie groups. More generally, we prove that for any non-elementary transverse subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$, there exist finitely generated free Anosov subsemigroups in the sense of Kassel--Potrie of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than that of the ambient transverse group. Furthermore, we show that these semigroups admit $\mathcal{C}$-regular quasi-isometric embeddings into the symmetric space $X$ of $G$, in the sense of Dey--Kim--Oh.</description>

Abstract: We transform the method of Glasson into a sufficient condition under which a monoid is non-finitely related, add a new member to the collection of interlocking word-patterns, and use it to show that the monoid $M(ab^2a, a^2b^2)$ is non-finitely related.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions of Bass-Serre Trees and the applications to $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Bass-Serre theory from the perspectives of $C^*$-algebras and topological dynamics. In particular, we investigate the actions of fundamental groups of graphs of groups on their Bass-Serre trees and the associated boundaries, through which, we identify new families of $C^*$-simple groups including certain tubular groups and fundamental groups of certain graphs of groups with one vertex group acylindrically hyperbolic. In addition, we obtain characterizations of $C^*$-simplicity for Generalized Baumslag-Solitar (GBS) groups and outer automorphism groups $\operatorname{Out}(BS(p, q))$ of Baumslag-Solitar groups. These $C^*$-simple groups also provide new examples of highly transitive groups. Moreover, we demonstrate that natural boundary actions of these $C^*$-simple fundamental groups of graphs of groups give rise to the new purely infinite crossed product $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05976v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that one-relator groups are coherent, solving a well-known problem of Gilbert Baumslag. Our proof strategy is readily applicable to many classes of groups of cohomological dimension two. We show that fundamental groups of two-complexes with non-positive immersions are homologically coherent, we show that groups with staggered presentations and many Coxeter groups are coherent and we show that group algebras over fields of characteristic zero of groups with reducible presentations without proper powers are coherent.</description>

      <title>Dehn functions of subgroups of products of free groups. Part I: Uniform upper bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subgroups of direct products of finitely many finitely generated free groups form a natural class that plays an important role in geometric group theory. Its members include fundamental examples, such as the Stallings-Bieri groups. This raises the problem of understanding their geometric invariants. We prove that finitely presented subgroups of direct products of three free groups, as well as subgroups of finiteness type $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$ in a direct product of $n$ free groups, have Dehn function bounded above by $N^9$. This gives a positive answer to a question of Dison within these important subclasses and provides new insights in the context of Bridson's conjecture stating that finitely presented subgroups of direct products of free groups have polynomially bounded Dehn function. To prove our results we generalise techniques for "pushing fillings" into normal subgroups.</description>

      <title>On groups with at most five irrational conjugacy classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much work has been done to study groups with few rational conjugacy classes or few rational irreducible characters. In this paper we look at the opposite extreme. Let $G$ be a finite group. Given a conjugacy class $K$ of $G$, we say it is irrational if there is some $\chi \in \operatorname{Irr}(G)$ such that $\chi(K) \not \in \mathbb{Q}$. One of our main results shows that, when $G$ contains at most $5$ irrational conjugacy classes, then $|\operatorname{Irr}_{\mathbb{Q}}(G)| = |\operatorname{cl}_{\mathbb{Q}}(G)|$. This suggests some duality with the known results and open questions on groups with few rational irreducible characters. Our results are independent of the Classification of Finite Simple Groups.</description>

Abstract: T.C. Burness and S.D. Scott \cite{3} classified finite groups $G$ such that the number of prime order subgroups of $G$ is greater than $|G|/2-1$. In this note, we study finite groups $G$ whose subgroup graph contains a vertex of degree greater than $|G|/2-1$. The classification given for finite solvable groups extends the work of Burness and Scott.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete countable group. The first main result of this work is that if $\Gamma$ is ICC inner-amenable non-amenable then it cannot satisfy the (AO)-property, answering a question posed by C. Anantharaman-Delaroche. It is also proved that if $\Gamma$ is a "sufficiently large" discrete subgroup of a product of locally compact second countable bi-exact groups, then it cannot be inner-amenable. Both these results generalize the well-known fact that ICC non-amenable inner-amenable discrete countable groups cannot be bi-exact.</description>
