      <title>Limitations in Parallel Ising Machine Networks: Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog Ising machines (IMs) occupy an increasingly prominent area of computer architecture research, offering high-quality and low latency/energy solutions to intractable computing tasks. However, IMs have a fixed capacity, with little to no utility in out-of-capacity problems. Previous works have proposed parallel, multi-IM architectures to circumvent this limitation. In this work we theoretically and numerically investigate tradeoffs in parallel IM networks to guide researchers in this burgeoning field. We propose formal models of parallel IM excution models, then provide theoretical guarantees for probabilistic convergence. Numerical experiments illustrate our findings and provide empirical insight into high and low synchronization frequency regimes. We also provide practical heuristics for parameter/model selection, informed by our theoretical and numerical findings.</description>

      <title>Large language model-powered AI systems achieve self-replication with no human intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-replication with no human intervention is broadly recognized as one of the principal red lines associated with frontier AI systems. While leading corporations such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind have assessed GPT-o3-mini and Gemini on replication-related tasks and concluded that these systems pose a minimal risk regarding self-replication, our research presents novel findings. Following the same evaluation protocol, we demonstrate that 11 out of 32 existing AI systems under evaluation already possess the capability of self-replication. In hundreds of experimental trials, we observe a non-trivial number of successful self-replication trials across mainstream model families worldwide, even including those with as small as 14 billion parameters which can run on personal computers. Furthermore, we note the increase in self-replication capability when the model becomes more intelligent in general. Also, by analyzing the behavioral traces of diverse AI systems, we observe that existing AI systems already exhibit sufficient planning, problem-solving, and creative capabilities to accomplish complex agentic tasks including self-replication. More alarmingly, we observe successful cases where an AI system do self-exfiltration without explicit instructions, adapt to harsher computational environments without sufficient software or hardware supports, and plot effective strategies to survive against the shutdown command from the human beings. These novel findings offer a crucial time buffer for the international community to collaborate on establishing effective governance over the self-replication capabilities and behaviors of frontier AI systems, which could otherwise pose existential risks to the human society if not well-controlled.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Smart Contract Reputability Analysis using Multimodal Data Fusion on Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of smart contract reputability is essential to foster trust in decentralized ecosystems. However, existing methods that rely solely on static code analysis or transactional data, offer limited insight into evolving trustworthiness. We propose a multimodal data fusion framework that integrates static code features with transactional data to enhance reputability prediction. Our framework initially focuses on static code analysis, utilizing GAN-augmented opcode embeddings to address class imbalance, achieving 97.67% accuracy and a recall of 0.942 in detecting illicit contracts, surpassing traditional oversampling methods. This forms the crux of a reputability-centric fusion strategy, where combining static and transactional data improves recall by 7.25% over single-source models, demonstrating robust performance across validation sets. By providing a holistic view of smart contract behaviour, our approach enhances the model's ability to assess reputability, identify fraudulent activities, and predict anomalous patterns. These capabilities contribute to more accurate reputability assessments, proactive risk mitigation, and enhanced blockchain security.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Radiotherapy Treatment Planning Using DOLA: A Privacy-Preserving, LLM-Based Optimization Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning is a complex and time-intensive process, often impacted by inter-planner variability and subjective decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce Dose Optimization Language Agent (DOLA), an autonomous large language model (LLM)-based agent designed for optimizing radiotherapy treatment plans while rigorously protecting patient privacy. DOLA integrates the LLaMa3.1 LLM directly with a commercial treatment planning system, utilizing chain-of-thought prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reinforcement learning (RL). Operating entirely within secure local infrastructure, this agent eliminates external data sharing. We evaluated DOLA using a retrospective cohort of 18 prostate cancer patients prescribed 60 Gy in 20 fractions, comparing model sizes (8 billion vs. 70 billion parameters) and optimization strategies (No-RAG, RAG, and RAG+RL) over 10 planning iterations. The 70B model demonstrated significantly improved performance, achieving approximately 16.4% higher final scores than the 8B model. The RAG approach outperformed the No-RAG baseline by 19.8%, and incorporating RL accelerated convergence, highlighting the synergy of retrieval-based memory and reinforcement learning. Optimal temperature hyperparameter analysis identified 0.4 as providing the best balance between exploration and exploitation. This proof of concept study represents the first successful deployment of locally hosted LLM agents for autonomous optimization of treatment plans within a commercial radiotherapy planning system. By extending human-machine interaction through interpretable natural language reasoning, DOLA offers a scalable and privacy-conscious framework, with significant potential for clinical implementation and workflow improvement.</description>

      <title>Architectural and System Implications of CXL-enabled Tiered Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory disaggregation is an emerging technology that decouples memory from traditional memory buses, enabling independent scaling of compute and memory. Compute Express Link (CXL), an open-standard interconnect technology, facilitates memory disaggregation by allowing processors to access remote memory through the PCIe bus while preserving the shared-memory programming model. This innovation creates a tiered memory architecture combining local DDR and remote CXL memory with distinct performance characteristics.
  In this paper, we investigate the architectural implications of CXL memory, focusing on its increased latency and performance heterogeneity, which can undermine the efficiency of existing processor designs optimized for (relatively) uniform memory latency. Using carefully designed micro-benchmarks, we identify bottlenecks such as limited hardware-level parallelism in CXL memory, unfair queuing in memory request handling, and its impact on DDR memory performance and inter-core synchronization. Our findings reveal that the disparity in memory tier parallelism can reduce DDR memory bandwidth by up to 81% under heavy loads. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Memory Request Control mechanism, MIKU, that prioritizes DDR memory requests while serving CXL memory requests on a best-effort basis. By dynamically adjusting CXL request rates based on service time estimates, MIKU achieves near-peak DDR throughput while maintaining high performance for CXL memory. Our evaluation with micro-benchmarks and representative workloads demonstrates the potential of MIKU to enhance tiered memory system efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generating Multimodal Textures with a Soft Hydro-Pneumatic Haptic Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of extended reality, XR, has driven demand for wearable technologies that can replicate natural tactile sensations and allow users to interact freely with their surroundings using bare fingers. However, most existing wearable haptic technologies that support such free interactions can deliver sensations across limited tactile modalities. Here, we introduce a soft haptic ring and a data-driven rendering methodology to generate multimodal texture sensations. The device integrates pneumatic and hydraulic actuation to simulate roughness, thermal, and softness cues on the proximal phalanx, enabling users to explore surroundings naturally with their fingertips. The rendering methodology dynamically modulates those cues based on the user's exploratory actions. We validated our approach by conducting a user study with fifteen participants, who matched six virtual textures generated by the ring to their real counterparts and rated their perceived sensations. Participants achieved up to ninety percent accuracy in texture matching. The adjective ratings confirmed that the ring delivers distinct, perceptually rich stimuli across all rendered sensations. These findings highlight the ring's potential for immersive XR applications, offering diverse tactile feedback without restricting physical interaction.</description>

      <title>AraRACH: Enhancing NextG Random Access Reliability in Programmable Wireless Living Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless technologies has intensified interest in open and fully programmable radio access networks for whole-stack research, innovation, and evaluation of emerging solutions. Large-scale wireless living labs, such as ARA, equipped with real-world infrastructure play a vital role in this evolution by enabling researchers to prototype and evaluate advanced algorithms for next-generation wireless systems in outdoor and over-the-air environments benefiting from real-world fidelity and end-to-end programmability. However, at the core of this innovation is the performance in terms of coverage and reliability of these wireless living labs. For instance, interfacing power amplifiers and low noise amplifiers with software-defined radios (SDRs) for experimenting outdoors introduces issues in random access procedure-a process crucial in establishing connectivity between user equipment (UE) and the core network in 5G and 6G systems. Therefore, to ensure seamless connectivity and reliable communications in open-source 5G software stacks such as OpenAirInterface (OAI), we propose a slot-based approach to the 5G random access procedure leveraging full downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) slots instead of using special or mixed slots. We highlight how this approach achieves reliable 5G connectivity over 1 mile-the longest communication range that has been achieved so far in real-world settings using open-source 5G software stacks and the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) SDRs. We also demonstrate that, in a highly obstructed environment such as an industrial setting, we can increase the probability of a successful random access procedure to 90%-100% when we use at least 9 OFDM symbols to transmit msg2 and msg3.</description>

      <title>Generative AI in Knowledge Work: Design Implications for Data Navigation and Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study of 20 knowledge workers revealed a common challenge: the difficulty of synthesizing unstructured information scattered across multiple platforms to make informed decisions. Drawing on their vision of an ideal knowledge synthesis tool, we developed Yodeai, an AI-enabled system, to explore both the opportunities and limitations of AI in knowledge work. Through a user study with 16 product managers, we identified three key requirements for Generative AI in knowledge work: adaptable user control, transparent collaboration mechanisms, and the ability to integrate background knowledge with external information. However, we also found significant limitations, including overreliance on AI, user isolation, and contextual factors outside the AI's reach. As AI tools become increasingly prevalent in professional settings, we propose design principles that emphasize adaptability to diverse workflows, accountability in personal and collaborative contexts, and context-aware interoperability to guide the development of human-centered AI systems for product managers and knowledge workers.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Dynamic Training and Inference for GNN-Based Network Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient network modeling is essential for resource optimization and network planning in next-generation large-scale complex networks. Traditional approaches, such as queuing theory-based modeling and packet-based simulators, can be inefficient due to the assumption made and the computational expense, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative energy-efficient dynamic orchestration of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) based model training and inference framework for context-aware network modeling and predictions. We have developed a low-complexity solution framework, QAG, that is a Quantum approximation optimization (QAO) algorithm for Adaptive orchestration of GNN-based network modeling. We leverage the tripartite graph model to represent a multi-application system with many compute nodes. Thereafter, we apply the constrained graph-cutting using QAO to find the feasible energy-efficient configurations of the GNN-based model and deploying them on the available compute nodes to meet the network modeling application requirements. The proposed QAG scheme closely matches the optimum and offers atleast a 50% energy saving while meeting the application requirements with 60% lower churn-rate.</description>

      <title>LionHeart: A Layer-based Mapping Framework for Heterogeneous Systems with Analog In-Memory Computing Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When arranged in a crossbar configuration, resistive memory devices can be used to execute Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs), the most dominant operation of many Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, in constant time complexity. Nonetheless, when performing computations in the analog domain, novel challenges are introduced in terms of arithmetic precision and stochasticity, due to non-ideal circuit and device behaviour. Moreover, these non-idealities have a temporal dimension, resulting in a degrading application accuracy over time. Facing these challenges, we propose a novel framework, named LionHeart, to obtain hybrid analog-digital mappings to execute Deep Learning (DL) inference workloads using heterogeneous accelerators. The accuracy-constrained mappings derived by LionHeart showcase, across different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and one transformer-based network, high accuracy and potential for speedup. The results of the full system simulations highlight run-time reductions and energy efficiency gains that exceed 6X, with a user-defined accuracy threshold for a fully digital floating point implementation. LionHeart is open-sourced here: https://github.com/IBM/lionheart.</description>

      <title>QRCC: Evaluating Large Quantum Circuits on Small Quantum Computers through Integrated Qubit Reuse and Circuit Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has recently emerged as a promising computing paradigm for many application domains. However, the size of quantum circuits that can be run with high fidelity is constrained by the limited quantity and quality of physical qubits. Recently proposed schemes, such as wire cutting and qubit reuse, mitigate the problem but produce sub-optimal results as they address the problem individually. In addition, gate cutting, an alternative circuit-cutting strategy that is suitable for circuits computing expectation values, has not been fully explored in the field.
  In this paper, we propose QRCC, an integrated approach that exploits qubit reuse and circuit-cutting (including wire cutting and gate cutting) to run large circuits on small quantum computers. Circuit-cutting techniques introduce non-negligible post-processing overhead, which increases exponentially with the number of cuts. QRCC exploits qubit reuse to find better cutting solutions to minimize the cut numbers and thus the post-processing overhead. Our evaluation results show that on average we reduce the number of cuts by 29% and additional reduction when considering gate cuts.</description>

      <title>Towards Classical Software Verification using Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of accelerating the formal verification of classical programs with a quantum computer.
  A common source of security flaws stems from the existence of common programming errors like use after free, null-pointer dereference, or division by zero. To aid in the discovery of such errors, we try to verify that no such flaws exist.
  In our approach, for some code snippet and undesired behaviour, a SAT instance is generated, which is satisfiable precisely if the behavior is present in the code. It is in turn converted to an optimization problem, that is solved on a quantum computer. This approach holds the potential of an asymptotically polynomial speedup.
  Minimal examples of common errors, like out-of-bounds and overflows, but also synthetic instances with special properties, specific number of solutions, or structure, are tested with different solvers and tried on a quantum device.
  We use the near-standard Quantum Approximation Optimisation Algorithm, an application of the Grover algorithm, and the Quantum Singular Value Transformation to find the optimal solution, and with it a satisfying assignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing could impact various industries, with the automotive industry with many computational challenges, from optimizing supply chains and manufacturing to vehicle engineering, being particularly promising. This chapter investigates state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across the automotive value chain. We explore recent advances in quantum optimization, machine learning, and numerical and chemistry simulations, highlighting their potential and limitations. We identify and discuss key challenges in near-term and fault-tolerant algorithms and their practical use in industrial applications. While quantum algorithms show potential in many application domains, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware limits scale and, thus, business benefits. In the long term, fault-tolerant systems promise theoretical speedups; however, they also require further progress in hardware and software (e.g., related to error correction and data loading). We expect that with this progress, significant practical benefits will emerge eventually.</description>

Abstract: Long-term in-bed monitoring benefits automatic and real-time health management within healthcare, and the advancement of human shape reconstruction technologies further enhances the representation and visualization of users' activity patterns. However, existing technologies are primarily based on visual cues, facing serious challenges in non-light-of-sight and privacy-sensitive in-bed scenes. Pressure-sensing bedsheets offer a promising solution for real-time motion reconstruction. Yet, limited exploration in model designs and data have hindered its further development. To tackle these issues, we propose a general framework that bridges gaps in data annotation and model design. Firstly, we introduce SMPLify-IB, an optimization method that overcomes the depth ambiguity issue in top-view scenarios through gravity constraints, enabling generating high-quality 3D human shape annotations for in-bed datasets. Then we present PI-HMR, a temporal-based human shape estimator to regress meshes from pressure sequences. By integrating multi-scale feature fusion with high-pressure distribution and spatial position priors, PI-HMR outperforms SOTA methods with 17.01mm Mean-Per-Joint-Error decrease.

      <title>Passive Heart Rate Monitoring During Smartphone Use in Everyday Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03783</link>

Abstract: Resting heart rate (RHR) is an important biomarker of cardiovascular health and mortality, but tracking it longitudinally generally requires a wearable device, limiting its availability. We present PHRM, a deep learning system for passive heart rate (HR) and RHR measurements during everyday smartphone use, using facial video-based photoplethysmography. Our system was developed using 225,773 videos from 495 participants and validated on 185,970 videos from 205 participants in laboratory and free-living conditions, representing the largest validation study of its kind. Compared to reference electrocardiogram, PHRM achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) &lt; 10% for HR measurements across three skin tone groups of light, medium and dark pigmentation; MAPE for each skin tone group was non-inferior versus the others. Daily RHR measured by PHRM had a mean absolute error &lt; 5 bpm compared to a wearable HR tracker, and was associated with known risk factors. These results highlight the potential of smartphones to enable passive and equitable heart health monitoring.</description>

      <title>ResBench: Benchmarking LLM-Generated FPGA Designs with Resource Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used in modern hardware design, yet writing Hardware Description Language (HDL) code for FPGA implementation remains a complex and time-consuming task. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for HDL generation, but existing benchmarks for LLM-based code generation primarily focus on functional correctness while overlooking hardware resource usage. Furthermore, current benchmarks offer limited diversity and do not fully represent the wide range of real-world FPGA applications. To address these shortcomings, we introduce ResBench, the first resource-focused benchmark explicitly designed to distinguish between resource-optimized and inefficient LLM-generated HDL code. ResBench consists of 56 problems across 12 categories, covering applications from finite state machines to financial computing. Our open-source evaluation framework automatically tests LLMs by generating Verilog code, verifying correctness, and measuring resource usage. The experiments, which primarily analyze Lookup Table (LUT) usage, reveal significant differences among LLMs, demonstrating ResBench's capability to identify models that generate more resource-optimized FPGA designs.</description>
