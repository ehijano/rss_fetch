      <title>Oceanic influence on Large-Scale Atmospheric Convection during co-occurring La Nina and IOD events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ISMR profoundly impacts over a billion people across the region. ISMR extremes have been linked to the ENSO and modulated by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). ISMR of 2022 displayed intriguing spatial patterns: above-normal precipitation over the south peninsula and central India, normal over Northwest India, and below-normal over East and NE India. In 2022, La Nina conditions associated with a negative IOD (nIOD), were prevalent over the equatorial Pacific Ocean (PO) and IO. This study investigates the often-overlooked Oceanic subsurface contribution to large-scale atmospheric convection over the tropical IO. By undertaking a comprehensive analysis, we find that strong equatorial westerly wind anomalies prevailed over the equatorial IO during co-occurring years generating eastward propagating downwelling Kelvin waves which deepens the D20 in the eastern equatorial IO. The Kelvin waves then propagates into BoB and gets reflected from southern tip of India as westward propagating Rossby waves deepening the D20 and causing low level wind convergence in the Northern Arabian Sea(NAS). We identify two centres of low-level wind convergence, one over NAS and another over Maritime Continent during co-occurrence years. These wind convergence centres play a pivotal role in channeling moisture towards their core, also, significantly deepen D20, increase the Ocean heat content and thus maintaining warmer SSTs over area of conversions. Together, these interrelated factors create an environment that is conducive for enhanced convective activity over the zone of convergence, enhancing and sustaining the convective conditions. This study underscores the significant contribution of ocean dynamics in shaping large-scale atmospheric convection during the co-occurrence years, highlighting the significance of considering broader Oceanic variables in comprehending and forecasting monsoonal variability.</description>

      <title>Regional impacts poorly constrained by climate sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate risk assessments must account for a wide range of possible futures, so scientists often use simulations made by numerous global climate models to explore potential changes in regional climates and their impacts. Some of the latest-generation models have high effective climate sensitivities or EffCS. It has been argued these so-called hot models are unrealistic and should therefore be excluded from analyses of climate change impacts. Whether this would improve regional impact assessments, or make them worse, is unclear. Here we show there is no universal relationship between EffCS and projected changes in a number of important climatic drivers of regional impacts. Analysing heavy rainfall events, meteorological drought, and fire weather in different regions, we find little or no significant correlation with EffCS for most regions and climatic drivers. Even when a correlation is found, internal variability and processes unrelated to EffCS have similar effects on projected changes in the climatic drivers as EffCS. Model selection based solely on EffCS appears to be unjustified and may neglect realistic impacts, leading to an underestimation of climate risks.</description>

      <title>Large-scale semi-organized rolls in a sheared convective turbulence: Mean-field simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a mean-field theory of a non-rotating turbulent convection (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 66}, 066305, 2002), we perform mean-field simulations (MFS) of sheared convection which takes into account an effect of modification of the turbulent heat flux by the non-uniform large-scale motions. As the result of this effect, there is an excitation of large-scale convective-shear instability, which causes the formation of large-scale semi-organized structures in the form of rolls. The life-times and spatial scales of these structures are much larger compared to the turbulent scales. By means of MFS performed for stress-free and no-slip vertical boundary conditions, we determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of these structures. Our study demonstrates that the modification of the turbulent heat flux by non-uniform flows leads to a strong reduction of the critical effective Rayleigh number (based on the eddy viscosity and turbulent temperature diffusivity) required for the formation of the large-scale rolls. During the nonlinear stage of the convective-shear instability, there is a transition from the two-layer vertical structure with two roles in the vertical direction before the system reaches steady-state to the one-layer vertical structure with one role after the system reaches steady-state. This effect is observed for all effective Rayleigh numbers. We find that inside the convective rolls, the spatial distribution of the mean potential temperature includes regions with a positive vertical gradient of the potential temperature caused by the mean heat flux of the convective rolls. This study might be useful for understanding of the origin of large-scale rolls observed in atmospheric convective boundary layers as well as in numerical simulations and laboratory experiments.</description>
