      <title>OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver for magnetohydrodynamic open cycles, applied to the Sakhalin pulsed magnetohydrodynamic generator (PMHDG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current study, we present a mathematical and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for simulating open-cycle linear Faraday-type continuous-electrode channels of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generators, operating on combustion plasma. The model extends the Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations to account for the electric properties of the flowing plasma gas and its reaction to the applied magnetic field. The model takes into account various effects, such as the Lorentz force, turbulence, compressibility, and energy extraction from the plasma, and it adopts an electric potential technique along with the low magnetic Reynolds number (Rem) approximation. The model is numerically implemented using the multiphysics open-source computer programming environment "OpenFOAM," which combines the finite volume method (FVM) and the object-oriented programming (OOP) concept. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated by simulating the supersonic channel of the large-scale pulsed MHD generator (PMHDG) called "Sakhalin", with the aid of collected data and empirical expressions in the literature about its tested operation. Sakhalin was the world's largest PMHDG, with a demonstrated peak electric power output of 510 MW. Sakhalin operated on solid-propellant plasma (SPP), and it had a single supersonic divergent Faraday-type continuous-electrode channel with a length of 4.5 m. We check the validity of the model through comparisons with independent results for the Sakhalin PMHDG. Then, we process our three-dimensional simulation results to provide scalar characteristics of the Sakhalin channel, one-dimensional profiles along the longitudinal centerline, and three-dimensional distributions in the entire channel.</description>

      <title>Integrated Radiation-Magneto-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Magnetized Burning Plasmas. I. Magnetizing Ignition-Class Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by breakthroughs in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), first achieving ignition conditions in National Ignition Facility (NIF) shot N210808 and then laser energy breakeven in N221204, modeling efforts here investigate the effect of imposed magnetic fields on integrated hohlraum simulations of igniting systems. Previous NIF experiments have shown yield and hotspot temperature to increase in magnetized, gas-filled capsules in line with scalings. In this work, we use the 2D radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Lasnex with a Livermore ICF common model. Simulations are tuned to closely approximate data from unmagnetized experiments. Investigated here is the effect of imposed axial fields of up to 100 T on the fusion output of high-performing ICF shots, specifically the record BigFoot shot N180128, and HYBRID-E shots N210808 and N221204. The main observed effect is an increase in the hotspot temperature due to magnetic insulation. Namely, electron heat flow is constrained perpendicular to the magnetic field and alpha trajectories transition to gyro-orbits, enhancing energy deposition. In addition, we investigate the impact of applied magnetic fields to future NIF designs, specifically an example Enhanced Yield Capability design with 3 MJ of laser energy as well as a high-\r{ho}R, low implosion velocity "Pushered Single Shell" design. In conclusion, magnetization with field strengths of 5-75 T is found to increase the burn-averaged ion temperature by 50% and the neutron yield by 2-12. Specifically, we see yield enhancement of at least 50% with only a 5-10 T applied magnetic field for N221204, while a 65 T field on N210808 with symmetrization gives an 8 increase in yield. This is all without further design optimization to best take advantage of an applied B field, which promises even greater improvements for designs tailored specifically towards magnetization.</description>

      <title>GKFieldFlow: A Spatio-Temporal Neural Surrogate for Nonlinear Gyrokinetic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GKFieldFlow, a novel three-dimensional autoregressive deep learning surrogate model for nonlinear gyrokinetic turbulence. Based on the architecture FieldFlow-Net, this model combines a multi-resolution 3D U-Net encoder-decoder that operates on evolving plasma potential fields. A dilated temporal convolutional network (TCN) learns the nonlinear time evolution of latent turbulence features. GKFieldFlow simultaneously (i) predicts ion and electron energy fluxes, and particle flux directly from CGYRO turbulence, and (ii) predicts future potential fields autoregressively with desired spatial resolution. This enables the model to replicate both instantaneous transport and the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics that generate it.
  The architecture is physics-informed in its design: 3D convolutions preserve the anisotropic geometry and phase structure of gyrokinetic fluctuations, while dilated temporal convolutions capture multiscale dynamical couplings such as turbulence and zonal-flow interactions, turbulence decorrelation, and intermittent bursty transport. We provide a complete technical description of the data structure, model components, and rationale behind each architectural choice.
  The model achieves high accuracy across all three transport channels, with multi-horizon inference maintaining robustness. Autoregressive field rollouts preserve the spectral content, phase coherence, and energy distribution of the CGYRO nonlinear state with strong fidelity, and flux predictions remain consistent with CGYRO within a small fractional error. This work presents GKFieldFlow as a data-driven reduced model that can jointly learn turbulence dynamics and transport.</description>

      <title>RONS Generation in Plasma-Activated Saline for Wound Healing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the physicochemical modifications and antimicrobial potential of plasma activated saline generated by exposing Sodium Chloride and Ringer solution to atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge plasma. Plasma activation produced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species leading to changes in pH, redox potential, conductivity and concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide, Nitrogen and Nitrous Oxides. Effects of activation time, voltage, and gas composition were analyzed. Antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E coli was assessed via MIC, CFU reduction and biofilm inhibition tests. Optimal plasma exposure achieved strong microbial inactivation with good biocompatibility. SEM and FTIR confirmed membrane damage, supporting PAS as a safe, nonantibiotic wound irrigation and disinfectant solution.</description>

      <title>A First-Principles Closure for Nonlocal Magnetized Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reduced kinetic method (RKM) for describing nonlocal transport in magnetized plasmas is derived from first principles and considered in a 1D3V geometry. Unlike standard nonlocal closures, this RKM uses the Fokker-Planck collision operator, therefore local transport results are naturally reproduced for small Knudsen number. An inhibited peak heat flux and preheat of the conductive heat flux are observed, which are expected from physical arguments and previous kinetic studies. Nonlocal behavior of other transport fluxes, namely the Righi-Leduc, Peltier, Ettingshausen, Nernst, thermal force, friction, cross friction, viscous stress, and gyroviscous stress terms are also demonstrated. Neglecting the nonlinear component of the Fokker-Planck collision operator is justified a posteriori. An especially computationally efficient and analytically simpler version of the RKM is presented.</description>

      <title>What Is the Minimum Number of Parameters Required to Represent Solutions of the Grad-Shafranov Equation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate solutions of the Grad--Shafranov (GS) equation are essential for equilibrium analysis, integrated modeling, and surrogate model construction in magnetic confinement fusion. In this work, we address a fundamental question: what is the minimum number of free parameters required to accurately represent numerical solutions of the GS equation under fixed-boundary conditions? We demonstrate that, for most practical applications, GS equilibria can be represented using only 2--5 free parameters while maintaining relative errors below 5\%. For higher-accuracy requirements, we introduce a unified spectral representation based on the Miller extended harmonic (MXH) expansion in the poloidal direction combined with shifted Chebyshev (Cheb) polynomials in the radial direction. This MXH--Cheb basis exhibits rapid convergence for two-dimensional GS equilibria. For configurations where three geometric moments (shift, elongation, and triangularity) are specified at the last closed flux surface (LCFS), relative errors on the order of $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}$ can be achieved using as few as 13--20 parameters. In more general cases, including up--down asymmetric equilibria, X-point configurations, and stiff pressure and current profiles (e.g., H-mode pedestals), accuracies beyond this level can be obtained with fewer than 100 parameters. The resulting equilibrium configurations and profile functions are fully analytical, with smooth derivatives of all orders. These results provide a systematic foundation for developing high-fidelity, ultra-fast GS solvers and enable efficient reduced-order and AI-based surrogate modeling of tokamak equilibria.</description>

      <title>Nutritional and growth enhancement of alfalfa sprouts through cold plasma and UV seed treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing eco-friendly techniques like cold plasma (CP) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation provides innovative approaches to enhance the sprout quality and productivity of alfalfa. This study explores the effects of CP and UV radiation on the germination, growth, and phytochemical profiles of alfalfa sprouts. CP significantly accelerated germination time, reducing median germination time by 8 hours compared to the control, and enhanced photo synthetic pigments, leading to higher biomass (25.87 mg/sprout fresh weight and 1.45 mg/sprout dry weight). UV treatments, particularly UV-C, increased chlorophyll and total flavonoid content. Overall, CP effectively promotes alfalfa germination and growth, while UV treatments improve specific phytochemicals.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties and Energy Injection in Mercury's Magnetotail Current Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mercury's magnetotail hosts a thin and highly dynamic current sheet (CS), where magnetic reconnection and strong fluctuations frequently occur. Here, we statistically analyze magnetic field power spectra across 370 magnetotail CSs observed by MESSENGER. About 20% of the events are quasi-laminar, showing single power-law spectra, whereas 80% are turbulent, exhibiting a spectral break separating inertial and kinetic ranges. A dawn-dusk asymmetry is identified: inertial-range slopes are systematically shallower on the dawnside, whereas kinetic-range slopes are steeper, indicating more developed turbulence there, consistent with the higher occurrence of reconnection-related processes on the dawnside. Component analysis shows that the transverse components, orthogonal to the tail-aligned principal field (BX), display shallow slopes near -1 in the inertial range, suggesting energy injection at ion scales rather than a classical inertial range. These results demonstrate that Mercury's unique plasma environment fundamentally reshapes the initiation of turbulence and the redistribution of energy in the magnetotail.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection with a 0.1 rate: Effective resistivity in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection is thought to power various multi-wavelength emission signatures from neutron stars and black holes. Relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics (RRMHD) offers the simplest model of reconnection. However, a small uniform resistivity underestimates the reconnection rate compared to first-principles kinetic models. By employing an effective resistivity based on kinetic models - which connects the reconnection electric field to the charge-starved current density - we show that RRMHD can reproduce the increased reconnection rate of kinetic models, both in local current sheets and in global black hole magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>The Role of Phase and Spatial Modes in Wave-Induced Plasma Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a two-dimensional symplectic map for particle motion at the plasma edge by modeling the electrostatic potential as a superposition of integer spatial harmonics with relative phase shift, then reduce it to a two-wave model to study the transport dependence on the perturbation amplitudes, relative phase, and spatial-mode choice. Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of a Multicusp-Assisted Inductively-Coupled Radio-Frequency Plasma Source for Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a detailed characterisation of a multicusp-assisted inductively coupled RF plasma source for plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). Using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and RF-compensated Langmuir probe diagnostics, we measured ion temperature T i and drift velocity v z in argon plasmas near an immersed electrode. The multicusp configuration enhances plasma density at low pressure, enabling stable operation down to 0.8 mTorr. Timeaveraged measurements show no detectable perturbation near the pulsed electrode, indicating full plasma recovery between high-voltage pulses. LIF-derived potential profiles match Riemann's presheath theory, and ion velocity distributions reveal acceleration consistent with sheath dynamics. These results support the use of LIF for steady-state characterisation of the bulk and presheath regions in PIII systems.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the space-charge dilemma in low-energy heavy ion beams via a multistage acceleration lens system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy heavy-ion beams are fundamentally limited by severe space-charge divergence, which constrains the transportable beam current to a few microamperes in conventional electrostatic accelerators. This limitation is particularly critical for high-mass ions, where the generalized perveance increases rapidly because of their low velocity. Here, we demonstrate that this apparent space-charge limit can be overcome by shaping the electrostatic potential configuration of an existing multistage accelerator, thereby transforming the acceleration column itself into a combined acceleration-focusing column. By optimizing the interstage voltage configuration, a strong electrostatic lens effect is superimposed on the accelerating field to counteract space-charge-driven expansion. We formulate a generalized design framework that quantitatively maps the transport 'design window' in terms of beam current, ion mass, and acceleration voltage. For gold ions at 64 keV, this approach enables stable transport of beam currents exceeding 100 microA, more than an order of magnitude higher than the conventional limit. Numerical phase-space analysis shows that this improvement is achieved by prioritizing envelope control over emittance preservation, a trade-off intrinsic to space-charge-dominated regimes. Our results establish a universal and practical guideline for high-current heavy-ion beam transport, relevant to fusion plasma diagnostics, ion implantation, and massive molecular ion applications.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical-Time Framework for the Dynamics of Charged Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a dynamical framework for modeling the motion of point-like charged particles, with or without mass, in general external electromagnetic fields. A key feature of this formulation is the treatment of time coordinate as a dynamical variable. The framework applies to the relativistic regime while consistently admitting a nonrelativistic limit. We also introduce a representation of particle trajectories in velocity space, which provides clear insight into the nature and asymptotic behavior of the dynamics. As an application, we compare the motion of massive and massless particles in a constant electromagnetic field and find that, for identical field configurations, their asymptotic behavior is independent of both mass and initial conditions. Finally, we explore the computational advantages of the dynamical-time formulation over the conventional uniform-time approach in two case studies: a uniform electromagnetic field, and an elliptically polarized wave propagating along a uniform magnetic field. In both scenarios, the proposed scheme exhibits improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>
