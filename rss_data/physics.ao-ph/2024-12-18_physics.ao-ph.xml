      <title>Anisotropic tidal dissipation in misaligned planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tides are the main driving force behind the long-term evolution of planetary systems. The associated energy dissipation and momentum exchanges are commonly described by Love numbers, which relate the exciting potential to the tidally perturbed potential. These transfer functions are generally assumed to depend solely on tidal frequency and body rheology, following the isotropic assumption, which presumes invariance of properties by rotation about the centre of mass. We examine the limitations of the isotropic assumption for fluid bodies, where Coriolis acceleration breaks spherical symmetry, resulting in rotational scattering and complex tidal responses. Using angular momentum theory, we derive a new formalism to calculate the tidal rates of energy and momentum transfers in non-isotropic cases. We apply this formalism to the Earth-Moon system to assess the effects of anisotropy in planet-satellite systems with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta. Our findings indicate that the isotropic assumption can introduce significant errors in planetary evolution models, particularly in the dynamical tide regime. These errors stem from forced wave resonances, with inaccuracies in energy dissipation scaling in proportion to resonance amplification factors.</description>

      <title>Theory of Unsupervised Super-Resolution Data Assimilation with Conditional Variational Autoencoders: Estimating Background Covariances via Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03351v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a theory of unsupervised super-resolution data assimilation (SRDA) using conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). The theory is based on an evidence lower bound that leads to an objective function for unsupervised learning. This function can be reduced to the objective function of a traditional data assimilation method, namely the three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) formalism. Similar to 3D-Var, it is essential to use a non-diagonal background error covariance matrix to assimilate distant observations. Instead of using such a non-diagonal matrix, we extend the proposed theory by using the non-locality of super-resolution (SR). For linear SR, SR operators serve as background error covariance matrices. For nonlinear SR, error backpropagation through SR neural networks induces covariance structures in inference. SRDA can be performed using CVAEs because the loss function for CVAEs is generally an evidence lower bound. By incorporating the SR neural network into the CVAE, the encoder estimates the high-resolution (HR) analysis from HR observations and low-resolution (LR) forecasts. The decoder acts as the observation operator and reconstructs the HR observations from the estimated HR analysis. The effectiveness of SRDA was evaluated through numerical experiments using an idealized barotropic ocean jet system. Compared to inference with an ensemble Kalman filter, SRDA demonstrated superior accuracy in HR inference. SRDA was also computationally efficient because it does not require HR numerical integration or ensemble calculations. The findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for integrating SR and DA, which will stimulate further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Transferring climate change physical knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14780v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise and reliable climate projections are required for climate adaptation and mitigation, but Earth system models still exhibit great uncertainties. Several approaches have been developed to reduce the spread of climate projections and feedbacks, yet those methods cannot capture the non-linear complexity inherent in the climate system. Using a Transfer Learning approach, we show that Machine Learning can be used to optimally leverage and merge the knowledge gained from Earth system models simulations and historical observations to reduce the spread of global surface air temperature fields projected in the 21st century. We reach an uncertainty reduction of more than 50% with respect to state-of-the-art approaches, while giving evidence that our novel method provides improved regional temperature patterns together with narrower projections uncertainty, urgently required for climate adaptation.</description>
