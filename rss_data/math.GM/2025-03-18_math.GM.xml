      <title>Further Generalization of Ramanujan Sums with Regular A-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of Ramanujan sums, the so-called regular A-function is a set-valued multiplicative function that tracks certain subsets of the divisor sets of natural numbers. McCarthy provided a generalization of the Ramanujan sum using these regular A-function based arithmetic convolutions. Recently, Burnett and Osterman extended this generalization to the semi-regular case. In this paper, we extend McCarthy's generalization in a different direction by considering two regular A-functions corresponding to both parameters in the Ramanujan sum. This further generalization is motivated by the expansion of arithmetic functions based on arbitrary regular A-functions. Fortunately, these sums exhibit several properties of Ramanujan sums. We also generalize the greatest common divisor (GCD) function and the Von Sterneck formula. Our introduction of two regular A-functions into these expressions enables us to explore a novel perspective on the connection between these expressions and the order relation between the two regular A-functions. In particular, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for orthogonality and Dedekind-Holder's identity (i.e., Ramanujan sum = Von Sterneck function) to hold.</description>

      <title>The Erd\"os-Straus Conjecture and Pythagorean Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Diophantine equation 4/n=1/x+1/y+1/z for a Pythagorean prime n is split into two independent Diophantine equations, which correspond to two different types of solution. The solvability of these equations forces certain restrictions on allowed Pythagorean primes. Empirical evidence suggests that these restrictions hold for all Pythagorean primes, which I state as two independent conjectures. One can be formulated as follows: every Pythagorean prime can be written as p=(4ab-1)(4c-1)-4abb/d, where a, b, c are natural numbers and d is a divisor of ab. The second conjecture reads: every Pythagorean prime can be written as p=(4ab-1)(4c-1)-4ac, where a, b, c are natural numbers. I give a new straightforward plausibility for the latter conjecture (which has been formulated independently by other authors) and I outline a practicle and effective algorithm to determine a,b,c for a given p.</description>

      <title>Dilute Hitomezashi on the Isometric Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes preliminary investigation of hitomezashi stitching designs created on the isometric grid. An imposed constraint is that only every second line of stitching in each of the possible three directions is present. Each vertex visited by the stitching has degree two. Motifs and wallpaper patterns with three- and six-fold rotational symmetry are illustrated, in particular designs featuring the von Koch snowflake iterates.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Fractional Neural Operators with Adaptive Hybrid Kernels in Multiscale Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces significant advancements in fractional neural operators (FNOs) through the integration of adaptive hybrid kernels and stochastic multiscale analysis. We address several open problems in the existing literature by establishing four foundational theorems. First, we achieve exact bias-variance separation for Riemann-Liouville operators using fractional Prokhorov metrics, providing a robust framework for handling non-local dependencies in differential equations. Second, we demonstrate L\'evy-regularized Hadamard stability with sharp convergence rates in Besov-Morrey spaces, enhancing FNO stability under heavy-tailed noise processes. Third, we overcome the curse of dimensionality in multivariate settings by achieving tensorized RL-Caputo convergence in RdRd with anisotropic H\"older regularity. Finally, we develop a quantum-inspired fractional gradient descent algorithm that significantly improves convergence rates in practical applications. Our proofs employ advanced techniques such as multiphase homogenization, Malliavin-Skorokhod calculus, and nonlocal divergence theorems, ensuring mathematical rigor and robustness. The practical implications of our work are demonstrated through applications in fusion plasma turbulence, where our methods yield a 70\% improvement over state-of-the-art FNOs. This enhancement is particularly notable in modeling the multifractal {\delta}B{\delta}B fields in ITER tokamak data, where the anisotropic penalty corresponds to enstrophy cascade rates in Hasegawa-Wakatani models, showcasing its versatility and potential for broader application.</description>

      <title>Convolution and Combination Matrices in Non-stationary Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time independent convolution yields circulant matrices whose eigenvectors are the Fourier exponentials with the eigenvalues being the Fourier transform of the mask. The case of time dependent convolution, the non-stationary case, no longer has this property and two matrices are then introduced, the cyclic convolution matrix and the cyclic combination matrix. In our paper, we prove results on the properties of these matrices. We give results in the context of the non-stationary frequency response in the Fourier domain, where the Fourier matrix is a full matrix in general. The techniques used here are attainable at the advanced undergraduate linear algebra settings and can be introduced into a relevant linear algebra undergraduate course.</description>

      <title>Tileset As: 3 squares with local rules for non-periodic tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a tileset of 3 squares with local constraints on their borders and corners that enforce non-periodic tiling. We start with a description of the tileset and we demonstrate that it can tile the entire plane non-periodically creating interesting patterns. Rules are also proposed to generate the tiling. They make use of 9 supertiles with border color constraints only.</description>

      <title>Is 14 a Solitary Number?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does $14$ have a friend? Till now, this is an open question, i.e., we do not know the answer. In this note, we prove that a potential friend $F$ of $14$ is an odd, non-square positive integer. $7$ appears in the prime factorization of $F$ with even exponent while at most two prime divisors of $F$ can have odd exponents in the prime factorization of $F$. If $p\mid F$ such that $p$ is congruent to $7$ modulo $8$ then $p^{2a}\mid\mid F$, for some positive integer $a$. Further, no prime divisor of $F$ has an exponent congruent to $7$ modulo $8$. The primes $3,5$ can not appear simultaneously in the prime factorization of $F$. If $(3,F)&gt;1$ or $(5,F)&gt;1$ then $\omega(F)\geq4$, otherwise $\omega(F)\geq8$.</description>

      <title>Paradoxical behavior in Collatz sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the set of positive integers, we consider an iterated process that sends $n$ to $\frac{3n+1}{2}$ or to $\frac{n}{2}$ depending on the parity of $n$. According to a conjecture due to Collatz, all such sequences end up in the cycle $(1,2)$. In a seminal paper, Terras further conjectured that the proportion of odd terms encountered when starting from $n\geq2$ is sufficient to determine its stopping time, namely, the number of iterations needed to descend below $n$. However, when iterating beyond the stopping time, there exist "paradoxical" sequences for which the first term is unexpectedly exceeded. In the present study, we show that this topic is strongly linked to the Collatz conjecture. Moreover, this non-typical behavior seems to occur finitely many times apart from the trivial cycle, thus lending support to Terras' conjecture.</description>
