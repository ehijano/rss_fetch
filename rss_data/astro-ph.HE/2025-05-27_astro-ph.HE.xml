      <title>Astrophysics with Compact Objects: An Indian Perspective, Present Status and Future Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects, viz., white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, are the remnants of stellar deaths at the end of their life cycles. They are ideal testbeds for various fundamental physical processes under extreme conditions that are unique in nature. Observational radio astronomy with uGMRT and OORT facilities has led to several important breakthroughs in studies of different kinds of pulsars and their emission mechanisms. On the other hand, accretion processes around compact objects are at the core of Indian astronomy research. In this context, AstroSat mission revolutionized spectro-temporal observations and measurements of accretion phenomena, quasi-periodic oscillations, and jet behaviour in binary systems hosting compact objects. Moreover, recently launched XPoSat mission is set to provide an impetus to these high-energy phenomena around compact objects by enabling us to conduct polarization measurements in the X-ray band. Further, during the past decade, numerous gravitational wave signals have been observed from coalescing black holes and neutron stars in binary systems. Recent simultaneous observation of the GW170817 event in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic channels has ushered in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. In the future, synergistic efforts among several world-class observational facilities, e.g., LIGO-India, SKA, TMT, etc., within the Indian astrophysics community will provide a significant boost to achieve several key science goals that have been delineated here. In general, this article plans to highlight scientific projects being pursued across Indian institutions in this field, the scientific challenges that this community would be focusing on, and the opportunities in the coming decade. Finally, we have also mentioned the required resources, both in the form of infrastructural and human resources.</description>

      <title>Filling fractions for the formation of nuclear pasta in neutron stars: semiclassical vs liquid-drop predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, a sequence of nuclear pasta shapes was predicted to appear in the deepest region of the inner crust of a neutron star within the compressible liquid-drop picture, when the filling fraction $u$ exceeds some threshold values. However, later calculations showed that these values depend on the details of the liquid-drop model. Here we investigate the existence of pasta in neutron stars within the semiclassical extended Thomas-Fermi approach using various generalized Skyrme functionals. The filling fractions for the different transitions are found to be quasi-universal, unlike the pasta density ranges governed by the symmetry energy at relevant densities. In particular, pasta emerge at $u_\mathrm{sp}\approx0.13-0.15$. By applying a simplified stability criterion within the liquid-drop framework, we show that these values of $u_\mathrm{sp}$ can be explained by the nuclear curvature correction. In this way, the abundance of pasta can be easily estimated. This criterion can also be used to optimize the search of pasta within the more realistic extended Thomas-Fermi approach.</description>

      <title>The Hawaii Infrared Supernova Study (HISS): Spectroscopic Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first data release of the Hawaii Infrared Supernova Study (\textit{HISS}), consisting of a large sample of near-infrared (NIR) spectra, $0.7 - 2.5 \mathrm{\mu m}$, obtained with the Keck-II/NIRES and IRTF/SpeX spectrographs. This sample is comprised of 90 NIR spectra of 48 transient events, spanning from hours after explosion to $\geq + 350$ days. Acquired over three years (2021-2024), this data release includes 17 Type Ia SNe, 15 Type II SNe, 8 Stripped Envelope SNe, 6 interacting SNe, 1 TDE, and 1 SLSN-I. These spectra were all systematically reduced using either the \textsc{Python}-based reduction code \textsc{Pypeit} or the \textsc{IDL}-based \textsc{Spextool} and constitute one of the largest NIR samples of transients available to the astrophysical community. We show the utility of NIR spectra and identify the key spectral features across multiple types of SNe. We show how both early-time and nebular-phase NIR spectra can be used to investigate the physics of the explosion, and to reveal the properties of the progenitor. With the addition of this dataset, the number of publicly available NIR spectra spanning multiple transient types has been substantially increased. In its next phase, \textit{HISS} will leverage target-of-opportunity spectral observations and NIR imaging from telescopes on Maunakea. Expanding the NIR dataset of SNe is vital to the transient community, particularly in light of the increasing emphasis on the infrared regime following the recent launch of the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} and the forthcoming launch of the \textit{Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope}.</description>

      <title>BL Lacertae under the Flare of 2024: Probing Temporal and Spectral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In October 2024, the object BL Lacertae experienced the brightest flaring event in gamma-ray ($&gt;$100 MeV) with a historically bright $\gamma$-ray flux of $\sim$2.59 $\times 10^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ with a detection of a 175.7 GeV photon with Fermi-LAT. This event was also followed by very high-energy $\gamma$-ray detection with LHAASO, VERITAS, and MAGIC. Soon after, Swift-XRT and Swift-UVOT follow-up confirmed the concurrent flare in X-ray, UV, and optical bands. A minimum flux doubling/halving time of 1.06 $\pm$ 0.26 hour with 4$\sigma$ significance has been observed with the Fermi-LAT orbit binned light curve. No compelling correlation has been found between $\gamma$-ray spectral indices and fluxes. The log-normal $\gamma$-ray flux distribution during the flare confirms the multiplicative nature of the non-linear perturbation causing the flare. We applied a one-zone leptohadronic model to fit the broadband SED during the flaring period. The broadband SED modeling reveals that the sudden enhancement of the magnetic field and bulk factor might promote the flare. The SED modeling also suggested a more compact emission region, which may be described by a shorter variability time than the observed one. The hadronic part best fitted the high energy part of the spectrum, suggesting the jets of BL Lac could provide a promising environment to accelerate the cosmic ray particles, such as protons. The jets of BL Lacertae could also be the possible source of astrophysical neutrinos, as an upper limit on neutrinos has already been reported from IceCube.</description>

      <title>Eccentric millisecond pulsar + subdwarf B star from rotationally delayed accretion-induced-collapse scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star + helium star systems are attracting more and more attentions. Following the rotationally delayed accretion-induced-collapse (RD-AIC) scenario, I predict that there could be eccentric millisecond pulsar + subdwarf B (MSP + sdB), at least eccentric neutron star + subdwarf B (NS + sdB) systems in the Galaxy. I show the predictions on their orbital parameters, including MSP mass, secondary mass, eccentricity and orbital period. Based on two detailed binary population synthesis calculations, we find that their Galactic birth rate is $(0.67-1.5)\times10^{\rm -4}~{\rm yr^{\rm -1}}$. Then, a very conservative upper limit of their number in the Galaxy is 6700-15000. They have an age of hundreds of Myr and then should be discovered in relatively young environments. In addition, most of the MSPs in the eccentric MSP + sdB systems have a mass less massive than 1.5 $M_{\odot}$. I simply discuss their future potential applications in astrophysical fields.</description>

      <title>Magnetothermal evolution of neutron star cores in the `weak-coupling' regime: implications of ambipolar diffusion for the quiescent X-ray luminosity of magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high quiescent X-ray luminosity observed in some magnetars is widely attributed to the decay and evolution of their ultra-strong magnetic fields. Several dissipation mechanisms have been proposed, each operating with different efficiencies depending on the region of the star. In this context, ambipolar diffusion, i.e., the relative motion of charged particles with respect to neutrons in the neutron star core, has been proposed as a promising candidate due to its strong dependence on magnetic field strength and its capacity to convert magnetic energy into heat. We perform axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the long-term magnetic evolution of a NS core composed of normal (non-Cooper paired) matter under the influence of ambipolar diffusion. The core is modeled as a two-fluid system consisting of neutrons and a charged-particle fluid (protons and electrons), coupled to the magnetic field. Simulations are performed both at constant and variable temperatures. In the latter case, a strategy that decouples the magnetic and thermal evolution is employed, enabling efficient thermal modeling across a range of initial magnetic field strengths. At constant temperature, we obtained the expected result where neutrons reach diffusive equilibrium, the Lorentz force is balanced by chemical potential gradients of charged particles, and the magnetic field satisfies a non-linear Grad-Shafranov equation. When thermal evolution is included, fields $B \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{15} \,\text{G}$ can balance ambipolar heating and neutrino cooling, delaying the evolution over $\sim 10^{3} \,[B/(5 \times 10^{15}\,\text{G})]^{-6/5}$ yr. Although the surface luminosity is enhanced compared to passive cooling, the heating from ambipolar diffusion alone is insufficient to fully explain the persistent X-ray emission observed in magnetars.</description>

      <title>Emergence of new oscillation modes in dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter admixed neutron stars provide a promising avenue for observationally probing the dark matter characteristic. In this study, we examine non-radial oscillations in neutron stars containing self-interacting dark matter, which interacts with normal matter exclusively via gravity. To achieve this, we derive a new set of perturbation equations for a multi-fluid system under the Cowling approximation. Using these equations, we analyze the oscillation spectra and identify additional modes associated with dark matter, alongside those of normal matter. We find that the frequency behavior becomes more intricate with increasing self-coupling strength of dark matter, particularly as the stellar structure transitions between dark core and dark halo configurations, depending on the total stellar mass. Nevertheless, we find that in the dark core structure, the fundamental ($f$) mode frequencies associated with dark matter exceed those of normal matter, at least when the central energy densities of both fluids are equal. Furthermore, we find that the $f$-mode frequencies associated with normal matter in dark core configurations adhere to a universal relation between the mass-scaled frequency and stellar compactness.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the infrared/X-ray correlation of GX 339-4 based on a jet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infrared (IR)/X-ray correlation of GX 339$-$4 is investigated based on a jet model with a modification by linking the magnetic field at the jet base to the accretion rate of the inner accretion flow though the the equilibrium between magnetic pressure at horizon and the ram pressure of the accretion flow. The IR flux is attributed to the synchrotron radiation of the jet, and the X-ray flux is attributed to the advective dominated accretion flow (ADAF), synchrotron radiation of the jet and synchrotron self-Compton scattering (SSC) of the jet, respectively. We find that the observed IR/X-ray correlation with a break is well reproduced with the variation of the accretion rate if the X-ray flux originates from SSC of the jet. Either a conical ballistic jet with the magnetic field parallel to the jet axis or a conical adiabatic jet with an isotropic field can account for the correlation. The power-law index of the energy distribution of electrons $p\sim3$, the minimum Lorentz factor of the electrons $\gamma_{\rm min}\sim60$, the magnetic field $B_0\sim10^5\ {\rm G}$ and the jet radius $R_0\sim10^{10}\ {\rm cm}$ at the jet base are required for both the ballistic jet and the adiabatic jet. This study helps us clarify the complex interaction between the accretion and jet in GX 339$-$4, as well as the properties and geometric structure of the jet, laying the groundwork for exploring similar astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Contribution to the 2025 Gravitation session of the 59th Rencontres de Moriond: Limits on the Ejecta Mass During the Search for Kilonovae Associated with Neutron Star-Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates ejecta properties from multi-messenger observations to understand the absence of detectable KN associated to the four NSBH candidates from May 2023 to July 2024: we use GW public information and joint observations taken from 05.2023 to 07.2024 (LVK, ATLAS, DECam, GECKO, GOTO, GRANDMA, SAGUARO, TESS, WINTER, ZTF) in the followup of S230518h, GW230529, S230627c and S240422ed. First, our analysis on follow-up observation strategies shows that, on average, more than 50\% of the simulated KNe associated with NSBH mergers reach their peak luminosity around one day after merger in the $g,r,i$- bands, which is not necessarily covered for each NSBH GW candidate. We also analyze the trade-off between observation efficiency and the intrinsic properties of the KN emission, to understand the impact on how these constraints affect our ability to detect the KN, and underlying ejecta properties for each GW candidate.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversions in QCD phase-transition supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae undergoing a first-order quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition experience the collapse of the central proto-neutron star that leads to a second bounce. This event is accompanied by the release of a second neutrino burst. Unlike the first stellar core bounce neutrino burst which consists exclusively of electron neutrinos, the second burst is dominated by electron antineutrinos. Such a condition makes QCD supernovae an ideal site for the occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC), which can lead to rapid flavor equilibration and significantly impact the related neutrino signal. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the conditions for fast flavor instability (FFI) around and after the second neutrino burst in a QCD phase transition supernova model launched from a 25~$M_\odot$ progenitor mass. We evaluate the relevant instability criteria and find two major phases of FFC. The first phase is closely associated with the collapse and the rapidly expanding shock wave, which is a direct consequence of the proto-neutron star collapse due to the phase transition. The second phase takes place a few milliseconds later when electron degeneracy is restored near the proto-neutron star surface. We also characterize the growth rate of FFI and estimate its impact on the evolution of the neutrino flavor content. The potential observational consequences on neutrino signals are evaluated by comparing a scenario assuming complete flavor equipartition with other scenarios without FFC. Finally, we investigate how FFC may influences $r$-process nucleosynthesis associated with QCD phase transition driven supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>Observing Supernova Neutrino Light Curves with Super-Kamiokande.VI. A Practical Data Analysis Technique Considering Realistic Experimental Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos from supernovae, especially those emitted during the late phase of core collapse, are essential for understanding the final stages of massive star evolution. We have been dedicated to developing methods for the analysis of neutrinos emitted during the late phase and observed at Super-Kamiokande (SK). Our previous studies have successfully demonstrated the potential of various analysis methods in extracting essential physical properties; however, the lack of background consideration has limited their practical application. In this study, we address this issue by incorporating a realistic treatment of the experimental signal and background events with the on-going SK experiment. We therefore optimize our analysis framework to reflect realistic observational conditions, including both signal and background events. Using this framework we study several long-time supernova models, simulating the late phase neutrino observation in SK and focusing in particular on the identification of the last observed event. We discuss the possibility of model discrimination methods using timing information from this last observed event.</description>

      <title>Do multifrequency polarimetric observations of BL Lac exclude a hadronic origin of its X-ray emission?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multifrequency polarimetric observations of the eponymous blazar BL Lac reveal an extremely large degree of polarization in the optical band (average of $25\%$, reaching $45\%$), together with a small ($\lesssim 7\%$) degree of polarization in the X-ray band. This has been interpreted as evidence that the X-rays are produced through inverse Compton emission by relativistic electrons, thus ruling out alternative models based on hadronic processes. Here we revisit the observational evidence, interpreting it in a framework where the observed radiation is entirely produced through synchrotron emission. Electrons produce the radio-to-optical component and protons produce the X-rays and the gamma-rays. We determine the jet magnetic fields from an MHD model of magnetically dominated stationary axisymmetric outflows, and show that the X-ray emission from the protons is naturally less polarized than the optical emission from the electrons. The model parameters required to reproduce the multifrequency polarimetric observations are fully compatible with blazar jets.</description>

      <title>SN 2024aecx: A double-peaked rapidly evolving Type IIb supernova at 11 Mpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of low-resolution spectroscopic and densely sampled multiband simultaneous optical imaging ($ugi$ and $vrz$ bands) follow-up of supernova (SN) 2024aecx. The photometric data is supplemented with $Swift$/UVOT and ATLAS survey observations. The SN was discovered in the spiral galaxy NGC 3521 (distance $\sim$11 Mpc) within a day after the explosion. The early spectra of SN 2024aecx show a weak signature of hydrogen lines, which disappeared in $\sim$30 days after the explosion. Light curves in all bands show a distinct feature of two peaks, and the first peak is likely due to the shock cooling emission. The early phase light curve evolution of SN 2024aecx has similarity with the typical Type IIb events, but the decay rate in different bands (e.g., $\rm \Delta m_{15}$ = 1.60 $\pm$ 0.05 mag, $g$-band) is significantly faster in the post-peak phase. It attained the secondary maximum in $\sim$19 days ($g$-band) with a peak absolute magnitude of M$_{g}$= -17.94 $\pm$ 0.10 mag. The color evolution of SN 2024aecx is displaying a red-blue-red trend between days $\sim$8 to 40. The analytical model fitting to the light curves reveals an envelope mass and progenitor radii in the range of $\sim$0.03 - 0.24 $M_\odot$ and $\sim$169 - 200 $R_\odot$, respectively. Modeling of the pseudo-bolometric light curve suggests that synthesized $^{56}$Ni in the explosion was $\sim$0.15 M$_{\odot}$ with ejecta mass and kinetic energy of $\sim$0.7 M$_{\odot}$ and $\sim$0.16 x 10$^{51}$ erg, respectively. The observational properties and modeling indicate that the SN 2024aecx progenitor belongs to the extended progenitor category.</description>

      <title>Estimating the binary neutron star merger rate density evolution with Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET) is a proposed third-generation, wide-band gravitational wave (GW) detector which will have an improved detection sensitivity in low frequencies, leading to a longer observation time in the detection band and higher detection rate for binary neutron stars (BNSs). Despite the fact that ET will have a higher detection rate, a large fraction of BNSs will remain undetectable. We present a scheme to estimate accurate detection efficiency and to reconstruct the true merger rate density of the population of the BNSs, as a function of redshift. We show that with ET as a single instrumnet, for a population of BNSs with $R_{mer} \sim 100 (300)$ $\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ at $z\sim 0(2)$, we can reconstruct the merger rate density uptil $z \sim 2$ , with a relative error of $12\%$ at ($z \sim 2$), despite the loss in detection of the bulk of the BNS population.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the X-ray binary transient MAXI J1834-021: clues from its first observed outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MAXI J1834-021 is a new X-ray transient that was discovered in February 2023. We analysed the spectral and timing properties of MAXI J1834-021 using NICER, NuStar and Swift data collected between March and October 2023. The light curve showed a main peak followed by a second activity phase. The majority of the spectra extracted from the individual NICER observations could be adequately fitted with a Comptonisation component alone, while a few of them required an additional thermal component. The spectral evolution is consistent with a softening trend as the source gets brighter in X-rays. We also analysed the broadband spectrum combining data from simultaneous NICER and NuStar observations on 2023 March 10. This spectrum can be fitted with a disc component with a temperature at the inner radius of $kT_{\rm in} \sim 0.4$ keV and a Comptonisation component with a power-law photon index of $\Gamma \sim 1.8$. By including a reflection component in the modelling, we obtained a 3$\sigma$ upper limit for the inner disc radius of 11.4 gravitational radii. We also detected a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO), whose central frequency varies with time (from 2 Hz to $\sim$0.9 Hz) and anti-correlates with the hardness ratio. Based on the observed spectral-timing properties, MAXI J1834-021, can be classified as a low-mass X-ray binary in outburst. However, we are not able to draw a definitive conclusion on the nature of the accreting compact object, which at the moment could as well be a black hole or a neutron star.</description>

      <title>Investigating Accretion Disk-Corona in Seyfert 1 galaxies: A UV/X-ray Spectral Study of Mrk 813 and RBS 688</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a broadband UV/X-ray spectral study of two Seyfert 1 galaxies, Mrk 813 and RBS 688, primarily based on AstroSat observations. These active galactic nuclei host relatively large super-massive black holes ($M_{BH} \sim 10^8 - 10^9M_{\odot}$), suffer negligible internal extinction/absorption, and are well suited for probing the inner regions of their accretion disks using far UV and soft X-ray spectra. In the case of Mrk 813, the AstroSat and HST far UV spectra are steeper than those expected from a standard accretion disk; the deficit of emission at shorter wavelengths suggests a truncated accretion disk with an inner radius $r_{in} \sim 70r_g$. Joint UV/X-ray broadband spectral modelling with FAGNSED and RELAGN models suggests that the apparent truncation in Mrk 813 is most likely due to the presence of a warm Comptonising disk in the inner regions that is responsible for the observed soft X-ray excess emission. RBS 688 lacks the soft X-ray excess emission, and the UV data are entirely consistent with a standard disk that appears to extend very close to the innermost stable circular orbit. Our study suggests the formation of the warm, optically-thick Comptonising corona in the innermost disk regions at higher Eddington fraction.</description>

      <title>Study on the magnetic field of the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar RX J0209.6-7427</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RX J0209.6-7427 is an ultraluminous X-ray pulsar (ULXP) having spin period of about 9.3 s. To date, no cyclotron resonance scattering features have been detected in this source, which can enable direct measurement of the magnetic field of the pulsar. We estimate the surface magnetic field of the neutron star in this source using different models and find that the inferred magnetic field lies in the range of $2.4-4 \times 10^{13}$G. We study the magnetic field and spin period evolution of the source using existing models and find that the magnetic field will decay to about $\sim 10^{9}$G and the source will become a millisecond pulsar at the end of the accretion phase of the accreting binary. Comparison between the magnetic field and the spin period of other ULXPs with those of magnetars suggests that some ULXPs may be accreting magnetars. Studying the magnetic and spin period evolution of ULXPs may be helpful for understanding magnetar evolution and the millisecond pulsar formation.</description>

      <title>Binary mass transfer in 3D -- Mass Transfer Rate and Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass transfer is crucial in binary evolution, yet its theoretical treatment has long relied on analytic models whose key assumptions remain debated. We present a direct and systematic evaluation of these assumptions using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations including the Coriolis force. We simulate streams overflowing from both the inner and outer Lagrangian points, quantify mass transfer rates, and compare them with analytic solutions. We introduce scaling factors, including the overfilling factor, to render the problem dimensionless. The donor-star models are simplified, with either an isentropic initial stratification and adiabatic evolution or an isothermal structure and evolution, but the scalability of this formulation allows us to extend the results for a mass-transferring system to arbitrarily small overfilling factors. We find that the Coriolis force -- often neglected in analytic models -- strongly impacts the stream morphology: breaking axial symmetry, reducing the stream cross section, and shifting its origin toward the donor's trailing side. Contrary to common assumptions, the sonic surface is not flat and does not always intersect the Lagrangian point: instead, it is concave and shifted, particularly toward the accretor's trailing side. Despite these structural asymmetries, mass transfer rates are only mildly suppressed relative to analytic predictions and the deviation is remarkably small -- within a factor of two (ten) for the inner (outer) Lagrangian point over seven orders of magnitude in mass ratio. We use our results to extend the widely-used mass-transfer rate prescriptions by Ritter(1988) and Kolb&amp;Ritter(1990), for both the inner and outer Lagrangian points. These extensions can be readily adopted in stellar evolution codes like MESA, with minimal changes where the original models are already in use.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the modelling of black hole ringdown beyond General Relativity (GR), emphasizing the limitations of approaches that rely solely on shifted quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies. Starting from modified Teukolsky equations in such scenarios, we classify the distinct types of deviations that can arise -- those shifting QNM frequencies, and those introducing additional frequencies associated with extra fields. We then construct the most general ansatz for metric perturbations in this context and discuss its implications for QNM modelling and theory-agnostic tests of GR using gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>A 3D Monte Carlo calculation of the inverse Compton emission from the Sun and stars in presence of magnetic and electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar steady emission in gamma rays is due to the interactions of Galactic cosmic rays with the solar atmosphere and with the low-energy solar photon field via inverse Compton scattering. The emission is sensitive to the magnetic field nearby the Sun and to the cosmic-ray transport in the magnetic field in the inner solar system. Modeling the inverse Compton emission in the presence of a magnetic field is therefore crucial to better interpret the observations. In a previous work we have presented a comprehensive calculation of the secondary productions due to the collision of cosmic rays with the solar atmosphere in presence of magnetic fields. In this paper, we present a general approach to calculate the (anisotropic) inverse Compton scattering in a 3D Monte Carlo simulation, also in presence of magnetic and electric fields. After a short review of the scattering process of photons with electrons, examples of inverse Compton emission are presented, including the predictions for the Sun.</description>

      <title>A neural network for estimating compact binary coalescence parameters of gravitational-wave events in real time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency pipelines analyzing gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence events rely on matched filter techniques. Limitations in template banks and waveform modeling, as well as nonstationary detector noise cause errors in signal parameter recovery, especially for events with high chirp masses. We present a quantile regression neural network model that provides dynamic bounds on key parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, and total mass. We test the model on various synthetic datasets and real events from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave transient catalogs. We find that the model accuracy is consistently over 90% across all the datasets. We explore the possibility of employing the neural network bounds as priors in online parameter estimation. We find that they reduce by 9% the number of likelihood evaluations. This approach may shorten parameter estimation run times without affecting sky localizations.</description>

      <title>Betelgeuse's Buddy: X-Ray Constraints on the Nature of $\alpha$ Ori B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\sim$$2100$d Long Secondary Period of Betelgeuse's optical lightcurve and radial velocity motivated the prediction of a low-mass stellar companion, expected to be at maximal apparent separation from Betelgeuse around December 2024. We carried out Director's Discretionary Time observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to identify any X-ray emission from the companion and constrain its nature as either a compact object or young stellar object (YSO). Past X-ray observations occurred at the wrong phase of the companion's orbit for optimal detection prospects and/or lacked the deep exposure required to constrain the typical X-ray luminosities of YSOs. In our 41.85 ks exposure with Chandra, we do not detect an X-ray source at the position of Betelgeuse. For an estimated hydrogen column density $N_H$$=$$6\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, we place a limit on the X-ray luminosity of $L_X$$\lesssim$$2\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim$$4.7\times10^{-4}L_\odot$) in $0.5$$-$$8$ keV for a 10 MK plasma temperature spectral model, or $L_X$$\lesssim$$5\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\lesssim$$1.2\times10^{-4}L_\odot$) for an absorbed power law with photon index $\Gamma$$=$$2$. These limits robustly exclude an accreting compact object (white dwarf or neutron star) as the companion. Solar mass YSOs with an age similar to Betelgeuse ($\sim$10 Myr) display a range of X-ray luminosities ($10^{28-32}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and we can place upper bounds within this range for most absorbing columns. Based on these considerations, we conclude that the companion to Betelgeuse is likely a low-mass YSO.</description>

      <title>Radio Observations as a Probe of Cosmic Web Magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Universe's magnetogenesis can be investigated with radio observations of cosmic filaments, where the information on the initial magnetic field seeds is expected to be preserved in time. In this work, we update the comparison between recent observational results in filaments with the predictions from recent cosmological simulations to check whether one of them is favoured. The radio probes we use are the rotation measure (RM) of filaments as a function of the redshift ($z$), stacking of synchrotron emission from filaments, and the RM radial profile away from galaxy groups. The first two probes favour the presence of a dominant primordial magnetic field component and disfavour a sole astrophysical scenario, the third probe does not yet give an unambiguous outcome. We also estimate the average field strength in filaments. Independently of the scenario and the shape of the astrophysical component RM, it is in the range 10--60 nG at $z=0$, while, when restricted to the model that gives the best match to the simulations, it gives $43\pm 7$ nG, with an astrophysical component RM rapidly decreasing with the redshift.</description>

      <title>Towards Laboratory Electron-Positron Plasma via Electromagnetic Showers in Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinetic equations describing electromagnetic showers from high-energy electron beams interacting with targets are solved, building on the analytical framework developed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 135001 (2025)]. Two regimes are defined by the ratio of the target thickness L to the radiation length Lr , which depends on the electron energy and target composition. For thin targets (L &lt; Lr ), we derive explicit expressions for the spectra of produced photons and pairs, as well as the number of pairs. For thick targets (L&gt;Lr ), we obtain the total pair number and photon spectrum. Analytical results agree well with Geant4 simulations, which show that significant pair escape requires L&lt;Lr . The divergence, density and characteristic dimensions of the escaping pair jets are obtained, and a criterion for pair plasma formation is derived. While current laser wakefield beams are not well adapted, multi-petawatt lasers may provide new electron or photon sources suitable for laboratory pair plasma production, opening new avenues for studying extreme plasma astrophysics in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Constraints on maximum neutron star mass from proto-neutron star evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proto-neutron star (PNS) gets formed after a successful supernova when the stellar remnant decouples from the ejecta. In this study, we explore a relativistic framework for the finite-temperature $\beta$-equilibrium limit of equation of state (EOS), constrained via a Bayesian inference methodology. The EOS is constrained by minimal approximations on a few nuclear saturation properties, low-density pure neutron matter constraints from chiral effective field theory, and a neutron star (NS) maximum mass greater than 2.0 $M_{\odot}$. Two sets of EOS derived from the relativistic mean field model for nucleonic and hyperonic matter constrained by a Bayesian inference calculation at the zero temperature limit are used. The thermal adiabatic index ($\Gamma_{\rm Th}$) is calculated as a function of the baryonic density across several temperatures for both the sets. Our results suggest that the maximum NS mass is of the order of 2.15 $M_\odot$ if hyperons are present. In addition, the present study suggests that an observation of NS with mass larger than $2.2\ M_{\odot}$ can indirectly indicates the absence of hyperons in its core. The deleptonization of hyperonic PNS reduces the stellar maximum mass rendering the PNS exceeding the zero temperature maximum stellar (baryonic) mass limit becomes metastable which is prone to collapse into a black hole while PNS below such a mass threshold evolves to a stable NS.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian model mixing (BMM) is a statistical technique that can combine constraints from different regions of an input space in a principled way. Here we extend our BMM framework for the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting matter from symmetric nuclear matter to asymmetric matter, specifically focusing on zero-temperature, charge-neutral, $\beta$-equilibrated matter. We use Gaussian processes (GPs) to infer constraints on the neutron star matter EOS at intermediate densities from two different microscopic theories: chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) at baryon densities around nuclear saturation, $n_B \sim n_0$, and perturbative QCD at asymptotically high baryon densities, $n_B \geqslant 20 n_0$. The uncertainties of the $\chi$EFT and pQCD EOSs are obtained using the BUQEYE truncation error model. We demonstrate the flexibility of our framework through the use of two categories of GP kernels: conventional stationary kernels and a non-stationary changepoint kernel. We use the latter to explore potential constraints on the dense matter EOS by including exogenous data representing theory predictions and heavy-ion collision measurements at densities $\geqslant 2n_0$. We also use our EOSs to obtain neutron star mass-radius relations and their uncertainties. Our framework, whose implementation will be available through a GitHub repository, provides a prior distribution for the EOS that can be used in large-scale neutron-star inference frameworks.</description>

      <title>Ground Calibration Result of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) onboard the Einstein Probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on results of the on-ground X-ray calibration of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) built from novel lobster-eye micro-pore optics, onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite. To fully characterize the instrumental performance and properties, a series of tests and calibrations have been carried out at different levels of devices, assemblies and the complete module before the launch of EP. In this paper, we present the calibration results of three flight model modules (FM1, FM5 and FM11) obtained during their end-to-end module calibration experiments carried out at the 100-m X-ray Test Facility (100XF) of IHEP, CAS. Measurements of the Point Spread Function (PSF), effective area, and energy response were performed for multiple incident directions and several characteristic X-ray emission line energies. Specifically, the distributions of the PSF and effective areas are found to be roughly uniform across the FoV, in large agreement with the prediction of lobster-eye optics. Their energy dependence behavior aligns well with theoretical predictions and Monte Carlo simulations. At 1.25 keV, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the focal spot is in range of 3-7 arcmin (a median of 4.2) and the effective area in range of 2-3 $cm^2$. Noticeably, the flight model instruments demonstrate a $\sim1.5$ arcmin spatial resolution improvement over the previously launched Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy. The properties of the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors were also calibrated. The gain coefficients are in range of 6.4-6.9 eV/DN. The energy resolutions are in range of 120-140 eV at 1.25 keV, meeting design requirements. These calibration results have been ingested into the first version of calibration database (CALDB) and applied to the analysis of the scientific data acquired by WXT after the launch of EP.</description>

      <title>Origins of Supermassive Black Holes in Galactic Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct imaging of black hole shadow halos has firmly confirmed the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with millions of solar masses, residing at the centers of the Milky Way and M87 galaxies. These groundbreaking discoveries represent a monumental success of Einstein's theory of general relativity and have revealed the hidden "monsters" lurking at the centers of galaxies. Moreover, observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) indicate that SMBHs with billions of solar masses were already in place within the first billion years after the Big Bang. However, the origins of these SMBHs, as well as their co-evolution with host galaxies, remain poorly understood. This review focuses on the origin of SMBHs, particularly on the formation of their seed black holes. We also highlight several outstanding challenges in modeling seed formation and discuss possible observational signatures. These signatures may be testable with current and future facilities, including the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the upcoming gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</description>

      <title>Infrared diagnostics of late-time core-collapse supernova spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations of red-supergiant and He-star explosions are presented, extending previous work to focus on the infrared emission from atoms and ions in the ejecta during the nebular-phase (i.e., ~200 to ~500d) -- molecules and dust are ignored. We cover non-rotating, solar-metallicity progenitors spanning an initial mass between 10 and about 40Msun, and exploding as Type II or Ibc supernovae (SNe). Both photometrically and spectroscopically, the SN II models evolve distinctly from the SN Ibc models, primarily because of the greater ejecta kinetic-energy-to-mass ratio in the latter, which leads to a greater gamma-ray escape together with a lower density and a higher ionization in our H-deficient ejecta. Type II SN models remain optically luminous at all times, whereas SN Ibc models progressively brighten in the infrared (which holds 80% of their luminosity at 500d), causing strong infrared lines such as [NeII]12.81mic or [NiII]6.634mic to evolve essentially at constant luminosity. We find that the strength of [NeII]12.81mic correlates with progenitor mass but with additional strong sensitivity to, for example, ejecta ionization -- this line radiates alone up to 20% of the SN luminosity after ~300d in our SN Ibc models. The numerous infrared Ni lines are found to be good tracers of the material that underwent explosive nucleosynthesis and can thus be used to constrain the level of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SNe. The evolution of the integrated flux in infrared Fe and Co lines shows much diversity, which compromises their use as diagnostic of the 56Ni-decay power source in our models. Future spectroscopic observations of core-collapse SNe by the JWST will provide unprecedented information on the emission from atoms and ions in their ejecta, delivering critical constraints on the inner workings of massive star explosions.</description>

      <title>Probing Memory-Burdened Primordial Black Holes with Galactic Sources observed by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently identified \textit{memory burden} effect has the potential to significantly decelerate the evaporation of black holes. Specifically, when approximately half of a black hole's initial mass has been radiated away, the evaporation process is halted. This mechanism allows very light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $m_{\rm PBH}&lt;10^{15}$ g to persist until the present day and may contribute to the dark matter (DM) content of the universe. In this work, we focus on PBHs with masses $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g. Due to the memory burden effect, these PBHs emit high-energy gamma-rays, which in turn alter the corresponding observed energy spectra. To investigate the constraints on the masses and DM abundance of PBHs, we analyze data from four Galactic sources measured by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), including the Crab Nebula, LHAASO J2226+6057, LHAASO J1908+0621, and LHAASO J1825-1326. Our findings indicate that the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray spectra from these Galactic sources provide crucial probes for light PBHs, thereby significantly constraining their potential contribution to DM.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Inner Crust at Finite Temperatures: A Comparison Between Compressible Liquid Drop and Extended Thomas-Fermi Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of temperature on the properties of the inner crust of a non-accreting neutron star. To this aim, we employ two different treatments: the compressible liquid drop model (CLDM) and the temperature-dependent extended Thomas-Fermi (TETF) method. Our systematic comparison shows an agreement between the two methods on their predictions for the crust thermodynamic properties. We find that the CLDM description can also reproduce reasonably well the TETF composition especially if the surface energy is optimized on the ETF calculation. However, the neglect of neutron skin in CLDM leads to an overestimation of the proton radii.</description>

      <title>Joint constraint on the jet structures from the short GRB population and GRB 170817A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nearest GRB 170817A provided an opportunity to probe the angular structure of the jet of this short gamma-ray burst (SGRB), by using its off-axis observed afterglow emission. It is investigated that whether the afterglow-constrained jet structures can be consistent with the luminosity of the prompt emission of GRB 170817A. Furthermore, by assuming that all SGRBs including GRB 170817A have the same explosive mechanism and jet structure, we apply the different jet structures to the calculation of the flux and redshift distributions of the SGRB population, confronting with the observational distributions of the Swift and Fermi sources. In comparison, it is found that the power-law and double-Gaussian models could be somewhat more favored than the single-Gaussian structure, as the last one could be not very consistent with the flux distribution of the Fermi data. Nevertheless, in view of the large uncertainty of parameters, we are still unable to make a sufficiently conclusive judgment at present.</description>

      <title>Modification of the universal relation between mass, radius and nonradial $f$-mode oscillation in proto-neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars are usually assumed to be cold; however, in certain dynamical astrophysical scenarios such as newly born neutron stars or binary star mergers, the temperature effects play a non-negligible role. We systematically derive the equation of state at finite-temperature within a relativistic mean-field hadronic model applicable to such proto-neutron stars. The equation of state so derived considerably affects the mass-radius curve, thereby affecting the nonradial quadruple $f$-mode oscillation frequencies.} Temperature effectively makes the equation of state stiffer at relatively low and intermediate densities, thereby making the star less compact and flattening the mass-radius curve. The $f$-mode frequency for low and intermediate-mass neutron stars decreases with temperature and thus should be easier to detect. The universal relation (connecting $f$-mode frequency, mass, and radius) changes nonlinearly with temperature. The parameters defining the universal relation [$\omega M = a(T) \left(\frac{M}{R}\right) + b(T)$] becomes temperature dependent with the coefficients following a parabolic relation with temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor instabilities appear to be omnipresent in dense astrophysical environments, thus presenting a challenge to large-scale simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers (NSMs). Subgrid models offer a path forward, but require an accurate determination of the local outcome of such conversion phenomena. Focusing on "fast" instabilities, related to the existence of a crossing between neutrino and antineutrino angular distributions, we consider a range of analytical mixing schemes, including a new, fully three-dimensional one, and also introduce a new machine learning (ML) model. We compare the accuracy of these models with the results of several thousands of local dynamical calculations of neutrino evolution from the conditions extracted from classical NSM simulations. Our ML model shows good overall performance, but struggles to generalize to conditions from a NSM simulation not used for training. The multidimensional analytic model performs and generalizes even better, while other analytic models (which assume axisymmetric neutrino distributions) do not have reliably high performances, as they notably fail as expected to account for effects resulting from strong anisotropies. The ML and analytic subgrid models extensively tested here are both promising, with different computational requirements and sources of systematic errors.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Three Methods for Triggering Core-collapse Supernova Explosions in Spherical Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the three-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), simulations in spherical symmetry (1D) play an important role to study large model sets for the progenitor-remnant connection, explosion properties, remnant masses, and CCSN nucleosynthesis. To trigger explosions in 1D, various numerical recipes have been applied, mostly with gross simplifications of the complex microphysics governing stellar core collapse, the formation of the compact remnant, and the mechanism of the explosion. Here we investigate the two most popular treatments, piston-driven and thermal-bomb explosions, in comparison to 1D explosions powered by a parametric neutrino engine in the P-HOTB code. For this comparison we calculate CCSNe for eight stars and evolution times up to 10,000 s, targeting the same progenitor-specific explosion energies as obtained by the neutrino-engine results. Otherwise we employ widely-used ("classic") modelling assumptions, and alternatively to the standard contraction-expansion trajectory for pistons, we also test suitably selected Lagrangian mass shells adopted from the neutrino-driven explosions as "special trajectories." Although the 56Ni production agrees within roughly a factor of two between the different explosion triggers, neither piston nor thermal bombs can reproduce the correlation of 56Ni yields and explosion energies found in neutrino-driven explosions. This shortcoming as well as the problem of massive fallback witnessed in classical piston models, which diminishes or extinguishes the ejected nickel, can be largely cured by the special trajectories. These and the choice of the explosion energies, however, make the modelling dependent on pre-existing neutrino-driven explosion results.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Burst Jets in Circumstellar Material: Dynamics, Breakout, and Diversity of Transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations indicate that stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae are often surrounded by dense circumstellar material (CSM). Motivated by this, we develop an analytic model to systematically study the dynamics of long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) jet propagation in various CSM environments. We derive a general expression for the jet head velocity ($\beta_{\rm h}$) and breakout time ($t_{\rm b}$) valid across Newtonian, relativistic, and intermediate regimes, accounting for a previously unrecognized dependence on $1 - \beta_{\rm h}$. Our results highlight a fundamental distinction between jet propagation in massive stars, where $\beta_{\rm h}\ll 1$, and in extended CSM, where $1-\beta_{\rm h}\ll 1$. We establish an analytic success/failure criterion for jets and express it in terms of jet and CSM parameters, revealing a strong dependence on CSM radius. To quantify the relativistic nature of the jet-cocoon system, we introduce the energy-weighted proper velocity $\overline{\Gamma\beta}$. We identify three possible jet outcomes-(a) successful jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 10-100$), (b) barely failed jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 1$), and (c) completely failed jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 0.1$)-and constrain their respective jet/CSM parameter spaces. We show that in (b) and (c), large CSM radii can result in luminous fast blue optical transients via cocoon cooling emission. This theoretical framework provides a basis for future observational and theoretical studies to understand the link between LGRBs, intermediate GRBs, low-luminosity LGRBs, and their environments.</description>

      <title>EP240414a: A Gamma-Ray Burst Jet Weakened by an Extended Circumstellar Material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent Einstein Probe (EP) event EP240414a exhibits several unusual observational features. Its prompt and afterglow emissions place it between long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and low-luminosity GRBs (LLGRBs). The event is followed by a fast optical transient (AT 2024gsa), initially exhibiting a thermal-like spectrum but later evolving into an unusually red peak at $\sim 3-5$ days, which is difficult to explain with thermal emission. Using our generalized analytic framework for jet propagation in a circumstellar material (CSM; Hamidani et al. 2025), we explore a scenario in which a conventional LGRB jet is launched in a progenitor surrounded by a dense CSM. For a CSM of $\sim 0.03 M_\odot$ extending to $\sim 3\times 10^{13}$ cm, we find that the jet is significantly weakened before breaking out, becoming "barely failed", an intermediate state between successful (LGRB) and completely failed (LLGRB) jets. This scenario naturally explains EP240414a's multi-wavelength observations, with the early thermal component produced by cocoon cooling emission, and the red peak explained by non-thermal afterglow emission from the mildly relativistic barely failed jet (and its inner-cocoon). Our work demonstrates the important role of extended CSM in shaping GRB jets and illustrates how early multi-wavelength follow-up observations can reveal the physically diverse nature of jet-driven transients.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, we find that the energy input from dark matter raises planetary temperatures and accelerates rotation. The distribution of energy between heating and rotational acceleration depends on both planetary properties and external inputs, suggesting that previous studies may have overestimated the heating contribution. At high dark matter densities, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and becomes primarily governed by dark matter effects.</description>

Abstract: We study a new channel for binary system formation involving stars and stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) embedded in dark matter (DM) minihalos. In this scenario, binaries form when a star passes through the DM minihalo surrounding a PBH and loses sufficient energy due to dynamical friction. The continued energy loss induced by this friction is expected to drive the resulting systems to merge rapidly. We estimate their merger rate and explore the implications for two observables: rapidly decaying X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and gravitational waves sourced by compact object mergers. We find that this mechanism naturally produces a population of O(1) currently observable short-lived X-ray binaries. It also leads to a non-negligible gravitational wave event rate of O(0.3) Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, potentially involving high mass ratios and black holes in the lower or upper mass gap. This dynamical friction channel thus offers a plausible explanation for several unusual observations reported in recent years across both the X-ray and gravitational wave domains.</description>

      <title>Two Periodic Activity Epochs in FRB 20201124A: Coincident with Critical RM Evolution Epochs and Its Implications</title>

Abstract: Recent observations of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20201124A by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) revealed a second-scale periodic modulation ($\sim$1.7\,s) in burst activity during two distinct observational windows. We find that these two periodic activity epochs temporally coincide with the transitional states of the source's Faraday rotation measure (RM), and the chance coincidence is only about 0.07$\%$. This correlation is can be understood within the magnetar/Be-star binary system framework. Considering that only the polar cap region can remain stable for such an extended period, we apply a coherent linear periodic evolution model to jointly constrain the initial burst period \( P_0 \) and the period derivative \( \dot{P} \) across both observation windows (MJD 59310 and MJD 59347). We obtain spin parameters consistent with blind search results: an initial spin period $P_0 = 1.7060155$\,s at the reference time and spin period derivative $\dot{P} = 6.1393 \times 10^{-10}$\,s\,s$^{-1}$. We conclude that during these two observational windows, the magnetar was just crossing the disk of the Be star. The disk-magnetar interaction at these two geometric positions may surpress the multi-polar magnetic fields at low latitudes of the magnetar, which enhances the dominance of the polar cap region emissions and makes the periodic activity detectable.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter with the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an investigation into dark photon dark matter (DPDM) within the infrared frequency band, utilizing highly sensitive infrared light detectors commonly integrated into space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The presence of DPDM induces electron oscillations in both the reflectors and the interior of the detectors. Consequently, these oscillating electrons can emit monochromatic electromagnetic waves with a frequency almost equivalent to the mass of DPDM. By estimating the signal generated by DPDM inside the detector and comparing with observation data, we establish constraints on the kinetic mixing between the photon and dark photon within the range [10, 500] THz. Despite JWST not being optimized for DPDM searches, our findings reveal constraints comparable to those obtained from the XENON1T experiment in the laboratory, as well as astrophysical constraints from solar emission. Additionally, we propose to modify the configuration of JWST optical elements to focus the DPDM induced signal onto the detector. By employing the stationary phase approximation, we can demonstrate that when the size of the reflector significantly exceeds the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, the contribution to the electromagnetic wave field at a given position primarily stems from the surface unit perpendicular to the relative position vector. This simplification results in the reduction of electromagnetic wave calculations to ray optics. We show that by rearranging the position of reflectors, JWST can achieve a sensitivity stronger than the existing limits by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories of dissipative fluids with one-form symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system with a one-form global symmetry at finite temperature can be viewed as a dissipative fluid of string-like objects. In this work, we classify and construct the most general effective field theories for hydrodynamics of such string fluids, in a probe limit where the one-form charge density is decoupled from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that at leading order in the derivative expansion, there are two distinct types of diffusive transport in a string fluid depending on the discrete spacetime symmetries present in it. One particular application of interest is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effective field theories describe the diffusion of magnetic field lines. Due to the distinction between the effective field theories for different discrete symmetries, we show that the MHD of a fluid with charge conjugation symmetry is qualitatively different from that of a neutron star, which we previously discussed in arXiv:2207.01636. The explicit effective actions that we write down can be used to obtain the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ up to cubic order in momenta for each of the different discrete symmetry choices. As another application of this formalism, we show that when the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken, the effective action reduces to the Maxwell theory. This confirms the interpretation of the photon as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a one-form symmetry.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays in light of the Lorentz Invariance Violation Effects within the Proton Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04361</link>

Abstract: Tiny Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) effects, potentially arising from quantum gravity-induced spacetime structures, may also manifest in the proton sector, offering a plausible pathway to test Planck-scale physics through high-energy cosmic phenomena. Our analysis reveals that even minuscule LIV effects in the proton sector can significantly elevate the photon threshold energy for photopion production to $\cal {O}$(0.1 to $10^3$ eV), orders of magnitude higher than in Lorentz-symmetric scenarios. Consequently, protons in ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) can propagate for very long distances without significant energy loss via photopion interactions with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. This suppression of attenuation may provide a plausible explanation for the observed cosmic-ray events exceeding the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff energy. We further demonstrate that when both leading-order and next-to-leading-order LIV effects are considered, higher-order LIV contributions induce discontinuous transitions in the GZK cutoff energy spectrum. Observations of proton-dominated UHECRs beyond the GZK threshold could provide constraints the LIV energy scale. Offering insights into the ultraviolet regime of LIV theories near the Planck scale, UHECRs may serve as a sensitive probe of LIV and provide a means to test quantum gravity predictions by constraining deviations from Lorentz symmetry in extreme-energy regimes.</description>

      <title>Channels of Stellar-mass Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the basis of a large collection of detailed 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times, we identify four channels of stellar mass black hole formation. Our examples for Channel 1 involve the formation of lower-gap and above black holes in energetic asymmetric supernova explosions. Our Channel 2 example involves a modest supernova explosion that may leave behind a lower-gap to $\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$ black hole. The latter may not be easily distinguishable from ``standard" supernovae that birth neutron stars. Our Channel 3 example experiences an aborted core-collapse explosion, more often in the context of a low-metallicity progenitor, whose residue is a black hole with a mass perhaps up to $\sim$40 $M_{\odot}$. The latter may be accompanied by a pulsational-pair instability supernova (PPISN). Channel 4 is the only quiescent or ``silent" scenario for which perhaps $\sim$5 to 15 $M_{\odot}$ black holes are left. Where appropriate, we estimate $^{56}$Ni yields, explosion energies, approximate recoil speeds, and residual black hole masses. The progenitor mass density and binding energy profiles at collapse influence the outcome in a systematic way. We speculate that the statistics and prevalence of these various channels depend not only on still evolving supernova theory, but on remaining issues with the theory of massive star evolution, binary interaction, wind mass loss, metallicity, and the nuclear equation of state. Importantly, we suggest, but have not proven, that the silent channel for black hole formation may not be the dominant formation modality.</description>
