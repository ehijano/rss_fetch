      <title>Dynamic film thickness measurement in a rolling bearing using numerical elastohydrodynamic-acoustic modelling to interpret reflected ultrasound data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thickness of the lubricating film plays a vital role in the operational efficiency and reliability of rolling bearings. Ultrasonic reflection techniques offer a promising non-invasive approach for in situ evaluation of lubricant films.However, accurately identifying the central film thickness remains challenging due to several complex factors, including dynamic fluctuations, localized elastic deformation, cavitation effects, and variations in oil supply. This study presents a comprehensive theoretical and numerical framework to elucidate the influence of these factors on ultrasonic wave propagation in lubricated contacts. Numerical simulations considering elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) regime and cavitation-induced effects are carried out to obtain the surface deformation profiles and the cavitation regions. Subsequently, high-fidelity acoustic simulations are conducted to interpret reflected ultrasound data.As main results, the EHL leads to a "double-peak with central valley" pattern in the reflection coefficient distribution. While the cavitation causes the central valley to shift toward the inlet region and increases the reflection coefficient.Accordingly, the central film thickness is extracted from the distribution of the reflection coefficient under different operating conditions. Experimental validation using both glass-oil-steel and steel-oil-steel bearing setups confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method. The high-resolution fluorescence measurement adopted in the glass-oil-steel configuration validates the simulation of the reflection coefficient distribution. Furthermore, the theoretical EHL calculations are employed with the steel-oil-steel configuration for validation of the measurement accuracy of central oil film thickness.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Temperature Vacuum Prober for Electrical and Thermal Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an ultra-high-temperature vacuum probe station (UHT-VPS) featuring a sample holder heated by thermal radiation from a silicon carbide heater. This contactless configuration electrically isolates the sample from the high-power heating source through a vacuum gap, ensuring reliable measurements under extreme conditions. The capability of this UHT-VPS to measure electrical signals from 30 nV upward on bulk sapphire is demonstrated using the 3w/2w method. Measurements are continuously operated from 300 to 1150 K, under high vacuum, for a total of about 66 hours without readjusting the contact. They yield the linear and quadratic temperature coefficients of resistance of chromium/platinum micro-resistances, as well as the sapphire's thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. By recording the heater and sensor temperature signals up to 30 kHz and fitting them with theoretical models that account for the quadratic TCR of Cr/Pt microwires, we obtain values in agreement with literature data obtained by optical methods. In this temperature range, we also measure thermal conductivity, which cannot be directly accessed by optical techniques. Our system thus provides an effective solution for simultaneously retrieving the electrical and thermal properties of materials using a single set of 3w/2w data up to unprecedented temperature levels.</description>

      <title>Grazing incidence X-ray scattering alignment using the area detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grazing incidence X-ray scattering experiments are designed to achieve strong scattering signals from materials, such as molecular monolayers, island films, or thin films that are localized to the surfaces of flat substrates. Optimal signals can be achieved with precise alignment of a substrate surface with the X-ray beam. Here, we outline a simple method that utilizes the area detector, generally available on such systems, to observe reflections from the sample to determine the sample-detector distance and the motor positions corresponding to the film being parallel to and centered in the beam. Observations of the reflected and transmitted beams are used to determine the critical angle of the sample and inform ideal motor angles that will lead to scattered X-ray intensity enhancement.</description>

      <title>Design of high-strength, radiopure copper-chromium alloys for rare-event searches assisted by computational thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Dark Matter detection and studies on the nature of neutrinos demand detector systems with extremely low background levels, including from radioactivity. Additive-free, electroformed copper, in addition to a set of advantages, exhibits exceptional radiopurity, making it the material of choice for rare-event searches. To satisfy the increasing demand for materials with superior mechanical strength, the development of copper-chromium alloys is pursued. Early investigations explored the synthesis of these alloys by electrodeposition and thermal processing. A materials-design approach is proposed to optimize the fabrication and thermal processing stages of manufacturing. It is assisted by materials modeling tools based on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of alloy compositions, which enables faster development of novel materials by predicting properties and materials performance. This approach is demonstrated by comparing simulations with previously reported experimental investigations and proposing improved thermal processing.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of nEXO to $^{136}$Xe Charged-Current Interactions: Background-free Searches for Solar Neutrinos and Fermionic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of nEXO to solar neutrino charged-current interactions, $\nu_e + ^{136}$Xe$\rightarrow ^{136}$Cs$^* + e^-$, as well as analogous interactions predicted by models of fermionic dark matter. Due to the recently observed low-lying isomeric states of $^{136}$Cs, these interactions will create a time-delayed coincident signal observable in the scintillation channel. Here we develop a detailed Monte Carlo of scintillation emission, propagation, and detection in the nEXO detector to model these signals under different assumptions about the timing resolution of the photosensor readout. We show this correlated signal can be used to achieve background discrimination on the order of $10^{-9}$, enabling nEXO to make background-free measurements of solar neutrinos above the reaction threshold of 0.668 MeV. We project that nEXO could measure the flux of CNO solar neutrinos with a statistical uncertainty of 25%, thus contributing a novel and competitive measurement towards addressing the solar metallicity problem. Additionally, nEXO could measure the mean energy of the $^7$Be neutrinos with a precision of $\sigma \leq 1.5$ keV and could determine the survival probability of $^{7}$Be and $pep$ solar $\nu_e$ with precision comparable to state-of-the-art. These quantities are sensitive to the Sun's core temperature and to non-standard neutrino interactions, respectively. Furthermore, the strong background suppression would allow nEXO to search for for charged-current interactions of fermionic dark matter in the mass range $m_\chi$ = $0.668$-$7$ MeV with a sensitivity up to three orders of magnitude better than current limits.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Continuous Variable Terahertz Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) protocol that employs orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the terahertz (THz) band to enable high-throughput and secure quantum communication. By encoding quantum information across multiple subcarriers, the protocol enhances spectral efficiency and mitigates channel dispersion and atmospheric attenuation. We present a comprehensive security analysis under collective Gaussian attacks, considering both terrestrial free-space channels, accounting for humidity-induced absorption, and inter-satellite links, incorporating realistic intermodulation noise. Simulations show secret key rates (SKR) reaching ~72 bits per channel use in open-air conditions. While intermodulation noise imposes trade-offs, optimised modulation variance enables resilience and secure communication range. The maximum terrestrial quantum link extends up to 4.5 m due to atmospheric THz absorption, whereas inter-satellite links can support secure communication over distances exceeding 100 km, owing to minimal propagation channel losses in space. We evaluate the practical implementation of our protocol using recently developed on-chip coherent THz sources based on superconducting Josephson junctions. These compact, voltage-tunable emitters produce wideband coherent radiation, making them ideal candidates for integration in scalable quantum networks. By incorporating their characteristics into our simulations, we assess secure key generation under various environmental conditions. Our results show secure communication over distances up to 3 m in open air, and up to 26 km in cryogenic or vacuum environments. This work advances the prospect of compact, high-capacity CVQKD systems for both terrestrial and space-based THz quantum communication.</description>

      <title>First observation of quantum oscillations by transport measurements in semi-destructive pulsed magnetic fields up to 125 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High magnetic fields have proven instrumental in exploring the physical properties of condensed matter, leading to groundbreaking discoveries such as the quantum Hall effect in 2D heterostructures and quantum oscillations in cuprate superconductors. The ability to conduct precise measurements at progressively higher magnetic fields continues to push the frontiers of knowledge and enable new discoveries. In this work, we present the development of a microwave technique for performing two-point transport measurements in semi-destructive pulsed magnetic fields (up to 125 T) and at low temperatures (down to 1.5 K) with unprecedented sensitivity. This new setup was tested on a variety of samples. We present results on the metal-insulator transition in InAs and we report notably the first observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations in WTe$_{2}$ at magnetic fields beyond 100 T.</description>

      <title>High-precision polarization measurements with Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to demonstrate that two arrays of Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs), when employed in filled array configuration and separated by an external linear polarizer oriented at 45 degrees, can achieve the precision required by next-generation cosmological experiments. The focus here is on validating their ability to meet stringent uncertainty requirements, in particular for polarization angle reconstruction. To achieve this, the uncertainties in the reconstruction of the polarization angle have been characterized in the laboratory using a dedicated closed-circuit 100 mK dilution cryostat. This is optically coupled to a Martin-Puplett interferometer and a custom-designed sky simulator equipped with both photometric and polarized sources, allowing one to reproduce realistic ground-based observation conditions. This experimental setup allows us to generate intensity and polarization maps with diffraction-limited resolution, allowing us to determine the polarization angles and their associated uncertainties. The results show performance in line with expectations for the next generation CMB experiments. The polarization angle was reconstructed with an uncertainty of 6.5 arcmin.</description>

Abstract: A new 2,400 L liquid scintillator has been produced for the COSINE-100 Upgrade, which is under construction at Yemilab for the next COSINE dark matter experiment phase. The linear-alkyl-benzene-based scintillator is designed to serve as a veto for NaI(Tl) crystal targets and a separate platform for rare event searches. We measured using a sample consisting of a custom-made 445 mL cylindrical Teflon container equipped with two 3-inch photomultiplier tubes. Analyses show activity levels of $0.091 \pm 0.042$ mBq/kg for $^{238}$U and $0.012 \pm 0.007$ mBq/kg for $^{232}$Th.</description>

      <title>Initial Results From the First Field Expedition of UAPx to Study Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00558v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In July 2021, faculty from the UAlbany Department of Physics participated in a week-long field expedition with the organization UAPx to collect data on UAPs in Avalon, California, located on Catalina Island, and nearby. This paper reviews both the hardware and software techniques which this collaboration employed, and contains a frank discussion of the successes and failures, with a section about how to apply lessons learned to future expeditions. Both observable-light and infrared cameras were deployed, as well as sensors for other (non-EM) emissions. A pixel-subtraction method was augmented with other similarly simple methods to provide initial identification of objects in the sky and/or the sea crossing the cameras' fields of view. The first results will be presented based upon approximately one hour in total of triggered visible/night-vision-mode video and over 600 hours of un-triggered (far) IR video recorded, as well as 55 hours of (background) radiation measurements. Following multiple explanatory resolutions of several ambiguities that were potentially anomalous at first, we focus on the primary remaining ambiguity captured at approximately 4am Pacific Time on Friday, July 16: a dark spot in the visible/near-IR camera possibly coincident with ionizing radiation that has so far resisted prosaic explanation. We conclude with quantitative suggestions (3-5 sigma rules) for serious researchers in the still-maligned field of hard-science-based UAP studies, with an ultimate goal of identifying UAPs without confirmation bias toward mundane / speculative conclusions.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>
