      <title>Suspected Undeclared Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Academic Literature: An Analysis of the Academ-AI Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT became widely available, researchers have used them in the writing process. The consensus of the academic publishing community is that such usage must be declared in the published article. Academ-AI documents examples of suspected undeclared AI usage in the academic literature, discernible primarily due to the appearance in research papers of idiosyncratic verbiage characteristic of large language model (LLM)-based chatbots. This analysis of the first 500 examples collected reveals that the problem is widespread, penetrating the journals and conference proceedings of highly respected publishers. Undeclared AI seems to appear in journals with higher citation metrics and higher article processing charges (APCs), precisely those outlets that should theoretically have the resources and expertise to avoid such oversights. An extremely small minority of cases are corrected post publication, and the corrections are often insufficient to rectify the problem. The 500 examples analyzed here likely represent a small fraction of the undeclared AI present in the academic literature, much of which may be undetectable. Publishers must enforce their policies against undeclared AI usage in cases that are detectable; this is the best defense currently available to the academic publishing community against the proliferation of undisclosed AI.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Data Reuse in Interactive Information Retrieval: Motivations, Sources, and Evaluation of Reusability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharing and reusing research data can effectively reduce redundant efforts in data collection and curation, especially for small labs and research teams conducting human-centered system research, and enhance the replicability of evaluation experiments. Building a sustainable data reuse process and culture relies on frameworks that encompass policies, standards, roles, and responsibilities, all of which must address the diverse needs of data providers, curators, and reusers.
  To advance the knowledge and accumulate empirical understandings on data reuse, this study investigated the data reuse practices of experienced researchers from the area of Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) studies, where data reuse has been strongly advocated but still remains a challenge. To enhance the knowledge on data reuse behavior and reusability assessment strategies within IIR community, we conducted 21 semi-structured in-depth interviews with IIR researchers from varying demographic backgrounds, institutions, and stages of careers on their motivations, experiences, and concerns over data reuse. We uncovered the reasons, strategies of reusability assessments, and challenges faced by data reusers within the field of IIR as they attempt to reuse researcher data in their studies. The empirical finding improves our understanding of researchers' motivations for reusing data, their approaches to discovering reusable research data, as well as their concerns and criteria for assessing data reusability, and also enriches the on-going discussions on evaluating user-generated data and research resources and promoting community-level data reuse culture and standards.</description>

      <title>Homeopathic Modernization and the Middle Science Trap: conceptual context of ergonomics, econometrics and logic of some national scientific case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article analyses the structural and institutional barriers hindering the development of scientific systems in transition economies, such as Kazakhstan. The main focus is on the concept of the "middle science trap," which is characterized by steady growth in quantitative indicators (publications, grants) but a lack of qualitative advancement. Excessive bureaucracy, weak integration into the international scientific community, and ineffective science management are key factors limiting development. This paper proposes an approach of "homeopathic modernization," which focuses on minimal yet strategically significant changes aimed at reducing bureaucratic barriers and enhancing the effectiveness of the scientific ecosystem. A comparative analysis of international experience (China, India, and the European Union) is provided, demonstrating how targeted reforms in the scientific sector can lead to significant results. Social and cultural aspects, including the influence of mentality and institutional structure, are also examined, and practical recommendations for reforming the scientific system in Kazakhstan and Central Asia are offered. The conclusions of the article could be useful for developing national science modernization programs, particularly in countries with high levels of bureaucracy and conservatism.</description>

      <title>Curious Rhythms: Temporal Regularities of Wikipedia Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09497v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wikipedia, in its role as the world's largest encyclopedia, serves a broad range of information needs. Although previous studies have noted that Wikipedia users' information needs vary throughout the day, there is to date no large-scale, quantitative study of the underlying dynamics. The present paper fills this gap by investigating temporal regularities in daily consumption patterns in a large-scale analysis of billions of timezone-corrected page requests mined from English Wikipedia's server logs, with the goal of investigating how context and time relate to the kind of information consumed. First, we show that even after removing the global pattern of day-night alternation, the consumption habits of individual articles maintain strong diurnal regularities. Then, we characterize the prototypical shapes of consumption patterns, finding a particularly strong distinction between articles preferred during the evening/night and articles preferred during working hours. Finally, we investigate topical and contextual correlates of Wikipedia articles' access rhythms, finding that article topic, reader country, and access device (mobile vs. desktop) are all important predictors of daily attention patterns. These findings shed new light on how humans seek information on the Web by focusing on Wikipedia as one of the largest open platforms for knowledge and learning, emphasizing Wikipedia's role as a rich knowledge base that fulfills information needs spread throughout the day, with implications for understanding information seeking across the globe and for designing appropriate information systems.</description>

      <title>AutoLLM-CARD: Towards a Description and Landscape of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, a vast variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to emerge for diverse NLP tasks. As more papers are published, researchers and developers face the challenge of information overload. Thus, developing a system that can automatically extract and organise key information about LLMs from academic papers is particularly important. The standard format for documenting information about LLMs is the LLM model card (\textbf{LLM-Card}). We propose a method for automatically generating LLM model cards from scientific publications. We use Named Entity Recognition (\textbf{NER}) and Relation Extraction (\textbf{RE}) methods that automatically extract key information about LLMs from the papers, helping researchers to access information about LLMs efficiently. These features include model \textit{licence}, model \textit{name}, and model \textit{application}. With these features, we can form a model card for each paper. We processed 106 academic papers by defining three dictionaries -- LLM's name, licence, and application. 11,051 sentences were extracted through dictionary lookup, and the dataset was constructed through manual review of the final selection of 129 sentences with a link between the name and the \textit{licence}, and 106 sentences with a link between the model name and the \textit{application}. The resulting resource is relevant for LLM card illustrations using relational knowledge graphs. Our code and findings can contribute to automatic LLM card generation. Data and code in \textsc{autoLLM-Card} will be shared and freely available at \url{https://github.com/shengwei-tian/dependency-parser-visualization}</description>
