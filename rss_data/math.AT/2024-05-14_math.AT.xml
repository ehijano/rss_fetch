      <title>On the image of the total power operation for Burnside rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the image of the total power operation for Burnside rings $A(G) \to A(G\wr\Sigma_n)$ lies inside a relatively small, combinatorial subring $\mathring A(G,n) \subseteq A(G \wr \Sigma_n)$. As $n$ varies, the subrings $\mathring A(G,n)$ assemble into a commutative graded ring $\mathring A(G)$ with a universal property: $\mathring A(G)$ carries the universal family of power operations out of $A(G)$. We construct character maps for $\mathring A(G,n)$ and give a formula for the character of the total power operation. Using $\mathring A(G)$, we extend the Frobenius--Wielandt homomorphism of Dress--Siebeneicher--Yoshida to wreath products compatibly with the total power operation. Finally, we prove a generalization of Burnside's orbit counting lemma that describes the transfer map $A(G \wr \Sigma_n) \to A(\Sigma_n)$ on the subring $\mathring A(G,n)$.</description>

      <title>A Representability Theorem for Stacks in Derived Geometry Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The representability theorem for stacks, due to Artin in the underived setting and Lurie in the derived setting, gives conditions under which a stack is representable by an $n$-geometric stack. In recent work of Ben-Bassat, Kelly, and Kremnizer, a new theory of derived analytic geometry has been proposed as geometry relative to the $(\infty,1)$-category of simplicial commutative Ind-Banach $R$-modules, for $R$ a Banach ring. In this paper, we prove a representability theorem which holds in a very general context, which we call a representability context, encompassing both the derived algebraic geometry context of To\"en and Vezzosi and these new derived analytic geometry contexts. The representability theorem gives natural and easily verifiable conditions for checking that derived stacks in these contexts are $n$-geometric, such as having an $n$-geometric truncation, being nilcomplete, and having an obstruction theory. Future work will explore representability of certain moduli stacks arising in derived analytic geometry, for example moduli stacks of Galois representations.</description>

      <title>On the universal and generalized orbifold Euler characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the universal orbifold Euler characteristic and generalized orbifold Euler characteristics corresponding to finitely generated groups $A$ (the $A$-Euler characteristics). We show that the collection of all $A$-Euler characteristics for $A$ of the form $A'\times Z$ ($Z$ is the group of integers) with finite $A'$ determine the universal orbifold Euler characteristic.</description>

      <title>The Connectedness Homomorphism between Discrete Morse Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two discrete Morse functions on a simplicial complex, we introduce the {\em connectedness homomorphism} between the corresponding discrete Morse complexes. This concept leads to a novel framework for studying the connectedness in discrete Morse theory at the chain complex level. In particular, we apply it to describe a discrete analogy to `cusp-degeneration' of Morse complexes. A precise comparison between smooth case and our discrete cases is also given.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and $(\infty,2)$-Naturality of Yoneda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Yoneda embedding extends to an $(\infty,2)$-natural transformation. Furthermore, as such, it is uniquely determined by its value at the trivial $\infty$-category. We also study the naturality of the Yoneda lemma in its arguments, showing that it is an isomorphism of $(\infty,2)$-natural transformations.</description>

      <title>Giving a $KO$ to 8D Gauge Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Garcia-Etxebarria:2017crf}, it was found that the system of $k$ D7-branes probing an $O7^+$-plane suffers from an $\mathfrak{sp}(k)$ gauge anomaly when $k&gt;1$. These authors then conjectured that this 8D $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory couples to an 8D topological field theory (TFT) such that the total system is anomaly-free, thus acting as a "topological" Green-Schwarz mechanism. In this note, we construct such an 8D TFT and show that it indeed cancels the gauge anomaly. The key step is to engineer the relevant topological operators from D3-branes and fluxbranes placed infinitely far away from the stack of 7-branes. Such symmetry operators have topological vector bundles defined on them whose $KO/KSp$-homology classes play a role in the anomaly cancellation.</description>

      <title>Configuration spaces as commutative monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After 1-point compactification, the collection of all unordered configuration spaces of a manifold admits a commutative multiplication by superposition of configurations. We explain a simple (derived) presentation for this commutative monoid object. Using this presentation, one can quickly deduce Knudsen's formula for the rational cohomology of configuration spaces, prove rational homological stability, and understand how automorphisms of the manifold act on the cohomology of configuration spaces. Similar considerations reproduce the work of Farb--Wolfson--Wood on homological densities.</description>

      <title>Strong minimal model theorem and Massey products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kadeishvili's minimal model theorem establishes the existence of an $A_\infty$-structure, unique up to isomorphism, on the cohomology of a dg associative algebra, which captures its homotopy type. In this note we prove the existence of minimal models that are unique up to isotopy, a stronger result obviously known to T. Kadeishvili and certainly to others, yet seemingly overlooked by mankind. We will explore how this stronger result can help in the study of Massey products. First, we show that the attempts to extract a local information from the ternary operation $\mu_3$ of our minimal model leads directly to the rediscovery of the triple Massey product. The motto is: "The triple Massey product is an invariant manifestation of $\mu_3$." We then prove that, under reasonable assumptions, the higher Massey product $\langle x_1,\ldots,x_n\rangle$ equals the set of all values $\mu_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, where $\mu_n$ runs over the $n$-ary products of our minimal models. We believe that this note will help to elucidate the still somewhat enigmatic relationship between minimal models and Massey products.</description>

      <title>Persistence Diagram Estimation of Multivariate Piecewise H\"older-continuous Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To our knowledge, the analysis of convergence rates for persistence diagram estimation from noisy signals had predominantly relied on lifting signal estimation results through sup norm (or other functional norm) stability theorems. We believe that moving forward from this approach can lead to considerable gains. We illustrate it in the setting of Gaussian white noise model. We examine from a minimax perspective, the inference of persistence diagram (for sublevel sets filtration). We show that for piecewise H\"older-continuous functions, with control over the reach of the discontinuities set, taking the persistence diagram coming from a simple histogram estimator of the signal, permit to achieve the minimax rates known for H\"older-continuous functions.</description>
