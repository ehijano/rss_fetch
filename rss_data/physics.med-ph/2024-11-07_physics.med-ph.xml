      <title>Advancements in Nanoparticle-based Near-Infrared Fluorescence Probes for Cancer Specific Imaging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) dyes, especially those within the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, offer substantial advantages for in vivo imaging, owing to their deep tissue penetration and minimal background autofluorescence. Nanoparticles incorporating these IR dyes, such as indocyanine green (ICG) have undergone extensive investigation regarding their pharmacokinetic behavior, including biodistribution patterns and clearance mechanisms. These nanoparticles often preferentially accumulate in tumor tissues, primarily through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, thereby establishing them as potent instruments for sophisticated tumor imaging and precision-targeted drug delivery systems. The development of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) for large-scale tissue imaging is attributed to its ability to generate highly specific, targeted visualization of organs. The distinctive properties of the near-infrared spectrum, including its selective absorption by biomolecules that bind to specific sites within tissues, minimal autofluorescence, and reduced light scattering, make it an appealing option for cancer imaging. Unlike the conventional structural imaging system, molecular imaging leverages these properties to differentiate between malignant and normal tissues at the molecular level, offering a more refined and precise diagnostic capability. This review offers a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in Nanoparticle-based NIRF probes and multifunctional agents for cancer molecular imaging. These advances will extend the current concepts of cancer theranostics by NIRF imaging.</description>

      <title>A Printed Microscopic Universal Gradient Interface for Super Stretchable Strain-Insensitive Bioelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stretchable electronics capable of conforming to nonplanar and dynamic human body surfaces are central for creating implantable and on-skin devices for high-fidelity monitoring of diverse physiological signals. While various strategies have been developed to produce stretchable devices, the signals collected from such devices are often highly sensitive to local strain, resulting in inevitable convolution with surface strain-induced motion artifacts that are difficult to distinguish from intrinsic physiological signals. Here we report all-printed super stretchable strain-insensitive bioelectronics using a unique universal gradient interface (UGI) to bridge the gap between soft biomaterials and stiff electronic materials. Leveraging a versatile aerosol-based multi-materials printing technique that allows precise spatial control over the local stiffnesses with submicron resolution, the UGI enables strain-insensitive electronic devices with negligible resistivity changes under a 180% stretch ratio. We demonstrate various stretchable devices directly printed on the UGI for on-skin health monitoring with high signal quality and near perfect immunity to motion artifacts, including semiconductor-based photodetectors for sensing blood oxygen saturation levels and metal-based temperature sensors. The concept in this work will significantly simplify the fabrication and accelerate the development of a broad range of wearable and implantable bioelectronics for real-time health monitoring and personalized therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Relaxometry and contrast-free cerebral microvascular quantification using balanced Steady-State Free Precession MR Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel, contrast-free Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) method using balanced Steady-State Free Precession (bSSFP) sequences for the quantification of cerebral blood volume (CBV), vessel radius (R), and relaxometry parameters (T1, T2 T2*) in the brain. The technique leverages the sensitivity of bSSFP sequences to intra-voxel frequency distributions in both transient and steady-state regimes. A dictionary-matching process is employed, using simulations of realistic mouse microvascular networks to generate the MRF dictionary. The method is validated through in silico studies and in vivo experiments on six healthy subjects, comparing results with standard MRF methods and literature values. The proposed method shows strong correlation and agreement with standard MRF methods for T1 and T2 values. High-resolution maps provide detailed visualizations of CBV and microvascular structures, highlighting differences in white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) regions. The measured GM/WM ratio for CBV is 1.91, consistent with literature values. This contrast-free bSSFP-based MRF method offers an innovative approach for quantifying CBV, vessel radius, and relaxometry parameters. Further validation against DSC imaging and clinical studies in pathological conditions is warranted to confirm its clinical utility.</description>

      <title>Effect of Singular Value Decomposition Algorithms on Removing Injection Variability in 2D Quantitative Angiography of Intracranial Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intraoperative 2D quantitative angiography (QA) for intracranial aneurysms (IAs) has accuracy challenges due to the variability of hand injections. Despite the success of singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithms in reducing biases in computed tomography perfusion (CTP), their application in 2D QA has not been extensively explored. This study seeks to bridge this gap by investigating the potential of SVD-based deconvolution methods in 2D QA, particularly in addressing the variability of injection durations. The study included three internal carotid aneurysm (ICA) cases. Virtual angiograms were generated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for three physiologically relevant inlet velocities to simulate contrast media injection durations. Time-density curves (TDCs) were produced for both the inlet and aneurysm dome. Various SVD variants, including standard SVD (sSVD) with and without classical Tikhonov regularization, block-circulant SVD (bSVD), and oscillation index SVD (oSVD), were applied to virtual angiograms. The method was applied on virtual angiograms to recover the aneurysmal dome impulse response function (IRF) and extract flow related parameters such as Peak Height PHIRF, Area Under the Curve AUCIRF, and Mean transit time MTT. Furthermore, we found that SVD can effectively reduce QA parameter variability across various injection durations, enhancing the potential of QA analysis parameters in neurovascular disease diagnosis and treatment. Implementing SVD-based deconvolution techniques in QA analysis can enhance the precision and reliability of neurovascular diagnostics by effectively reducing the impact of injection duration on hemodynamic parameters.</description>

      <title>Fatigue performance of prosthetic screws used in dental implant restorations: Rolled versus cut threads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statement of problem. Cold rolling is widely used for screw thread manufacturing in industry but is less common in implant dentistry, where cutting is the preferred manufacturing method. Purpose. The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the surface finish and mechanical performance of a specific model of prosthetic screw used for direct restorations manufactured by thread rolling and cutting. Material and methods. The thread profiles were measured in an optical measuring machine, the residual stresses in an X-ray diffractometer, the surface finish in a scanning electron microscope, and then fatigue and static load tests were carried out in a direct stress test bench according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14801. Finally, linear regression models and 95% interval confidence bands were calculated and compared through ANCOVA for fatigue tests while the t test was used for statistical comparisons (a=.05). Results. The surface finish was smoother, and compressive residual stresses were higher for the roll-threaded screws. Linear regression models showed a fatigue life 9 times higher for roll-threaded screws (P=1) without affecting static behavior, which showed statistically similar static strengths (P=.54). However, the thread profile in the roll-threaded screws was not accurately reproduced, but this should be easily corrected in future prototypes. Conclusions. Rolling was demonstrated to be a better thread-manufacturing process for prosthetic screws, producing improved surface quality and fatigue behavior.</description>

      <title>A Learnable Prior Improves Inverse Tumor Growth Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biophysical modeling, particularly involving partial differential equations (PDEs), offers significant potential for tailoring disease treatment protocols to individual patients. However, the inverse problem-solving aspect of these models presents a substantial challenge, either due to the high computational requirements of model-based approaches or the limited robustness of deep learning (DL) methods. We propose a novel framework that leverages the unique strengths of both approaches in a synergistic manner. Our method incorporates a DL ensemble for initial parameter estimation, facilitating efficient downstream evolutionary sampling initialized with this DL-based prior. We showcase the effectiveness of integrating a rapid deep-learning algorithm with a high-precision evolution strategy in estimating brain tumor cell concentrations from magnetic resonance images. The DL-Prior plays a pivotal role, significantly constraining the effective sampling-parameter space. This reduction results in a fivefold convergence acceleration and a Dice-score of 95%.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Inward-Outward Ring Permanent Magnet Array for Portable Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permanent magnet array (PMA) is a popular option to provide the main magnetic field in a dedicated portable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system because it does not need power or a cooling system and has a much stronger field strength compared to a resistive magnet. Aside from the popular Halbach array that has a transversal field direction, the Inward-Outward ring (IO ring) array is a promising candidate that offers a longitudinal field direction with various design and engineering possibilities. In this article, a thorough study of IO ring arrays is conducted by examining the relation between the design parameters and its field patterns, its variants that lead to different applications and their properties. A detailed comparison between an IO ring array and Halbach array was conducted and reported. Moreover, the feasibility of building an IO ring array in a lab is demonstrated. The investigations strongly indicate that IO ring is a promising candidate that can offer high and homogeneous fields or a desired field pattern to portable MRI systems. With a longitudinal field direction, an IO ring array opens up opportunities to adopt MRI advanced technology and techniques in a portable system to improve image quality and shorten scan time.</description>
