      <title>Coupling-Constant Averaged Exchange-Correlation Hole for He, Li, Be, N, Ne Atoms from CCSD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate approximation of the exchange-correlation (XC) energy in density functional theory (DFT) calculations is essential for reliably modelling electronic systems. Many such approximations are developed from models of the XC hole; accurate reference XC holes for real electronic systems are crucial for evaluating the accuracy of these models however the availability of reliable reference data is limited to a few systems. In this study, we employ the Lieb optimization with a coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) reference to construct accurate coupling-constant averaged XC holes, resolved into individual exchange and correlation components, for five spherically symmetric atoms: He, Li, Be, N, and Ne. Alongside providing a new set of reference data for the construction and evaluation of model XC holes, we compare our data against the exchange and correlation hole models of the established LDA and PBE density functional approximations. Our analysis confirms the established rationalization for the limitations of LDA and the improvement observed with PBE in terms of the hole depth and its long-range decay, demonstrated in real-space for the series of spherically-symmetric atoms.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The force field is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>

      <title>Different intermediate water cluster with distinct nucleation dynamics among mono layer ice nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent first-principle calculations unveiled a distinctive dynamic behavior in water molecule rotation during the melting process of highly confined water, indicating a notable time-scale separation in diffusion. In this short paper, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the rotation dynamics during the mono-layer ice nucleation process to investigate the possible intermediate states characterized by the differences in rotation of water molecules. Our study reveals two types of ice clusters with similar ice geometric structure but possess distinctly different rotational behaviors. In terms of molecular rotation, one type cluster is ice like (ILC) and can be regarded as small ice nuclei while the other is supercooled liquid water like (SCC). We found distinct nucleation pathways, thermodynamic properties, and phase transition dynamics to associate with these intermediate clusters, which yielded an unexpectedly complex picture of mono-layer ice nucleation.</description>

      <title>Facile synthesis of micro-flower NiCo2O4 assembled by nanosheets efficient for electrocatalysis of water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective regulation of the morphology of transition metal spinel structures is crucial for creating efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts for electrocatalysis of water. In this work, micro-flower NiCo2O4 (F-NCO) assembled by nanosheets via a chemical template method for the simultaneous promotion of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Electronic microscope analysis revealed that the thickness of the F-NCO catalyst was only 2.7% of that of the NiCo2O4 bulk (B-NCO), and this ultrathin lamellar structure was conducive to further exposure of the active site and improved reaction kinetics. The F-NCO catalyst exhibited superior HER and OER performance (10 = 236 and 310 mV) and robust long-term stability over the B-NCO catalyst in 1.0 M KOH, with a 2.68-fold and 4.16-fold increase in active surface area and a 0.42-fold and 0.61-fold decrease in charge transfer resistance values, respectively. This micro-flower-structured electrode has remarkable electrocatalytic property and long-term durability, providing a novel insight for characterizing cost-effective and high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Heating Induced Suppression of $d$-band Dominance in the Electronic Excitation Spectrum of Cuprum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of isochoric heating of solids by free electron lasers (FEL) and in situ diagnostics by X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) allows for measurements of material properties at warm dense matter (WDM) conditions relevant for astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion, and material science. In the case of metals, the FEL beam pumps energy directly into electrons with the lattice structure of ions being nearly unaffected. This leads to a unique transient state that gives rise to a set of interesting physical effects, which can serve as a reliable testing platform for WDM theories. In this work, we present extensive linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) results for the electronic dynamic structure factor of isochorically heated copper with a face-centered cubic lattice. At ambient conditions, the plasmon is heavily damped due to the presence of $d$-band excitations, and its position is independent of the wavenumber. In contrast, the plasmon feature starts to dominate the excitation spectrum and has a Bohm-Gross type plasmon dispersion for temperatures $T \geq 4~{\rm eV}$, where the quasi-free electrons in the interstitial region are in the WDM regime. In addition, we analyze the thermal changes in the $d$-band excitations and outline the possibility to use future XRTS measurements of isochorically heated copper as a controlled testbed for WDM theories.</description>

      <title>An MBE-CASSCF Approach for the Accurate Treatment of Large Active Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method that makes use of the many-body expanded full configuration interaction (MBE-FCI) method to incrementally approximate electronic structures within large active spaces. On the basis of a hybrid first-order algorithm employing both Super-CI and quasi-Newton strategies for the optimization of molecular orbitals, we demonstrate both computational efficacy and high accuracy of the resulting MBE-CASSCF method. We assess the performance of our implementation on a set of established numerical tests before applying MBE-CASSCF in the investigation of the triplet-quintet spin gap of an iron(II) tetraphenylporphyrin model system with active spaces as large as 50 electrons in 50 orbitals.</description>

      <title>Recent advances on the spherical metal oxides for sustainable degradation of antibiotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the permanent harm to human health and ecosystem balance, antibiotic pollution in water has become an important direction of current environmental governance. Spherical metal oxides (SMOs) have been frequently utilized as effective heterogeneous photocatalysts for the efficient degradation of antibiotics due to the unique properties (e.g., strong light absorption ability, high separation efficiency of photo-generated electron hole pairs, and good catalytic activity). This review will firstly focus on summarizing the rational design and synthesis of SMOs with various tuned microstructures such as hollow, porous shell, yolk shell, core shell, and nanoflowers. These structures can expose more active sites, achieve a higher utilization rate of light, enhance the mass transfer efficiency and improve the effective diffusion of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Secondly, this review will mainly analyze the intrinsic relationship between the structure of SMOs and its photocatalytic property, the ability to generate ROS, and the degradation pathway for antibiotics. Moreover, the photocatalytic mechanisms and recent progress of different SMOs catalysts for degrading typical antibiotics are compared in detail. Finally, challenges and prospects of future direction in the development of SMOs for antibiotic degradation are reviewed. It is expected to provide a rational design of SMOs catalysts for efficient photocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants.</description>

      <title>EL-MLFFs: Ensemble Learning of Machine Leaning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising approach to bridge the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods and the efficiency of classical force fields. However, the abundance of MLFF models and the challenge of accurately predicting atomic forces pose significant obstacles in their practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning framework, EL-MLFFs, which leverages the stacking method to integrate predictions from diverse MLFFs and enhance force prediction accuracy. By constructing a graph representation of molecular structures and employing a graph neural network (GNN) as the meta-model, EL-MLFFs effectively captures atomic interactions and refines force predictions. We evaluate our approach on two distinct datasets: methane molecules and methanol adsorbed on a Cu(100) surface. The results demonstrate that EL-MLFFs significantly improves force prediction accuracy compared to individual MLFFs, with the ensemble of all eight models yielding the best performance. Moreover, our ablation study highlights the crucial roles of the residual network and graph attention layers in the model's architecture. The EL-MLFFs framework offers a promising solution to the challenges of model selection and force prediction accuracy in MLFFs, paving the way for more reliable and efficient molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulation of hydrogen adsorption in hierarchical silicalite: Role of electrostatics and surface chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adsorption in nanoporous materials is one strategy that can be used to store hydrogen at conditions of temperature and pressure that are economically viable. Adsorption capacity of nanoporous materials depends on surface area which can be enhanced by incorporating a hierarchical pore structure. We report grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation results on the adsorption of hydrogen in hierarchical models of silicalite that incorporate 4 nm wide mesopores in addition to the 0.5 nm wide micropores at 298 K, using different force fields to model hydrogen. Our results suggest that incorporating mesopores in silicalite can enhance adsorption by at least 20% if electrostatic interactions are not included and up to 100% otherwise. Incorporating electrostatic interactions results in higher adsorption by close to 100% at lower pressures for hierarchical silicalite whereas for unmodified silicalite, it is less significant at all pressures. Hydroxylating the mesopore surface in hierarchical silicalite results in an enhancement in adsorption at pressures below 1 atm and suppression by up to 20 % at higher pressures. Temperature dependence at selected pressures exhibits expected decrease in adsorption amounts at higher temperatures. These findings can be useful in the engineering, selection, and optimization of nanoporous materials for hydrogen storage.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Induced Associations in the Double Layer of Salt-in-Ionic-Liquid Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionic liquids (ILs) are an extremely exciting class of electrolytes for energy storage applications because of their unique combination of properties. Upon dissolving alkali metal salts, such as Li or Na based salts, with the same anion as the IL, an intrinsically asymmetric electrolyte can be created for use in batteries, known as a salt-in-ionic liquid (SiIL). These SiILs have been well studied in the bulk, where negative transference numbers of the alkali metal cation have been observed from the formation of small, negatively charged clusters. The properties of these SiILs at electrified interfaces, however, have received little to no attention. Here, we develop a theory for the electrical double layer (EDL) of SiILs where we consistently account for the thermoreversible association of ions into Cayley tree aggregates. The theory predicts that the IL cations first populate the EDL at negative voltages, as they are not strongly bound to the anions. However at large negative voltages which are strong enough to break the alkali metal cation-anion associations, these IL cations are exchanged for the alkali metal cation because of their higher charge density. At positive voltages, we find that the SiIL actually becomes $\textit{more aggregated while screening the electrode charge}$ from the formation of large, negatively charged aggregates. Therefore, in contrast to conventional intuition of associations in the EDL, SiILs appear to become more associated in certain electric fields. We present these theoretical predictions to be verified by molecular dynamics simulations and experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>CO$_2$ and NO$_2$ Formation on Amorphous Solid Water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics for molecule formation, relaxation, diffusion, and desorption on amorphous solid water is studied in a quantitative fashion. We aim at characterizing, at a quantitative level, the formation probability, stabilization, energy relaxation and diffusion dynamics of CO$_2$ and NO$_2$ on cold amorphous solid water following atom+diatom recombination reactions. Accurate machine-learned energy functions combined with fluctuating charge models were used to investigate the diffusion, interactions, and recombination dynamics of atomic oxygen with CO and NO on amorphous solid water (ASW). Energy relaxation to the ASW and into water-internal-degrees of freedom were determined from analysis of the vibrational density of states. The surface diffusion and desorption energetics was investigated from extended and nonequilibrium MD simulations. The reaction probability on the nanosecond time scale is determined in a quantitative fashion and demonstrates that surface diffusion of the reactants leads to recombination for initial separations up to 20 \AA\/. After recombination both, CO$_2$ and NO$_2$, stabilize by energy transfer to water internal and surface phonon modes on the picosecond time scale. The average diffusion barriers and desorption energies agree with those reported from experiments. After recombination, the triatomic products diffuse easily which contrasts with the equilibrium situation in which both, CO$_2$ and NO$_2$, are stationary on the multi-nanosecond time scale.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Band Gap Problem with a Machine-Learned Exchange Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systematic underestimation of band gaps is one of the most fundamental challenges in semilocal density functional theory (DFT). In addition to hindering the application of DFT to predicting electronic properties, the band gap problem is intimately related to self-interaction and delocalization errors, which make the study of charge transfer mechanisms with DFT difficult. In this work, we present two key innovations to address the band gap problem. First, we design an approach for machine learning density functionals based on Gaussian processes to explicitly fit single-particle energy levels. Second, we introduce novel nonlocal features of the density matrix that are expressive enough to fit these single-particle levels. Combining these developments, we train a machine-learned functional for the exact exchange energy that predicts molecular energy gaps and reaction energies of a wide range of molecules in excellent agreement with reference hybrid DFT calculations. In addition, while being trained solely on molecular data, our model predicts reasonable formation energies of polarons in solids, showcasing its transferability and robustness. Our approach generalizes straightforwardly to full exchange-correlation functionals, thus paving the way to the design of novel state-of-the-art functionals for the prediction of electronic properties of molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>Node-Aligned Graph-to-Graph (NAG2G): Elevating Template-Free Deep Learning Approaches in Single-Step Retrosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-step retrosynthesis (SSR) in organic chemistry is increasingly benefiting from deep learning (DL) techniques in computer-aided synthesis design. While template-free DL models are flexible and promising for retrosynthesis prediction, they often ignore vital 2D molecular information and struggle with atom alignment for node generation, resulting in lower performance compared to the template-based and semi-template-based methods. To address these issues, we introduce Node-Aligned Graph-to-Graph (NAG2G), a transformer-based template-free DL model. NAG2G combines 2D molecular graphs and 3D conformations to retain comprehensive molecular details and incorporates product-reactant atom mapping through node alignment which determines the order of the node-by-node graph outputs process in an auto-regressive manner. Through rigorous benchmarking and detailed case studies, we have demonstrated that NAG2G stands out with its remarkable predictive accuracy on the expansive datasets of USPTO-50k and USPTO-FULL. Moreover, the model's practical utility is underscored by its successful prediction of synthesis pathways for multiple drug candidate molecules. This not only proves NAG2G's robustness but also its potential to revolutionize the prediction of complex chemical synthesis processes for future synthetic route design tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study combines the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix with the Benalcazar Bernevig Hughes model, defines a matrix algorithm based on the reverse process of convolution, and constructs an expression for the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix and Hamiltonian. Furthermore, in order to make the operation of the quantum Rubik's Cube matrix clearer, we use a Josephus ring to draw a topological graph of the Rubik's Cube expansion. This article uses a quantum Rubik's Cube to calculate energy level transitions of electrons, and shows that its operation corresponds to path integration. The band dispersion is obtained. This work provides new ideas and methods for calculating Hamiltonians and studying energy level structure.</description>
