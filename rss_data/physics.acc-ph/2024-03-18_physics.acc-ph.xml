      <title>CETASim: A numerical tool for beam collective effect study in storage rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a 6D multi-particle tracking program CETASim in C++ programming language to simulate intensity-dependent effects in electron storage rings. The program can simulate the beam collective effects due to short-range/long-range wakefields for single/coupled-bunch instability studies. It also features to simulate interactions among charged ions and the trains of electron bunches, including both fast ion and ion trapping effects. The bunch-by-bunch feedback is also included so that the user can simulate the damping of the unstable motion when its growth rate is faster than the radiation damping rate. The particle dynamics is based on the one-turn map, including the nonlinear effects of amplitude-dependent tune shift, high-order chromaticity, and second-order momentum compaction factor. A skew quadrupole can also be introduced by the users, which is very useful for the emittance sharing and the emittance exchange studies. This paper describes the code structure, the physics models, and the algorithms used in CETASim. We also present the results of its application to PETRA-IV storage ring.</description>

      <title>Thickness effect on superconducting properties of niobium films for radio-frequency cavity applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium-coated copper radio-frequency cavities are cost-effective alternatives to bulk niobium cavities, given the lower material costs of copper substrates and their operation in liquid helium at around 4.2 K. However, these cavities historically exhibited a gradual degradation in performance with the accelerating field. This phenomenon, not yet fully understood, limits the application of niobium thin film cavities in accelerators where the real-estate gradient needs to be maximized. Recent studies on niobium films deposited on copper using high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) technique show promising results in mitigating the performance degradation of niobium thin film radio-frequency cavities. This paper examines the effect of film thickness on the superconducting properties of niobium films deposited on copper using HiPIMS. The study provides insights into how the critical temperature, transition width, lower and upper critical fields, and critical current density vary with the film thickness. Increasing the thickness of niobium films deposited through HiPIMS is found to enhance superconducting properties and reduce densities of defects and structural irregularities in the crystalline lattice. This shows potential for enhancing overall performance and potentially mitigating the observed performance degradation in niobium thin film radio-frequency cavities. Additionally, the Ivry's scaling relation among critical temperature, thickness, and sheet resistance at the normal state appears applicable to niobium films up to approximately 4 $\mu$m. This extends the previously confirmed validity for niobium films, which was limited to around 300 nm thickness.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of the Microbunching Instability Through Transverse Landau Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microbunching instability has been a long-standing issue for high-brightness free-electron lasers (FELs), and is a significant show-stopper to achieving full longitudinal coherence in the x-ray regime. This paper reports the first experimental demonstration of microbunching instability mitigation through transverse Landau damping, based on linear optics control in a dispersive region. Analytical predictions for the microbunching content are supported by numerical calculations of the instability gain and confirmed through the experimental characterization of the spectral brightness of the FERMI FEL under different transverse optics configurations of the transfer line between the linear accelerator and the FEL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a method for adjusting macro-particle weights within a particle distribution while preserving statistical and physical properties. The method allows the weights of the new macro-particle distribution to be determined by any continuous function, including uniform.

      <title>Suppressing Coherent Synchrotron Radiation Effects in Chicane Bunch Compressors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most significant advances in the accelerator-based light sources (i.e., x-ray free electron lasers) are driven by the production of the high final peak current in the last several decades. As a prerequisite to attain the proposed high brightness, the symmetric C-chicane bunch compressor is typically exploited due to its simplicity, efficiency, and natural dispersion-free feature at all orders. However, during bunch compression for a high peak current requirement, a main contributing factor to the transverse emittance degradation is the emission of the coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR). Suppressing this effect is necessary to preserve the beam phase-space quality. To this end, this paper presents an analysis of one-dimensional CSR point-kick and derives the cancellation conditions in terms of compression factor. The CSR cancelation conditions indicate an asymmetric geometric design. We demonstrate concrete schemes for asymmetric C- and S-chicanes, and verify the CSR cancelation conditions using integration methods and ELEGANT simulations. Furthermore, the proposed asymmetric C- and S-chicanes can drastically suppress the emittance growth compared with the symmetric ones with identical bunch compression goals.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional theory of superradiant free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for coherently shaping attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable coherent pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad coherent bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the coherent seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production of pulse pairs using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source.</description>
