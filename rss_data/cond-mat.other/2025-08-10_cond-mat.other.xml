      <title>Rydberg Exciton Dynamics in the Blockade Regime of Cu2O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hosting giant Rydberg excitons with principal quantum numbers up to n = 30, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) provides a rare solid-state setting for exploring Rydberg physics, as exemplified by the blockade effect. Here we access the strongly interaction regime at high excitation densities (10^14-10^16/cm^3) and resolve the corresponding blockade dynamics for n = 2-7 using time-resolved spectroscopy. We find that Rydberg blockades are primarily governed by resonant dipolar interactions and that exciton recombination is coupled to the blockade itself. These findings demonstrate the potential for manipulating Rydberg exctions in the strongly interacting blockade regime in a solid state system.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Collisional Stopping Power via Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-Moller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R'$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range.</description>

      <title>Fermi Surface Reconstruction and Anisotropic Linear Magnetoresistance in the Charge Density Wave Topological Semimetal TaTe4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between topology and correlated electron states is central to the study of quantum materials. TaTe$_4$ is a quasi-one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) compound predicted to host topological phases, which makes it a model platform to explore this interplay. Here, we combine high-field magnetotransport measurements with density functional theory calculations to provide a comprehensive mapping of the Fermi surface (FS) of TaTe$_4$ in its CDW phase. Using multiple current-field geometries, we resolve the four largest of six pockets of the FS predicted by theory and find no evidence of non-CDW bands, highlighting the full reconstruction of the FS in the bulk. We identify a previously unobserved quasi-cylindrical pocket and uncover a large size orbit consistent with magnetic breakdown between reconstructed FS sheets, from which we estimate a CDW gap of $\sim$0.29~eV. Moreover, we observe a robust linear magnetoresistance that persists across all field directions when current flows perpendicular to the 1D chains along which the CDW is formed, with a distinct high-field linear regime emerging when field is along the chains. These findings establish TaTe$_4$ as a prototypical material to study the coexistence of correlation-driven reconstruction and topological electronic states.</description>
