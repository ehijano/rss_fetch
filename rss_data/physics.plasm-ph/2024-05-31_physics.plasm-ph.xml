      <title>Shock Wave Formation in Radiative Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temporal evolution of weak shocks in radiative media is theoretically investigated in this work. The structure of radiative shocks has traditionally been studied in a stationary framework. Their systematic classification is complex because layers of optically thin and thick regions alternate to form a radiatively-driven precursor and a temperature-relaxation layer, between which the hydrodynamic shock is embedded. In this work, we analyze the formation of weak shocks when two radiative plasmas with different pressures are put in contact. Applying a reductive perturbative method yields a Burgers-type equation that governs the temporal evolution of the perturbed variables including the radiation field. The conditions upon which optically thin and thick solutions exist have been derived and expressed as a function of the shock strength and Boltzmann number. Below a certain Boltzmann number threshold, weak shocks always become optically thick asymptotically in time, while thin solutions appear as transitory structures. The existence of an optically thin regime is related to the presence of an overdense layer in the compressed material. Scaling laws for the characteristic formation time and shock width are provided for each regime. The theoretical analysis is supported by FLASH simulations, and a comprehensive test-case has been designed to benchmark radiative hydrodynamic codes.</description>

      <title>Low-energy collisions between electrons and BeD$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multichannel quantum defect theory is applied in the treatment of the dissociative recombination and vibrational excitation processes for the BeD$^+$ ion in the twenty four vibrational levels of its ground electronic state ($\textrm{X}\,{^{1}\Sigma^{+}},v_{i}^{+}=0\ldots 23$). Three electronic symmetries of BeD$^{**}$ states (\ensuremath{^{2}\Pi}, \ensuremath{^{2}\Sigma^{+}}, and \ensuremath{^{2}\Delta}), are considered in the calculation of cross sections and the corresponding rate coefficients. The incident electron energy range is $10^{-5}$--2.7 eV and the electron temperature range is 100--5000~K. The vibrational dependence of these collisional processes is highlighted. The resulting data are useful in magnetic confinement fusion edge plasma modelling and spectroscopy, in devices with beryllium based main chamber materials, such as ITER and JET, and operating with the deuterium-tritium fuel mix. An extensive rate coefficients database is presented in graphical form and also by analytic fit functions whose parameters are tabulated in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isodynamic stellarators with low turbulence as fusion reactor candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellarator is a type of fusion energy device that - if properly designed - could provide clean, safe, and abundant energy to the grid. To generate this energy, a stellarator must keep a hot mixture of charged particles (known as a plasma) sufficiently confined by using a fully shaped magnetic field. If this is achieved, the heat from fusion reactions within the plasma can be harvested as energy. We present a novel method for designing reactor-relevant stellarator magnetic fields, which combine several key physical properties. These include plasma stability, excellent confinement of the fast moving particles generated by fusion reactions, and reduction of the turbulence that is known to limit the performance of the most advanced stellarator experiment in the world, Wendelstein 7-X.</description>

      <title>MANTA: A Negative-Triangularity NASEM-Compliant Fusion Pilot Plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MANTA (Modular Adjustable Negative Triangularity ARC-class) design study investigated how negative-triangularity (NT) may be leveraged in a compact, fusion pilot plant (FPP) to take a ``power-handling first" approach. The result is a pulsed, radiative, ELM-free tokamak that satisfies and exceeds the FPP requirements described in the 2021 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report ``Bringing Fusion to the U.S. Grid". A self-consistent integrated modeling workflow predicts a fusion power of 450 MW and a plasma gain of 11.5 with only 23.5 MW of power to the scrape-off layer (SOL). This low $P_\text{SOL}$ together with impurity seeding and high density at the separatrix results in a peak heat flux of just 2.8 MW/m$^{2}$. MANTA's high aspect ratio provides space for a large central solenoid (CS), resulting in ${\sim}$15 minute inductive pulses. In spite of the high B fields on the CS and the other REBCO-based magnets, the electromagnetic stresses remain below structural and critical current density limits. Iterative optimization of neutron shielding and tritium breeding blanket yield tritium self-sufficiency with a breeding ratio of 1.15, a blanket power multiplication factor of 1.11, toroidal field coil lifetimes of $3100 \pm 400$ MW-yr, and poloidal field coil lifetimes of at least $890 \pm 40$ MW-yr. Following balance of plant modeling, MANTA is projected to generate 90 MW of net electricity at an electricity gain factor of ${\sim}2.4$. Systems-level economic analysis estimates an overnight cost of US\$3.4 billion, meeting the NASEM FPP requirement that this first-of-a-kind be less than US\$5 billion. The toroidal field coil cost and replacement time are the most critical upfront and lifetime cost drivers, respectively.</description>

      <title>The effects of finite electron inertia on helicity-barrier-mediated turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the partitioning of turbulent energy between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for the accurate interpretation of observations and modelling of various astrophysical phenomena. Many such plasmas are "imbalanced", wherein the large-scale energy input is dominated by Alfv\'enic fluctuations propagating in a single direction. In this paper, we demonstrate that when strongly-magnetised plasma turbulence is imbalanced, nonlinear conservation laws imply the existence of a critical value of the electron plasma beta that separates two dramatically different types of turbulence in parameter space. For betas below the critical value, the free energy injected on the largest scales is able to undergo a familiar Kolmogorov-type cascade to small scales where it is dissipated, heating electrons. For betas above the critical value, the system forms a "helicity barrier" that prevents the cascade from proceeding past the ion Larmor radius, causing the majority of the injected free energy to be deposited into ion heating. Physically, the helicity barrier results from the inability of the system to adjust to the disparity between the perpendicular-wavenumber scalings of the free energy and generalised helicity below the ion Larmor radius; restoring finite electron inertia can annul, or even reverse, this disparity, giving rise to the aforementioned critical beta. We relate this physics to the "dynamic phase alignment" mechanism, and characterise various other important features of the helicity barrier, including the nature of the nonlinear wavenumber-space fluxes, dissipation rates, and energy spectra. The existence of such a critical beta has important implications for heating, as it suggests that the dominant recipient of the turbulent energy -- ions or electrons -- can depend sensitively on the characteristics of the plasma at large scales.</description>

      <title>Embedded coherent structures from MHD to sub-ion scales in turbulent solar wind at 0.17 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10478v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study intermittent coherent structures in solar wind magnetic turbulence from MHD to kinetic plasma scales using Parker Solar Probe data during its first perihelion (at 0.17 au), when the satellite was in the Alfv\'enic slow wind of 340 km/s. The coherent structures are energetic events localized in time and covering wide range of scales. We detect them using Morlet wavelets. For the first time, we apply a multi-scale analyses in physical space to study these structures. At MHD scales within the inertial range, times scales $\tau \in (1, 10^{2} )$ s, we find (i) current sheets including switchback boundaries and (ii) Alfv\'en vortices. Within these events, there are embedded structures at smaller scales: typically Alfv\'en vortices at ion scales, $\tau \in (0.08, 1)$ s, and a compressible vortices at sub-ion scales, $\tau \in (8,80)$ ms. The number of coherent structures grows toward smaller scales: we observe about $\sim 200$ events during 5 h time interval at MHD scales, $\sim 10^{3}$ events ai ion scales and $\sim 10^{4}$ events at sub-ion scales. In general, there are multiple structures of ion and sub-ion scales embedded within one MHD structure. There are also examples of ion and sub-ion scales structures outside of MHD structures. To quantify the relative importance of different type of structures, we do a statistical comparison of the observed structures with the expectations of models of the current sheets and vortices. This comparison is based on amplitude anisotropy of magnetic fluctuations within the structures. The results show the dominance of Alfv\'en vortices at all scales in contrast to the widespread view of dominance of current sheets. This means that Alfv\'en vortices are important building blocs of solar wind turbulence.</description>

      <title>Magnetized compressible turbulence with a fluctuation dynamo and Reynolds numbers over a million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is a ubiquitous state for many astrophysical plasmas. However, even the basic statistics for this type of turbulence remains uncertain. We present results from supersonic MHD turbulence simulations at unparalleled resolutions, with plasma Reynolds numbers of over a million. In the kinetic energy spectrum we find a break between the scales that are dominated by kinetic energy, with spectral index $-2$, and those that become strongly magnetized, with spectral index $-3/2$. By analyzing the Helmholtz decomposed kinetic energy spectrum, we find that the compressible modes are not passively mixed through the cascade of the incompressible modes. At high magnetic Reynolds number, above $10^5$, we find a power law in the magnetic energy spectrum with spectral index $-9/5$. On the strongly magnetized, subsonic scales the plasma tends to self-organize into locally relaxed regions, where there is strong alignment between the current density, magnetic field, velocity field and vorticity field, depleting both the nonlinearities and magnetic terms in the MHD equations, which we attribute to plasma relaxation on scales where the magnetic fluctuations evolve on shorter timescales than the velocity fluctuations. This process constrains the cascade to inhomogenous, volume-poor, fractal surfaces between relaxed regions, which has significant repercussions for understanding the nature of magnetized turbulence in astrophysical plasmas and the saturation of the fluctuation dynamo.</description>

      <title>Dust dynamics in RAMSES -- II. Equilibrium drift velocity distributions of charged dust grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gas-grain relative drift velocity distributions of charged astrophysical dust grains in MHD turbulence. We do this using a range of MHD-PIC simulations spanning different plasma-$\beta$, sonic/Alfv\'en Mach number, and with grains of varying size and charge-to-mass ratio. We find that the root-mean-square drift velocity is a strong function of the grain size, following a power law with a 1/2 slope. The r.m.s. value has only a very weak dependence on the charge-to-mass ratio. On the other hand, the shape of the distribution is a strong function of the grain charge-to-mass ratio, and in compressible turbulence, also the grain size. We then compare these results to simple analytic models based upon time-domain quasi-linear theory and solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation. These models explain qualitatively the r.m.s. drift velocity's lack of charge-to-mass ratio dependence, as well as why the shape of the distribution changes as the charge-to-mass ratio increases. Finally we scale our results to astrophysical conditions. As an example, at a length scale of one parsec in the cold neutral medium, 0.1 $\mu$m grains should be drifting at roughly 40% of the turbulent velocity dispersion. These findings may serve as a basis for a model for grain velocities in the context of grain-grain collisions, non-thermal sputtering, and accretion of metals. These findings also have implications for the transport of grains through the galaxy, suggesting that grains may have non-negligible random motions at length-scales that many modern galaxy simulations approach.</description>
