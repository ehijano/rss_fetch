      <title>Multilevel Graph Reinforcement Learning for Consistent Cognitive Decision-making in Heterogeneous Mixed Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of heterogeneous mixed autonomy, vehicles experience dynamic spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal interactions in a complex, non-Euclidean space. These complexities pose significant challenges to traditional decision-making frameworks. Addressing this, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework integrated with multilevel graph representations, which effectively comprehends and models the spatiotemporal interactions among vehicles navigating through uncertain traffic conditions with varying decision-making systems. Rooted in multilevel graph representation theory, our approach encapsulates spatiotemporal relationships inherent in non-Euclidean spaces. A weighted graph represents spatiotemporal features between nodes, addressing the degree imbalance inherent in dynamic graphs. We integrate asynchronous parallel hierarchical reinforcement learning with a multilevel graph representation and a multi-head attention mechanism, which enables connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to exhibit capabilities akin to human cognition, facilitating consistent decision-making across various critical dimensions. The proposed decision-making strategy is validated in challenging environments characterized by high density, randomness, and dynamism on highway roads. We assess the performance of our framework through ablation studies, comparative analyses, and spatiotemporal trajectory evaluations. This study presents a quantitative analysis of decision-making mechanisms mirroring human cognitive functions in the realm of heterogeneous mixed autonomy, promoting the development of multi-dimensional decision-making strategies and a sophisticated distribution of attentional resources.</description>

      <title>AgentSimulator: An Agent-based Approach for Data-driven Business Process Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business process simulation (BPS) is a versatile technique for estimating process performance across various scenarios. Traditionally, BPS approaches employ a control-flow-first perspective by enriching a process model with simulation parameters. Although such approaches can mimic the behavior of centrally orchestrated processes, such as those supported by workflow systems, current control-flow-first approaches cannot faithfully capture the dynamics of real-world processes that involve distinct resource behavior and decentralized decision-making. Recognizing this issue, this paper introduces AgentSimulator, a resource-first BPS approach that discovers a multi-agent system from an event log, modeling distinct resource behaviors and interaction patterns to simulate the underlying process. Our experiments show that AgentSimulator achieves state-of-the-art simulation accuracy with significantly lower computation times than existing approaches while providing high interpretability and adaptability to different types of process-execution scenarios.</description>

      <title>The computational power of a human society: a new model of social evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social evolutionary theory seeks to explain increases in the scale and complexity of human societies, from origins to present. Over the course of the twentieth century, social evolutionary theory largely fell out of favor as a way of investigating human history, just as advances in complex systems science and computer science saw the emergence of powerful new conceptions of complex systems, and in particular new methods of measuring complexity. We propose that these advances in our understanding of complex systems and computer science should be brought to bear on our investigations into human history. To that end, we present a new framework for modeling how human societies co-evolve with their biotic environments, recognizing that both a society and its environment are computers. This leads us to model the dynamics of each of those two systems using the same, new kind of computational machine, which we define here. For simplicity, we construe a society as a set of interacting occupations and technologies. Similarly, under such a model, a biotic environment is a set of interacting distinct ecological and climatic processes. This provides novel ways to characterize social complexity, which we hope will cast new light on the archaeological and historical records. Our framework also provides a natural way to formalize both the energetic (thermodynamic) costs required by a society as it runs, and the ways it can extract thermodynamic resources from the environment in order to pay for those costs -- and perhaps to grow with any left-over resources.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Construction of Finite Abstractions for Interconnected Systems: A Compositional Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-state abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) present a promising avenue for the formal verification and synthesis of controllers in continuous-space control systems. These abstractions provide simplified models that capture the fundamental behaviors of the original systems. However, the creation of such abstractions typically relies on the availability of precise knowledge concerning system dynamics, which might not be available in many real-world applications. In this work, we introduce an innovative, data-driven, and compositional approach to generate finite abstractions for interconnected systems that consist of discrete-time control subsystems with unknown dynamics. These subsystems interact through an unknown static interconnection map. Our methodology for abstracting the interconnected system involves constructing abstractions for individual subsystems and incorporating an abstraction of the interconnection map.</description>

      <title>Self-organizing Multiagent Target Enclosing under Limited Information and Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to address the target enclosing problem using non-holonomic multiagent systems, where agents self-organize on the enclosing shape around a fixed target. In our approach, agents independently move toward the desired enclosing geometry when apart and activate the collision avoidance mechanism when a collision is imminent, thereby guaranteeing inter-agent safety. Our approach combines global enclosing behavior and local collision avoidance mechanisms by devising a special potential function and sliding manifold. We rigorously show that an agent does not need to ensure safety with every other agent and put forth a concept of the nearest colliding agent (for any arbitrary agent) with whom ensuring safety is sufficient to avoid collisions in the entire swarm. The proposed control eliminates the need for a fixed or pre-established agent arrangement around the target and requires only relative information between an agent and the target. This makes our design particularly appealing for scenarios with limited global information, hence significantly reducing communication requirements. We finally present simulation results to vindicate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>
