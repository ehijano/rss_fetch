      <title>The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Dark Matter Speed Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detection experiments require information about the local dark matter speed distribution to produce constraints on dark matter candidates, or infer their properties in the event of a discovery. In this paper, we analyze how the uncertainty in the dark matter speed distribution near the Sun is affected by baryonic feedback, halo-to-halo variance, and halo mass. To do so, we harness the statistical power of the new DREAMS Cold Dark Matter simulation suite, which is comprised of 1024 zoom-in Milky Way-mass halos with varied initial conditions as well as cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Applying a normalizing flows emulator to these simulations, we find that the uncertainty in the local DM speed distribution is dominated by halo-to-halo variance and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty in host halo mass. Uncertainties in supernova and black hole feedback (from the IllustrisTNG model in this case) are negligible in comparison. Using the DREAMS suite, we present a state-of-the-art prediction for the DM speed distribution in the Milky Way. Although the Standard Halo Model is contained within the uncertainty of this prediction, individual galaxies may have distributions that differ from it. Lastly, we apply our DREAMS results to the XENON1T experiment and demonstrate that the astrophysical uncertainties are comparable to the experimental ones, solidifying previous results in the literature obtained with a smaller sample of simulated Milky Way-mass halos.</description>

      <title>Galactic bars are already mature at Cosmic Noon: bar strength and flatness at z ~ 1.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the nature of $z&gt;1$ galactic bars. Once thought to be highly transient, our results demonstrate otherwise. Our sample consists of nine massive ($&gt;10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) star-forming barred-spiral galaxies at $z_{\rm spec} \sim 1.5$. Using rest-frame near-IR (F444W) JWST/NIRCam imaging, we apply ellipse fitting along with 1D and 2D morphological modeling to directly measure bar properties. We find that five galaxies host flat surface brightness profiles (bar S\'ersic index $&lt;0.4$), indicative of highly evolved, "mature" bars. By contrast, only two galaxies show exponential profiles, characteristic of young bars, and these are also shorter in absolute length than the flat bars. We therefore conclude that a large fraction of bars at this epoch have already matured, thereby indicating the presence of well-settled disks required to facilitate bar formation and sustained evolution well before $z\sim1.5$. To assess the gravitational impact of the bars, we calculate the maximum transverse-to-radial force ratio ($Q_{b}$). We find that $Q_{b}$ values are comparable to, or weaker than, those of bars in the local Universe, Seven of the nine bars show only a marginal increase in strength with maturity (from exponential to flat bars). Contrarily however, the remaining two bars are flat, but have the lowest $Q_{b}$ values in our sample. We hence propose that the mature bars at $z\sim 1.5$ may experience phases of weakening due to rapid gas inflows and/or minor mergers. In conclusion, our work sheds light on the rapidly evolving nature of high-z bars and paves the way for larger statistical studies.</description>

      <title>JWST Confirmation of a Runaway Supermassive Black Hole via its Supersonic Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of $\approx 600$ km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The runaway black hole interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/H$\alpha$, [SII]/H$\alpha$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in good agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Eight New Ultramassive Black Hole Masses confirm Best Correlation with Galaxy Core Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse black-hole scaling relations at the high-mass end, focusing in particular on the regime of ultra-massive black holes, $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{BH} &gt; 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ (UMBHs). In a sample of 16 Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) without previous black-hole mass measurements we discover 8 UMBHs based on direct dynamical detections with triaxial Schwarzschild models. This first sample of triaxial black-hole mass determinations increases the number of known UMBHs by a factor of two and dramatically increases the constraints for BH mass scaling relations at the high-mass end. We find that BCGs are outliers in the canonical BH - $\sigma$ relation, while the size of their depleted cores - the central light-deficient region - is a much better unbiased predictor of the black hole mass and should be used as a proxy at the high-mass end. BCGs smoothly join the trend already established for massive core galaxies in previous studies. This also holds for tight correlations between core size and sphere-of-influence radius and core size and core density. All these relations strongly support the black-hole binary model for the formation of the centers of the most massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>A bottleneck for star formation: the importance of magnetic fields during the formation of cold gas in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a high-resolution simulation of a dwarf galaxy, we quantify the energetic importance of magnetic fields within the different phases of its interstellar medium (ISM) on parsec scales. We show that, whilst overall the magnetic field is only energetically dominant for a small fraction of the ISM, it becomes important in the thermally unstable regime (45.2% of the mass is magnetically dominated), and in the majority of the cold neutral medium (66.1% of the mass). In the molecular gas, the magnetic field dominates more of the total mass budget (39.8%) than thermal energy, turbulent kinetic energy, or gas self-gravitating potential energy. However, much of this gas will be CO-dark. This suggests that magnetic forces are non-negligible during the formation of cold dense gas, which will slow its collapse and lead to an increase in the fraction of cold atomic, and molecular gas in the ISM. Consequently, star-forming clouds may be surrounded by a larger reservoir of cold gas than would otherwise be expected.</description>

      <title>Stellar Bars in Jellyfish Galaxies: Statistical Insights into the Combined Role of Bars and Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observational studies suggest that the interplay between internal and environmental mechanisms, in particular, the combined action of stellar bars and ram pressure stripping (RPS) may influence central star formation activity in jellyfish galaxies. However, current evidence relies on small samples, leaving open whether bars play a significant role during stripping. In this study, we analyse a sample about five times larger than those used in previous works, comprising 176 galaxies identified as RPS candidates based on optical morphological indicators such as asymmetries, debris tails, and displaced star-forming regions. To assess the impact of these processes, we examine radial $u-r$ colour profiles from SDSS imaging as tracers of the specific star formation rate (sSFR). We classify galaxies by bar presence and RPS signatures, and construct comparison samples through stepwise matching in stellar mass and environment to disentangle the individual and combined effects of bars and RPS on stellar population gradients. Our results show that central rejuvenation signals emerge in RPS candidate galaxies, becoming most evident when bars and RPS act together. Barred RPS galaxies are systematically bluer at all radii than their non-RPS counterparts, while unbarred systems display only mild or no central differences, suggesting that the observable outcome of RPS depends on the stripping stage. Furthermore, barred galaxies exhibit flatter central colour profiles than unbarred ones -- a robust signature across all matched configurations. These findings highlight the key role of bars in amplifying environmental effects on the stellar populations of jellyfish galaxies, underscoring how internal structures can modulate the observable signatures of environmental processes in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Warped &amp; Hooked: Mapping the Magellanic Clouds in 3D using Red Clump stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) are the Milky Way's nearest interacting galaxy pair, offering a unique laboratory for studying tidal effects on galactic disks. Despite extensive survey efforts, the three-dimensional geometry of the Clouds, particularly the putative warp of the LMC, remains poorly constrained due to incompleteness in their crowded centers and the low stellar density of their peripheries, which demand wide-field coverage. Using red-clump (RC) stars as standard candles, corrected for age- and metallicity-dependent population effects with empirically calibrated color-magnitude relations and spatially resolved star-formation histories, we construct the most detailed distance map of the Magellanic System to date. Based on $\sim$2.3 million RC stars from \textit{Gaia} DR3 combined with modern reddening maps, we measure median heliocentric distances of $50.62 \pm 2.32$~kpc for the LMC (to $\sim$23$^{\circ}$) and $60.75 \pm 2.85$~kpc for the SMC (to $\sim$12$^{\circ}$). The maps reveal substructures including the LMC Northern Arm, southern hooks, the Magellanic Bridge, and SMC peripheral over-densities, with refreshed distance estimates. Fitting the LMC disk within $7^{\circ}$ yields a global inclination of $i = 25.32^{\circ} \pm 0.10^{\circ}$ and line-of-nodes position angle of $\theta = 142.34^{\circ} \pm 0.21^{\circ}$. Most strikingly, we find the LMC periphery is warped azimuthally into a U-shaped structure reaching vertical amplitudes of $\sim$7~kpc at radii of $\sim$15~kpc. We interpret this warp as a tidal response to the most recent close passage of the SMC $\sim$300 Myr ago, providing new constraints on the orbital history and dynamical evolution of the Magellanic Clouds.</description>

      <title>A Black-Hole Envelope Interpretation for Cosmological Demographics of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs) newly discovered with JWST are active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may represent black hole (BH) growth at the earliest cosmic epochs. These sources show puzzling features unlike typical AGNs, including red optical continua, weak hot-dust emission, and a lack of detectable X-rays. Previously, LRDs have often been interpreted as dust-reddened AGNs, leading to severe inconsistencies with the luminosity and BH mass densities inferred for previously known AGNs over $0&lt;z&lt;5$. The BH-envelope (BHE) model has been proposed to explain these characteristics, in which an accreting BH is enshrouded by a dense, optically thick gaseous envelope. In this Letter, we reanalyze the SEDs of $\sim 400$ photometric LRDs in the COSMOS-Web survey using the BHE model and reassess their implications for cosmological BH evolution. We find that the optical-NIR spectra of LRDs are well reproduced by blackbody emission with an effective temperatures of $4000-6000~\K$. Within the BHE framework, the inferred bolometric luminosities decrease by $\gtrsim1-2$ orders of magnitude compared to dust-reddened AGN assumptions. As a result, the revised luminosity function, BH accretion density, and BH mass function become consistent with those of AGNs at $z&lt;5$. The stellar masses of LRD hosts are estimated by attributing the UV excesses to star formation. Although the resulting $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratio remains higher than the local empirical value, the excess is modest. Overall, the BHE model not only resolves the spectral features of LRDs but also brings their statistical properties into agreement with the broader cosmological BH population.</description>

      <title>The DESI Single Fiber Lens Search. I. Four Thousand Spectroscopically Selected Galaxy-Galaxy Gravitational Lens Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 4,110 strong gravitational lens candidates, 3,887 of which are new discoveries, selected from a sample of 5,837,154 luminous red galaxies (LRGs) observed with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Candidates are identified via the presence of background ionized oxygen [O II] nebular emission lines in the foreground LRG spectra which may originate from the lensing of higher redshift star-forming galaxies. Using the measured foreground redshift, background redshift, and integrated flux of the background [O II] doublet, we integrate over impact parameters to compute the probability that each candidate is a lens. We expect 53% of candidates to be true lenses with Einstein radii ranging from 0.1'' to 4'', which can be confirmed with high-resolution imaging. Confirmed strong lenses from this sample will form a valuable cosmological dataset, as strong gravitational lensing is the only method to directly measure dark matter halo substructure at cosmological distances. We independently recover the host of the multiply imaged gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova iPTF16geu (Goobar et al. 2017). Monitoring these lenses for future multiply lensed transients will enable a) H0 measurements via time-delay cosmography and b) substructure measurements via flux ratios.</description>

      <title>A distance measurement for blazar TXS 0506+056 using its radio variability and very long baseline images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of constraining the angular diameter distance to blazar TXS 0506+056. We used data obtained with the 15 GHz VLBA in MJD 54838-60262 and data from the 15 GHz OVRO 40 m single dish telescope in MJD 54474-59023. We used a variability timescale and a causality argument of a linear size to measure the angular diameter distance to the source. To constrain the Doppler factor, we applied the relation between the rest-frame brightness temperature of the emission region and the observed brightness temperature. To calculate the observed brightness temperature, the angular size and flux density variation of the emission region are required. The angular size of the emission region (i.e., the VLBA core) was obtained from a FWHM, which is a circular Gaussian model-fitting parameter that ranges from 0.048-0.228 mas, and its uncertainty is determined to be 1.8-13 %. Using the OVRO SD light curve, we obtained a variability timescale of $128.0_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$ days and a peak flux density of $1.750_{-0.104}^{+0.015}$ Jy for the largest flare that peaked on MJD $58921.7_{-5.5}^{+2.6}$. We assumed a disk brightness geometry, equipartition brightness temperature ($5\times10^{10}$ K), and perfect radius. Using the VLBA core sizes obtained near the flare peaks, we found consistent distance measurement results with the $\Lambda$CDM model within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties. We suggest that the best distance from the source is $941_{-64}^{+59}$ Mpc, which is comparable with the $\Lambda$CDM distance of $948.2\pm13.5$ Mpc. The distance measurement should indeed be taken at the peak of a flare. We found that the decomposed timescale allowed us to obtain consistent distances with the $\Lambda$CDM. We strongly suggest to decompose light curves when the variability timescales are to be obtained properly.</description>

      <title>ELG$\times$LRG distribution through dark matter halo dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the clustering and halo occupation distribution (HOD) of DESI Y1 emission-line (ELGs) and luminous red (LRGs) galaxies at $0.8&lt;z&lt;1.1$, including their cross-correlation (ELG$\times$LRG), using the AbacusSummit suite and a new Halo Occupation Model (HOMe) for galaxy multi-tracers. This integrates intra-halo dynamics, halo exclusion, and quenching, bridging insights from hydrodynamical, HOD, abundance-matching, and semi-analytic studies. Leveraging full phase-space information from the Uchuu N-body simulation, and sampling satellites from dark-matter particle positions via physically motivated prescriptions, HOMe reproduces the anisotropic clustering down to $s=200\,h^{-1}$kpc with unprecedented accuracy. Model parameters are inferred solely from two-point statistics using a two-level Bayesian framework, yielding high-fidelity ELG, LRG and cross-reference catalogs. We find that satellite ELGs behave as incoherent flows within their parent halos, dominating the clustering below $4\,h^{-1}$Mpc. The HOD from the best-fit HOMe has the following properties: (i) 90.50% (85.91%) of ELGs (LRGs) are central galaxies without satellites, residing in halos of $M_{\rm vir}\sim6.6\times10^{11}\,(1.2\times10^{13})\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$; (ii) the ELG$\times$LRG cross-correlation is governed by central-central pairs and shaped by halo exclusion on $2-5\,h^{-1}$Mpc scales; (iii) 9.50% (14.09%) of ELGs (LRGs) are satellites, of which 1.09% (3.52%) inhabit halos with a central galaxy of the same species in a maximally conformal configuration, 7.02% (0.005%) orbit complementary hosts in a minimally conformal state, and 0.58% (10.57%) are orphans. HOMe high sensitivity precisely captures the dynamics of satellites in different host environments, opening a promising avenue for understanding systematics, the dynamical nature of dark matter, potentially distinguishing gravity models.</description>

      <title>Investigating the H i mass-size relation using the Simba cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational studies have established a remarkably tight power-law relationship between the H I masses and sizes of late-type galaxies, known as the H I mass-size relation. This relation has been shown to persist across various models of a galaxy's H I surface density profile. Using the Simba cosmological simulations, we investigate the robustness of this relation under different feedback prescriptions, including cases where specific feedback mechanisms are absent. While the global properties of galaxies are significantly affected by changes in feedback, the H I mass-size relation remains intact. Moreover, its parameters consistently align with the best available empirical measurements. We analyze the H I mass distributions of galaxies and demonstrate that, regardless of the feedback scenario, galaxies within a given H I mass bin exhibit outer H I radial profiles well approximated by an exponential function. Furthermore, the exponential decline rate remains remarkably similar across different physical prescriptions. We attribute the persistence of the H I mass-size relation to this inherent self-similarity in the H I mass distributions.</description>

      <title>The dynamical memory of tidal stellar streams: Joint inference of the Galactic potential and the progenitor of GD-1 with flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams offer one of the most sensitive probes of the Milky Way`s gravitational potential, as their phase-space morphology encodes both the tidal field of the host galaxy and the internal structure of their progenitors. In this work, we introduce a framework that leverages Flow Matching and Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to jointly infer the parameters of the GD-1 progenitor and the global properties of the Milky Way potential. Our aim is to move beyond traditional techniques (e.g. orbit-fitting and action-angle methods) by constructing a fully Bayesian, likelihood-free posterior over both host-galaxy parameters and progenitor properties, thereby capturing the intrinsic coupling between tidal stripping dynamics and the underlying potential. To achieve this, we generate a large suite of mock GD-1-like streams using our differentiable N-body code \textsc{\texttt{Odisseo}}, sampling self-consistent initial conditions from a Plummer sphere and evolving them in a flexible Milky Way potential model. We then apply conditional Flow Matching to learn the vector field that transports a base Gaussian distribution into the posterior, enabling efficient, amortized inference directly from stream phase-space data. We demonstrate that our method successfully recovers the true parameters of a fiducial GD-1 simulation, producing well-calibrated posteriors and accurately reproducing parameter degeneracies arising from progenitor-host interactions. Flow Matching provides a powerful, flexible framework for Galactic Archaeology. Our approach enables joint inference on progenitor and Galactic parameters, capturing complex dependencies that are difficult to model with classical likelihood-based methods.</description>

      <title>Velocity Dispersion Functions of Pressure-supported Galaxies in EAGLE Simulations with Varying AGN Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stellar velocity dispersion functions (VDFs) of pressure-supported galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological simulations. The central stellar velocity dispersion is one of the fundamental dynamical tracers of the total mass of galaxy subhalos, alongside luminosity and stellar mass. Because it reflects the gravitational potential, the stellar velocity dispersion is expected to be relatively insensitive to feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a critical process that regulates the connection between other galaxy observables and subhalo mass. To examine the impact of AGN feedback, we analyze the VDFs from five EAGLE simulation runs, each adopting a different AGN feedback model: one "standard", two "enhanced", one "reduced", and one with no AGN feedback. We compute the stellar velocity dispersions of pressure-supported galaxies using member stellar particles, mimicking fiber spectroscopy. The VDFs from the standard and enhanced AGN feedback models show little difference. However, contrary to our initial expectation that the VDF shape would be largely insensitive to AGN feedback, the simulations with reduced and no AGN feedback show a significant excess of high velocity dispersion galaxies ($\sigma_{*}$ &gt; 200 km s$^{-1}$) and a deficit of low dispersion galaxies (100 &lt; $\sigma_{*}$ (km s$^{-1}$) &lt; 200), compared to those with standard or enhanced AGN feedback. The presence of high velocity dispersion galaxies in the no-AGN model arises from enhanced central star formation, due to the absence of AGN-driven gas heating or expulsion. Our results demonstrate that the shape of the theoretical VDF is sensitive to the strength of AGN feedback. These predictions offer a theoretical benchmark for future observational studies of the galaxy velocity dispersion function using large-scale spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>A Chandra view of SPT-CL J0217-5014: a massive galaxy cluster at a cosmic intersection at z=0.53</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters trace the densest regions of the cosmic web and are crucial laboratories for studying the thermodynamic and chemical evolution of the intracluster medium (ICM). We present a Chandra study of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0217-5014 ($z \sim 0.53$; $M_{\rm 500} \sim 3 \times 10^{14}~\rm M_{\odot}$), previously reported as a Swift serendipitous clusters with the highest Fe abundance ($\sim 1.3\pm 0.4$ $\rm Z_{\odot}$ within $\sim 1'.7$) and a potentially disturbed morphology. The X-ray morphology reveals a disturbed ICM with a surface brightness edge at $\sim 0'.26$ ($\sim 100$ kpc) to the west and a tail-like feature extending towards the east. The best-fit metal abundance within 1'.5 ($\sim 0.7\rm R_{500}$) is $0.61_{-0.23}^{+0.26}~\rm Z_{\odot}$. The derived central electron number density, entropy, and cooling time classify this system as a non-cool-core cluster, suggesting that merger activity has likely disrupted the possible pre-existing cool core. At larger radii ($\sim 1' - 2'$), we detect excess X-ray emission to the south, spatially aligned with a filamentary distribution of red galaxies, indicating ongoing accretion along an intracluster filament. Based on the DESI DR9 cross-matched optical clusters and photometric redshifts, we identify three nearby, lower-mass clusters that likely trace the large-scale structures, suggesting that SPT-CL~J0217-5014 is the primary node of a dynamically active environment where past mergers and anisotropic accretion along cosmic filaments have shaped the present-day ICM.</description>

      <title>ALMA-QUARKS: Few-Thousand-Year Hatching out of "Egg": The Supersonic Breakout of a Hypercompact H II Region from Its Parental Hot Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinematic evolution of hypercompact H II (HC H II) regions around young high-mass stars remains poorly understood due to complex interactions with parental environs. We present ALMA QUARKS/ATOMS 1.3 mm/3 mm observations (the highest resolution $\sim0.01$ pc) of a deeply embedded HC H II region (diameter $\sim0.015$ pc, electron density $\sim2\times10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) exhibiting a striking $\gtrsim20$ km s$^{-1}$ global redshift seen in optically thin H30$\alpha$/H40$\alpha$ recombination lines relative to its parental hot molecular core within a hub-filament system. The 1.3 mm continuum data reveal a distinct 0.1-pc arc and a perpendicular 0.04-pc tail. We propose that this morphology arises from a dynamic champagne flow: the slow expansion of HC H II region into a pre-existing filament forms the arc and associated low-velocity (few km s$^{-1}$) SiO shocks. Meanwhile, in the opposite direction ionized gas escapes along a steep density gradient traced by the tail and high-velocity (20 km s$^{-1}$) SiO emission. We reject the bow shock scenario in which ionized gas co-moves with a runaway high-mass star because shocked gas in the arc aligns with the hub velocity, contradicting the bow shock prediction. Non-LTE radiative transfer modeling further rules out infall of ionized gas as the velocity shift origin. We conclude that this exceptional HC H II region is undergoing a few-thousand-year transition phase of "hatching out of the egg": the ionized gas of HC H II region has just broken out of its parental hot core and now is flowing outward supersonically. This work highlights how anisotropic density distributions induce supersonically anisotropic ionized flows that govern HC H II region evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a population-scale catalogue of 287,872 supermassive black hole masses with high accuracy. Using a deep encoder-decoder network trained on optical spectra with reverberation-mapping (RM) based labels of 849 quasars and applied to all SDSS quasars up to $z=4$, our method achieves a root-mean-square error of $0.058$\,dex, a relative uncertainty of $\approx 14\%$, and coefficient of determination $R^{2}\approx0.91$ with respect to RM-based masses, far surpassing traditional single-line virial estimators. Notably, the high accuracy is maintained for both low ($&lt;10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$) and high ($&gt;10^{9}\,M_\odot$) mass quasars, where empirical relations are unreliable.</description>

      <title>The MALATANG survey: star formation, dense gas, and AGN feedback in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to investigate the interplay between dense molecular gas, star formation, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) NGC 1068 at sub-kiloparsec scales. We present the HCN (4-3) and HCO$^+$ (4-3) maps of NGC 1068, obtained with JCMT as part of the Mapping the dense molecular gas in the strongest star-forming galaxies (MALATANG) project, and perform spatially resolved analyses of their correlations with infrared luminosity and soft X-ray emission. Spatially resolved relations between the luminosities of infrared dust emission and dense molecular gas tracers ($L_{\rm IR}-L'_{\rm dense}$) are found to be nearly linear, without clear evidence of excess contributions from AGN activity. The spatially resolved X-ray emission ($L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$) displays a radially-dependent twofold correlation with the star formation rate (SFR), suggesting distinct gas-heating mechanisms between the galaxy center and the outer regions. A super-linear scaling is obtained in galactic center regions with SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) $&gt;$ 8.2 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$: log($L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$/erg s$^{-1}$) = 2.2 log(SFR/$M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) + 39.1. We further found a statistically significant super-linear correlation ($\beta = 1.34$ $\pm$ 0.86) between $L^{\rm gas}_{0.5-2\,\mathrm{keV}}$/SFR and HCN(4-3)/CO(1-0) intensity ratio, whereas no such trend is seen for HCO$^+$(4-3)/CO(1-0) or CO(3-2)/CO(1-0). These findings indicate that AGN feedback does not dominate star formation regulation on sub-kiloparsec scales, and that the excitation of dense gas traced by HCN (4-3) may be more directly influenced by high-energy feedback processes compared to HCO$^+$ (4-3) and CO (3-2).</description>

      <title>Long-term Mid-infrared Color Variations of Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of long-term mid-infrared (MIR) color variability in 1,718 Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) using 14-year \textit{WISE}/NEOWISE monitoring data. Through Pearson correlation analysis between photometric magnitude and color, we identify: (1) a radio-quiet NLSy1 (RQ-NLSy1) population comprising 230 bluer-when-brighter (BWB) sources, 131 redder-when-brighter (RWB) sources, and 1,323 objects showing weak or statistically insignificant color variations; and (2) a radio-loud NLSy1 (RL-NLSy1) population containing 5 BWBs, 2 RWBs, and 27 sources with weak/no color variations. Our analysis reveals that the BWB tendency strengthens significantly in galaxies with redder mean MIR colors $\rm \left&lt;W1-W2\right&gt;$ and lower starlight contamination. Furthermore, this color-change pattern demonstrates that the most bolometric luminous sources exhibit the most pronounced BWB behavior. While similar trends exist for black hole mass and Eddington ratio, bolometric luminosity appears to be the primary physical driver. Potential origins of these variations (e.g., host galaxy contribution, accretion disk variability, and dust reprocessing) are discussed. We conclude that temperature-dependent dust reprocessing dominates the observed BWB, RWB, and no/weak variation patterns. This interpretation may also apply to similar MIR color variations observed in other extragalactic MIR transients, such as tidal disruption events, ambiguous nuclear transients, and changing-look AGNs. In addition, we find no significant difference in long-term MIR color variations between RL-NLSy1s and RQ-NLSy1s, however, RL-NLSy1s show significantly greater dispersion in intrinsic variability amplitude compared to RQ-NLSy1s due to jet-induced complexity, where non-thermal synchrotron emission from relativistic jets obscures thermal dust signatures.</description>

      <title>The critical role of clumping in line-driven disc winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising mechanism for powering disc winds from accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, overionization reduces line opacity and quenches the line force, which suppresses outflows. Here, we show that small-scale clumping can resolve this problem. Adopting the microclumping approximation, our new simulations demonstrate that even modest volume filling factors ($f_V \sim 0.1-0.01$) can dramatically increase the wind mass-loss rate by lowering its ionization state -- raising $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}$ and yielding $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-4}$ for such modest filling factors. Clumpy wind models produce the UV resonance lines that are absent from smooth wind models. They can also reprocess a significant fraction of the disc luminosity and thus dramatically modify the broad-band optical/UV SED. Given that theory and observations indicate that disc winds are intrinsically inhomogeneous, clumping offers a physically motivated solution. Together, these results provide the first robust, self-consistent demonstration that clumping can reconcile line-driven wind theory with observations across AWDs and AGNs.</description>

      <title>Probing AGN Feedback in Dwarf Galaxies with Spatially Resolved NIR Coronal Lines from JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first spatially resolved investigation of near-infrared coronal lines in dwarf galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy. Coronal lines (CLs), which are forbidden transitions from highly ionized species with ionization potentials up to 450 eV, act as sensitive tracers of the AGN ionizing continuum and feedback processes. Across four dwarf galaxies with ionized gas outflows traced by the optical [O III] lines, we report the detection of 16 unique species of near-infrared CLs. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that photoionization from the AGN dominates the excitation of CLs. We find that the coronal line region in dwarf galaxies, traced by the various CLs, extends up to 0.5 kpc, and can constitute up to 10% of their host galaxy size. Correlations between CL luminosities and [O III] ionized gas outflow properties are consistent with a scenario in which AGN-driven outflows likely facilitate the detection of CLs and contribute to their extent. Several CLs, including [Si VI], [Si VII], and [Mg VIII], exhibit a secondary broad component (W$_{80}$ &gt; 300 km/s). If we interpret this spatially compact gas as part of an outflow, this would indicate that the outflowing gas includes a wide range of ionizations. The estimated energetics imply this highly ionized component is compact yet powerful enough to perturb gas in the central regions of the host dwarfs. These results indicate that AGN in low-mass galaxies may produce outflows capable of influencing their structure and evolution.</description>

      <title>Dust destruction by the supernova remnant forward shock in a turbulent interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. While supernova remnants (SNRs) are observed to produce up to 1 M$_\odot$ of dust, the amount of dust destroyed by the forward shock (FS) is poorly constrained, raising the question whether they are net dust producers or destroyers. Aims. We aim to estimate the dust destruction efficiency of SNR FSs in a realistically turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) during their most destructive phase, and assess dust shielding by high density filaments during this period. Methods. We run 3D turbulence simulations for different turbulent Mach numbers (0-3) and average ISM densities (1-100 cm$^{-3}$) to resemble observations of the turbulent ISM. We then set off a supernova to trace its 3D magnetohydrodynamical evolution for 10 kyr. Finally, we run post-processing simulations to study the dust transport and destruction by the SNR FS, considering gas and plasma drag, kinetic and thermal sputtering, and grain-grain collisions, and either silicate or carbonaceous dust. Results. The dust destruction rate of the FS strongly depends on the average ISM density and turbulence strength, varying between 27-92% (0.85-11.0 M$_\odot$) in the studied 10 kyr. Overall, dust is less efficiently destroyed in a low density medium (1 cm$^{-3}$, 27-57%) than in intermediate (10 cm$^{-3}$, 46-92%) and high densities (100 cm$^{-3}$, 73-87%). The FS destroys 8-34% less dust in high Mach turbulence compared to a homogeneous medium. Furthermore, carbonaceous grains are more robust (up to 21% more) than silicates. Conclusions. Filaments can partly shield dust from destruction in the first 10 kyr, however, always more than 0.85 M$_\odot$ of dust is destroyed, making most SNRs dust sinks under the conditions explored in this work. The destruction efficiency of the SNRs with less than 1 M$_\odot$ of destroyed dust has not yet plateaued so that they are most likely also net dust destroyers by the end of their lifetime.</description>

      <title>Resolving the molecular gas emission of the z~2.5-2.8 starburst galaxies SPT0125-47 and SPT 2134-50</title>

Abstract: The comoving cosmic star formation rate density peaks at z~2-3, with dusty star-forming galaxies being significant contributors to this peak. These galaxies are characterized by their high star formation rates and substantial infrared luminosities. The formation mechanisms remain an open question for these galaxies, particularly with respect to how such intense levels of star formation are triggered and maintained. We aim to resolve CO(3-2) emission toward two strongly lensed galaxies, SPT0125-47 and SPT2134-50, at z~2.5-2.8 to determine their morphology and physical properties. We used high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations of CO(3-2) emission toward both sources to investigate their properties. We performed parametric and nonparametric lens modeling using the publicly available lens modeling software PyAutoLens. We divided the CO(3-2) emission line into two bins corresponding to the red and blue portions of the emission line and nonparametrically modeled the source plane emission for both bins. We performed a basic analysis of the morphology and kinematics in the source plane using nonparametric lens modeling of the red and blue bins. We found tentative evidence of a velocity gradient across both sources and no evidence of any clumpy structure, companions, or ongoing mergers. The previously calculated high star formation rates and low depletion times of both SPT0125-47 and SPT2134-50 suggest that these galaxies are undergoing a dramatic phase in their evolution. Given the lack of evidence of ongoing interactions or mergers in our source plane models, we suggest that the intense star formation was triggered by a recent interaction and/or merger. We also consider the possibility that these galaxies might be in the process of settling into disks.</description>

      <title>Highly-ionized gas in lensed z = 6.027 Little Red Dot seen through [OIII] 88$\mu$m with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05097</link>

Abstract: Determining the physical properties of galaxies during the first billion years after the big bang is key to understanding both early galaxy evolution and how galaxies contributed to the epoch of reionization. We present deep ALMA observations of the redshifted [OIII] 88um line for the gravitationally lensed ($\mu = 11.4\pm1.9$) galaxy A383-5.1 (z=6.027) that has previously been detected in [CII] 158um. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging identified this sub-L* galaxy as a ''Little Red Dot'' (LRD). With a line luminosity of $L_{\rm [OIII]} = (1.29\pm0.24)\times10^8$ L$_\odot$ (corrected for lensing magnification) A383-5.1 is one of the faintest galaxies with combined [CII] and [OIII] detections. The ALMA data reveal no dust continuum emission, consistent with previous observations. The high line luminosity ratio of [OIII]/[CII] $\sim 14\pm5$ is consistent with A383-5.1 being low-metallicity and dust-poor. The non-detection of dust continuum in bands 6 and 8 is consistent with the high [OIII]/[CII] ratio and suggests a presence of a strong ultraviolet radiation field, which would be less affect by dust attenuation, implying that galaxies of this type could contribute significantly to the ionization of the intergalactic medium. The presence of strong ionizing field could provide an important piece of information for understanding the nature of LRDs and their role in cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Pleiades Binary Fraction Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the nearest and best studied open clusters, Pleiades is an important cornerstone of stellar astrophysics. Despite its role as reference coeval stellar population, its multiplicity properties remain vaguely determined. The combined use of Gaia DR3 multiband photometry, astrometric parameter RUWE, non-single star solutions along with available ground-based spectroscopic, high angular resolution, and polarimetric observations enable more robust constraints on the binary star population in the cluster. Several conclusions may have broader implications for other stellar populations. Twin binaries, with mass ratio close to $q\sim 1$, tend to have lower RUWE, increasing their membership selection probability, relative to $q\sim 0.5$ systems that are disfavored. The frequently observed peak in mass ratio distribution for $q\sim 1$ binaries may be partially attributed to this bias. Photometrically fitted mass ratio is underestimated for double-lined spectroscopic binaries in agreement with other authors. Differential extinction photometrically mimics stellar binarity. An area of enlarged absorption is traced by increased polarization south of the Merope star and excluded from the analysis to avoid this bias. The fraction of systems with $q&gt;0.6$ companions is measured to be $f=16.4\%^{+2.6}_{-0.6}$ for $m&gt;0.5~M_\odot$ stars, which is larger than recent Gaia-based estimates, but compatible with the pre-Gaia values for Pleiades and the field population. Binary fraction shows no steady increase with stellar mass in the 0.5 $-$ 1.2 $M_\odot$ range, while mass ratio has a bimodal distribution with a minimum near $q\sim 0.7$.</description>

      <title>Minuet: A Diffusion Autoencoder for Compact Semantic Compression of Multi-Band Galaxy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is slated to observe nearly 20 billion galaxies during its decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The rich imaging data it collects will be an invaluable resource for probing galaxy evolution across cosmic time, characterizing the host galaxies of transient phenomena, and identifying novel populations of anomalous systems. While machine learning models have shown promise for extracting galaxy features from multi-band astronomical imaging, the large dimensionality of the learned latent space presents a challenge for mechanistic interpretability studies. In this work, we present Minuet, a low-dimensional diffusion autoencoder for multi-band galaxy imaging. Minuet is trained to reconstruct 72x72-pixel $grz$ image cutouts of 6M galaxies within $z&lt;1$ from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey using only five latent dimensions. By using a diffusion model conditioned on the transformer-based autoencoder's output for image reconstruction, we achieve semantically-meaningful latent representations of galaxy images while still allowing for high-fidelity, probabilistic reconstructions. We train a series of binary classifiers on Minuet's latent features to quantify their connection to morphological labels from Galaxy Zoo, and a conditional flow to produce posterior distributions of SED-derived redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates. We further show the value of Minuet for nearest neighbor searches in the learned latent space. Minuet provides strong evidence for the low intrinsic dimensionality of galaxy imaging, and introduces a class of astrophysical models that produce highly compact representations for diverse science goals.</description>

      <title>Testing warm dark matter with kinematics of the smallest galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every dark matter halo forms with a $\rho\propto r^{-1.5}$ density cusp at its center. For warm dark matter (WDM), these prompt cusps can be massive enough to influence the kinematics of dwarf galaxies. By implementing prompt cusps in the Galacticus galaxy formation model, we show that the measured velocity dispersions of Tucana V and Triangulum II are serious outliers for dwarf galaxies arising in WDM models. For thermal-relic dark matter, the three faintest Milky Way satellites together constrain the particle mass to be $m_\chi&gt;5.8$ keV at 95 percent confidence or $m_\chi&gt;9.4$ keV at 90 percent confidence. Improved velocity dispersion measurements for these systems could greatly refine this constraint, as could identification and kinematic characterization of more such galaxies.</description>

      <title>The impact of strong feedback on galaxy group scaling relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback from active supermassive black holes alters the distribution of matter in the Universe by injecting energy in the neighbouring hot gaseous medium, which leads to ejection of gas from the halos of galaxy groups and massive galaxies. Recent cosmological simulations such as FLAMINGO calibrate their feedback model on the baryon fractions of galaxy groups to tune the efficiency of gas ejection. However, recent observational constraints from optically selected groups and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect yield lower baryon fractions than previous studies, which indicates that feedback may be more ejective than previously thought. Here we show that models involving highly ejective feedback are inconsistent with the scaling relations of local galaxy groups in the mass range $10^{13}-10^{14}M_\odot$. We study the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation in a sample of 44 galaxy groups with high-quality XMM-Newton observations. We show that highly ejective models under-predict the luminosity of galaxy groups at fixed mass at high significance ($5.7\sigma$). This conclusion is robust against selection effects and is obtained from directly measurable and minimally correlated quantities. We point out that turning observable quantities into gas fraction estimates is challenging, especially in the context of stacking large samples of heterogeneous systems. We argue that calibrating feedback models on baryon fractions is prone to systematic uncertainties and that observable scaling relations are better suited for this task.</description>

      <title>On angular dependent response to gravitational-wave signals for time-delay interferometry combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are designed for wave sources in the millihertz band with different locations and orientations.
  Time-delay interferometry (TDI) technique is an indispensable ingredient in space-borne GW detection that effectively suppresses the laser phase noise.
  The abundant TDI solutions derived in the literature also feature distinct angular-dependent sensitivities.
  Because a GW source's angular location is unknown prior to the signals' detection, a solid-angle average is often performed when analyzing the sensitivity function of a given TDI combination.
  The present study explores the angular dependence of the detector's sensitivity.
  This detail is relevant, because once the initial detection is achieved, the source's location can be extracted and used to provide information on a refined TDI combination tailored for the specific GW source.
  As the TDI technique is a post-processing algorithm, such a procedure can be implemented in practice.
  We evaluate the angular dependence of the detector's response function to the GW signals for different TDI combinations as a function of the orientation angles.
  Moreover, we classify the response functions into seven categories at the low-frequency limit, leveraging the characteristics of the underlying geometrical TDI combinations.
  By further averaging out the azimuthal angle $\phi_D$ in the detector's plane, the main features of the resulting response functions and their zenithal dependence with respect to the GW source are scrutinized.
  The findings presented in this work provide pertinent insights for ongoing space-borne detector programs.</description>

      <title>The Binary Fraction of Stars in the Dwarf Galaxy Ursa Minor via Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize multi-epoch line-of-sight velocity measurements from the Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument to estimate the binary fraction for member stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor. Our dataset comprises 670 distinct member stars, with a total of more than 2,000 observations collected over approximately one year. We constrain the binary fraction for UMi to be $0.61^{+0.16}_{-0.20}$ and $0.69^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$, with the binary orbital parameter distributions based on solar neighborhood observation from Duquennoy \&amp; Mayor (1991) and Moe \&amp; Di Stefano (2017), respectively. Furthermore, by dividing our data into two subsamples at the median metallicity, we identify that the binary fraction for the metal-rich ([Fe/H]&gt;-2.14) population is slightly higher than that of the metal-poor ([Fe/H]&lt;-2.14) population. Based on the Moe \&amp; Di Stefano model, the best-constrained binary fractions for metal-rich and metal-poor populations in UMi are $0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.24}$ and $0.48^{+0.26}_{-0.19}$, respectively. After a thorough examination, we find that this offset cannot be attributed to sample selection effects. We also divide our data into two subsamples according to their projected radius to the center of UMi, and find that the more centrally concentrated population in a denser environment has a lower binary fraction of $0.33^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$, compared with $1.00^{+0.00}_{-0.32}$ for the subsample in more outskirts.</description>

      <title>A Morpho-kinematic Study of Galactic High-ADF PNe Based on the VLT/UVES Deep Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report detailed analyses of deep, high-resolution spectra of three Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) with high abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs), Hf2-2, M1-42 and NGC6153, obtained with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) on the 8.2m Very Large Telescope (VLT). These spectra were carefully reduced, including rigorous absolute flux calibration, yielding detections of ~410-800 emission lines in each PN. Plasma diagnostics and abundance calculations were critically performed using nebular lines. In all three PNe, the electron temperatures derived using the collisionally excited lines (CELs) are higher than those yielded by the HI Balmer and Paschen jumps, while the temperatures yielded by the OII and NII optical recombination lines (ORLs) are very low, &lt;2000 K, indicating that the heavy-element ORLs probe cold nebular regions. The ORL abundances of N, O and Ne are systematically higher than the corresponding CEL values, confirming high ADFs in the three objects. Position-velocity (PV) diagrams were created, and spatio-kinematical studies show that CELs come from the outer nebular regions, while the ORL-emitting regions are close to nebular center. Additionally, the velocity indicated by CEL line-splitting decreases with ionization potential, which was not obvious in ORLs. These spatial and kinematic differences support two distinct components of ionized gas: a cold, metal-rich component and a warmer component with normal metallicity. Heavy elements are strongly enriched in the cold gas, while its H^+ fraction is low but still produces significant HI emission, affecting CEL abundance estimates.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXIX. OCS line emission: a new method for measuring the luminosity of embedded protostars in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The luminosity of embedded protostars is commonly measured via observations of the dust continuum spectral energy distribution from millimetre to infrared wavelengths. However, this method cannot be applied to embedded protostars in binary or multiple systems, where their components are usually unresolved over this extended wavelength range. We propose a new method, based on the idea that a molecule formed (mainly) on the grain surfaces only emits lines in the region where it thermally sublimates from the grain mantles, heated by the photons emitted by the embedded source. In this respect, carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is an optimal molecule, because of its low binding energy and rotational lines in the millimetre. We apply the method to the protobinary system NGC1333 IRAS4A, using ALMA high-spatial resolution ($\sim$50 au) observations of the OCS(19-18) line as part of the ALMA Large Program FAUST. We also present new quantum mechanics calculations of the OCS binding energy distribution, essential for the application of the method. We found that the two binary components, A1 and A2, have a comparable luminosity within the error bars, 7.5$\pm$2.5 and 7$\pm$1 L$_\odot$, respectively. We discuss the reliability of the estimated luminosities and the potential of this new method for measuring the luminosity of embedded protostars in binary and multiple systems.</description>

      <title>The ejection velocities of interstellar objects signpost their progenitor system architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) ejected from planetary systems carry kinematic signatures of their formation environments. The properties of these velocity distributions govern the ISOs' propagation and dynamical evolution in the Galactic potential. We investigate how planetary system architecture influences ISO production during post-gas-disc dynamical instabilities using N-body simulations. We explore the ISO production outcomes of 2461 randomly generated systems spanning total system masses of 300-800 Earth masses and multiplicities of 3-7 planets. By integrating planets embedded in a disc of test particles for 10 Myr, we find that evolving systems can be broadly divided into two distinct classes based on their initial architectures. Catastrophic systems are characterized by high multiplicities and orbitally compact configurations, or by high-mass planets in systems with large mass asymmetries. These systems eject a large fraction of their planetesimals (median 59 percent) and, depending on the ejection pathway, produce high-speed ISOs (median 2.9 km/s). In contrast, quiet systems have lower masses and multiplicities and do not undergo significant orbital rearrangement, yet still eject a median of 28 percent of planetesimals at lower velocities (median 1.6 km/s). This dichotomy points to distinct ejection pathways, involving either violent global instabilities or more gradual, diffusive processes. Overall, we find that ISO ejection velocities are typically low, on the order of a few km/s. Although ISOs subsequently experience dynamical heating as they orbit the Galaxy, their velocity distributions retain signatures of their progenitor systems' architectures and histories, underscoring the potential use of ISOs in Galactic archaeology.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and anisotropies of Galactic cosmic rays: a laboratory for magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much has been learned about Galactic cosmic rays in the past decade: On the observational side, the spectra of cosmic ray nuclei have been directly measured with high precision, resolving chemical composition up to TV rigidities. At even higher rigidities, direct detection is making contact with indirect observations from air shower arrays. A number of breaks have been found in the nuclear spectrum, which was previously thought to be a pure power law up to the knee. Data from air shower arrays also show interesting features in the arrival directions of cosmic-ray nuclei. On the theoretical side, more sophisticated models are able to explain the various spectral breaks either with transitions between different classes of sources or with changes in the transport regime. Yet, it has become clear that our ignorance of the structure of the Galactic magnetic fields, both on large and small scales, is limiting precision predictions. Turning this problem into an opportunity though, we can use Galactic cosmic rays as a laboratory for the study of Galactic magnetic fields. In this review talk, delivered at the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2025), I have summarised what is known about the spectrum and anisotropies of Galactic cosmic rays, what is not known yet and what can be learnt in the future.</description>

      <title>The position and resolvability of blended point sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we derive analytic expressions and numerical recipes for finding the effective observed position of sources close enough on sky that their Point Spread Functions (PSF), modelled as Gaussian profiles, overlap. In particularly we derive these for an elongated PSF, with a long and short axis, such as we would see from an instrument with a rectangular or elliptical mirror (relevant, for example, for the Gaia mission). We show that in this case the problem can be reduced to a one dimensional brightness profile with extrema along the line connecting the two sources, with an effective PSF width that depends on the relative orientation of the PSF and its degree of elongation. The problem can then be expressed in units of this effective width to be a function of the relative separation and light ratio alone (thus reducing to a rescaling of the un-elongated case). We derive the minimum light ratio, for a given separation and effective width, above which two sources will be resolved. We map out numerical procedures for finding the positions of these extrema across all possible cases. Finally we derive the positional offset and deviance associated with observing a fixed pair of blended sources from a variety of orientations, showing that this can be a significant source of excess noise.</description>

      <title>Line-of-sight shear in SLACS strong lenses II: validation tests with an extended sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing images are subject to shape distortions due to inhomogeneities along the line of sight. The leading order shape distortion is shear, which, if measurable, will be a complementary cosmological probe to traditional cosmic shear. In Hogg et al. (2025a), we modelled 23 of the SLACS strong lenses, studying the line-of-sight (LOS) shear under a variety of shear and mass model parametrisations. In this work, we model 27 additional lenses, extending our sample of LOS shear constraints to 45 in total. We find a mean shear magnitude of $0.11\pm 0.024$, showing that a significant fraction of the lenses modelled in this work possess LOS shears with unexpectedly large magnitudes, $|\gamma_{\rm LOS}| &gt; 0.1$, even when an octupolar distortion is included in the lens mass. We further investigate if factors such as lens and source redshift, filter and PSF, or flux and signal-to-noise ratio in the lensed arcs correlate with shear. We find that none of these features play a statistically significant role in the production of unusually large shear magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Improving Posterior Inference of Galaxy Properties with Image-Based Conditional Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating physical properties of galaxies from wide-field surveys remains a central challenge in astrophysics. While spectroscopy provides precise measurements, it is observationally expensive, and photometry discards morphological information that correlates with mass, star formation history, metallicity, and dust. We present a conditional flow matching (CFM) framework that leverages pixel-level imaging alongside photometry to improve posterior inference of galaxy properties. Using $\sim10^5$ SDSS galaxies, we compare models trained on photometry alone versus photometry plus images. The image+photometry model outperforms the photometry-only model in posterior inference and more reliably recovers known scaling relations. Morphological information also helps mitigate the dust--age degeneracy. Our results highlight the potential of integrating morphology into photometric SED fitting pipelines, opening a pathway towards more accurate and physically informed constraints on galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>Mapping Dark Matter in the Milky Way using Normalizing Flows and Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel, data-driven analysis of Galactic dynamics, using unsupervised machine learning -- in the form of density estimation with normalizing flows -- to learn the underlying phase space distribution of 6 million nearby stars from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Solving the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation, we calculate -- for the first time ever -- a model-free, unbinned estimate of the local acceleration and mass density fields within a 3 kpc sphere around the Sun. As our approach makes no assumptions about symmetries, we can test for signs of disequilibrium in our results. We find our results are consistent with equilibrium at the 10% level, limited by the current precision of the normalizing flows. After subtracting the known contribution of stars and gas from the calculated mass density, we find clear evidence for dark matter throughout the analyzed volume. Assuming spherical symmetry and averaging mass density measurements, we find a local dark matter density of $0.47\pm 0.05$ GeV/cm$^3$. We compute the dark matter density at four radii in the stellar halo and fit to a generalized NFW profile. Although the uncertainties are large, we find a profile broadly consistent with recent analyses.</description>

      <title>Sweeping the Dust Away - Correcting the Phase Space Density of the Milky Way with Unsupervised Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation relates the equilibrium phase space distribution of stars in the Milky Way to the Galaxy's gravitational potential. However, observations of stellar populations are biased by extinction from foreground dust, which complicates measurements of the potential in the disk and towards the Galactic center. Using the kinematics of Red Clump and Red Branch stars in Gaia DR3, we use machine learning to simultaneously estimate both the unbiased stellar phase space density and the gravitational potential. The unbiased phase space density is obtained through a learned "dust efficiency factor" -- an observational selection function that accounts for dust extinction. The potential and the dust efficiency are parameterized by fully connected neural networks and are completely data driven. We validate the dust efficiency using a recent three-dimensional dust map in this work, and examine the potential in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>A Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE). XIX. The discovery of a spectacular 230 kpc Halpha tail following NGC 4569 in the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Galaxies fly inside galaxy clusters and ram pressure by the ICM can remove a large amount of the ISM from the galaxy, and deposit the gas in the ICM. The ISM decoupled from the host galaxy leaves a long trail following the moving galaxy. Such long trails track the galaxy motion and can be detected with sensitive data in Halpha.
  Aims. We study the Halpha tail trailing NGC 4569 in the Virgo cluster.
  Methods. The initial discovery was made with the deep Halpha imaging data with CFHT, from the VESTIGE project. The follow-up spectroscopic observations were made with APO/DIS, MMT/Binospec and CFHT/SITELLE.
  Results. Besides the known 80 kpc Halpha tail downstream of NGC 4569, the deep Halpha imaging data allow the Halpha tail detected to at least 230 kpc from the galaxy. More importantly, the Halpha clumps implied from the imaging data are confirmed with the spectroscopic data. The Halpha clumps show a smooth radial velocity gradient across about 1300 km/s, eventually reaching the velocity of the cluster.
  Conclusions. This discovery, for the first time, demonstrates the full deceleration process of the stripped ISM. This discovery also showcases the potential with wide-field Halpha survey on galaxy clusters to discover intracluster optical emission-line clouds originated from cluster galaxies. These clouds provide kinematic tracers to the infall history of cluster galaxies and the turbulence in the ICM. They are also excellent multi-phase objects to study the classical cloud crushing problem and other relevant important physical processes.</description>

      <title>Memoirs of mass accretion: probing the edges of intracluster light in simulated galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffuse starlight extending throughout massive galaxy clusters, known as intracluster light (ICL), has the potential to be read as a memoir of mass accretion: informative, individual, and yet imperfect. Here, we combine dark matter-only zoom-in simulations from the Symphony suite with the Nimbus "star-tagging" model of the stellar halo to assess how much information about the mass assembly of an individual galaxy cluster can be gleaned from idealized measurements of ICL outskirts. We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar profile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar "splashback" radii -- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete merger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We find that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time ago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser degree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters that have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time. We use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the MultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive to mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo concentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer of relaxedness, x_off. While our analysis is idealized, the relevant ICL features are potentially detectable in next-generation deep imaging of nearby clusters. This work highlights the promise of ICL measurements and lays the groundwork for more detailed forecasts of their power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present measurements of stellar population properties of a newly discovered spectroscopically confirmed $z=11.10^{+0.11}_{-0.26}$, gravitationally lensed galaxy, using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging. The arc is highly magnified by the Bullet Cluster (magnification factor ${\mu}=14.0^{+6.2}_{-0.3}$. It contains three star-forming components of which one is barely resolved and two are unresolved, giving intrinsic sizes of $\lesssim 10pc$. The clumps also contain ~50% of the total stellar mass. The galaxy formed the majority of its stars ~150Myr ago (by z~14). The spectrum shows a pronounced damping wing, typical for galaxies deep in the reionisation era and indicating a neutral IGM at this line of sight. The intrinsic luminosity of the galaxy is $0.086^{+0.008}_{-0.030} L^*$ (with $L^*$ being the characteristic luminosity for this redshift), making it the lowest luminosity spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at $z&gt;10$ discovered to date.</description>

      <title>Vz-GAL: Probing Cold Molecular Gas in Dusty Star-forming Galaxies at z=1-6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results of Vz-GAL, a high-redshift CO(J=1-0) large survey with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, targeting 92 Herschel-selected, infrared-luminous, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at redshifts 1 to 6. These sources are selected based on having redshifts and mid/high-J CO transitions from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array z-GAL survey. We successfully detect CO(J=1-0) emission in 90/92 galaxies at the expected positions and redshifts, including 9 tentative detections at $2\sigma - 3\sigma$ significance, and CO(J=2-1) emission in 10 of these galaxies. The CO(J=1-0) luminosities suggest apparent gas masses in the range $\mu {M}_{\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \times {10}^{11}~(\alpha_{CO}/{4.0})~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which implies gas depletion times of $(50-600)$ Myr. These timescales show similar spread as local ULIRGs, suggesting a self-regulatory mechanism that maintains a consistent SFR per unit gas mass in starbursts across redshifts. To quantify the contribution of "excitation correction" factors to gas mass estimates, we calculate median CO line brightness temperature ratios of $r_{21}=0.88\pm0.25$, $r_{31}=0.61\pm0.22$, $r_{41}=0.49\pm0.15$, $r_{51}=0.47\pm0.13$, and $r_{61}=0.28\pm0.13$. Accounting for these corrections results in a reduced scatter in 'gas mass$-$star formation rate' relations. We also find a median log(${L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{[CI]}(^{3}P_1 - ^{3}P_0)}/{L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO}(J=1-0)})=-0.71\pm0.12$ for a subsample of 23 sources, consistent with the ratios derived for local star-forming galaxies. Together, our findings are in agreement with common conditions in the cold gas reservoirs among star-forming galaxies over a broad range in star formation modes, efficiencies, and scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The center of the Milky Way is a unique environment of great astrophysical interest, but its extreme crowding and extinction make it difficult to study. The GALACTICNUCLEUS survey, a high-angular-resolution near-infrared imaging program, was designed to overcome these challenges. We present the methodology and first results of its second data release, which includes major improvements in reduction, calibration, and analysis, providing deeper photometry, improved astrometry, and high-precision proper motions across the Nuclear Stellar Disk. Observations were obtained with VLT/HAWK-I in two epochs separated by seven years, using speckle holography and a ground-layer adaptive optics system. Proper motions were derived both relative, by aligning epochs within the survey, and absolute, by tying to the Gaia reference frame. The new release achieves photometry about one magnitude deeper and astrometry about ten times more precise than the first release. Proper motions reach an accuracy of about 0.5 mas/yr relative to Gaia. In the Arches field, our clustering analysis recovers the cluster with mean velocities consistent with HST-based results. The second data release of the GALACTICNUCLEUS survey provides the most precise ground-based proper motion catalogs of the Galactic Center to date, enabling studies of the Nuclear Stellar Disk, young star kinematics, and new stellar cluster detections.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Spin Alignment with Tidal Fields in the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy spins are correlated with the surrounding tidal field, reflecting how angular momentum is acquired during structure formation. We present a new observational test of this prediction using the final data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory integral field spectroscopy survey, which enables direct spin measurements from stellar and ionized gas kinematics for a sample of 6325 disk galaxies. We utilize the three-dimensional tidal field reconstructed from the galaxy distribution, providing a physically defined reference frame for the analysis. We find that massive galaxies tend to align their spins parallel to the intermediate axis of the tidal field, consistent with the prediction of the TTT, while also showing a tendency to align perpendicular to the major axis. In contrast, low-mass galaxies exhibit the opposite trend, with a transition mass of $M_* \sim 10^{10}-10^{10.5}M_\odot$. No significant alignment is detected with respect to the minor axis across all stellar masses. We further examine the dependence on morphology and environment, finding that S0 and early-type spiral galaxies exhibit stronger alignment signals than late-type spirals. The alignment trend becomes particularly pronounced in regions of high tidal anisotropy and high overdensity. A mutual information analysis identifies these environmental factors as the dominant drivers of the observed trends. Our results provide new empirical evidence for the connection between galaxy spins and the cosmic tidal field.</description>

      <title>VENUS: When Red meets Blue -- A multiply imaged Little Red Dot with an apparent blue companion behind the galaxy cluster Abell 383</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a doubly-imaged Little Red Dot (LRD) candidate behind the galaxy cluster Abell 383, which we dub A383-LRD1. Initially classified as a dropout galaxy in HST imaging with several ground-based emission line detections placing it at $z_{\mathrm{spec}}=6.027$, new JWST/NIRCam observations taken as part of the cycle 4 VENUS survey now reveal that the source consists of two underlying components: A red point-source with a V-shaped SED consistent with LRD selection criteria, and a nearby ($\sim 380$ pc) compact blue companion which was the main contributor to the previous rest-frame UV detections. Based on lensing symmetry and its SED, the LRD appears to lie at a similar redshift as well. The magnification of the two images of A383-LRD1 is $\mu_{\mathrm{A}}=16.2\pm1.2$ and $\mu_\mathrm{B}=9.0\pm0.6$, respectively, and the predicted time delay between them is $\Delta t_{\mathrm{grav}}=5.20\pm0.14$ yr ($\sim0.7$ yr in the rest-frame). After correcting for the lensing magnification, we derive an absolute magnitude of $M_{\mathrm{UV,LRD}}=-16.8\pm 0.3$ for the LRD, and $M_{\mathrm{UV,BC}}=-18.2\pm 0.2$ for the blue companion. We perform SED fits to both components, revealing the LRD to be best fitted with a black hole star (BH*) model and a substantial host galaxy, and the blue companion with an extremely young, emission-line dominated star-forming nebula. A383-LRD1 represents the second known multiply-imaged LRD detected to date, following A2744-QSO1, and to our knowledge, the first LRD system with a confirmed detection of [C $_{II}$]$\lambda158 \ \mu$m emission from ALMA observations. Thanks to lensing magnification, this system opens a unique door to study the relation between a LRD, its host galaxy, and its environment, and represents a prime candidate for deep JWST spectroscopy and high-resolution ALMA follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>An Ancient Descendant of the First Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has revealed unexpectedly bright galaxies in the first 500 Myr after the Big Bang. Their overabundance suggests that they are preferentially observed during burst phases, where their star formation rates increase dramatically. In cosmological simulations, such bursts transition into short ($\approx 40$ Myr) periods without star formation or naps. Using JWST/NIRCam medium-band observations, we report the discovery of the galaxy CANUCS-A370-2228423 ($z = 5.95 \pm 0.06$, $\log(M_\ast/M_{\odot}) = 9.14 \pm 0.09$), dubbed The Sleeper. Its star formation history indicates rapid assembly in the first 300 Myr ($z \gtrsim 14$), where it formed a $\log(M_\ast/M_{\odot}) = 8.7^{+0.3}_{-0.4}\ M_{\odot}$ progenitor, comparable in stellar mass to the few spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at those redshifts. Unexpectedly, this is followed by several hundred million years of suppressed star formation, in stark contrast to nappers. This results in a remarkably strong hydrogen Balmer break, exceeding that of any galaxy observed within the first billion years by a factor of $\approx 3$. Furthermore, Sleeper-like systems are overabundant in the observed survey volume compared to theory, as the probability of finding such galaxies in simulations is $&lt; 0.2\%$. The discovery of The Sleeper therefore disrupts the current narrative that all luminous galaxies in the first few hundred million years grow into massive descendants. Instead it presents an alternative evolutionary pathway in which these unusually luminous galaxies fade into inefficient dwarfs after an early starburst, revealing greater diversity in the first stages of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Cosmic Evolution of the Cool Circumgalactic Medium of Luminous Red Galaxies with DESI Year 1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) of massive galaxies and their cosmic evolution. By using the year 1 dataset of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and QSOs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey, we construct a sample of approximately 600,000 galaxy-quasar pairs and measure the radial distribution and kinematics of the cool gas traced by Mg II absorption lines as a function of galaxy properties from redshift 0.4 to redshift 1.2. Our results show that the covering fraction of the cool gas around LRGs increases with redshift, following a trend similar to the global evolution of galaxy star formation rate. At small radii (&lt; 0.3rvir), the covering fraction anti-correlates with stellar mass, suggesting that mass-dependent processes suppress the cool gas content in the inner region. In addition, we measure the gas dispersion by modeling the velocity distribution of absorbers with a narrow and a broad components -- sigma_n ~ 160 and sigma_b ~ 380 km/s -- and quantify their relative contributions. The results show that the broad component becomes more prominent in the outer region, and its relative importance in the central region grows with increasing stellar mass. Finally, we discuss possible origins of the cool gas around massive galaxies, including the contribution of satellite galaxies and the precipitation scenario.</description>

      <title>Modeling APOKASC-3 red giants: I. The first dredge-up and red giant branch bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on two key diagnostics of stellar physics in red giant branch (RGB) stars: the first dredge-up (FDU) of nuclear processed material and the location of the red giant branch bump (RGBB). We compare asteroseismic and spectroscopic APOKASC-3 data with theoretical MESA models. Our FDU predictions have similar mass and metallicity trends to the data, but the observed magnitude of the change in $[{\rm C}/{\rm N}]$ in data is smaller than theoretical predictions by $[0.1615 \pm 0.0760 \,({\rm obs}) \pm 0.0108 \,({\rm sys})] \,{\rm dex}$. These results are insensitive to the input physics, but they are at a level consistent with systematic uncertainties in the abundance measurements. When we include observed trends in birth $[{\rm C}/{\rm Fe}]$ and $[{\rm N}/{\rm Fe}]$ in our models, it modestly increases the metallicity dependent difference relative to the data. We find a well-defined empirical RGBB locus: $\log g = 2.6604 - 0.1832 (M/{\rm M}_\odot-1) + 0.2824 \,[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}]$. Our model RGBB loci have mass and composition trends that mirror the data, but we find that the observed RGBB is $[0.1509 \pm 0.0017 \,({\rm obs}) \pm 0.0182 \,({\rm sys})] \,{\rm dex}$ higher than predicted across the board, similar to prior literature results. We find that envelope undershooting, proposed solution to reconcile theory with data, increases ${\rm Li}$ destruction during the FDU at higher metallicities, creating tension with depletion observed in GALAH data. We propose ${\rm Li}$ in the FDU as a sensitive test of the RGBB and FDU, and discuss other potential solutions.</description>

      <title>Line-of-sight shear in SLACS strong lenses I: shear and mass model parametrisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneities along the line of sight in strong gravitational lensing distort the images produced, in an effect called shear. If measurable, this shear may provide independent constraints on cosmological parameters, complementary to traditional cosmic shear. We model 23 strong gravitational lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) catalogue with the aim of measuring the line-of-sight (LOS) shear for the first time. We use the 'minimal model' for the LOS shear, which has been shown to be theoretically safe from degeneracies with lens model parameters, a finding which has been confirmed using mock data. We use the dolphin automated modelling pipeline, which uses the lenstronomy software as a modelling engine, to model our selected lenses. Across the 23 lenses, we measure the LOS shear with a mean magnitude of $0.056 \pm 0.013$. Neglecting the post-Born correction to the potential of the main deflector due to foreground shear leads to a propagation of degeneracies in the LOS shear measurement with other lens model parameters, and the inclusion of an octupole moment in the lens mass profile does not lead to shear measurements that are in better agreement with the expectations from weak lensing.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Coma Cluster Structure: From the Core to the Hubble Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Coma cluster, embedded in a cosmic filament, is a complex and dynamically active structure in the local Universe. Applying a density-based member selection (\texttt{dbscan}) to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify its virialised core and zero-velocity boundary. Cross-correlating with the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalogue enables a velocity-distance analysis, incorporating radial infall models and redshift-independent distance estimators. This reveals, for the first time, the Hubble flow surrounding Coma, a first step to investigate the entanglement between Coma's dark matter halo and the dark energy driving the expansion of the surroundings. The distance to the Coma centre is determined as $(69.959 \pm 0.012) \, h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$. From \texttt{dbscan}, we infer a virial radius of $r_{\rm vir} = \left(1.95 \pm 0.12\right)\,h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$ and a turnaround of $r_{\rm ta} \geq 4.87~{h}^{-1}~\mbox{Mpc}$. Combining the SDSS redshifts with the CF4 distances, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = (73.10 \pm 0.92)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}/\mbox{Mpc}$, which varies between $[72, 80]$~km/s/Mpc with different calibrations for the distance moduli. Mass estimates via caustics, the virial theorem and the Hubble-flow method yield $M = [0.77, 2.0] \times 10^{15}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$, consistent with prior mass estimates. However, our mass estimates are based on fewer model assumptions in the member selection and require fewer members to attain the same precision. Our systematic approach maps the structure of Coma into the local Hubble flow and shows the degeneracies between dynamical parameters such as the Hubble constant, the virial radius, and the total mass.</description>

      <title>Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars: spectral library, metallicities and abundances of $\alpha$ and Fe-peak elements of the third version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate determination of chemical abundances in stars plays a pivotal role in understanding stellar structure and evolution, nucleosynthesis, and the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. Benchmark stars with precise and accurate atmospheric parameters and abundances are indispensable for calibrating spectroscopic surveys and testing stellar atmosphere models. This study focuses on the compilation of high-quality spectra and the determination of LTE chemical abundances of iron-peak and $\alpha$ elements for the third version of the Gaia FGK Benchmark Stars (GBSv3). We compiled spectra of the GBSv3 from public archives and complemented these with our own observations. We use fundamental atmospheric parameters from Soubiran et al. 2024 to derive the chemical abundances and perform a spectroscopic analysis using the public code iSpec. We compile a homogeneous spectral library of high-resolution (42,000) and high signal-to-noise ($&gt;100$) normalised spectra for 202 stars: including the 192 GBSv3, 9 stars with indirect measurement of the angular diameter from previous GBS versions, and the Sun. Using four radiative transfer codes, we derive chemical abundances of 13 chemical species (Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Si I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Co I, Ni I). We make an in-depth study of several sources of error. The GBSv3 contributes to the legacy samples of spectroscopic reference stars with improved statistics and homogeneity. This work offers the community a homogeneous spectral library and robust reference abundances for iron-peak and $\alpha$ elements, supported by an extensive analysis of the associated uncertainties.</description>
