      <title>Sketchable infinity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sketch is a category equipped with specified collections of cones and cocones. Its models are functors to the category of sets that send the distinguished cones and cocones to limit cones and colimit cocones, respectively. Sketches provide a categorical formalization of theories, interpreting logical operations in terms of limits and colimits. Gabriel and Ulmer showed that categories of models of sketches involving only cones (called limit sketches) are precisely the locally presentable categories, while Lair extended this correspondence to sketches including both cones and cocones, thereby characterizing accessible categories.
  In this article, we discuss a homotopy-coherent generalization of sketches in the context of $\infty$-categories and prove that presentable $\infty$-categories are the $\infty$-categories of models of limit sketches, whereas accessible $\infty$-categories arise as the $\infty$-categories of models of arbitrary sketches. As illustrations, we make the corresponding sketches explicit for a wide range of $\infty$-categories, including complete Segal spaces, $\infty$-operads, $A_\infty$-algebras, $E_\infty$-algebras, spectra, and higher sheaves.</description>

      <title>On Strict Higher C*-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.09339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide definitions for strict involutive higher categories (a vertical categorification of dagger categories), strict higher C*-categories and higher Fell bundles (over arbitrary involutive higher topological categories). We put forward a proposal for a relaxed form of the exchange property for higher (C*)-categories that avoids the Eckmann-Hilton collapse and hence allows the construction of explicit non-trivial "non-commutative" examples arising from the study of hypermatrices and hyper-C*-algebras, here defined. Alternatives to the usual globular and cubical settings for strict higher categories are also explored. Applications of these non-commutative higher C*-categories are envisaged in the study of morphisms in non-commutative geometry and in the algebraic formulation of relational quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Exotic quantum subgroups and extensions of affine Lie algebra VOAs -- part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prototypical rational vertex operator algebras are associated to affine Lie algebras at positive integer level k. They correspond physically to the Wess-Zumino-Witten theories, and their representation theory can be captured by quantum groups at roots of unity. One would like to identify the full (bulk) conformal field theories whose chiral halves are those VOAs. Mathematically, these correspond to their module categories. Until now, this has been done only for sl(2) (famously, the A-D-E classification of Cappelli-Itzykson-Zuber) and sl(3). The problem reduces to knowing the possible extensions of those VOAs, and the tensor equivalences between those extensions. Recent progress puts the tensor equivalences in good control, especially for sl(n). This paper focuses on the extensions. We prove that, for any simple g, there is a bound K(g) growing like rank$(g)^3$, such that for any level k&gt;K(g), the only extensions are generic (i.e. simple-current ones). We use that bound to find all extensions for g=sl(4) and sl(5), at all levels, as well as all g=sl(n) at levels $k\le 5$ (only those for k=1 had been classified before). In the sequel to this paper, we find all extensions for all simple g of rank &lt;7 (and the corresponding low level classifications).</description>

      <title>Simplicial lists in operad theory I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a category $\mathsf{List}$ whose objects are sets and morphisms are mappings which assign to an element in the domain an ordered sequence (list) of elements in the codomain. We introduce and study a category of simplicial objects $\mathsf{slist}$ whose objects are functors $\Delta^{op} \to \mathsf{List}$, which we call simplicial lists, and morphisms are natural transformations which have functions as components. We demonstrate that $\mathsf{sList}$ supports the combinatorics of (non-symmetric) operads by constructing a fully-faithful nerve functor $N^l : \mathsf{Operad} \to \mathsf{sList}$ from the category of operads. This leads to a reasonable model for the theory of non-symmetric $\infty$-operads.
  We also demonstrate that $\mathsf{sList}$ has the structure of a presheaf category. In particular, we study a subcategory $\mathsf{sList}_{\text{op}}$ of operadic simplicial lists, in which the nerve functor takes values. The latter category is also a presheaf category over a base whose objects may be interpreted as levelled trees. We construct a coherent nerve functor which outputs an $\infty$-operad for each operad enriched in Kan complexes. We also define homology groups of simplicial lists and study first properties.</description>

      <title>Categorification of modules and construction of schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use categorification of module structures to study algebraic geometry over symmetric monoidal categories. This brings together the relative algebraic geometry over symmetric monoidal categories developed by To\"{e}n and Vaqui\'{e}, along with the theory of module categories over monoidal categories. We obtain schemes over a datum $(\mathcal C,\mathcal M)$, where $(\mathcal C,\otimes,1)$ is a symmetric monoidal category and $\mathcal M$ is a module category over $\mathcal C$. One of our main tools is using the datum $(\mathcal C,\mathcal M)$ to give a Grothendieck topology on the category of affine schemes over $(\mathcal C,\otimes,1)$ that we call the ``spectral $\mathcal M$-topology.'' This consists of ``fpqc $\mathcal M$-coverings'' with certain special properties. We also give a counterpart for a construction of Connes and Consani by presenting a notion of scheme over a composite datum consisting of a $\mathcal C$-module category $\mathcal M$ and the category of commutative monoids with an absorbing element.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory for Non-full Commutative C*-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the spectral theory of commutative C*-categories to the non full-case, introducing a suitable notion of spectral spaceoid provinding a duality between a category of "non-trivial" *-functors of non-full commutative C*-categories and a category of Takahashi morphisms of "non-full spaceoids" (here defined). As a byproduct we obtain a spectral theorem for a non-full generalization of imprimitivity Hilbert C*-bimodules over commutative unital C*-algebras via continuous sections vanishing at infinity of a Hilbert C*-line-bundle over the graph of a homeomorphism between open subsets of the corresponding Gel'fand spectra of the C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Distributing Retractions, Weak Distributive Laws and Applications to Monads of Hyperspaces, Continuous Valuations and Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two monads $S$, $T$ on a category where idempotents split, and a weak distributive law between them, one can build a combined monad $U$. Making explicit what this monad $U$ is requires some effort. When we already have an idea what $U$ should be, we show how to recognize that $U$ is indeed the combined monad obtained from $S$ and $T$: it suffices to exhibit what we call a distributing retraction of $ST$ onto $U$. We show that distributing retractions and weak distributive laws are in one-to-one correspondence, in a 2-categorical setting. We give three applications, where $S$ is the Smyth, Hoare or Plotkin hyperspace monad, $T$ is a monad of continuous valuations, and $U$ is a monad of previsions or of forks, depending on the case. As a byproduct, this allows us to describe the algebras of monads of superlinear, resp. sublinear previsions. In the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, the Plotkin hyperspace monad is sometimes known as the Vietoris monad, the monad of probability valuations coincides with the Radon monad, and we infer that the associated combined monad is the monad of normalized forks.</description>
