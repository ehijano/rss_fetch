      <title>Sofic actions on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of soficity for actions on graphs and obtain new applications to the study of sofic groups. We establish various examples, stability and permanence properties of sofic actions on graphs, in particular soficity is preserved by taking several natural graph join operations. We prove that an action of a group on its Cayley graph is sofic if and only if the group is sofic. We show that arbitrary actions of amenable groups on graphs are sofic. Using a graph theoretic result of E. Hrushovski, we also show that arbitrary actions of free groups on graphs are sofic. Notably we show that arbitrary actions of sofic groups on graphs, with amenable stabilizers, are sofic, settling completely an open problem from \cite{gao2024soficity}. We also show that soficity is preserved by taking limits under a natural Gromov-Hausdorff topology, generalizing prior work of the first author \cite{gao2024actionslerfgroupssets}. Our work sheds light on a family of groups called graph wreath products, simultaneously generalizing graph products and generalized wreath products. Extending various prior results in this direction including soficity of generalized wreath products \cite{gao2024soficity}, B. Hayes and A. Sale \cite{HayesSale}, and soficity of graph products \cite{CHR, charlesworth2021matrix}, we show that graph wreath products are sofic if the action and acting groups are sofic. These results provide several new examples of sofic groups in a systematic manner.</description>

      <title>Chirality and non-real elements in $G_2(q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we determine the non-real elements--the ones that are not conjugate to their inverses--in the group $G = G_2(q)$ when $char(F_q)\neq 2,3$. We use this to show that this group is chiral; that is, there is a word w such that $w(G)\neq w(G)^{-1}$. We also show that most classical finite simple groups are achiral</description>

      <title>Uniform rank metric stability of Lie algebras, Lie groups and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study uniform stability of discrete groups, Lie groups and Lie algebras in the rank metric, and the connections between uniform stability of these objects. We prove that semisimple Lie algebras are far from being flexibly $\mathbb{C}$-stable, and that semisimple Lie groups and lattices in semisimple Lie groups of higher rank are not strictly $\mathbb{C}$-stable. Furthermore, we prove that free groups are not uniformly flexibly $F$-stable over any field $F$.</description>

      <title>Weyl-invariants of totally disconnected locally compact groups acting cocompactly on buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several instances, the invariants of compactly generated totally disconnected locally compact groups acting on locally finite buildings can be conveniently described via invariants of the Coxeter group representing the type of the building. For certain totally disconnected locally compact groups acting on buildings, we establish and collect several results concerning, for example, the rational discrete cohomological dimension (cf. Thm. A), the flat-rank (cf. Thm. C) and the number of ends (cf. Cor. K). Moreover, for an arbitrary compactly generated totally disconnected locally compact group, we express the number of ends in terms of its cohomology groups (cf. Thm. J). Furthermore, generalising a result of F. Haglund and F. Paulin, we prove that visual graph of groups decompositions of a Coxeter group $(W,S)$ can be used to construct trees from buildings of type $(W,S)$. We exploit the latter result to show that all $\sigma$-compact totally disconnected locally compact groups acting chamber-transitively on buildings can be decomposed accordingly to any visual graph of groups decomposition of the type $(W,S)$ (cf. Thm. F and Cor. G).</description>

      <title>Infinite families of triangle presentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A triangle presentation is a combinatorial datum that encodes the action of a group on a $2$-dimensional triangle complex with prescribed links, which is simply transitive on the vertices. We provide the first infinite family of triangle presentations that give rise to lattices in exotic buildings of type $\widetilde{\text{A}_2}$ of arbitrarily large order. Our method also gives rise to infinite families of triangle presentations for other link types, such as opposition complexes in Desarguesian projective planes.</description>

      <title>On quadratic rational Frobenius groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and, for a given complex character $\chi$ of $G$, let ${\mathbb{Q}}(\chi)$ denote the field extension of ${\mathbb{Q}}$ obtained by adjoining all the values $\chi(g)$, for $g\in G$. The group $G$ is called quadratic rational if, for every irreducible complex character $\chi\in{\rm{Irr}}(G)$, the field ${\mathbb{Q}}(\chi)$ is an extension of ${\mathbb{Q}}$ of degree at most $2$. Quadratic rational groups have a nice characterization in terms of the structure of the group of central units in their integral group ring, and in fact they generalize the well-known concept of a cut group (i.e., a finite group whose integral group ring has a finite group of central units). In this paper we classify the Frobenius groups that are quadratic rational, a crucial step in the project of describing the Gruenberg-Kegel graphs associated to quadratic rational groups. It turns out that every Frobenius quadratic rational group is uniformly semi-rational, i.e., it satisfies the following property: all the generators of any cyclic subgroup of $G$ lie in at most two conjugacy classes of $G$, and these classes are permuted by the same element of the Galois group ${\rm{Gal}}({\mathbb{Q}}_{|G|}/{\mathbb{Q}})$ (in general, every cut group is uniformly semi-rational, and every uniformly semi-rational group is quadratic rational). We will also see that the class of groups here considered coincides with the one studied in [4], thus the main result of this paper also completes the analysis carried out in [4].</description>

      <title>What makes math problems hard for reinforcement learning: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a long-standing conjecture from combinatorial group theory, we explore, from multiple angles, the challenges of finding rare instances carrying disproportionately high rewards. Based on lessons learned in the mathematical context defined by the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, we propose algorithmic improvements that can be relevant in other domains with ultra-sparse reward problems. Although our case study can be formulated as a game, its shortest winning sequences are potentially $10^6$ or $10^9$ times longer than those encountered in chess. In the process of our study, we demonstrate that one of the potential counterexamples due to Akbulut and Kirby, whose status escaped direct mathematical methods for 39 years, is stably AC-trivial.</description>
