      <title>Path integral measures and diffeomorphism invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much like the action, diffeomorphism invariance can be used to fix the form of the path integral measure in quantum gravity. Moreover, since there is a redundancy between what constitutes "the action" and what constitutes "the measure" one can always pick a minimal form of the latter. However, the authors of the recent papers arXiv:2412.14108, arXiv:2412.10194 have advocated a form of the path integral measure for quantum gravity, proposed long ago by Fradkin and Vilkovisky, that is not invariant. This is easily seen since it depends explicitly on the $g^{00}$ component of the inverse metric without being contracted to form a scalar. An equally non-invariant measure was proposed in arXiv:2009.00728. As noted by their proponents, when these measures are used, certain divergences that typically appear are absent. However, the divergences that remain with the proposed measures are, unsurprisingly, neither diffeomorphism-invariant nor is the regulated effective action. We demonstrate this explicitly by computing the free scalar field contribution to the divergent part of the gravitational effective action using different measures and a proper-time cutoff. We support our findings with a thorough discussion of the path integral measure. In particular, we see how the contributions from the measure, obtained in a canonical setting, could be reinterpreted in a relational way compatible with diffeomorphism invariance.</description>

      <title>Extensions from within</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inclusions and extensions lie at the heart of physics and mathematics. The most relevant kind of inclusion in quantum systems is that of a von Neumann subalgebra, which is the focus of this work. We propose an object intrinsic to a given algebra that indexes its potential extensions into larger algebras. We refer to this object as a spatial Q-system, since it is inspired by the Q-system construction of Longo and others that has been used to categorify finite index inclusions for properly infinite algebras. The spatial Q-system broadens the usefulness of the Q-system by extending its applicability to the context of possibly infinite index inclusions admitting only operator valued weights rather than conditional expectations. An immediate physical motivation for the spatial Q-system arises in the form of the crossed product, which is a method for extending a given algebra by the generators of a locally compact group which acts upon it. If the group in question is not finite, the inclusion of the original algebra into its crossed product will be of infinite index and admit only an operator valued weight. Such an extension cannot be described by a standard Q-system. The spatial Q-system covers this case and, in fact, may be regarded as a far reaching generalization of the crossed product in which an algebra is extended by a collection of operators that possess a closed product structure compatible with the original algebra, but need not generate a symmetry object. We comment upon the categorical interpretation of the spatial Q-system, and describe how it may be interpreted as instantiating a protocol for approximate, or non-isometric, quantum error correction or in terms of quantum reference frames. We conclude by identifying a series of physical applications including the study of generalized symmetries, non-perturbative quantum gravity, black hole evaporation and interiors, and holography.</description>

      <title>Gravito-electromagnetism, Kerr-Schild and Weyl double copies; a unified perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two modern programs involving analogies between general relativity and electromagnetism, gravito-electromagnetism (GEM) and the classical double copy (CDC), induce electromagnetic potentials from specific classes of spacetime metrics. We demonstrate such electromagnetic potentials are gauge equivalent to Killing vectors present in the spacetime, long known themselves to be analogous to electromagnetic potentials. We utilize this perspective to relate the Type D Weyl double copy to the Kerr-Schild double copy without appealing to specific coordinates. We analyze the typical assumptions taken within Kerr-Schild double copies, emphasizing the role Killing vectors play in the construction. The basis of the GEM program utilizes comparisons of tidal tensors between GR and EM; we perform a more detailed analysis of conditions necessary for equivalent tidal tensors between the theories, and note they require the same source prescription as the classical double copy. We discuss how these Killing vector potentials relate to the Weyl double copy, in particular there must a relation between the field strength formed from the Killing vector and the Weyl tensor. We consider spacetimes admitting a Killing-Yano tensor which provide a particularly insightful example of this correspondence. This includes a broad class of spacetimes, and provides an explanation for observations regarding the splitting of the Weyl tensor noted when including sources.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering the calculation of the false vacuum decay rate at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the calculation of the decay rate at finite temperature using the saddle point approximation, we identified some inconsistencies in the calculation of the decay rate at zero temperature. These inconsistencies may impact the explanation provided by Callan and Coleman. To address these inconsistencies, we recalculated the decay rate using the shifted-bounce solution and the shot solution.</description>

      <title>Counting Black Hole Microstates at Future Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a black hole microstate counting method based on the canonical quantization of the asymptotic symmetries of a two-dimensional dilaton-gravity system at future null infinity. This dilaton-gravity is obtained from the s-wave reduction of an $N$-dimensional Einstein gravity over a generic asymptotically flat black hole solution. We show that a Cardy-type formula leads to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In this scenario, the quantized bulk degrees of freedom act as a source for the dual field theory operators living at future null infinity that are soft gravitons of the higher dimensional system, up to some gauge fixing.</description>

      <title>Three-loop chiral effective potential in the Wess-Zumino model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03358v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the three-loop contribution to the chiral effective potential in the massless Wess-Zumino model. It is shown that while the non-renormalisation theorem forbids divergent contributions to the chiral potential, in the massless case the finite corrections survive. There are only three three-loop supergraphs that give rise to a superfield effective action in the pure chiral sector. Two of them are UV finite while the third requires one-loop counterterm corresponding to the chiral field renormalisation.</description>

      <title>Holographic derivation of effective action for a dissipative neutral fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a holographic prescription for the Schwinger-Keldysh closed time path, we derive the effective action for a dissipative neutral fluid holographically described by the Einstein gravity in an asymptotic AdS spacetime. In the saddle point approximation for the dual gravity, the goal is achieved by solving the double Dirichlet problem for the linearized gravitational field living in a complexified static AdS black brane background. We adopt a partially on-shell scheme for solving the bulk dynamics, which is equivalent to ``integrating out'' the gapped modes in the boundary field theory. The boundary effective action in the fluid spacetime, identified as the partially on-shell bulk action, is computed to first order in boundary derivative and to cubic order in AdS boundary data. The boundary effective action, rewritten in the physical spacetime, successfully reproduces various results known in the framework of classical hydrodynamics, confirming our holographic derivation.</description>

      <title>Exploring non-supersymmetric black holes with multiple bubbles in five-dimensional minimal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological censorship theorem suggests that higher dimensional black holes can possess the domain of outer communication (DOC) of nontrivial topology. In this paper, we seek for a black hole coexisting with two bubbles adjacent to the horizon in five-dimensional minimal supergravity, under the assumptions of stationarity and bi-axisymmetry. For simplicity, we also assume that the spacetime is symmetric under the exchange of the two axisymmetric Killing vectors. To find the solution, we combine the inverse scattering method and the Harrison transformation, and we present the conditions for the absence of conical, orbifold and Dirac-Misner string singularities, respectively. As the result, we find that the black hole with topology of $S^3$ or $S^2\times S^1$ can be supported by two bubbles if we admit the conical singularities (deficits).</description>

      <title>Gauge/Gravity Duality: Recovering the Bulk from the Boundary using AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the holographic principle, within the context of the AdS/CFT Correspondence in the large t'Hooft limit, we investigate how the geometry of certain highly symmetric bulk spacetimes can be recovered given information of physical quantities in the dual boundary CFT. In particular, we use the existence of bulk-cone singularities (relating the location of operator insertion points of singular boundary correlation functions to the endpoints of boundary-to boundary null geodesics in the bulk spacetime) and the holographic entanglement entropy proposal (relating the entanglement entropy of certain subsystems on the boundary to the area of static minimal surfaces) to recover the bulk metric.
  Using null and zero-energy spacelike boundary-to-boundary geodesic probes, we show that for classes of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically AdS spacetimes, one can find analytic expressions for extracting the metric functions given boundary data. We find that if the spacetime admits null circular orbits, the bulk geometry can only be recovered from the boundary, down to the radius of null circular orbits. We illustrate this for various analytic and numerical boundary functions of endpoint separation of null and spacelike geodesics. We then extend our analysis to higher dimensional minimal surface probes within a class of static, planar symmetric, asymptotically AdS spacetimes. We again find analytic and perturbative expressions for the metric function in terms of the entanglement entropy of straight belt and circular disk subsystems of the boundary theory respectively. Finally, we discuss how such extractions can be generalised.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical realisation of the equation of state $p +\rho =0$ is studied. A non-pathological dynamics for the perturbations of such a system mimicking a dynamical cosmological constant (DCC) requires to go beyond the perfect fluid paradigm. It is shown that an anisotropic stress must be always present. The Hamiltonian of the system in isolation resembles the one of a Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator and linear stability requires that it cannot be positive definite. The dynamics of linear cosmological perturbations in a DCC dominated Universe is studied in detail showing that when DCC is minimally coupled to gravity no dramatic instability is present. In contrast to what happens in a cosmological constant dominated Universe, the non-relativistic matter contrast is no longer constant and exhibits an oscillator behaviour at small scales while it grows weakly at large scales. In the gravitational waves sector, at small scales, the amplitude is still suppressed as the inverse power of the scale factor while it grows logarithmically at large scales. Also the vector modes propagate, though no growing mode is found.</description>

      <title>Canonical differential equations for the elliptic two-loop five-point integral family relevant to $t\bar t +$jet production at leading colour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present differential equations (DEs) in canonical form for a family of two-loop five-point Feynman integrals containing elliptic functions and nested square roots. This is the only family for which canonical DEs were not yet available among those required to compute the two-loop leading-colour amplitude for top-pair production in association with a jet at hadron colliders. We write the DEs in terms of one-forms having (locally) simple poles at all singular points, and highlight the `duplet' structure that generalises the even/odd charge of square roots to nested roots. All transcendental functions in the DEs are expressed in closed form using complete elliptic integrals, while one-forms free of elliptic functions are given in terms of logarithms, including those with the nested roots. In addition to marking a significant step towards next-to-next-to-leading order QCD predictions for an important LHC process, this work represents the first time that a canonical basis of integrals involving elliptic functions has been obtained for a five-particle process.</description>

      <title>F-theory with hyperelliptic fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the role of hyperelliptic fibrations in F-theory. For each even integer $n$ we give a noncompact Calabi--Yau threefold $X$ containing a hyperelliptically fibered surface $Y$, such that $X$ and $Y$ are homotopy equivalent and $c_2(X) = n$. We investigate two distinct cases depending on the position of the hyperelliptic fibration. First, we propose to extend F-theory considering hyperelliptic fibrations, giving an identification between the determinant of the period matrix and the axio-dilaton. Such an identification requires that the curve satisfies an appropriate criterium which we describe. Our explicit examples have split Jacobian, preserve the same number of degrees of freedom of usual F-theory, while allowing for the appearance of a greater variety of singularities. Second, when the hyperelliptic fibration is contained in the base of a Calabi--Yau fourfold, we show that tadpole cancellation conditions are satisfied for arbitrarily large values of $c_2(X)$.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Phantom BTZ Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the thermodynamic and geometric properties of phantom BTZ black holes within the framework of noncommutative spacetime, where noncommutative effects are incorporated via Lorentzian distributions for mass and charge. The resulting modifications in spacetime geometry introduce significant alterations to horizon structures and curvature singularities. A comprehensive and comparative thermodynamic analysis is conducted, examining the differences between phantom and ordinary matter cases. This includes an investigation of Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, and stability criteria. Additionally, the black hole is analyzed as a thermodynamic heat engine, with its efficiency evaluated as a function of noncommutative parameters. Our findings highlight the profound impact of noncommutativity on the thermodynamic behavior and efficiency of phantom BTZ black holes, revealing new insights into the interplay between quantum spacetime effects and exotic field dynamics. The results indicate that noncommutative corrections not only modify the stability conditions of these black holes but also play a crucial role in governing phase transitions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that noncommutativity influences energy extraction processes, refining our understanding of black hole thermodynamics in lower-dimensional spacetimes and distinguishing the behavior of phantom and ordinary matter cases.</description>

      <title>Observables and Unconstrained Spin Tensor Dynamics in General Relativity from Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous Letter, we showed that physical scattering observables for compact spinning objects in general relativity can depend on additional degrees of freedom in the spin tensor beyond those described by the spin vector alone. In this paper, we provide further details on the physics of these additional degrees of freedom, whose commutation relations and Poisson brackets are inherited from the underlying Lorentz symmetry, and on their consequence on observables. In particular, we give the waveform at leading order in Newton's constant and up to second order in the components of the spin tensor, and the conservative impulse, boost and spin kick, exhibiting spin magnitude change, through next-to-leading-order in Newton's constant and third order in the components of the spin tensor. We provide explicit examples -- a Newtonian two-particle bound system and a certain black-hole solution in an exotic matter-coupled gravitational theory -- that exhibit these degrees of freedom and are described by our four-dimensional and worldline field theories. We also discuss connections between these degrees of freedom and dynamical worldline multipole moments. We construct effective two-body Hamiltonians, we demonstrate explicitly that the extra degrees of freedom beyond the spin vector are necessary to describe the complete dynamics, and we explicitly remove certain unphysical singularities. Moreover, we show that the previously proposed eikonal (or radial action) formula correctly captures observables derived from the classical Hamiltonian. Finally, we comment on possible descriptions of the additional degrees of freedom from the perspective of Goldstone's theorem.</description>

      <title>General form of the function $f(\mathbb{Q})$ using cylindrically static spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find an exact static solution in four dimensions to the field equations of the $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity by using a cylindrically static spacetime with two different ansatz, $\nu(r)$ and $\mu(r)$. This solution is derived without imposing any conditions on $f(\mathbb{Q})$. The black hole solution involves four constants: $c_1$, $c_2$, $c_3$, and $c_4$. Among these, $c_1$ is linked to the cosmological constant, $c_2$ to the black hole's mass, while $c_3$ and $c_4$ are responsible for the deviation of the solution from the linear form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$. We demonstrate how the analytical function $f(\mathbb{Q})$ relies on $c_3$. When $c_3$ is zero, $f(\mathbb{Q})$ becomes a constant function, leading to the non-metricity case. We investigate the singularity of this solution and show that the Kretschmann invariant has a much milder singularity compared to the non-metricity case. We produce a black hole that rotates with non-vanishing values of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $f(\mathbb{Q})$ by using a coordinate transformation. Then, we analyze the laws of thermodynamics to determine the physical characteristics of this black hole solution and demonstrate that it is locally thermodynamically stable.</description>

      <title>Gauging non-invertible symmetries on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general prescription for gauging finite non-invertible symmetries in 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian systems. Our primary example is the Rep(D$_8$) fusion category generated by the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation, which is the simplest anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry on a spin chain of qubits. We explicitly compute its lattice F-symbols and illustrate our prescription for a particular (non-maximal) gauging of this symmetry. In our gauging procedure, we introduce two qubits around each link, playing the role of "gauge fields" for the non-invertible symmetry, and impose novel Gauss's laws. Similar to the Kramers-Wannier transformation for gauging an ordinary $\mathbb{Z}_2$, our gauging can be summarized by a gauging map, which is part of a larger, continuous non-invertible cosine symmetry.</description>

      <title>On regular charged black holes in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As argued in arXiv:2104.10172, introducing a non-minimally coupled scalar field, three-dimensional Einstein gravity can be extended by infinite families of theories which admit simple analytic generalizations of the charged BTZ black hole. Depending on the gravitational couplings, the solutions may describe black holes with one or several horizons and with curvature or BTZ-like singularities. In other cases, the metric function behaves as $f(r)\overset{(r\rightarrow 0)}{\sim} \mathcal{O}(r^{2s})$ with $s\geq 1$, and the black holes are completely regular -- a feature unique to three dimensions. Regularity arises generically i.e., without requiring any fine-tuning of parameters. In this paper we show that all these theories satisfy Birkhoff theorems, so that the most general spherically-symmetric solutions are given by the corresponding static black holes. We perform a thorough characterization of the Penrose diagrams of the solutions, finding a rich structure which includes, in particular, cases which tessellate the plane and others in which the diagrams cannot be drawn in a single plane. We also study the motion of probe particles on the black holes, finding that observers falling to regular black holes reach the center after a finite proper time. Contrary to the singular cases, the particles are not torn apart by tidal forces, so they oscillate between antipodal points describing many-universe orbits. We argue that in those cases the region $r=0$ can be interpreted as a horizon with vanishing surface gravity, giving rise to generic inner-extremal regular black hole solutions. We also analyze the deep interior region of the solutions identifying the presence of Kasner eons and the conditions under which they take place. Finally, we construct new black hole solutions in the case in which infinite towers of terms are included in the action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relativistic viscous hydrodynamic description of the quark-gluon plasma by M\"uller-Israel-Stewart formulations has been very successful, but despite this success, these theories present limitations regarding well-posedness and causality. In recent years, a well-behaved version of the relativistic Navier-Stokes equations has been formulated, appearing as a promising alternative in which those limitations are absent. Using this novel theory, we perform numerical simulations of a quark-gluon plasma fluid that we use to describe experimental data on the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons from central Pb-Pb collisions measured at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Impact of the cosmic neutrino background on black hole superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the effect of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) on the superradiant phase caused by an ultralight scalar field around a spinning black hole (BH). When the scalar-neutrino Yukawa coupling $y_{\phi \nu}$ reaches values near $10^{-16}$ for astrophysical black holes (ApBHs) or $10^{-20}$ for supermassive black holes (SMBHs), thermal field theory corrections to the scalar field self-interaction drive superradiant instability, regardless of whether the scalar field constitutes dark matter. Additionally, we assess how these thermal corrections influence the scalar field mass $m_\phi$. In scenarios lacking self-interactions, these effects impose stricter constraints on the parameter space of the scalar field. Assuming two degenerate C$\nu$B neutrino masses and an inverted mass ordering, these Yukawa couplings constrain $y_{\phi \nu}$ to values as large as $10^{-6}$ for ApBHs and $10^{-11}$ for SMBHs, with comparable results for massless neutrinos or normal mass ordering. We also examine the robustness of these findings in light of astrophysical uncertainties near the BH and highlight prospects for future observational discoveries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new construction of vertex algebras using the Deligne category. This approach provides a rigorous framework for defining the so-called large $N$ vertex algebra, which has appeared in recent physics literatures. We first define the notion of a vertex algebra in a symmetric monoidal category and extend familiar constructions in ordinary vertex algebras to this broader categorical context. As an application, we consider a $\beta\gamma$ vertex algebra in the Deligne category and construct the large N vertex algebra from it. We study some simple properties of this vertex algebra and analyze a certain vertex Poisson algebra limit.</description>

      <title>Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Non-Affine Extensions of the Raychaudhuri Equation in the K-essence Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Raychaudhuri equation (RE) governs the evolution of geodesic congruences in curved spacetime. Here, we extend the classical RE by incorporating non-affine parametrization within the framework of k-essence scalar field dynamics. The non-affine parametrization introduces deviations from purely geodesic congruences (motion), allowing investigation of non-gravitational interactions and external forces. Using a DBI-type k-essence Lagrangian, we analyze the behavior of non-geodesic flow curves in the background FLRW metric, elucidating their role in cosmic acceleration and structure formation. The emergent metric formalism is used to derive a modified RE, revealing new geometric and dynamical features induced by the k-essence field. The cosmological implications of our model are studied by constraining key parameters using observational data from the PANTHEON+SHOES+BAO and Hubble datasets. Our results suggest that non-affine parametrization, coupled with k-essence dynamics, can provide a viable explanation for late-time cosmic acceleration while addressing the Hubble tension. Further, we reinterpret the modified RE as an anti-damped harmonic oscillator, revealing quantum-like effects in cosmic expansion. These results suggest a deep connection between scalar field dynamics and modified gravity, offering new perspectives on the nature of the universe's expansion history.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magic in Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum computing, non-stabilizerness -- the magic -- refers to the computational advantage of certain quantum states over classical computers and is an essential ingredient for universal quantum computation. Employing the second order stabilizer R\'enyi entropy to quantify magic, we study the production of magic states in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) via 2-to-2 scattering processes involving electrons and muons. Considering all 60 stabilizer initial states, which have zero magic, the angular dependence of magic produced in the final states is governed by only a few patterns, both in the non-relativistic and the ultra-relativistic limits. Some processes, such as the low-energy $e^-\mu^-\to e^-\mu^-$ and Bhabha scattering $e^-e^+\to e^-e^+$, do not generate magic at all. In most cases the largest magic generated is significantly less than the maximal possible value of $\log (16/7) \approx 0.827$. The only instance where QED is able to generate maximal magic is the low-energy $\mu^-\mu^+\to e^-e^+$, in the limit $m_e/m_\mu \to 0$, which is well approximated in nature. Our results suggest QED, although capable of producing maximally entangled states easily, may not be an efficient mechanism for generating quantum advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity is identical to curved spacetime. It is manifested by the curvature of a Riemannian spacetime in general relativity but by torsion or non-metricity in teleparallel gravity models. In this paper, we apply these multiple options to the spacetime perturbation theory and seek the possibilities of representing the gravitation of the background and that of the perturbation in separate ways. We show that the perturbation around a Riemannian background can be described by torsion or non-metricity, so that we have teleparallel like actions for the perturbation.</description>

      <title>On covariant and canonical Hamiltonian formalisms: Weakly Isolated Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian description of classical gauge theories is a well studied subject. The two best known approaches, namely the covariant and canonical Hamiltonian formalisms have received a lot of attention in the literature. However, in our opinion, a full understanding of the relation between them is not available, specially for gauge theories that are defined over regions with boundaries. Here we consider this issue, for spacetimes with isolated horizons as inner boundaries (representing black holes in equilibrium), and assess whether their corresponding descriptions can be seen as equivalent. First, we shall review and reanalyze both formalisms from anew, focusing on some subtleties not considered before. Next we show that, if we compare them at face value, there are subtle differences between both formalisms, for instance in the derivation of horizon energy, a physical observable of the theory, as well as in the number of boundary degrees of freedom. At first sight, it seems that the canonical formalism introduces some additional ambiguities that make more challenging the comparison between both formalisms. We analyze different possible interpretations in both approaches and show how one can obtain complete correspondence between results within covariant and canonical formalisms. We also show that the correspondence can be achieved in the original phase spaces, with no boundary degrees of freedom, or by appropriately extending them by adding horizon degrees of freedom. Along the way, we shed light on the role of boundary terms in the symplectic structure in relation to boundary degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>On the structure of trans-series in quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many observables in quantum field theory can be expressed in terms of trans-series, in which one adds to the perturbative series a typically infinite sum of exponentially small corrections, due to instantons or to renormalons. Even after Borel resummation of the series in the coupling constant, one has to sum this infinite series of small exponential corrections. It has been argued that this leads to a new divergence, which is sometimes called the divergence of the OPE. We show that, in some interesting examples in quantum field theory, the series of small exponential corrections is convergent, order by order in the coupling constant. In particular, we give numerical evidence for this convergence property in the case of the free energy of integrable asymptotically free theories, which has been intensively studied recently in the framework of resurgence. Our results indicate that, in these examples, the Borel resummed trans-series leads to a well defined function, and there are no further divergences.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of the wave function coefficients for conformally coupled scalars at both one and two-loop levels at leading order in the coupling constant, in momentum space. We take cues from time-dependent interactions in flat spacetime and under suitable approximations, these can also be used to study the wave function coefficients for general cosmologies. We make use of recursion relations developed in arxiv:\{1709.02813\} to regularize certain bulk-point integrals and express the wave function coefficients in a form that simplifies the loop integrals. We utilize hard-cutoff regularization to regularize the loop integrals and further provide a discussion on their renormalization. Our results can also be analytically continued to obtain answers for transition amplitudes in AdS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop vacuum energy in 10 dimensional (10D) super Yang-Mills theory compactified on $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times (\mathbb{T}^2)^3$ in the presence of the Abelian magnetic fluxes. The regularization of infinite Kaluza-Klein (KK) sum is achieved by the use of Barnes $\zeta$-functions, which can be applied to the case with Landau level structure of KK mass spectrum. We apply the technique to two different models of the 10D super Yang-Mills theory: The one is to introduce the magnetic flux background to the 10D super Yang-Mills action. The other is to first embed 10D super Yang-Mills action into 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ superspace and to introduce magnetic fluxes. The two model buildings result in tree level potential. The KK mass spectrum of two models look different and we compute the one-loop vacuum energy of each case. Nevertheless, both of the KK mass spectra have the Landau level structure and we can apply the regularization method in the same way. We show that despite the differences the resultant one-loop vacuum energy of both models coincide with each other.</description>

      <title>False Vacuum Decay Rate From Thin To Thick Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a single real scalar field in flat spacetime with a polynomial potential up to $\phi^4$, that has a local minimum, the false vacuum, and a deeper global minimum, the true vacuum. When the vacua are almost degenerate we are in the thin wall regime, while as their difference in potential energy increases, we approach the thick wall regime. We give explicit simple formulae for the decay rate of the false vacuum in 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions. Our results include a careful treatment both of the bounce action, which enters at the exponent of the decay rate, and of the functional determinant at one loop, which determines the prefactor. The bounce action is computed analytically as an expansion in the thin wall parameter in generic $D$ dimensions. We find that truncating such an expansion at second order we obtain a remarkably accurate bounce action also deep into thick wall regimes. We calculate the functional determinant numerically in 3 and 4 dimensions and fit the results with simple polynomials of the same thin wall parameter. This allows us to write the complete one-loop decay rate as a compact expression, which works accurately from thin to thick wall regimes.</description>

Abstract: We construct the unintegrated vertex operator at the first mass level of the open superstring from the OPE of massless vertices. Using BRST cohomology manipulations, the tree amplitude of two massless and one massive state is rewritten in terms of the pure spinor superspace kinematic expression of the massless four-point amplitude at the ${\alpha^\prime}^2$ level. A generalization relating the partial $n$-point tree amplitudes with one massive state and linear combinations of the ${\alpha^\prime}^2$ corrections to n+1 massless amplitudes is found and shown to be consistent with unitarity.</description>

      <title>Do holographic CFT states have unique semiclassical bulk duals?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a situation where a holographic CFT state has multiple semiclassical bulk duals. In our example, a given holographic state has two simple, semiclassical descriptions, one with a closed universe, constructed using the gravitational path integral, and one without a closed universe, constructed using the extrapolate dictionary. This highlights an ambiguity in the AdS/CFT dictionary. We propose various options for resolving this tension although none are perfectly satisfactory. We also discuss what this implies for the black hole interior and the gravitational path integral.</description>

      <title>Dyonic bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study (multi) fermion - monopole bound states, many of which are the states that dyons adiabatically transition into as fermions become light. The properties of these bound states depend critically on the UV symmetries preserved by the fermion mass terms, their relative size, and the value of $\theta$. Depending on the relative size of the mass terms and the value of $\theta$, the bound states can undergo phase transitions as well as transition from being stable to unstable. In some simple situations, the bound state solution can be related to the Witten effect of another theory with fewer fermions and larger gauge coupling. These bound states are a result of mass terms and symmetry breaking boundary conditions at the monopole core and, consequently, these bound states do not necessarily have definite quantum numbers under accidental IR symmetries. Additionally, they have binding energies that are $\mathcal{O}(1)$ times the fermion mass and bound state radii of order their inverse mass. As the massless limit is approached, the bound state radii approach infinity, and they become new asymptotic states with odd quantum numbers giving a dynamical understanding to the origin of semitons.</description>

      <title>No-boundary extremal surfaces in slow-roll inflation and other cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on previous work on de Sitter extremal surfaces anchored at the future boundary, we study no-boundary extremal surfaces in slow-roll inflation models, with perturbations to no-boundary global $dS$ preserving the spatial isometry. While in pure de Sitter space the Euclidean hemisphere gives a real area equalling half de Sitter entropy, the no-boundary extremal surface areas here have nontrivial real and imaginary pieces overall. We evaluate the area integrals in the complex time-plane defining appropriate contours. For the 4-dim case, the real and imaginary finite corrections at leading order in the slow-roll parameter match those in the semiclassical expansion of the Wavefunction (or action), and corroborate the cosmic brane interpretation discussed previously. We also study no-boundary extremal surfaces in other cosmologies including 3-dimensional inflation and Schwarzschild de Sitter spaces with small mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons on a Bose-Einstein condensate has been explored in (Phys. Rev. D 110 (2024) 026014; https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.026014). In the previous paper, we investigated the effects of graviton while detecting a gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this work we shall explicitly calculate the decoherence due to the noise of gravitons between two momentum states of the Bose-Einstein condensate. This decoherence happens due to Bremsstrahlung from the Bose-Einstein condensates due to the effect of the noise induced by gravitons. It is also observed that the two states become entangled because of the existence of a surrounding graviton field which degrades over time via means of this gravitational Bremsstrahlung. Using this property of the Bose-Einstein condensate in a quantum gravity background, we propose an experimental test via the use of atom lasers (generated from the condensate) which would, in principle, help to detect gravitons in future generations of very advanced ultra-cold temperature experiments.</description>

      <title>Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory and its Chirality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and solve the $\text{U(1)}$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, with an emphasis on the chirality of the theory. Realizing Chern-Simons theory on lattice has been a problem of interest for decades, and over the years it has gradually become clear that there are two key points: 1) Some non-topological term, such as a Maxwell term, is necessary -- this is true even in the continuum, but more manifestly on the lattice; 2) the $\text{U(1)}$ gauge field should be implemented in the Villainized form to retain its topological properties. Putting the two ideas together seriously, we show all interesting properties of a chiral Chern-Simons theory are reproduced in an explicitly regularized manner on the lattice. These include the bosonic and fermionic level quantization, the bulk and chiral edge spectrum, the Wilson loop flux attachment (with point-split framing or geometric framing depending on the Maxwell coupling), the Wilson loop spin, the ground state degeneracy, and, most non-trivially, the chiral gravitational anomaly.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Entropy for Brane-World Higher Derivative Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the splitting problem, it is difficult to derive the holographic entanglement entropy for general higher derivative gravity. Inspired by double holography and renormalized entanglement entropy, we develop a method to derive the generalized gravitational entropy for the brane-world higher derivative (BWHD) gravity. Remarkably, this approach is independent of the splitting problem. The so-called BWHD gravity is an effective theory on the brane, given by the counter terms of holographic renormalization. Interestingly, all solutions to Einstein gravity are also solutions to BWHD gravity. We first verify our approach can derive the correct results for curvature-squared gravity and then derive the holographic entanglement entropy for cubic BWHD gravity, which is the main result of this paper. We also derive the entropy of quartic BWHD gravity in flat space with constant extrinsic curvatures and perform several tests on our results. Finally, we briefly comment on our results.</description>

      <title>Phase transition on superfluid vortices in Higgs-Confinement crossover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to distinguish states of matter by identifying spontaneous symmetry breaking on extended objects, such as vortices, even in the absence of a bulk phase transition. As a specific example, we investigate the phase transition on superfluid vortices in the Higgs-confinement crossover using a $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{gauge} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ model. This model exhibits superfluidity of $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ symmetry and allows for a crossover between the Higgs and confinement regimes by varying the gauge coupling constant from weak to strong. We demonstrate that, on vortices, spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flavor symmetry occurs in the weak coupling (Higgs) regime, while it does not in the strong coupling (confinement) regime. We also confirm that those regimes are separated by a second-order phase transition through Monte Carlo simulations, whose universality class corresponds to the two-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but with vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low-energy effective field theory for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. The dynamical variables involve the chiral charge densities and order parameter (chiral condensate). Via the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique, the effective action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model. With higher-order terms suitably neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the effective field theory resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the effective field theory, we briefly discuss the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and Goldstone modes.</description>

Abstract: Coupling $N$ large $m$ minimal models and flowing to IR fixed points is a systematic way to build new classes of compact unitary 2d CFTs which are likely to be irrational, and potentially have a positive Virasoro twist gap above the vaccuum. In this paper, we build on the construction of [1], establishing that, for spins less than 10, additional currents transforming in non-trivial irreducible representations of the permutation symmetry $S_N$ are not conserved at the IR fixed points. Along the way, we develop a finer understanding of the spectrum of these theories, of the special properties of the $N=4$ case and of non-invertible symmetries that constrain them. We also discuss variations of the original setup of [1] some of which can exist for smaller values of the UV central charge.</description>

Abstract: A traversable wormhole generally violates the averaged null energy condition, usually requiring exotic matter. Recently, it has been found that the traversable wormhole can be realized by non-exotic matter in Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theories in flat space. This paper generalizes discussions to the AdS spacetime and finds traversable wormholes with spherical and planar topologies. Furthermore, based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the entanglement entropy of strips and disks on two AdS boundaries of the wormhole. We find that entanglement entropy undergoes a phase transition as the subsystem size increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CEGM formalism offers a general framework for scattering amplitudes, which rests on Grassmannians, moduli spaces and tropical geometry. The physical implications of this generalization are still to be understood. Conventional wisdom says that key features of scattering amplitudes, like factorization at their poles into lower-point amplitudes, are associated to their singularities. The factorization behavior of CEGM amplitudes at their poles is interesting but complicated. Recent developments have revealed important properties of standard particle and string scattering amplitudes from factorizations, known as splits, that happen away from poles. In this paper we introduce a kinematic subspace on which the CEGM amplitude splits into very simple rational functions. These functions, called simplex amplitudes, arise from stringy integrals for the multivariate beta function, and also from restricting the biadjoint scalar amplitude in quantum field theory to certain kinematic loci. Using split kinematics we also discover a specific class of zeros of the CEGM amplitude. Our construction rests on viewing positive moduli space as a product of simplices, and it suggests a novel approach for deriving scattering amplitudes from tropical determinantal varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the self-similar structure of loop amplitudes in quantum field theory and apply it to amplitude generation and renormalization. A renormalized amplitude can be regarded as an effective coupling that recursively appears within another loop. It is best described as a coupling in the effective action. It is a scale-dependent, finite, parametrically small and observable quantity appearing in the S-matrix. Replacing a tree-level coupling with a loop amplitude provides a systematic method of generating high-order loop amplitudes, guaranteeing no subamplitude divergence. This method also provides an alternative bottom-up proof and improvement to the traditional top-down recursive renormalization of general amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18005v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The novel concept of entanglement renormalization and its corresponding tensor network renormalization technique have been highly successful in developing a controlled real space renormalization group (RG) scheme. Numerically approximate fixed-point (FP) tensors are widely used to extract the conformal data of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT) describing critical phenomena. In this paper, we present an explicit analytical construction of the FP tensor for 2D rational CFT. We define it as a correlation function between the "boundary-changing operators" (BCO) on triangles. Our construction fully captures all the real-space RG conditions. We also provide concrete examples, such as Ising, Yang-Lee and Tri-critical Ising models to compute the scaling dimensions explicitly based on the corresponding FP tensor. The BCO descendants turn out to be an optimal basis such that truncation in bond dimensions naturally produces comparable accuracies with the leading existing FP algorithms. Interestingly, our construction of FP tensors is closely related to a strange correlator, where the holographic picture naturally emerges. Our results also open a new door towards understanding CFT in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical conservation of the lepton number is an accidental symmetry present in the Standard Model (SM). Thus, we consider here a scenario where the SM is extended with a U(1) gauge group, promoting the lepton number to a local symmetry. The gauge anomaly cancellations necessitate the extension of the particle spectrum with several beyond the SM (BSM) particle fields. The extended lepton gauge group breaks around the TeV scale via spontaneous symmetry breaking, and a $Z_2$ symmetry remains, which ensures the stability of the light $Z_2$ odd BSM particles. Interestingly, the particle spectrum of the model has two distinct dark sectors, with one having a Dirac-type DM and the other one containing a Majorana-type DM, thus resulting in a multipartite dark matter scenario. We have explored the available parameter space consistent with the observed dark matter relic density and direct detection measurements for both of the DM particles. Having a Majorana dark matter, we have also studied for the gamma line signatures to constrain the parameter space from the indirect dark matter detection experiments like FermiLAT and CTA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study plasmonic time crystals, an extension of dielectric-based photonic time crystals to plasmonic media. Remarkably, we demonstrate that such systems may amplify both longitudinal and transverse modes. In particular, we show that plasmonic time crystals support \emph{collective resonances} of longitudinal modes, which occur independently of the wave vector $k$, even in the presence of significant dissipation. These resonances originate from the coupling between the positive- and negative-frequency branches of the plasmonic dispersion relation of the unmodulated system and from the divergence of the density of states near the plasma ($\varepsilon$-near zero) frequency $\omega_p$. The strongest resonance arises at a modulation frequency $\Omega = 2 \omega_p$, corresponding to a direct interband transition. We demonstrate these resonances for various periodic modulation profiles and provide a generic perturbative formula for resonance widths in the weak modulation limit. Furthermore, we propose transparent conducting oxides as promising platforms for realizing plasmonic time crystals, as they enable significant modulation of the electron effective mass while maintaining moderate dissipation levels. Our findings provide new insights into leveraging time-modulated plasmonic media to enhance optical gain and control wave dynamics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>First-order deformations of freely generated vertex algebras</title>

Abstract: We solve the problem of how to classify the first-order vertex-algebraic deformations for any grading-restricted vertex algebra $V$ that is freely generated by homogeneous elements of positive weights. We approach by computing the second cohomology $H^2_{1/2}(V, V)$ constructed by Yi-Zhi Huang. We start with the cocycle on two generators and show that its cohomology class is completely determined by its singular part. To extend the cocycle to any pair of elements in $V$, we take a generating function approach, formulate the cocycle equation, and show that all the complementary solutions are coboundaries. Then we use a very general procedure to construct a particular solution. The procedure applies to vertex algebras that are not freely generated. As a by-product, we show that $H^2_{1/2}(V, V) = H^2_\infty(V, V)$. Using these results, we explicitly determine the first-order deformations of the universal Virasoro VOA $Vir_c$, universal affine VOA $V^l(\mathfrak{g})$, Heisenberg VOA $V^l(\mathfrak{h})$, and the universal Zamolodchikov VOA $W_3^c$.</description>

      <title>Matroids and amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Kita--Yoshida and Cho--Matsumoto introduced intersection forms on the twisted (co)homologies of hyperplane arrangement complements. We give a closed combinatorial formula for these intersection pairings. We show that these intersection pairings are obtained from (continuous and discrete) Laplace transforms of subfans of the Bergman fan of the associated matroid. We compute inverses of these intersection pairings, allowing us to identify (variants of) these intersection forms with the contravariant form of Schechtman--Varchenko, and the bilinear form of Varchenko.
  Building on parallel joint work with C. Eur, we define a notion of scattering amplitudes for matroids. We show that matroid amplitudes satisfy locality and unitarity, and recover biadjoint scalar amplitudes in the case of the complete graphic matroid. We apply our formulae for twisted intersection forms to deduce old and new formulae for scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal mode spectrum of rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes are excited during the ringdown phase of black holes after merger. Determination of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in alternative theories of gravity has remained a challenge for a long time. Here we discuss in detail our recently developed method to extract the quasinormal modes for rapidly rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory. We first obtain numerically the exact rapidly rotating background solutions, which also clarify their domain of existence. Then we solve the equations for the linear perturbations of the metric and the dilaton field by employing an appropriate set of boundary conditions and a spectral decomposition of the perturbation functions. The resulting spectrum agrees well with the known limits obtained for slow rotation and weak coupling, while it exhibits larger deviations for stronger coupling.</description>

      <title>Models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study six-dimensional $SU(n)$ gauge models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$. In the absence of continuous Wilson line phases, product group unification models can be constructed based on $SU(7)$ and $SU(8)$ gauge models. When continuous Wilson line phases are present, we find that a minimal model, namely, an $SU(6)$ gauge model, can describe the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry. In addition, this model has excellent features that two Higgs doublets appear from the zero modes of the extra-dimensional gauge field, and the quarks in each generation can be unified into one multiplet, without exotic quarks, as the zero modes of a bulk field in the $\boldsymbol{15}$ representation of $SU(6)$. We show that there exists a vacuum where the electroweak symmetry is slightly broken, as a minimum of the effective potential for the continuous Wilson line phases, by adding suitable bulk fields, in a toy model. This electroweak symmetry breaking can be naturally understood in terms of the two Higgs doublet model, and mass eigenstates of the neutral Higgs bosons are examined, including the component corresponding to the nonflat direction, which does not appear in the continuous Wilson line phases. We also discuss the tadpole terms of the field strength localized on fixed points. We show that their direct contributions to the Higgs masses can be forbidden by a reflection symmetry, and thus, quadratic divergences are not reintroduced into the Higgs masses not only at one-loop level but also at higher orders.</description>
