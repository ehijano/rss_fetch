      <title>Detectability of Emission from Exoplanet Outflows Calculated by pyTPCI, a New 1D Radiation-Hydrodynamic Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoevaporation in exoplanet atmospheres is thought to contribute to the shaping of the small planet radius valley. Escaping atmospheres have been detected in transmission across a variety of exoplanet types, from hot Jupiters to mini-Neptunes. However, no work has yet considered whether outflows might also be detectable in emission. We introduce pyTPCI, a new, open-source self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamics code that is an improved version of The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface. We use pyTPCI to model seven exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-69b, WASP-107b, TOI-1430b, TOI-560b, and HAT-P-32b) at varying metallicities and compute their emission spectra to investigate their detectability across a variety of spectral lines. We calculate the eclipse depths and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of these lines for a 10m class telescope with a high-resolution spectrograph, taking into account appropriate line broadening mechanisms. We show that the most detectable spectral lines tend to be the 589 nm Na I doublet and the 1083 nm metastable helium triplet. Halpha and Mg I 457 nm are moderately strong for some planets at some metallicities, but they are almost always optically thin, so some of their emission may not be from the outflow. The planet with the highest-flux, highest-eclipse-depth, and highest-SNR lines is HD 189733b, with a Na I eclipse depth of 410 ppm and SNR of 2.4 per eclipse, and a He* eclipse depth of 170 ppm and SNR of 1.3. These signals would be marginally detectable with Keck if 3-10 eclipses were observed, assuming (over-optimistically) photon limited observations.</description>

      <title>Identifying Flare Locations Through Exoplanet Transit Occultations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M dwarfs are the most common stars in the galaxy, with long lifespans, a high occurrence rate of rocky planets, and close-in habitable zones. However, high stellar activity in the form of frequent flaring and any associated coronal mass ejections may drive atmospheric escape with the bombardment of radiation and high-energy particles, drastically impacting the habitability of these systems. The stellar latitude where flares and coronal mass ejections occur determines the space weather that exoplanets are subject to, with high-energy particle events associated with equatorial flares producing significant atmospheric erosion. However, the flaring latitudes for M dwarfs remain largely unconstrained. To aid in the effort to locate these flaring regions we explore the applicability of flare occultations using optical photometry to identify the latitudes of flares. As a planet transits in front of an ongoing flare the timing and geometry of the transit can be used to constrain the latitude and longitude of the flare. We predict the probability of detecting an occultation for known transiting planets and eclipsing binaries. From this, we estimate 3-22 detectable occultations exist within the TESS primary mission photometry, with the majority occurring in eclipsing binary observations. To demonstrate this technique, we analyze a candidate flare occultation event for the eclipsing binary CM Draconis.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey V: Exploring Atmospheric Variability and Orbit of the Super-Jupiter AB Pictoris b with CRIRES+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing number of directly-imaged companions have been recently characterised, with robust constraints on carbon-to-oxygen ratios and even isotopic ratios. Many companions and isolated targets have also shown spectral variability. In this work we observed the super-Jupiter AB~Pictoris~b across four consecutive nights using VLT/CRIRES+ as part of the ESO SupJup survey, exploring how the constraints on chemical composition and temperature profile change over time using spectral line shape variations between nights. We performed atmospheric retrievals of the high-resolution observations and found broadly consistent results across all four nights, but there were differences for some parameters. We clearly detect H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO in each night, but abundances varied by $\sim2\sigma$, which was correlated to the deep atmosphere temperature profiles. We also found differences in the $^{12}$C$/^{13}$C ratios in each night by up to $\sim3\sigma$, which seemed to be correlated with the cloud deck pressure. Our combined retrieval simultaneously analysing all nights together constrained broadly the average of each night individually, with the C/O$=0.59\pm0.01$, consistent with solar composition, and $^{12}$C$/^{13}$C~$ = 102\pm8$, slightly higher than the ISM and Solar System values. We also find a low projected rotational velocity, suggesting that AB~Pictoris~b is either intrinsically a slow rotator due to its young age or that the spin axis is observed pole-on with a $\sim90^\circ$ misalignment with its orbit inclination. Future observations will be able to further explore the variability and orbit of AB~Pictoris~b as well as for other companions.</description>

      <title>Impact of photoevaporative winds in chemical models of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most stars form in dense clusters within high-mass star-forming regions, where protoplanetary disks may be exposed to intense UV radiation from nearby massive stars. While previous studies have typically focused on isolated sources in low-mass regions, recent observational campaigns have started to probe the chemistry of irradiated disks in unprecedented detail. Interpreting this data requires complex chemical models, yet few studies have examined these disks' chemistry, and none have incorporated the photoevaporative wind launched by external UV fields into their physical structure. In this study, we post-process radiation hydrodynamics simulations of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks using the thermochemical code DALI, comparing models with and without the wind to assess its impact on disk chemistry. Results show that UV radiation is rapidly attenuated by the disk in both cases. However, thermal re-emission from the wind at longer wavelengths enhances disk heating, increasing the gas-phase abundances of some key volatiles. Synthetic line fluxes vary by orders of magnitude between wind and windless models, primarily due to emission from the wind itself rather than abundance variations within the disk. Our findings demonstrate that the photoevaporative wind significantly influences the physical and chemical structure, and observational characteristics, of externally irradiated disks. We conclude that incorporating the wind into chemical models is essential for accurately predicting chemical abundances, interpreting observations, and ultimately understanding planet formation in these common yet complex environments.</description>

      <title>The Role of Atmospheric Composition in Defining the Habitable Zone Limits and Supporting E. coli Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying exoplanet atmospheres is essential for assessing their potential to host liquid water and their capacity to support life (their habitability). Each atmosphere uniquely influences the likelihood of surface liquid water, defining the habitable zone (HZ), the region around a star where liquid water can exist. However, being within the HZ does not guarantee habitability, as life requires more than just liquid water. In this study, we adopted a two-pronged approach. First, we estimated the surface conditions of planets near the HZ's inner edge under various atmospheric compositions. By utilizing a 3D climate model, we refined the inner boundaries of the HZ for planets with atmospheres dominated by H2 and CO2 for the first time. Second, we investigated microbial survival in these environments, conducting laboratory experiments on the growth and survival of E. coli K-12, focusing on the impact of different gas compositions. This innovative combination of climate modeling and biological experiments bridges theoretical climate predictions with biological outcomes. Our findings indicate that atmospheric composition significantly affects bacterial growth patterns, highlighting the importance of considering diverse atmospheres in evaluating exoplanet habitability and advancing the search for life beyond Earth.</description>

      <title>The CO-Fuelled Time Machine: Tracing Birth Conditions and Terrestrial Planet Formation Outcomes in HD 163296 through Pebble Drift-induced CO Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The architecture and composition of planetary systems are thought to be strongly influenced by the transport and delivery of dust and volatiles via ices on pebbles during the planet formation phase in protoplanetary discs. Understanding these transport mechanisms is crucial in building a comprehensive picture of planet formation, including material and chemical budget; constraining the birth properties of these discs is a key step in this process. We present a novel method of retrieving such properties by studying the transport of icy pebbles in the context of an observed gas-phase CO enhancement within the CO snowline in the protoplanetary disc around HD 163296. We combine Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with a fast model of radial drift to determine the birth gas mass and characteristic radius of the disc, and compare our results against observations and models in the literature; we find the birth-condition disc gas mass to be $\log_{10}(M_{\rm{disc}}/M_{\odot})=-0.64^{+0.19}_{-0.24}$ and the characteristic radius to be $\log_{10}(r_{\rm{c}}/\rm{AU})=2.30^{+0.45}_{-0.46}$. We additionally determine that dust grains must be `fragile' ($v_{f}=100~\mathrm{cms}^{-1}$) to retain enough dust to match current dust mass observations, with our lowest fragmentation velocity model providing a current-age dust mass of $\rm{M_{dust}}=662^{+518}_{-278} \rm{M_{\oplus}}$ based on the retrieved birth conditions. Using our retrieved birth conditions, we extend our simulations to mass of material reaching the water snowline in the inner disc, where terrestrial and super-Earth planets may be forming, and speculate on the nature of these exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Martian atmospheric disturbances from orbital images and surface pressure at Jezero Crater, Mars, during Martian Year 36</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of atmospheric disturbances at Jezero Crater, Mars, using ground-based measurements of surface pressure by the Perseverance rover in combination with orbital images from the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions. The study starts at Ls $\sim$ 13.3{\deg} in MY36 (March 6th, 2021) and extends up to Ls $\sim$ 30.3{\deg} in MY37 (February 28th, 2023). We focus on the characterization of the major atmospheric phenomena at synoptic and planetary-scales. These are the thermal tides (measured up to the sixth component), long-period pressure oscillations (periods &gt; 1 sol), the Aphelion Cloud Belt, and the occasional development of regional dust storms over Jezero. We present the seasonal evolution of the amplitudes and phases of the thermal tides and their relation with the atmospheric dust content (optical depth). Three regional dust storms and one polar storm extending over Jezero produced an increase in the diurnal and semidiurnal amplitudes but resulted in inverse responses in their phases. We show that the primary regular wave activity is due to baroclinic disturbances with periods of 2-4 sols and amplitudes $\sim$ 1-15 Pa increasing with dust content, in good agreement with theoretical predictions by model calculations. The spacecraft images show a number of arc-shaped, spiral and irregular cyclonic vortices, traced by dust and clouds at the edge of the North Polar Cap, that could be behind some of the pressure oscillations measured at Jezero.</description>

      <title>A Disintegrating Rocky Planet with Prominent Comet-like Tails Around a Bright Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab, a transiting exoplanet orbiting a bright ($V=10.16$) K-dwarf (TIC 466376085) with a period of 1.27 days. Observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) reveal variable transit depths and asymmetric transit profiles that are characteristic of comet-like tails formed by dusty effluents emanating from a disintegrating planet. Unique to BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab is the presence of prominent dust tails in both the trailing and leading directions that contribute to the extinction of starlight from the host star. By fitting the observed transit profile and analytically modeling the drift of dust grains within both dust tails, we infer large grain sizes ($\sim1-10\,\mu$m) and a mass loss rate of $10\,M_{\rm \oplus}\,$Gyr$^{-1}$, suggestive of a lunar-mass object with a disintegration timescale of only several Myr. The host star is probably older than the Sun and is accompanied by an M-dwarf companion at a projected physical separation of 130 AU. The brightness of the host star, combined with the planet's relatively deep transits ($0.8-2.0\%$), presents BD+05$\,$4868$\,$Ab as a prime target for compositional studies of rocky exoplanets and investigations into the nature of catastrophically evaporating planets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory is intended to observe the atmospheres of nearby terrestrial exoplanets with a resolution greater than that of any previous instrument. While these observations present a substantial opportunity for astrobiology, they also incur the risk of false positives and false negatives. Here, we explore the use of systems science (in the form of network theory and thermochemical kinetics) to mitigate these risks, and briefly describe the technical specifications HWO would require in order to use these methodologies.</description>

      <title>ALMA Observations of Peculiar Embedded Icy Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) towards two peculiar icy objects, which were discovered serendipitously by infrared spectroscopic survey of the Galactic plane with the AKARI satellite. Previous infrared observations have reported that both objects show deep ice and dust absorption features that are often seen in embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) or background stars sitting behind dense clouds, however, they are located neither in known star-forming regions nor in known dense clouds. Their infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) show a peak around 5 micron, which are incompatible with existing SED models of typical embedded YSOs. The present ALMA observations have detected compact emission of CO(3-2) and SiO(8-7) at the positions of the icy objects. The observed large column ratios of gas-phase SiO/CO (~10^-3) in both objects, as well as their broad line widths (8-14 km/s), imply that they are associated with shocked gas. Although a large dust extinction (Av ~100 mag) is expected from their deep dust/ice absorption, no dust continuum emission is detected, which would suggest a large beam dilution effect due to their compact source sizes. Their systemic velocities are clearly separated from the surrounding CO clouds, suggesting that they are isolated. The characteristics of their SEDs, the presence of deep dust/ice absorption features, compact source size, and SiO-dominated broad molecular line emission, cannot easily be accounted for by any of known interstellar ice-absorption sources. They may represent a previously unknown type of isolated icy objects.</description>

      <title>Detecting Planetary Oblateness in the Era of JWST: A Case Study of Kepler-167e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planets may be rotationally flattened, and their oblateness thus provide useful information on their formation and evolution. Here we develop a new algorithm that can compute the transit light curve due to an oblate planet very efficiently and use it to study the detectability of planet oblateness (and spin obliquity) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the Jupiter analog, Kepler-167e, as an example, we show that observations of a single transit with JWST are able to detect a Saturn-like oblateness ($f=0.1$) with high confidence, or set a stringent upper limit on the oblateness parameter, as long as the planetary spin is slightly misaligned ($\gtrsim 20^\circ$) with respect to its orbital direction. Based on known obliquity measurements and theoretical arguments, it is reasonable to believe that this level of misalignment may be common. We estimate the sensitivity limit of JWST in oblateness detections and highlight the importance of better characterizations of cold planets in planning future JWST transit observations. The potential to detect rings, moons, and atmospheric species of the cold giants with JWST is also discussed.</description>

      <title>NGTS-EB-7, an eccentric, long-period, low-mass eclipsing binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite being the most common types of stars in the Galaxy, the physical properties of late M dwarfs are often poorly constrained. A trend of radius inflation compared to evolutionary models has been observed for earlier type M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries, possibly caused by magnetic activity. It is currently unclear whether this trend also extends to later type M dwarfs below theconvective boundary. This makes the discovery of lower-mass, fully convective, M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries valuable for testing evolutionary models especially in longer-period binaries where tidal interaction between the primary and secondary is negligible. With this context, we present the discovery of the NGTS-EB-7 AB system, an eclipsing binary containing a late M dwarf secondary and an evolved G-type primary star. The secondary star has a radius of $0.125 \pm 0.006 R_\odot$ , a mass of $0.096 \pm 0.004 M_\odot$ and follows a highly eccentric $(e=0.71436 \pm 0.00085)$ orbit every $193.35875 \pm 0.00034$ days. This makes NGTS-EB-7 AB the third longest-period eclipsing binary system with a secondary smaller than $200 M_J$ with the mass and radius constrained to better than $5 \%$. In addition, NGTS-EB-7 is situated near the centre of the proposed LOPS2 southern field of the upcoming PLATO mission, allowing for detection of the secondary eclipse and measurement of the companion`s temperature. With its long-period and well-constrained physical properties - NGTS-EB-7 B will make a valuable addition to the sample of M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries and help in determining accurate empirical mass/radius relations for later M dwarf stars.</description>
