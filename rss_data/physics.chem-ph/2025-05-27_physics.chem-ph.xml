      <title>Degradation of methylparaben by anodic oxidation, electro-Fenton, and photoelectro-Fenton using carbon felt-BDD cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the comparative efficiency of different electrochemical advanced oxidation processes, such as anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (AO- H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF), and its combination with UV irradiation (photoelectron-Fenton (PEF)), was investigated for the removal of methylparaben (MP) using a carbon felt cathode and a boron-doped diamond anode. The EF process achieved a higher MP removal efficiency than the AO-H2O2 process for all applied current densities. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal after 6 h of treatment at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 reached 75.0% and 91.9% for the AO- H2O2 and EF processes, respectively. The combination of EF and UV light improved the efficiency of the EF process. The PEF process achieved a TOC removal of 84.6% in only 2 h at 5 mA cm-2 and 96.8% after 6 h of treatment. Furthermore, based on identifying oxidation reaction intermediates and short-chain carboxylic acids generated during the treatment, a reaction pathway for methylparaben mineralization by hydroxyl radicals was proposed.</description>

      <title>FlashMD: long-stride, universal prediction of molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) provides insights into atomic-scale processes by integrating over time the equations that describe the motion of atoms under the action of interatomic forces. Machine learning models have substantially accelerated MD by providing inexpensive predictions of the forces, but they remain constrained to minuscule time integration steps, which are required by the fast time scale of atomic motion. In this work, we propose FlashMD, a method to predict the evolution of positions and momenta over strides that are between one and two orders of magnitude longer than typical MD time steps. We incorporate considerations on the mathematical and physical properties of Hamiltonian dynamics in the architecture, generalize the approach to allow the simulation of any thermodynamic ensemble, and carefully assess the possible failure modes of such a long-stride MD approach. We validate FlashMD's accuracy in reproducing equilibrium and time-dependent properties, using both system-specific and general-purpose models, extending the ability of MD simulation to reach the long time scales needed to model microscopic processes of high scientific and technological relevance.</description>

      <title>Local Pseudopotential Unlocks the True Potential of Neural Network-based Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Network-based Quantum Monte Carlo (NNQMC), an emerging method for solving many-body quantum systems with high accuracy, has been limitedly applied to small systems due to demanding computation requirements. In this work, we introduce an approach based on local pseudopotentials to break through such limitation, significantly improving the computational efficiency and scalability of NNQMC. The incorporation of local pseudopotentials not only reduces the number of electrons treated in neural network but also achieves better accuracy than all electron NNQMC calculations for complex systems. This counterintuitive outcome is made possible by the distinctive characteristics inherent to NNQMC. Our approach enables the reliable treatment of large and challenging systems, such as iron-sulfur clusters with as many as 268 total electrons, which were previously beyond reach for NNQMC methods. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the synergy between NNQMC and local pseudopotentials substantially expands the scope of accurate ab initio calculations, pushing the frontiers of quantum chemistry and computational physics.</description>

      <title>Triplets in the cradle: ultrafast dynamics in a cyclic disulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of spin-orbit coupling on the "Newton's cradle"-type photodynamics in the cyclic disulfide 1,2-dithiane (C4H8S2) is investigated theoretically. We consider excitation by a 290 nm laser pulse and simulate the subsequent ultrafast nonadiabatic dynamics by propagating surface-hopping trajectories using SA(4|4)-CASSCF(6,4)-level electronic structure calculations with a modified ANO-R1 basis set. Two simulations are run: one with singlet states only, and one with both singlet and triplet states. All trajectories are propagated for 1 ps with a 0.5 fs timestep. Comparison of the simulations suggests that the presence of triplet states depletes the singlet state population, with the net singlet and triplet populations at long times tending towards their statistical limit. Crucially, the triplet states also hinder the intramolecular thiyl radical recombination pathway via the efficient intersystem crossing between the singlet and triplet state manifolds.</description>

      <title>Sublimation of orientated amino acid films for reliable, amplified piezoelectric performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular crystals, such as amino acids, peptides, and proteins, have emerged as potential next generation piezoelectric materials due to their low-cost, biocompatibility, eco-friendliness, and reduced permittivity versus ceramics. However, many challenges have limited their acceleration into mainstream sensing applications. Their natural self-assembly from saturated solutions into polycrystalline films reduces their effective piezoelectric output, and results in high variability within individual samples, and across sample batches when scaled-up. Here we validate the sublimation of a variety of amino acids onto conductive substrates as an effective technique for overcoming these challenges. This solvent-free crystallisation technique results in polycrystalline films with uniformly orientated crystals, and a resulting piezoelectric response that exceeds that of single crystals. We report a maximum piezoelectric response of 9.6 pC/N in films of L-Valine, which matches the predicted single crystal response, and a maximum voltage output of 4.6 V. For L-Methionine and L-Valine sublimated films the material properties are consistent at all points on the piezoelectric films and repeatable across any number of films grown under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Transcorrelated Methods for Multireference Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the transcorrelated method to problems of multireference character. For this, we show that the choice of reference wavefunction during the Jastrow optimisation procedure is vital, and we propose a workflow wherein we use conventional multi-configurational methods to provide a reference wavefunction for Jastrow factor optimisation. This Jastrow function is subsequently used with transcorrelated-full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo within the xTC approximation (TC-FCIQMC) to yield highly accurate transcorrelated energies. This is demonstrated for N$_2$ using the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set, achieving chemical accuracy across the entire binding curve compared with experiment. We also apply the method to compute excitation energies of dinitrogen, CO and the ammonia molecule, where accurate results, comparable to the best available theoretical predictions, are obtained with modest basis sets.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study of Charge Transport Properties of Curved PAH Organic Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exhibit distinctive geometric and electronic structures, rendering them highly promising in addressing issues of solubility and air stability, which are faced for large linear arene $\pi$-conjugated organic semiconductors. In this study, a series of surface-curved PAHs and the heteroatom doped derivatives are selected and designed, and the relationship between electronic structure and charge transport properties of these molecules is investigated by using density functional theory (DFT). And the effects of sulfur/oxygen, nitrogen and boron doping on the charge transport performance of curved PAH semiconductors are explored. The results show that curved PAHs exhibit improved solubility and stability, with the degree of molecular curvature significantly affecting the material's transport properties.</description>

      <title>2DNMRGym: An Annotated Experimental Dataset for Atom-Level Molecular Representation Learning in 2D NMR via Surrogate Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, particularly Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy, plays a critical role in elucidating molecular structures, interactions, and electronic properties. However, accurately interpreting 2D NMR data remains labor-intensive and error-prone, requiring highly trained domain experts, especially for complex molecules. Machine Learning (ML) holds significant potential in 2D NMR analysis by learning molecular representations and recognizing complex patterns from data. However, progress has been limited by the lack of large-scale and high-quality annotated datasets. In this work, we introduce 2DNMRGym, the first annotated experimental dataset designed for ML-based molecular representation learning in 2D NMR. It includes over 22,000 HSQC spectra, along with the corresponding molecular graphs and SMILES strings. Uniquely, 2DNMRGym adopts a surrogate supervision setup: models are trained using algorithm-generated annotations derived from a previously validated method and evaluated on a held-out set of human-annotated gold-standard labels. This enables rigorous assessment of a model's ability to generalize from imperfect supervision to expert-level interpretation. We provide benchmark results using a series of 2D and 3D GNN and GNN transformer models, establishing a strong foundation for future work. 2DNMRGym supports scalable model training and introduces a chemically meaningful benchmark for evaluating atom-level molecular representations in NMR-guided structural tasks. Our data and code is open-source and available on Huggingface and Github.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Politicizing science funding undermines public trust in science, academic freedom, and the unbiased generation of knowledge"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a commentary published in mid-2024 (to which the present work is a direct response), a number of scientists argue that U.S. funding agencies have "politicized" the process by which grants are awarded, in service of diversifying the scientific workforce. The commentary in question, however, makes numerous unfounded assertions while recycling citations to a fusillade of opinion essays written by the same cabal of authors, in an effort to resemble a work of serious scholarship. Basic fact-checking is provided here, demonstrating numerous claims that are unsupported by the source material and readily debunked. The present work also serves to document the reality of inclusion and diversity plans for scientific grant proposals to U.S. funding agencies, as they existed at the end of 2024. It is intended as a bulwark against retroactive false narratives, as the U.S. moves into a period of intense antagonism towards diversity, equity, and inclusion activities.</description>

      <title>Strain Modulated Catalytic Activity of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The catalytic properties of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) in hydrogen-electrode- (HER-) based catalysts have been investigated based on state-of-the-art ab initio simulations. Our results show that the late transition metal sites (Hg and Zn) exhibit the best activity for HER in an acidic environment. Furthermore, lattice stretching and compression can effectively modulate the H binding energy, achieving almost thermoneutral adsorption at 3% compressive strain. The changes are attributed to the modulation in the d-band centers of late transition metal sites, as well as the depletion of charge population on bonding states, contributing to the destabilization of the H-metal bonds. Our contribution explores strain engineering as an effective strategy to tailor the activity of 2D mineral-based catalyst materials for HER, advancing our understanding of how mechanical manipulation can effectively modulate the catalytic properties of these materials.</description>

      <title>Competition Between Thermophoretic Separation and Thermal Convective Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In binary fluid systems under temperature differences, thermophoretic separation and thermal convective mixing are two key mechanisms that affect the processes of transport. The thermophoretic effect, also known as the Soret effect, describes the migration behavior of molecules in the fluid with temperature gradient. Thermophilic and thermophobic molecules tend to migrate to regions of higher and lower temperature. Thermal convective mixing is triggered by a Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard-type hydrodynamics instability as a macroscopic flow caused by buoyancy induced by temperature differences, promoting the mixing of different components within the fluid. There is a competition between the separation caused by thermophoresis and the mixing produced by convection. A dimensionless number, namely Soret-Rayleigh number $S_R$, which is the ratio of dimensionless Soret factor $S_T$ and Rayleigh numbers $Ra$, is introduced to quantitatively describe this competition. The impact of different $S_R$ and Rayleigh numbers $Ra$ on the concentration field is studied by energy-conserving dissipative particle dynamics (eDPD). The results indicate that the components separation exhibits a non-monotonic variation with $Ra$ increase. For a specific $S_R$, there exists an optimal $Ra$ that achieves the lowest separation at long time scales. This result will have potential implications for the design and application of micro-mixers.</description>

      <title>Temperature- and charge carrier density-dependent electronic response in methylammonium lead iodide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding carrier dynamics in photoexcited metal-halide perovskites is key for optoelectronic devices such as solar cells (low carrier densities) and lasers (high carrier densities). Trapping processes at low carrier densities and many-body recombination at high densities can significantly alter the dynamics of photoexcited carriers. Combining optical-pump/THz probe and transient absorption spectroscopy we examine carrier responses over a wide density range (10^14-10^19 cm-3) and temperatures (78-315K) in the prototypical methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. At densities below ~10^15 cm-3 (room temperature, sunlight conditions), fast carrier trapping at shallow trap states occurs within a few picoseconds. As excited carrier densities increase, trapping saturates, and the carrier response stabilizes, lasting up to hundreds of picoseconds at densities around ~10^17 cm-3. Above 10^18 cm-3 a Mott transition sets in: overlapping polaron wavefunctions lead to ultrafast annihilation through an Auger recombination process occurring over a few picoseconds. We map out trap-dominated, direct recombination-dominated, and Mott-dominated density regimes from 78-315 K, ultimately enabling the construction of an electronic phase diagram. These findings clarify carrier behavior across operational conditions, aiding material optimization for optoelectronics operating in the low (e.g. photovoltaics) and high (e.g. laser) carrier density regimes.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Kramers' Law: Hasselmann's Program and AMOC Tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In bistable dynamical systems driven by Wiener processes, the widely used Kramers' law relates the strength of the noise forcing to the average time it takes to see a noise-induced transition from one attractor to the other. We extend this law to bistable systems forced with fast chaotic dynamics, which we argue to be a more realistic modeling approach than unbounded noise forcing in some cases. We test our results numerically in a reduced-order model of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and discuss the limits of the chaotic Kramers' law as well as its surprisingly wide parameter range of applicability. Hereby, we show in detail how to apply Hasselmann's program in practice and give a possible explanation for recent findings of AMOC collapse and recovery in complex climate models.</description>

      <title>Uncovering relationships between the electronic self-energy and coupled-cluster doubles theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) amplitude equations by introduction of the particle-hole-time decoupled electronic self-energy. This leads to an alternative ground state correlation energy obtained from the Green's function formalism which is exactly of the form obtained in coupled-cluster doubles theory. We demonstrate the relationship to the ionization potential/electron affinity equation-of-motion coupled-cluster doubles (IP/EA-EOM-CCD) eigenvalue problem by coupling the reverse-time self-energy contributions while maintaining particle-hole separability. The formal relationships established are demonstrated by exact solution of the Hubbard dimer.</description>

      <title>Tokenizing Electron Cloud in Protein-Ligand Interaction Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The affinity and specificity of protein-molecule binding directly impact functional outcomes, uncovering the mechanisms underlying biological regulation and signal transduction. Most deep-learning-based prediction approaches focus on structures of atoms or fragments. However, quantum chemical properties, such as electronic structures, are the key to unveiling interaction patterns but remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ECBind, a method for tokenizing electron cloud signals into quantized embeddings, enabling their integration into downstream tasks such as binding affinity prediction. By incorporating electron densities, ECBind helps uncover binding modes that cannot be fully represented by atom-level models. Specifically, to remove the redundancy inherent in electron cloud signals, a structure-aware transformer and hierarchical codebooks encode 3D binding sites enriched with electron structures into tokens. These tokenized codes are then used for specific tasks with labels. To extend its applicability to a wider range of scenarios, we utilize knowledge distillation to develop an electron-cloud-agnostic prediction model. Experimentally, ECBind demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, achieving improvements of 6.42\% and 15.58\% in per-structure Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, respectively.</description>

      <title>Truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz: efficient quantum circuit design for quantum chemistry and material science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry and material science by offering solutions to complex problems unattainable with classical computers. However, the development of efficient quantum algorithms that are efficient under noisy conditions remains a major challenge. This paper introduces the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz (tVHA), a novel circuit design for conducting quantum calculations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. tVHA provides a promising approach for a broad range of applications by utilizing principles from the adiabatic theorem in solid state physics. Our proposed ansatz significantly reduces the parameter count and can decrease circuit size substantially, with a trade-off in accuracy. Thus, tVHA facilitates easier convergence within the variational quantum eigensolver framework compared to state-of-the-art ans\"atze such as Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) and Hardware-Efficient Ansatz (HEA). While this paper concentrates on the practical applications of tVHA in quantum chemistry, demonstrating its suitability for both weakly and strongly correlated systems and its compatibility with active space calculations, its underlying principles suggest a wider applicability extending to the broader field of material science computations on quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Electric Dipole Approximation: Electric and Magnetic Multipole Contributions Reveal Biaxial Water Structure from SFG Spectra at the Air-Water Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra has been severely limited by the absence of quantitative theoretical predictions for multipole contributions. The previously unknown magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions are determined by the bulk media but appear in all experimental SFG spectra, obscuring the connection between measured spectra and interfacial structure. We present the simulation-based framework that predicts the full set of multipole contributions to the SFG spectrum. This framework also yields depth-resolved spectra, enabling the precise localization of spectroscopic features. Applied to the air-water interface, our approach achieves quantitative agreement with experimental spectra for different polarization combinations in both the bending and stretching regions. Multipole contributions are crucial for correctly interpreting SFG spectra: in the bending band, the electric dipole contribution is of an intensity similar to the magnetic dipole contribution, and both are dominated by the electric quadrupole contribution. In the OH-stretch region, the electric quadrupole contribution is found to be responsible for the mysterious shoulder at 3600 cm$^{-1}$. Crucially, subtracting the multipole contributions isolates the second-order electric dipole susceptibility, which is a quantitative probe for interfacial orientational anisotropy. This electric-dipole susceptibility reveals a pronounced biaxial ordering of water at the air-water interface. By resolving a fundamental limitation of the interpretation of SFG spectroscopy, our framework allows for the detailed extraction of interfacial water ordering from SFG spectra.</description>

      <title>Crystallographic control of hydrogen ingress in bcc-Iron: Insights from ab initio simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen uptake into body-centered cubic (bcc) iron as a root cause for subsequent hydrogen embrittlement, is initiated at the surface. In this paper, we quantify how readily H diffuses from the surface into the bulk. We consider a set of low-index, vicinal and general Fe surfaces and treat H-permeation as a two-step process. First, density-functional calculations determine the adsorption energy of an isolated H atom at every crystallographically distinct surface site. Second, for each adsorption site we map the minimum-energy pathway that carries the atom beneath the surface and into the lattice. Across all ten orientations studied, a clear trend emerges: sites that bind hydrogen most weakly (highest adsorption energy) are the starting point of the lowest-barrier diffusion channels into the metal interior. Thus, the least-favorable adsorption pockets act as gateways for efficient subsurface penetration. These insights provide a practical design rule: suppressing or minimizing exposure of such high-energy adsorption motifs - through appropriate surface texturing or orientation control - should make bcc-iron components less susceptible to hydrogen uptake and the associated embrittlement.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Electronic Coherences from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic coherences can be leveraged to control molecular dynamics, but such control is limited by ultrafast decoherence driven by coupling between electronic excitations and molecular vibrations. With the goal of understanding and controlling electronic coherence in molecules, we introduce a first-principles approach that enables direct simulation of the creation and decay of electronic coherences in molecules. Simulations of long-lived experimentally-observed coherences created upon multiphoton excitation of thiophene reveal coherent electronic motions within a dense manifold of Rydberg states, enabled by their relatively parallel potential energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Super diffusive length dependent thermal conductivity in one-dimensional materials with structural defects: longitudinal to transverse phonon scattering leads to $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural defects in one-dimensional heat conductors couple longitudinal (stretching) and transverse (bending) vibrations. This coupling results in the scattering of longitudinal phonons to transverse phonons and backwards. We show that the decay rate of longitudinal phonons due to this scattering scales with their frequencies as $\omega^{3/2}$ within the long wavelength limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), which is more efficient scattering compared to the traditionally considered Rayleigh scattering within the longitudinal band ($\omega^2$). This scattering results in temperature independent thermal conductivity depending on the size as $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ for sufficiently long materials. This predicted length dependence is observed in nanowires, though the temperature dependence is seen there possibly because of deviations from pure one-dimensional behavior. The significant effect of interaction of longitudinal phonons with transverse phonons is consistent with the earlier observations of a substantial suppression of thermal energy transport by kinks, obviously leading to such interaction, though anharmonic interaction can also be significant.</description>

      <title>PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16381v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>

      <title>Quantum suppression of cold reactions far from the s-wave energy limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects in chemical reactions are most pronounced at ultracold temperatures, where only a few partial waves contribute. While interference among many partial waves is theoretically expected to persist at higher temperatures, direct evidence for such quantum effects in reactive processes has been lacking. Here, we report the first observation of quantum interference suppressing a chemical reaction in the multi-partial-wave regime: resonant charge exchange between a single $^{87}$Rb atom and its parent ion $^{87}$Rb$^+$. Using quantum-logic detection on a single atom-ion pair and a calibrated in-situ measurement of Langevin collision probabilities, we benchmark the thermally averaged reaction rate against both classical and quantum predictions. We find that the reaction rate is suppressed by over an order of magnitude relative to the classical expectation, despite occurring in the millikelvin temperature regime (more than three orders of magnitude above the $s$-wave threshold), where more than a dozen partial waves contribute. These results establish quantum interference as a key mechanism in chemical reactivity beyond the ultracold limit and offer a platform for probing coherent quantum effects in atom-ion reactions where \textit{ab initio} methods remain intractable.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) framework that operates on a simple yet effective premise: subtracting mixed and wrong signals to extract correct signals while providing the benefit of optimal scaling in the condition number of $A$ (denoted as $\mathcal{\kappa}$) for large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ scenarios. This approach, which leads to minimal increase in circuit depth, has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. The term `signal' refers to a feature of $|x\rangle$. We design circuits for overlap and expectation value estimation in the Psi-HHL framework. We demonstrate performance of Psi-HHL via numerical simulations. We carry out two sets of computations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) application to quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 393. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, KH, RbH, and CsH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works universally for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Mol-LLM: Multimodal Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to models that tackle diverse molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction and molecular property prediction. Large-scale molecular instruction-tuning datasets have enabled sequence-only (e.g., SMILES or SELFIES) generalist molecular LLMs, and researchers are now exploring multimodal approaches that incorporate molecular structural information for further gains. However, a genuinely multimodal, generalist LLM that covers a broad spectrum of molecular tasks has yet to be fully investigated. We observe that naive next token prediction training ignores graph-structural information, limiting an LLM's ability to exploit molecular graphs. To address this, we propose (i) Molecular structure Preference Optimization (MolPO), which facilitates graph usage by optimizing preferences between pairs of correct and perturbed molecular structures, and (ii) an advanced graph encoder with a tailored pre-training strategy to improve the effect of graph utilization by MolPO. Building on these contributions, we introduce Mol-LLM, the first multimodal generalist model that (a) handles a broad spectrum of molecular tasks among molecular LLMs, (b) explicitly leverages molecular-structure information, and (c) takes advantage of extensive instruction tuning. Mol-LLM attains state-of-the-art or comparable results across the most comprehensive molecular-LLM benchmark-even on out-of-distribution datasets for reaction and property prediction, where it surpasses prior generalist molecular LLMs by a large margin.</description>
