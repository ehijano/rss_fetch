      <title>Boosting weather forecast via generative superensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting is essential for socioeconomic activities. While data-driven forecasting demonstrates superior predictive capabilities over traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) with reduced computational demands, its deterministic nature and limited advantages over physics-based ensemble predictions restrict operational applications. We introduce the generative ensemble prediction system (GenEPS) framework to address these limitations by randomizing and mitigating both random errors and systematic biases. GenEPS provides a plug-and-play ensemble forecasting capability for deterministic models to eliminate random errors, while incorporating cross-model integration for cross-model ensembles to address systematic biases. The framework culminates in a super-ensemble approach utilizing all available data-driven models to further minimize systematic biases. GenEPS achieves an Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC) of 0.679 for 500hPa geopotential (Z500), exceeding the ECMWF Ensemble Prediction System's (ENS) ACC of 0.646. Integration of the ECMWF ensemble mean further improves the ACC to 0.683. The framework also enhances extreme event representation and produces energy spectra more consistent with ERA5 reanalysis. GenEPS establishes a new paradigm in ensemble forecasting by enabling the integration of multiple data-driven models into a high-performing super-ensemble system.</description>

      <title>Statistical Downscaling via High-Dimensional Distribution Matching with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical downscaling is a technique used in climate modeling to increase the resolution of climate simulations. High-resolution climate information is essential for various high-impact applications, including natural hazard risk assessment. However, simulating climate at high resolution is intractable. Thus, climate simulations are often conducted at a coarse scale and then downscaled to the desired resolution. Existing downscaling techniques are either simulation-based methods with high computational costs, or statistical approaches with limitations in accuracy or application specificity. We introduce Generative Bias Correction and Super-Resolution (GenBCSR), a two-stage probabilistic framework for statistical downscaling that overcomes the limitations of previous methods. GenBCSR employs two transformations to match high-dimensional distributions at different resolutions: (i) the first stage, bias correction, aligns the distributions at coarse scale, (ii) the second stage, statistical super-resolution, lifts the corrected coarse distribution by introducing fine-grained details. Each stage is instantiated by a state-of-the-art generative model, resulting in an efficient and effective computational pipeline for the well-studied distribution matching problem. By framing the downscaling problem as distribution matching, GenBCSR relaxes the constraints of supervised learning, which requires samples to be aligned. Despite not requiring such correspondence, we show that GenBCSR surpasses standard approaches in predictive accuracy of critical impact variables, particularly in predicting the tails (99% percentile) of composite indexes composed of interacting variables, achieving up to 4-5 folds of error reduction.</description>
