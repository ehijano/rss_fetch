      <title>Functional Random Forest with Adaptive Cost-Sensitive Splitting for Imbalanced Functional Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification of functional data where observations are curves or trajectories poses unique challenges, particularly under severe class imbalance. Traditional Random Forest algorithms, while robust for tabular data, often fail to capture the intrinsic structure of functional observations and struggle with minority class detection. This paper introduces Functional Random Forest with Adaptive Cost-Sensitive Splitting (FRF-ACS), a novel ensemble framework designed for imbalanced functional data classification. The proposed method leverages basis expansions and Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to represent curves efficiently, enabling trees to operate on low dimensional functional features. To address imbalance, we incorporate a dynamic cost sensitive splitting criterion that adjusts class weights locally at each node, combined with a hybrid sampling strategy integrating functional SMOTE and weighted bootstrapping. Additionally, curve specific similarity metrics replace traditional Euclidean measures to preserve functional characteristics during leaf assignment. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world datasets including biomedical signals and sensor trajectories demonstrate that FRF-ACS significantly improves minority class recall and overall predictive performance compared to existing functional classifiers and imbalance handling techniques. This work provides a scalable, interpretable solution for high dimensional functional data analysis in domains where minority class detection is critical.</description>

      <title>Provable Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Bayesian Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel diffusion-based posterior sampling method within a plug-and-play (PnP) framework. Our approach constructs a probability transport from an easy-to-sample terminal distribution to the target posterior, using a warm-start strategy to initialize the particles. To approximate the posterior score, we develop a Monte Carlo estimator in which particles are generated using Langevin dynamics, avoiding the heuristic approximations commonly used in prior work. The score governing the Langevin dynamics is learned from data, enabling the model to capture rich structural features of the underlying prior distribution. On the theoretical side, we provide non-asymptotic error bounds, showing that the method converges even for complex, multi-modal target posterior distributions. These bounds explicitly quantify the errors arising from posterior score estimation, the warm-start initialization, and the posterior sampling procedure. Our analysis further clarifies how the prior score-matching error and the condition number of the Bayesian inverse problem influence overall performance. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method across a range of inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Worst-case generation via minimax optimization in Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Worst-case generation plays a critical role in evaluating robustness and stress-testing systems under distribution shifts, in applications ranging from machine learning models to power grids and medical prediction systems. We develop a generative modeling framework for worst-case generation for a pre-specified risk, based on min-max optimization over continuous probability distributions, namely the Wasserstein space. Unlike traditional discrete distributionally robust optimization approaches, which often suffer from scalability issues, limited generalization, and costly worst-case inference, our framework exploits the Brenier theorem to characterize the least favorable (worst-case) distribution as the pushforward of a transport map from a continuous reference measure, enabling a continuous and expressive notion of risk-induced generation beyond classical discrete DRO formulations. Based on the min-max formulation, we propose a Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA)-type scheme that updates the decision model and the transport map in a single loop, establishing global convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions and possibly without convexity-concavity. We also propose to parameterize the transport map using a neural network that can be trained simultaneously with the GDA iterations by matching the transported training samples, thereby achieving a simulation-free approach. The efficiency of the proposed method as a risk-induced worst-case generator is validated by numerical experiments on synthetic and image data.</description>

      <title>Heuristics for Combinatorial Optimization via Value-based Reinforcement Learning: A Unified Framework and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the 1990s, considerable empirical work has been carried out to train statistical models, such as neural networks (NNs), as learned heuristics for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. When successful, such an approach eliminates the need for experts to design heuristics per problem type. Due to their structure, many hard CO problems are amenable to treatment through reinforcement learning (RL). Indeed, we find a wealth of literature training NNs using value-based, policy gradient, or actor-critic approaches, with promising results, both in terms of empirical optimality gaps and inference runtimes. Nevertheless, there has been a paucity of theoretical work undergirding the use of RL for CO problems. To this end, we introduce a unified framework to model CO problems through Markov decision processes (MDPs) and solve them using RL techniques. We provide easy-to-test assumptions under which CO problems can be formulated as equivalent undiscounted MDPs that provide optimal solutions to the original CO problems. Moreover, we establish conditions under which value-based RL techniques converge to approximate solutions of the CO problem with a guarantee on the associated optimality gap. Our convergence analysis provides: (1) a sufficient rate of increase in batch size and projected gradient descent steps at each RL iteration; (2) the resulting optimality gap in terms of problem parameters and targeted RL accuracy; and (3) the importance of a choice of state-space embedding. Together, our analysis illuminates the success (and limitations) of the celebrated deep Q-learning algorithm in this problem context.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Function-Valued Responses under Min-Max Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is widely used for optimizing expensive black box functions, but most existing approaches focus on scalar responses. In many scientific and engineering settings the response is functional, varying smoothly over an index such as time or wavelength, which makes classical formulations inadequate. Existing methods often minimize integrated error, which captures average performance but neglects worst case deviations. To address this limitation we propose min-max Functional Bayesian Optimization (MM-FBO), a framework that directly minimizes the maximum error across the functional domain. Functional responses are represented using functional principal component analysis, and Gaussian process surrogates are constructed for the principal component scores. Building on this representation, MM-FBO introduces an integrated uncertainty acquisition function that balances exploitation of worst case expected error with exploration across the functional domain. We provide two theoretical guarantees: a discretization bound for the worst case objective, and a consistency result showing that as the surrogate becomes accurate and uncertainty vanishes, the acquisition converges to the true min-max objective. We validate the method through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and physics inspired case studies involving electromagnetic scattering by metaphotonic devices and vapor phase infiltration. Results show that MM-FBO consistently outperforms existing baselines and highlights the importance of explicitly modeling functional uncertainty in Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <title>Softly Symbolifying Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising path toward interpretable machine learning: their learnable activations can be studied individually, while collectively fitting complex data accurately. In practice, however, trained activations often lack symbolic fidelity, learning pathological decompositions with no meaningful correspondence to interpretable forms. We propose Softly Symbolified Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (S2KAN), which integrate symbolic primitives directly into training. Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines. We demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy with substantially smaller models across symbolic benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, and observe evidence of emergent self-sparsification even without regularization pressure.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Networks for Electrical Load Time Series Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Fourier-enhanced recurrent neural network (RNN) for downscaling electrical loads. The model combines (i) a recurrent backbone driven by low-resolution inputs, (ii) explicit Fourier seasonal embeddings fused in latent space, and (iii) a self-attention layer that captures dependencies among high-resolution components within each period. Across four PJM territories, the approach yields RMSE lower and flatter horizon-wise than classical Prophet baselines (with and without seasonality/LAA) and than RNN ablations without attention or Fourier features.</description>

      <title>CrowdLLM: Building LLM-Based Digital Populations Augmented with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked much interest in creating LLM-based digital populations that can be applied to many applications such as social simulation, crowdsourcing, marketing, and recommendation systems. A digital population can reduce the cost of recruiting human participants and alleviate many concerns related to human subject study. However, research has found that most of the existing works rely solely on LLMs and could not sufficiently capture the accuracy and diversity of a real human population. To address this limitation, we propose CrowdLLM that integrates pretrained LLMs and generative models to enhance the diversity and fidelity of the digital population. We conduct theoretical analysis of CrowdLLM regarding its great potential in creating cost-effective, sufficiently representative, scalable digital populations that can match the quality of a real crowd. Comprehensive experiments are also conducted across multiple domains (e.g., crowdsourcing, voting, user rating) and simulation studies which demonstrate that CrowdLLM achieves promising performance in both accuracy and distributional fidelity to human data.</description>

      <title>LUNA: Linear Universal Neural Attention with Generalization Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling attention faces a critical bottleneck: the $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ quadratic computational cost of softmax attention, which limits its application in long-sequence domains. While linear attention mechanisms reduce this cost to $\mathcal{O}(n)$, they typically rely on fixed random feature maps, such as random Fourier features or hand-crafted functions. This reliance on static, data-agnostic kernels creates a fundamental trade-off, forcing practitioners to sacrifice significant model accuracy for computational efficiency. We introduce \textsc{LUNA}, a kernelized linear attention mechanism that eliminates this trade-off, retaining linear cost while matching and surpassing the accuracy of quadratic attention. \textsc{LUNA} is built on the key insight that the kernel feature map itself should be learned rather than fixed a priori. By parameterizing the kernel, \textsc{LUNA} learns a feature basis tailored to the specific data and task, overcoming the expressive limitations of fixed-feature methods. \textsc{Luna} implements this with a learnable feature map that induces a positive-definite kernel and admits a streaming form, yielding linear time and memory scaling in the sequence length. Empirical evaluations validate our approach across diverse settings. On the Long Range Arena (LRA), \textsc{Luna} achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy among efficient Transformers under compute parity, using the same parameter count, training steps, and approximate FLOPs. \textsc{Luna} also excels at post-hoc conversion: replacing softmax in fine-tuned BERT and ViT-B/16 checkpoints and briefly fine-tuning recovers most of the original performance, substantially outperforming fixed linearizations.</description>

Abstract: We study the expressivity of one-dimensional (1D) ReLU deep neural networks through the lens of their linear regions. For randomly initialized, fully connected 1D ReLU networks (He scaling with nonzero bias) in the infinite-width limit, we prove that the expected number of linear regions grows as $\sum_{i = 1}^L n_i + \mathop{{o}}\left(\sum_{i = 1}^L{n_i}\right) + 1$, where $n_\ell$ denotes the number of neurons in the $\ell$-th hidden layer. We also propose a function-adaptive notion of sparsity that compares the expected regions used by the network to the minimal number needed to approximate a target within a fixed tolerance.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Semiparametric Mixture Cure (Frailty) Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, mixture cure models have gained increasing popularity in survival analysis as an alternative to the Cox proportional hazards model, particularly in settings where a subset of patients is considered cured. The proportional hazards mixture cure model is especially advantageous when the presence of a cured fraction can be reasonably assumed, providing a more accurate representation of long-term survival dynamics. In this study, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for the semiparametric mixture cure model, which accommodates both the inclusion and exclusion of a frailty component, allowing for greater flexibility in capturing unobserved heterogeneity among patients. Samples from the posterior distribution are obtained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, leveraging a hierarchical structure inspired by Bayesian Lasso. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted across diverse scenarios to evaluate the performance and robustness of the proposed models. Bayesian model comparison and assessment are performed using various criteria. Finally, the proposed approaches are applied to two well-known datasets in the cure model literature: the E1690 melanoma trial and a colon cancer clinical trial.</description>

      <title>Distributional Random Forests for Complex Survey Designs on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study estimation of the conditional law $P(Y|X=\mathbf{x})$ and continuous functionals $\Psi(P(Y|X=\mathbf{x}))$ when $Y$ takes values in a locally compact Polish space, $X \in \mathbb{R}^p$, and the observations arise from a complex survey design. We propose a survey-calibrated distributional random forest (SDRF) that incorporates complex-design features via a pseudo-population bootstrap, PSU-level honesty, and a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) split criterion computed from kernel mean embeddings of H\'{a}jek-type (design-weighted) node distributions. We provide a framework for analyzing forest-style estimators under survey designs; establish design consistency for the finite-population target and model consistency for the super-population target under explicit conditions on the design, kernel, resampling multipliers, and tree partitions. As far as we are aware, these are the first results on model-free estimation of conditional distributions under survey designs. Simulations under a stratified two-stage cluster design provide finite sample performance and demonstrate the statistical error price of ignoring the survey design. The broad applicability of SDRF is demonstrated using NHANES: We estimate the tolerance regions of the conditional joint distribution of two diabetes biomarkers, illustrating how distributional heterogeneity can support subgroup-specific risk profiling for diabetes mellitus in the U.S. population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Input features are conventionally represented as vectors, matrices, or third order tensors in the real field, for color image classification. Inspired by the success of quaternion data modeling for color images in image recovery and denoising tasks, we propose a novel classification method for color image classification, named as the Low-rank Support Quaternion Matrix Machine (LSQMM), in which the RGB channels are treated as pure quaternions to effectively preserve the intrinsic coupling relationships among channels via the quaternion algebra. For the purpose of promoting low-rank structures resulting from strongly correlated color channels, a quaternion nuclear norm regularization term, serving as a natural extension of the conventional matrix nuclear norm to the quaternion domain, is added to the hinge loss in our LSQMM model. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based iterative algorithm is designed to effectively resolve the proposed quaternion optimization model. Experimental results on multiple color image classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed classification approach exhibits advantages in classification accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency, compared to several state-of-the-art methods using support vector machines, support matrix machines, and support tensor machines.</description>

      <title>A Multivariate Bernoulli-Based Sampling Method for Multi-Label Data with Application to Meta-Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08371v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Datasets may contain observations with multiple labels. If the labels are not mutually exclusive, and if the labels vary greatly in frequency, obtaining a sample that includes sufficient observations with scarcer labels to make inferences about those labels, and which deviates from the population frequencies in a known manner, creates challenges. In this paper, we consider a multivariate Bernoulli distribution as our underlying distribution of a multi-label problem. We present a novel sampling algorithm that takes label dependencies into account. It uses observed label frequencies to estimate multivariate Bernoulli distribution parameters and calculate weights for each label combination. This approach ensures the weighted sampling acquires target distribution characteristics while accounting for label dependencies. We applied this approach to a sample of research articles from Web of Science labeled with 64 biomedical topic categories. We aimed to preserve category frequency order, reduce frequency differences between most and least common categories, and account for category dependencies. This approach produced a more balanced sub-sample, enhancing the representation of minority categories.</description>

      <title>A Distribution Testing Approach to Clustering Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the following distribution clustering problem: Given a hidden partition of $k$ distributions into two groups, such that the distributions within each group are the same, and the two distributions associated with the two clusters are $\varepsilon$-far in total variation, the goal is to recover the partition. We establish upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity for two fundamental cases: (1) when one of the cluster's distributions is known, and (2) when both are unknown. Our upper and lower bounds characterize the sample complexity's dependence on the domain size $n$, number of distributions $k$, size $r$ of one of the clusters, and distance $\varepsilon$. In particular, we achieve tightness with respect to $(n,k,r,\varepsilon)$ (up to an $O(\log k)$ factor) for all regimes.</description>

      <title>Minimax and Bayes Optimal Adaptive Experimental Design for Treatment Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an adaptive experiment for treatment choice and design a minimax and Bayes optimal adaptive experiment with respect to regret. Given binary treatments, the experimenter's goal is to choose the treatment with the highest expected outcome through an adaptive experiment, in order to maximize welfare. We consider adaptive experiments that consist of two phases, the treatment allocation phase and the treatment choice phase. The experiment starts with the treatment allocation phase, where the experimenter allocates treatments to experimental subjects to gather observations. During this phase, the experimenter can adaptively update the allocation probabilities using the observations obtained in the experiment. After the allocation phase, the experimenter proceeds to the treatment choice phase, where one of the treatments is selected as the best. For this adaptive experimental procedure, we propose an adaptive experiment that splits the treatment allocation phase into two stages, where we first estimate the standard deviations and then allocate each treatment proportionally to its standard deviation. We show that this experiment, often referred to as Neyman allocation, is minimax and Bayes optimal in the sense that its regret upper bounds exactly match the lower bounds that we derive. To show this optimality, we derive minimax and Bayes lower bounds for the regret using change-of-measure arguments. Then, we evaluate the corresponding upper bounds using the central limit theorem and large deviation bounds.</description>

      <title>DS FedProxGrad: Asymptotic Stationarity Without Noise Floor in Fair Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08671v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work \cite{arifgroup} introduced Federated Proximal Gradient \textbf{(\texttt{FedProxGrad})} for solving non-convex composite optimization problems in group fair federated learning. However, the original analysis established convergence only to a \textit{noise-dominated neighborhood of stationarity}, with explicit dependence on a variance-induced noise floor. In this work, we provide an improved asymptotic convergence analysis for a generalized \texttt{FedProxGrad}-type analytical framework with inexact local proximal solutions and explicit fairness regularization. We call this extended analytical framework \textbf{DS \texttt{FedProxGrad}} (Decay Step Size \texttt{FedProxGrad}). Under a Robbins-Monro step-size schedule \cite{robbins1951stochastic} and a mild decay condition on local inexactness, we prove that $\liminf_{r\to\infty} \mathbb{E}[\|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}^r)\|^2] = 0$, i.e., the algorithm is asymptotically stationary and the convergence rate does not depend on a variance-induced noise floor.</description>

      <title>Prediction Intervals for Individual Treatment Effects in a Multiple Decision Point Framework using Conformal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying uncertainty of individual treatment effects (ITEs) across multiple decision points is crucial for personalized decision-making in fields such as healthcare, finance, education, and online marketplaces. Previous work has focused on predicting non-causal longitudinal estimands or constructing prediction bands for ITEs using cross-sectional data based on exchangeability assumptions. We propose a novel method for constructing prediction intervals using conformal inference techniques for time-varying ITEs with weaker assumptions than prior literature. We guarantee a lower bound for coverage, which is dependent on the degree of non-exchangeability in the data. Although our method is broadly applicable across decision-making contexts, we support our theoretical claims with simulations emulating micro-randomized trials (MRTs) -- a sequential experimental design for mobile health (mHealth) studies. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method by applying it to a real-world MRT - the Intern Health Study (IHS).</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Density Estimates with Topological Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel density estimation is a key component of a wide variety of algorithms in machine learning, Bayesian inference, stochastic dynamics and signal processing. However, the unsupervised density estimation technique requires tuning a crucial hyperparameter: the kernel bandwidth. The choice of bandwidth is critical as it controls the bias-variance trade-off by over- or under-smoothing the topological features. Topological data analysis provides methods to mathematically quantify topological characteristics, such as connected components, loops, voids et cetera, even in high dimensions where visualization of density estimates is impossible. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach using a topology-based loss function for the automated and unsupervised selection of the optimal bandwidth and benchmark it against classical techniques -- demonstrating its potential across different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Survey of Data-driven Newsvendor: Unified Analysis and Spectrum of Achievable Regrets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03505v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Newsvendor problem, the goal is to guess the number that will be drawn from some distribution, with asymmetric consequences for guessing too high vs. too low. In the data-driven version, the distribution is unknown, and one must work with samples from the distribution. Data-driven Newsvendor has been studied under many variants: additive vs. multiplicative regret, high probability vs. expectation bounds, and different distribution classes. This paper studies all combinations of these variants, filling in many gaps in the literature and simplifying many proofs. In particular, we provide a unified analysis based on the notion of clustered distributions, which in conjunction with our new lower bounds, shows that the entire spectrum of regrets between $1/\sqrt{n}$ and $1/n$ can be possible. Simulations on commonly-used distributions demonstrate that our notion is the "correct" predictor of empirical regret across varying data sizes.</description>

      <title>Median Consensus Embedding for Dimensionality Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes median consensus embedding (MCE) to address variability in low-dimensional embeddings caused by random initialization in nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques such as $t$-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. MCE is defined as the geometric median of multiple embeddings. By assuming multiple embeddings as independent and identically distributed random samples and applying large deviation theory, we prove that MCE achieves consistency at an exponential rate. Furthermore, we develop a practical algorithm to implement MCE by constructing a distance function between embeddings based on the Frobenius norm of the pairwise distance matrix of data points. Application to actual data demonstrates that MCE converges rapidly and effectively reduces instability. We further combine MCE with multiple imputation to address missing values and consider multiscale hyperparameters. Results confirm that MCE effectively mitigates instability issues in embedding methods arising from random initialization and other sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish non-asymptotic bounds for accuracy of normal approximation for linear two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA) algorithms driven by martingale difference or Markov noise. Focusing on both the last iterate and Polyak-Ruppert averaging regimes, we derive bounds for normal approximation in terms of the convex distance between probability distributions. Our analysis reveals a non-trivial interaction between the fast and slow timescales: the normal approximation rate for the last iterate improves as the timescale separation increases, while it decreases in the Polyak-Ruppert averaged setting. We also provide the high-order moment bounds for the error of linear TTSA algorithm, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Discovering Influential Factors in Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.01804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of machine learning, it is still a critical issue to identify and supervise the learned representation without manually intervening or intuition assistance to extract useful knowledge or serve for the downstream tasks. In this work, we focus on supervising the influential factors extracted by the variational autoencoder(VAE). The VAE is proposed to learn independent low dimension representation while facing the problem that sometimes pre-set factors are ignored. We argue that the mutual information of the input and each learned factor of the representation plays a necessary indicator of discovering the influential factors. We find the VAE objective inclines to induce mutual information sparsity in factor dimension over the data intrinsic dimension and therefore result in some non-influential factors whose function on data reconstruction could be ignored. We show mutual information also influences the lower bound of the VAE's reconstruction error and downstream classification task. To make such indicator applicable, we design an algorithm for calculating the mutual information for the VAE and prove its consistency. Experimental results on MNIST, CelebA and DEAP datasets show that mutual information can help determine influential factors, of which some are interpretable and can be used to further generation and classification tasks, and help discover the variant that connects with emotion on DEAP dataset.</description>

      <title>Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, we introduce curved neural networks as a class of models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing higher-order phenomena in complex networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard deep learning architectures used for classification generate label predictions with a projection head and softmax activation function. Although successful, these methods fail to leverage the relational information between samples for generating label predictions. In recent works, graph-based learning techniques, namely Laplace learning, have been heuristically combined with neural networks for both supervised and semi-supervised learning (SSL) tasks. However, prior works approximate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the graph learning algorithm or decouple the processes; end-to-end integration with neural networks is not achieved. In this work, we derive backpropagation equations, via the adjoint method, for inclusion of a general family of graph learning layers into a neural network. The resulting method, distinct from graph neural networks, allows us to precisely integrate similarity graph construction and graph Laplacian-based label propagation into a neural network layer, replacing a projection head and softmax activation function for general classification task. Our experimental results demonstrate smooth label transitions across data, improved generalization and robustness to adversarial attacks, and improved training dynamics compared to a standard softmax-based approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series prediction underpins a broad range of downstream tasks across many scientific domains. Recent advances and increasing adoption of black-box machine learning models for time series prediction highlight the critical need for reliable uncertainty quantification. While conformal prediction has gained attention as a reliable uncertainty quantification method, conformal prediction for time series faces two key challenges: (1) adaptively leveraging correlations in features and non-conformity scores to overcome the exchangeability assumption, and (2) constructing prediction sets for multi-dimensional outcomes. To address these challenges jointly, we propose a novel conformal prediction method for time series using flow with classifier-free guidance. We provide coverage guarantees by establishing exact non-asymptotic marginal coverage and a finite-sample bound on conditional coverage for the proposed method. Evaluations on real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our method constructs significantly smaller prediction sets than existing conformal prediction methods while maintaining target coverage.</description>

      <title>Proper Learnability and the Role of Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proper learning refers to the setting in which learners must emit predictors in the underlying hypothesis class $H$, and often leads to learners with simple algorithmic forms (e.g. empirical risk minimization (ERM), structural risk minimization (SRM)). The limitation of proper learning, however, is that there exist problems which can only be learned improperly, e.g. in multiclass classification. Thus, we ask: Under what assumptions on the hypothesis class or the information provided to the learner is a problem properly learnable? We first demonstrate that when the unlabeled data distribution is given, there always exists an optimal proper learner governed by distributional regularization, a randomized generalization of regularization. We refer to this setting as the distribution-fixed PAC model, and continue to evaluate the learner on its worst-case performance over all distributions. Our result holds for all metric loss functions and any finite learning problem (with no dependence on its size). Further, we demonstrate that sample complexities in the distribution-fixed PAC model can shrink by only a logarithmic factor from the classic PAC model, strongly refuting the role of unlabeled data in PAC learning (from a worst-case perspective).
  We complement this with impossibility results which obstruct any characterization of proper learnability in the realizable PAC model. First, we observe that there are problems whose proper learnability is logically undecidable, i.e., independent of the ZFC axioms. We then show that proper learnability is not a monotone property of the underlying hypothesis class, and that it is not a local property (in a precise sense). Our impossibility results all hold even for the fundamental setting of multiclass classification, and go through a reduction of EMX learning (Ben-David et al., 2019) to proper classification which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Few-Shot Image Fusion: Granular Ball Priors Enable General-Purpose Deep Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08937v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In image fusion tasks, the absence of real fused images as priors forces most deep learning approaches to rely on large-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features or to generate pseudo-supervised images through algorithmic constructions. Unlike previous methods, this work re-examines prior-guided learning under few-shot conditions by introducing rough set theory. We regard the traditional algorithm as a prior generator, while the network re-inferrs and adaptively optimizes the prior through a dynamic loss function, reducing the inference burden of the network and enabling effective few-shot learning.To provide the prior, we propose the Granular Ball Pixel Computation (GBPC) algorithm. GBPC models pixel pairs in a luminance subspace using meta-granular balls and mines intra-ball information at multiple granular levels. At the fine-grained level, sliding granular balls assign adaptive weights to individual pixels to produce pixel-level prior fusion. At the coarse-grained level, the algorithm performs split computation within a single image to estimate positive and boundary domain distributions, enabling modality awareness and prior confidence estimation, which dynamically guide the loss weighting.The network and the algorithmic prior are coupled through the loss function to form an integrated framework. Thanks to the dynamic weighting mechanism, the network can adaptively adjust to different priors during training, enhancing its perception and fusion capability across modalities. We name this framework GBFF (Granular Ball Fusion Framework). Experiments on four fusion tasks demonstrate that even with only ten training image pairs per task, GBFF achieves superior performance in both visual quality and model compactness.

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are widely used in biology to understand how individual actions scale into emergent population behavior. Modelers employ sensitivity analysis (SA) algorithms to quantify input parameters' impact on model outputs, however, it is hard to perform SA for ABMs due to their computational and complex nature. In this work, we develop the Simulate, Summarize, Reduce, Cluster, and Analyze (SSRCA) methodology, a machine-learning based pipeline designed to facilitate SA for ABMs. In particular, SSRCA can achieve the following tasks for ABMS: 1) identify sensitive model parameters, 2) reveal common output model patterns, and 3) determine which input parameter values generate these patterns. We use an example ABM of tumor spheroid growth to showcase how SSRCA identifies four common patterns from the ABM and the parameter regions that generate these outputs. Additionally, we compare the SA results between SSRCA and the popular Sobol' Method and find that SSRCA's identified sensitive parameters are robust to the choice of model descriptors while Sobol's are not. This analysis could streamline data-driven tasks, such as parameter estimation, for ABMs by reducing parameter space. While we highlight these results with an ABM on tumor spheroid formation, the SSRCA Methodology is broadly applicable to biological ABMs.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Adaptation as Posterior Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptation is the holy grail of intelligence, but even the best AI models lack the adaptability of toddlers. In spite of great progress, little is known about the mechanisms by which machines can learn to adapt as fast as humans and animals. Here, we cast adaptation as `correction' of old posteriors and show that a wide-variety of existing adaptation methods follow this very principle, including those used for continual learning, federated learning, unlearning, and model merging. In all these settings, more accurate posteriors often lead to smaller corrections and can enable faster adaptation. Posterior correction is derived by using the dual representation of the Bayesian Learning Rule of Khan and Rue (2023), where the interference between the old representation and new information is quantified by using the natural-gradient mismatch. We present many examples demonstrating how machines can learn to adapt quickly by using posterior correction.</description>

      <title>Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Forecasting of Complex Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most applications in high-dimensional complex systems predict future states individually. This approach struggles to model complex temporal dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of uncertainty inherent to the systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5-degree resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines, including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful general framework for tackling diffusion-based dynamics forecasting problems where modeling uncertainty propagation is paramount.</description>

      <title>Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However, it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve generalization by optimizing in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a new hyperparameter to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective generalization and scales to large models such as LLAMA3-8B. Furthermore, as a result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty quantification. We test ABMLL on CrossFit and Unified-QA datasets and find that it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and expected calibration error.</description>

      <title>Contractive kinetic Langevin samplers beyond global Lipschitz continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the problem of sampling from log-concave distributions with (possibly) superlinear gradient growth under kinetic (underdamped) Langevin algorithms. Using a carefully tailored taming scheme, we propose two novel discretizations of the kinetic Langevin SDE, and we show that they are both contractive and satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality. Building on this, we establish a series of non-asymptotic bounds in $2$-Wasserstein distance between the law reached by each algorithm and the underlying target measure.</description>

      <title>Graph Coloring for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby potentially reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align.</description>

      <title>CLAPS: Posterior-Aware Conformal Intervals via Last-Layer Laplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CLAPS, a posterior-aware conformal regression method that pairs a Last-Layer Laplace Approximation with split-conformal calibration. From the resulting Gaussian posterior, CLAPS defines a simple two-sided posterior CDF score that aligns the conformity metric with the full predictive shape, not just a point estimate. This alignment yields narrower prediction intervals at the same target coverage, especially on small to medium tabular datasets where data are scarce and uncertainty modeling matters. We also provide a lightweight diagnostic suite that separates aleatoric and epistemic components and visualizes posterior behavior, helping practitioners understand why intervals shrink when they do. Across multiple benchmarks using the same MLP backbone, CLAPS consistently attains nominal coverage with improved efficiency and minimal overhead, offering a clear, practical upgrade to residual-based conformal baselines.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Curse of Detail: Scaling Arguments for Feature Learning and Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two pressing topics in the theory of deep learning are the interpretation of feature learning mechanisms and the determination of implicit bias of networks in the rich regime. Current theories of rich feature learning, often appear in the form of high-dimensional non-linear equations, which require computationally intensive numerical solutions. Given the many details that go into defining a deep learning problem, this complexity is a significant and often unavoidable challenge. Here, we propose a powerful heuristic route for predicting the data and width scales at which various patterns of feature learning emerge. This form of scale analysis is considerably simpler than exact theories and reproduces the scaling exponents of various known results. In addition, we make novel predictions on complex toy architectures, such as three-layer non-linear networks and attention heads, thus extending the scope of first-principle theories of deep learning.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Scientific Machine Learning using Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SVGP KAN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks have emerged as interpretable alternatives to traditional multi-layer perceptrons. However, standard implementations lack principled uncertainty quantification capabilities essential for many scientific applications. We present a framework integrating sparse variational Gaussian process inference with the Kolmogorov-Arnold topology, enabling scalable Bayesian inference with computational complexity quasi-linear in sample size. Through analytic moment matching, we propagate uncertainty through deep additive structures while maintaining interpretability. We use three example studies to demonstrate the framework's ability to distinguish aleatoric from epistemic uncertainty: calibration of heteroscedastic measurement noise in fluid flow reconstruction, quantification of prediction confidence degradation in multi-step forecasting of advection-diffusion dynamics, and out-of-distribution detection in convolutional autoencoders. These results suggest Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SVGP KANs) is a promising architecture for uncertainty-aware learning in scientific machine learning.</description>
