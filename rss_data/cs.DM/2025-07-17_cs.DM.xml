      <title>The Directed Disjoint Paths Problem with Congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic result by Fortune, Hopcroft, and Wyllie [TCS~'80] states that the directed disjoint paths problem is NP-complete even for two pairs of terminals. Extending this well-known result, we show that the directed disjoint paths problem is NP-complete for any constant congestion $c \geq 1$ and~$k \geq 3c-1$ pairs of terminals. This refutes a conjecture by Giannopoulou et al. [SODA~'22], which says that the directed disjoint paths problem with congestion two is polynomial-time solvable for any constant number $k$ of terminal pairs. We then consider the cases that are not covered by this hardness result. The first nontrivial case is $c=2$ and $k = 3$. Our second main result is to show that this case is polynomial-time solvable.</description>

      <title>Multiset Metric Dimension of Binomial Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a graph $G = (V,E)$ and a subset $R \subseteq V$, we say that $R$ is \textit{multiset resolving} for $G$ if for every pair of vertices $v,w$, the \textit{multisets} $\{d(v,r): r \in R\}$ and $\{d(w,r):r \in R\}$ are distinct, where $d(x,y)$ is the graph distance between vertices $x$ and $y$. The \textit{multiset metric dimension} of $G$ is the size of a smallest set $R \subseteq V$ that is multiset resolving (or $\infty$ if no such set exists). This graph parameter was introduced by Simanjuntak, Siagian, and Vitr\'{i}k in 2017~\cite{simanjuntak2017multiset}, and has since been studied for a variety of graph families. We prove bounds which hold with high probability for the multiset metric dimension of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ in the regime $d = (n-1)p = \Theta(n^{x})$ for fixed $x \in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>New allocation rule based on graph structures and their application to economic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the \emph{edge-based Shapley value}, a novel allocation rule within cooperative game theory, specifically tailored for networked systems, where value is generated through interactions represented by edges. Traditional allocation rules, such as the Shapley and Myerson values, evaluate player contributions based on node-level characteristics, or connected components. However, these approaches often fail to adequately capture the functional role of edges, which are crucial in systems such as supply chains and digital platforms, where interactions, rather than individual agents, are the primary drivers of value. Our edge-based Shapley value shifts the characteristic function from node sets to edge sets, thereby enabling a more granular and context-sensitive evaluation of the contributions. We establish its theoretical foundations, demonstrate its relationship to classical allocation rules, and show that it retains key properties such as fairness and symmetry. To illustrate its applicability, we present two use cases: content platform networks and supply chain logistics (SCL). In both cases, our method produces intuitive and structurally consistent allocations, particularly in scenarios with overlapping routes, exclusive contracts or cost-sensitive paths. This framework offers a new perspective on value attribution in cooperative settings with complex interaction structures and provides practical tools for analyzing real-world economic and logistical networks.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable butterfly minors in digraphs of large cycle rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cycle rank is one of the depth parameters for digraphs introduced by Eggan in 1963. We show that there exists a function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that every digraph of cycle rank at least $f(k)$ contains a directed cycle chain, a directed ladder, or a directed tree chain of order $k$ as a butterfly minor. We also investigate a new connection between cycle rank and a directed analogue of the weak coloring number of graphs.</description>

      <title>Matroids are Equitable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if the ground set of a matroid can be partitioned into $k\ge 2$ bases, then for any given subset $S$ of the ground set, there is a partition into $k$ bases such that the sizes of the intersections of the bases with $S$ may differ by at most one. This settles the matroid equitability conjecture by Fekete and Szab\'o (Electron.~J.~Comb.~2011) in the affirmative. We also investigate equitable splittings of two disjoint sets $S_1$ and $S_2$, and show that there is a partition into $k$ bases such that the sizes of the intersections with $S_1$ may differ by at most one and the sizes of the intersections with $S_2$ may differ by at most two; this is the best possible one can hope for arbitrary matroids.
  We also derive applications of this result into matroid constrained fair division problems. We show that there exists a matroid-constrained fair division that is envy-free up to 1 item if the valuations are identical and tri-valued additive. We also show that for bi-valued additive valuations, there exists a matroid-constrained allocation that provides everyone their maximin share.</description>

      <title>A near-complete resolution of the exponential-time complexity of k-opt for the traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $k$-opt algorithm is one of the simplest and most widely used heuristics for solving the traveling salesman problem. Starting from an arbitrary tour, the $k$-opt algorithm improves the current tour in each iteration by exchanging up to $k$ edges. The algorithm continues until no further improvement of this kind is possible. For a long time, it remained an open question how many iterations the $k$-opt algorithm might require for small values of $k$, assuming the use of an optimal pivot rule. In this paper, we resolve this question for the cases $k = 3$ and $k = 4$ by proving that in both these cases an exponential number of iterations may be needed even if an optimal pivot rule is used. Combined with a recent result from Heimann, Hoang, and Hougardy (ICALP 2024), this provides a complete answer for all $k \geq 3$ regarding the number of iterations the $k$-opt algorithm may require under an optimal pivot rule. In addition we establish an analogous exponential lower bound for the 2.5-opt algorithm, a variant that generalizes 2-opt and is a restricted version of 3-opt. All our results hold for both the general and the metric traveling salesman problem.</description>

      <title>Modeling Feasible Locomotion of Nanobots for Cancer Detection and Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying motile nanosized particles, also known as ``nanobots'', in the human body promises to improve selectivity in drug delivery and reduce side effects. We consider a swarm of nanobots locating a single cancerous region and treating it by releasing an onboard payload of drugs at the site. At nanoscale, the computation, communication, sensing, and locomotion capabilities of individual agents are extremely limited, noisy, and/or nonexistent.
  We present a general model to formally describe the individual and collective behavior of agents in a colloidal environment, such as the bloodstream, for cancer detection and treatment by nanobots. This includes a feasible and precise model of agent locomotion, inspired by actual nanoparticles that, in the presence of an external chemical gradient, move towards areas of higher concentration by means of self-propulsion. We present two variants of our general model: The first assumes an endogenous chemical gradient that is fixed over time and centered at the targeted cancer site; the second is a more speculative and dynamic variant in which agents themselves create and amplify a chemical gradient centered at the cancer site. In both settings, agents can sense the gradient and ascend it noisily, locating the cancer site more quickly than via simple Brownian motion.
  For the first variant of the model, we present simulation results to show the behavior of agents under our locomotion model, as well as {analytical results} to bound the time it takes for the agents to reach the cancer site. For the second variant, simulation results highlight the collective benefit in having agents issue their own chemical signal. While arguably more speculative in its agent capability assumptions, this variant shows a significant improvement in runtime performance over the first variant, resulting from its chemical signal amplification mechanism.</description>

      <title>Sparse Approximation in Lattices and Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the following question: Suppose that there exist an integer or a non-negative integer solution $x$ to a system $Ax = b$, where the number of non-zero components of $x$ is $n$. The target is, for a given natural number $k &lt; n$, to approximate $b$ with $Ay$ where $y$ is an integer or non-negative integer solution with at most $k$ non-zero components. We establish upper bounds for this question in general. In specific cases, these bounds are tight. If we view the approximation quality as a function of the parameter $k$, then the paper explains why the quality of the approximation increases exponentially as $k$ goes to $n$. This paper is a complete version of an extended abstract that appeared at the 26th International Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization (IPCO).</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparse Flow Decomposition Methods for RNA Multi-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14662v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decomposing a flow on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into a weighted sum of a small number of paths is an essential task in operations research and bioinformatics. This problem, referred to as Sparse Flow Decomposition (SFD), has gained significant interest, in particular for its application in RNA transcript multi-assembly, the identification of the multiple transcripts corresponding to a given gene and their relative abundance. Several recent approaches cast SFD variants as integer optimization problems, motivated by the NP-hardness of the formulations they consider. We propose an alternative formulation of SFD as a data fitting problem on the conic hull of the flow polytope. By reformulating the problem on the flow polytope for compactness and solving it using specific variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, we obtain a method converging rapidly to the minimizer of the chosen loss function while producing a parsimonious decomposition. Our approach subsumes previous formulations of SFD with exact and inexact flows and can model different priors on the error distributions. Computational experiments show that our method outperforms recent integer optimization approaches in runtime, but is also highly competitive in terms of reconstruction of the underlying transcripts, despite not explicitly minimizing the solution cardinality.</description>

      <title>Graph Local Complementation is Inherently Sequential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local complementation of a graph $G$ on vertex $v$ is an operation that results in a new graph $G*v$, where the neighborhood of $v$ is complemented. This operation has been widely studied in graph theory and quantum computing.
  This article introduces the Local Complementation Problem, a decision problem that captures the complexity of applying a sequence of local complementations. Given a graph $G$, a sequence of vertices $s$, and a pair of vertices $u,v$, the problem asks whether the edge $(u,v)$ is present in the graph obtained after applying local complementations according to $s$. The main contribution of this work is proving that this problem is $\mathsf{P}$-complete, implying that computing a sequence of local complementation is unlikely to be efficiently parallelizable. The proof is based on a reduction from the Circuit Value Problem, a well-known $\mathsf{P}$-complete problem, by simulating circuits through local complementations.
  Additionally, the complexity of this problem is analyzed under different restrictions. In particular, it is shown that for complete and star graphs, the problem belongs to $\mathsf{LOGSPACE}$. Finally, it is conjectured that the problem remains $\mathsf{P}$-complete for the class of circle graphs.</description>
