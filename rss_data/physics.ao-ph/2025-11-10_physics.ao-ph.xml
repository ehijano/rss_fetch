      <title>Geographic variability in reanalysis wind speed biases: A high-resolution bias correction approach for UK wind energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reanalysis datasets have become indispensable tools for wind resource assessment and wind power simulation, offering long-term and spatially continuous wind fields across large regions. However, they inherently contain systematic wind speed biases arising from various factors, including simplified physical parameterizations, observational uncertainties, and limited spatial resolution. Among these, low spatial resolution poses a particular challenge for capturing local variability accurately. Whereas prevailing industry practice generally relies on either no bias correction or coarse, nationally uniform adjustments, we extend and thoroughly analyse a recently proposed spatially resolved, cluster-based bias correction framework. This approach is designed to better account for local heterogeneity and is applied to 319 wind farms across the United Kingdom to evaluate its effectiveness. Results show that this method reduced monthly wind power simulation errors by more than 32% compared to the uncorrected ERA5 reanalysis dataset. The method is further applied to the MERRA-2 dataset for comparative evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for different reanalysis products. In contrast to prior studies, which rarely quantify the influence of topography on reanalysis biases, this research presents a detailed spatial mapping of bias correction factors across the UK. The analysis reveals that for wind energy applications, ERA5 wind speed errors exhibit strong spatial variability, with the most significant underestimations in the Scottish Highlands and mountainous areas of Wales. These findings highlight the importance of explicitly accounting for geographic variability when correcting reanalysis wind speeds, and provide new insights into region-specific bias patterns relevant for high-resolution wind energy modelling.</description>

      <title>Cracking the Code of Arctic Sea Ice: Why Models Fail to Predict Its Retreat?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arctic sea ice is rapidly retreating due to global warming, and emerging evidence suggests that the rate of decline may have been underestimated. A key factor contributing to this underestimation is the coarse resolution of current climate models, which fail to accurately represent eddy floe interactions, climate extremes, and other critical small scale processes. Here, we elucidate the roles of these dynamics in accelerating sea ice melt and emphasize the need for higher resolution models to improve projections of Arctic sea ice.</description>

      <title>Improvement of a neural network convection scheme by including triggering and evaluation in present and future climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we improve a neural network (NN) parameterization of deep convection in the global atmosphere model ARP-GEM. To take into account the sporadic nature of convection, we develop a NN parameterization that includes a triggering mechanism that can detect whether deep convection is active or not within a grid-cell. This new data-driven parameterization outperforms the existing NN parameterization in present climate when replacing the original deep convection scheme of ARP-GEM. Online simulations with the NN parameterization run without stability issues. Then, this NN parameterization is evaluated online in a warmer climate. We confirm that using relative humidity instead of the specific total humidity as input for the NN (trained with present data) improves the performance and generalization in warmer climate. Finally, we perform the training of the NN parameterization with data from a warmer climate and this configuration get similar results when used in simulations in present or warmer climates.</description>

      <title>Climate Downscaling of Tropical Cyclone Intensity using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for enhancing tropical cyclone (TC) intensity from climate model outputs or projections have primarily relied on either dynamical or statistical downscaling. With recent advances in deep learning (DL) techniques, a natural question is whether DL can provide an alternative approach for improving TC intensity estimation from climate data. Using a common DL architecture based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and selecting a set of key environmental features, we show that both TC intensity and structure can be effectively downscaled from climate reanalysis data as compared to common vortex detection methods, even when applied to coarse-resolution (0.5-degree) data. Our results thus highlight that TC intensity and structure are governed not only by its internal dynamics but also by local environments during TC development, for which DL models can learn and capture beyond the potential intensity framework. The performance of our DL model depends on several factors such as data sampling strategy, season, or the stage of TC development, with root-mean-square errors ranging from 3-9 ms$^{-1}$ for maximum 10 m wind and 10-20 hPa for minimum central pressure. Although these errors are better than direct vortex detection methods, their wide ranges also suggest that 0.5-degree resolution climate data may contain limited TC information for DL models to learn from, regardless of model optimizations or architectures. Possible improvements and challenges in addressing the lack of fine-scale TC information in coarse resolution climate reanalysis datasets will be discussed.</description>

      <title>A Satellite Remote Sensing and Doppler LiDAR-based Framework for Evaluating Mesoscale Flows Driven by Surface Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface heterogeneity, particularly complex patterns of surface heating, significantly influences mesoscale atmospheric flows, yet observational constraints and modeling limitations have hindered comprehensive understanding and model parameterization. This study introduces a framework combining satellite remote sensing and Doppler LiDAR to observationally evaluate heterogeneity-driven mesoscale flows in the atmospheric boundary layer. We quantify surface heterogeneity using metrics derived from GOES land surface temperature fields, and assess atmospheric impact through the Dispersive Kinetic Energy (DKE) calculated from a network of Doppler LiDAR profiles at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site. Results demonstrate that DKE and its ratio to the Mean Kinetic Energy (MKE) serve as effective indicators of heterogeneity driven flows, including breezes and circulations. The DKE and DKE ratio are correlated with metrics for surface heterogeneity, including the spatial correlation lengthscale, the spatial standard deviation, and the orientation of the surface heating gradient relative to the wind. The correlation becomes stronger when other flows that would affect DKE, including deep convection, low level jets, and storm fronts, are accounted for. Large Eddy Simulations contextualize the findings and validate the metric's behavior, showing general agreement with expectations from prior literature. Simulations also illustrate the sensitivity to configuration of LiDAR networks using virtual LiDAR sites, indicating that even smaller networks can be used effectively. This approach offers a scalable, observationally grounded method to explore heterogeneity-driven flows, advancing understanding of land-atmosphere interactions as well as efforts to parameterize these dynamics in climate and weather prediction models.</description>

      <title>Global 3D Reconstruction of Clouds &amp; Tropical Cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.</description>

      <title>Computing the Full Earth System at 1 km Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first-ever global simulation of the full Earth system at 1.25 km grid spacing, achieving highest time compression with an unseen number of degrees of freedom. Our model captures the flow of energy, water, and carbon through key components of the Earth system: atmosphere, ocean, and land. To achieve this landmark simulation, we harness the power of 8192 GPUs on Alps and 20480 GPUs on JUPITER, two of the world's largest GH200 superchip installations. We use both the Grace CPUs and Hopper GPUs by carefully balancing Earth's components in a heterogeneous setup and optimizing acceleration techniques available in ICON's codebase. We show how separation of concerns can reduce the code complexity by half while increasing performance and portability. Our achieved time compression of 145.7 simulated days per day enables long studies including full interactions in the Earth system and even outperforms earlier atmosphere-only simulations at a similar resolution.</description>
