      <title>The Skin Game: Revolutionizing Standards for AI Dermatology Model Comparison</title>

Abstract: Deep Learning approaches in dermatological image classification have shown promising results, yet the field faces significant methodological challenges that impede proper evaluation. This paper presents a dual contribution: first, a systematic analysis of current methodological practices in skin disease classification research, revealing substantial inconsistencies in data preparation, augmentation strategies, and performance reporting; second, a comprehensive training and evaluation framework demonstrated through experiments with the DINOv2-Large vision transformer across three benchmark datasets (HAM10000, DermNet, ISIC Atlas). The analysis identifies concerning patterns, including pre-split data augmentation and validation-based reporting, potentially leading to overestimated metrics, while highlighting the lack of unified methodology standards. The experimental results demonstrate DINOv2's performance in skin disease classification, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.85 (HAM10000), 0.71 (DermNet), and 0.84 (ISIC Atlas). Attention map analysis reveals critical patterns in the model's decision-making, showing sophisticated feature recognition in typical presentations but significant vulnerabilities with atypical cases and composite images. Our findings highlight the need for standardized evaluation protocols and careful implementation strategies in clinical settings. We propose comprehensive methodological recommendations for model development, evaluation, and clinical deployment, emphasizing rigorous data preparation, systematic error analysis, and specialized protocols for different image types. To promote reproducibility, we provide our implementation code through GitHub. This work establishes a foundation for rigorous evaluation standards in dermatological image classification and provides insights for responsible AI implementation in clinical dermatology.</description>

      <title>Photodynamic, UV-curable and fibre-forming polyvinyl alcohol derivative with broad processability and staining-free antibacterial capability</title>

Abstract: Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) is a promising antibiotic-free strategy for broad-spectrum infection control in chronic wounds, minimising bacterial resistance risks. However, rapid photosensitiser diffusion, tissue staining, side toxicity, and short-lived antimicrobial effects present significant clinical limitations for integrating APDT into wound dressings. To address these challenges, we present the design of a bespoke polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) derivative conjugated with both phenothiazine and methacrylate functionalities, enabling staining-free antibacterial photodynamic effects, cellular tolerability and processability into various wound dressing formats, including films, textile fibres and nanoscale coatings. Tosylation of PVA is leveraged for the covalent coupling of toluidine blue, as confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy and the minimal release of TB in vitro. UV-induced network formation is exploited to accomplish cast films and nanoscale integrated wound dressing coatings. UV curing is also successfully coupled with an in-house wet spinning process to realise individual, water-insoluble fibres as the building blocks of fibrous wound dressings. A fluorometric assay supports the generation of reactive oxygen species when the UV-cured samples are exposed to work, but not UV, light, yielding a mean log10 reduction of up to 2.13 in S. aureus, and the complete eradication of P. aeruginosa. Direct and extract cytotoxicity tests with UV-cured films and fibres demonstrate the viability of L929 fibroblasts following 60-min light irradiation and 72-hour cell culture. The bespoke molecular architecture, broad processability and cellular tolerability of this PVA derivative are highly attractive aiming to integrate durable staining-free photodynamic capability in a wide range of healthcare technologies, from chronic wound dressings up to minimally invasive localised therapy.</description>
