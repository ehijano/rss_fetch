      <title>Resonant helical dichroism in twisted dielectric metastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular dichroism, arising from interactions with light fields of opposite spin angular momentum, has become a fundamental tool for molecular characterization. Meanwhile, helical dichroism (HD) - the dichroic response to vortex beams carrying opposite orbital angular momentum (OAM) - offers an alternative approach for probing chiral molecules and photonic structures. Previous demonstrations of HD have been limited to non-resonant light-matter interactions with chiral micro- and nanostructures, leaving the realization of resonance helical dichroism largely unexplored. Here, we present the design and implementation of twisted dielectric metastructures, composed of an array of rotated silicon trimer nanostructures harnessing nonlocal photonic modes with a high quality factor of several dozen that enable strong resonant HD for OAM values up to $10$. We experimentally demonstrate resonantly enhanced HD for strongly focused OAM beams with the magnitude of topological charges from $1$ to $3$. Our findings pave the way for resonant nanophotonics involving OAM beams, unlocking the full potential of structured light for applications in molecular sensing, optical imaging, nonlinear optics, and optical data storage.</description>

      <title>High computational density nanophotonic media for machine learning inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient machine learning inference is essential for the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence across various domains.On-chip optical computing has emerged as a transformative solution for accelerating machine learning tasks, owing to its ultra-low power consumption. However, enhancing the computational density of on-chip optical systems remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the difficulties in miniaturizing and integrating key optical interference components.In this work, we harness the potential of fabrication-constrained scattering optical computing within nanophotonic media to address these limitations.Central to our approach is the use of fabrication-aware inverse design techniques, which enable the realization of manufacturable on-chip scattering structures under practical constraints.This results in an ultra-compact optical neural computing architecture with an area of just 64 um2,representing a remarkable three orders of magnitude reduction in footprint compared to traditional optical neural networks. Our prototype, tested on the Iris flower dataset, achieved an experimental accuracy of 86.7%, closely matching the simulation benchmark.This breakthrough showcases a promising pathway toward ultra-dense, energy-efficient optical processors for scalable machine learning inference, significantly reducing both the hardware footprint, latency, and power consumption of next-generation AI applications.</description>

      <title>GHz spiking neuromorphic photonic chip with in-situ training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic photonic computing represents a paradigm shift for next-generation machine intelligence, yet critical gaps persist in emulating the brain's event-driven, asynchronous dynamics,a fundamental barrier to unlocking its full potential. Here, we report a milestone advancement of a photonic spiking neural network (PSNN) chip, the first to achieve full-stack brain-inspired computing on a complementary metal oxide semiconductor-compatible silicon platform. The PSNN features transformative innovations of gigahertz-scale nonlinear spiking dynamics,in situ learning capacity with supervised synaptic plasticity, and informative event representations with retina-inspired spike encoding, resolving the long-standing challenges in spatiotemporal data integration and energy-efficient dynamic processing. By leveraging its frame-free, event-driven working manner,the neuromorphic optoelectronic system achieves 80% accuracy on the KTH video recognition dataset while operating at ~100x faster processing speeds than conventional frame-based approaches. This work represents a leap for neuromorphic computing in a scalable photonic platform with low latency and high throughput, paving the way for advanced applications in real-time dynamic vision processing and adaptive decision-making, such as autonomous vehicles and robotic navigation.</description>

      <title>Direct tensor processing with coherent light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor processing is the cornerstone of modern technological advancements, powering critical applications in data analytics and artificial intelligence. While optical computing offers exceptional advantages in bandwidth, parallelism, and energy efficiency, existing methods optimized for scalar operations struggle to efficiently handle tensor-based tasks, limiting their applicability in complex applications, such as neural networks. Here, we report Parallel Optical Matrix Matrix Multiplication (POMMM), a novel paradigm that enables fully parallel tensor processing through a single coherent light propagation. This approach addresses key limitations of current optical methods, scaling the performance with data dimension, while improving theoretical computational power and efficiency. We demonstrate its high consistency with GPU based matrix matrix multiplication across both real-valued and complex valued domains. Moreover, we showcase its adaptability, scalability, and versatility in tensor processing applications such as convolutional and vision transformer neural networks. Furthermore, we analyse the theoretical compatibility and efficiency of POMMM in relation to existing optical computing paradigms, highlighting its potential to outperform current state-of-the-art methods. By enabling a variety of computational tasks and supporting multi2 wavelength and large-scale expansion, POMMM provides a scalable, high-efficient foundation for advancing next-generation optical computing.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Engineered Hybrid Plasmonic Cavities for Emission Control of Defects in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect-based quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising building blocks for scalable quantum photonics due to their stable single-photon emission at room temperature. However, enhancing their emission intensity and controlling the decay dynamics remain significant challenges. This study demonstrates a low-cost, scalable fabrication approach to integrate plasmonic nanocavities with defect-based quantum emitters in hBN nanoflakes. Using the thermal dewetting process, we realize two distinct configurations: stochastic Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) on hBN flakes and hybrid plasmonic nanocavities formed by AgNPs on top of hBN flakes supported on gold/silicon dioxide (Au/SiO2) substrates. While AgNPs on bare hBN yield up to a two-fold photoluminescence (PL) enhancement with reduced emitter lifetimes, the hybrid nanocavity architecture provides a dramatic, up to 100-fold PL enhancement and improved uniformity across multiple. emitters, all without requiring deterministic positioning. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and time-resolved PL measurements confirm size-dependent control over decay dynamics and cavity-emitter interactions. Our versatile solution overcomes key quantum photonic device development challenges, including material integration, emission intensity optimization, and spectral multiplexity. Future work will explore potential applications in integrated photonic circuits hosting on-chip quantum systems and hBN-based label-free single-molecule detection through such quantum nanoantennas.</description>

      <title>MobileHolo: A Lightweight Complex-Valued Deformable CNN for High-Quality Computer-Generated Hologram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic displays have significant potential in virtual reality and augmented reality owing to their ability to provide all the depth cues. Deep learning-based methods play an important role in computer-generated holograms (CGH). During the diffraction process, each pixel exerts an influence on the reconstructed image. However, previous works face challenges in capturing sufficient information to accurately model this process, primarily due to the inadequacy of their effective receptive field (ERF). Here, we designed complex-valued deformable convolution for integration into network, enabling dynamic adjustment of the convolution kernel's shape to increase flexibility of ERF for better feature extraction. This approach allows us to utilize a single model while achieving state-of-the-art performance in both simulated and optical experiment reconstructions, surpassing existing open-source models. Specifically, our method has a peak signal-to-noise ratio that is 2.04 dB, 5.31 dB, and 9.71 dB higher than that of CCNN-CGH, HoloNet, and Holo-encoder, respectively, when the resolution is 1920$\times$1072. The number of parameters of our model is only about one-eighth of that of CCNN-CGH.</description>

      <title>Accurate Depth-Resolved Temperature Profiling via Thermal-Radiation Spectroscopy: Numerical Methods vs Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and compare three approaches for accurately retrieving depth-resolved temperature distributions within materials from their thermal-radiation spectra, based on: (1) a nonlinear equation solver implemented in commercial software, (2) a custom-built nonlinear equation solver, and (3) a deep neural network (DNN) model. These methods are first validated using synthetic datasets comprising randomly generated temperature profiles and corresponding noisy thermal-radiation spectra for three different structures: a fused-silica substrate, an indium antimonide substrate, and a thin-film gallium nitride layer on a sapphire substrate. We then assess the performance of each approach using experimental spectra collected from a fused-silica window heated on a temperature-controlled stage. Our results demonstrate that the DNN-based method consistently outperforms conventional numerical techniques on both synthetic and experimental data, providing a robust solution for accurate depth-resolved temperature profiling.</description>

      <title>Integrated photonic deep neural network with end-to-end on-chip backpropagation training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated significant potential to complement the digital electronic counterparts [1-3]. Nevertheless, robust and repeatable performance of scalable integrated PNNs is directly tied to the quality of their training. Error backpropagation (BP), which relies on nonlinear activation gradient computation, is the mainstream algorithm to train digital neural networks due to its scalability, versatility, and implementation efficiency [4]. Consequently, its adoption is highly desirable for the training of scalable PNNs. Despite such benefits and due to the lack of scalable on-chip activation gradient [5], PNNs have mostly been trained using a digital computer to run BP, which is inadequate in addressing device variations, or through gradient-free algorithms that do not fully benefit from the versatility of BP training. Here, we report the demonstration of an integrated photonic deep neural network with end-to-end on-chip gradient-descent BP training. All linear and nonlinear computations are performed on a single photonic chip, leading to scalable and robust training despite the considerable--but typical--fabrication-induced device variations. Two nonlinear data classification tasks are demonstrated in which the chip performance matches that of the ideal digital model, both in accuracy and robustness. Integrating the advantages of BP training with PNNs allows for generalization to various PNN architectures, paving the way for scalable and reliable next-generation photonic computing systems.</description>

      <title>Certifying spatial entanglement between non-degenerate photon pairs with a camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate transverse spatial entanglement between photon pairs of different wavelengths using a camera-based coincidence technique. By adapting the correlation measurements to the photons frequencies, we certify the presence of entanglement between the pairs through violation of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion. Additionally, we examine how parameters such as pump waist and crystal length influence these correlations. Our results highlight key differences from the frequency-degenerate case, showing that an adapted theoretical analysis is essential to avoid significant misestimations and to reliably certify entanglement.</description>

      <title>Detecting immune cells with label-free two-photon autofluorescence and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Label-free imaging has gained broad interest because of its potential to omit elaborate staining procedures which is especially relevant for in vivo use. Label-free multiphoton microscopy (MPM), for instance, exploits two-photon excitation of natural autofluorescence (AF) from native, metabolic proteins, making it ideal for in vivo endomicroscopy. Deep learning (DL) models have been widely used in other optical imaging technologies to predict specific target annotations and thereby digitally augment the specificity of these label-free images. However, this computational specificity has only rarely been implemented for MPM. In this work, we used a data set of label-free MPM images from a series of different immune cell types (5,075 individual cells for binary classification in mixed samples and 3,424 cells for a multi-class classification task) and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify cell types based on this label-free AF as input. A low-complexity squeezeNet architecture was able to achieve reliable immune cell classification results (0.89 ROC-AUC, 0.95 PR-AUC, for binary classification in mixed samples; 0.689 F1 score, 0.697 precision, 0.748 recall, and 0.683 MCC for six-class classification in isolated samples). Perturbation tests confirmed that the model is not confused by extracellular environment and that both input AF channels (NADH and FAD) are about equally important to the classification. In the future, such predictive DL models could directly detect specific immune cells in unstained images and thus, computationally improve the specificity of label-free MPM which would have great potential for in vivo endomicroscopy.</description>

      <title>All-optical convolution utilizing processing in memory based on a cold atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing in memory (PIM) has received significant attention due to its high efficiency, low latency, and parallelism. In optical computation, coherent memory is a crucial infrastructure for PIM frameworks. This study presents an all-optical convolution experiment conducted within computational storage based on a cold atomic ensemble. By exploiting the light-atom phase transfer facilitated by the electromagnetically induced transparency, we demonstrated spiral phase contrast processing of photon images in memory, resulting in the edge enhancement of retrieved images recorded using time-correlated photon imaging. In particular, adopting state-of-the-art atomic techniques provides a coherent memory lifetime exceeding 320 us for PIM operations. Our results highlight the significant potential of cold atomic ensembles as computational storage for developing all-optical PIM systems.</description>

      <title>Dispersion-tuning of nonlinear optical pulse dynamics in gas-filled hollow capillary fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the nonlinear optical pulse dynamics of ultrashort laser pulses propagating in gas-filled hollow capillary fibers in different dispersion regimes, which are achieved by tuning the gas pressure. When the pulse propagates in the anomalous dispersion regime we observe soliton dynamics accompanied with soliton-plasma effects, such as self-compression, resonant dispersive-wave emission in the fundamental as well as in higher-order modes, soliton blue-shifting and ionization-induced pulse splitting. Propagation of the pulse in the vicinity of the zero-dispersion wavelength results in pulse splitting and subsequent cross-phase modulation leading to the generation of an additional frequency-shifted band and a 3-octave broad supercontinuum. In the case of pulses propagating in normal dispersion we observe the generation of a broad and flat supercontinuum. In this regime, the experimental results are less well described by simulations that consider only the propagation dynamics inside the fiber. Free-space simulations of the beam propagation in the bulk gas, before the capillary entrance, suggest that this discrepancy is caused by self-focusing and ionization altering the pulse spatial and temporal shape, affecting both the coupling efficiency and the subsequent propagation inside the capillary.</description>

      <title>Integrated, ultrafast all-optical polariton transistors with sub-wavelength grating microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All-optical logic has the potential to overcome the operation speed barrier that has persisted in electronic circuits for two decades. However, the development of scalable architectures has been prevented so far by the lack of materials with sufficiently strong nonlinear interactions needed to realize compact and efficient ultrafast all-optical switches with optical gain. Microcavities with embedded organic material in the strong light-matter interaction regime have recently enabled all-optical transistors operating at room temperature with picosecond switching times. However, the vertical cavity geometry, which is predominantly used in polaritonics, is not suitable for complex circuits with on-chip coupled transistors. Here, by leveraging state-of-the-art silicon photonics technology, we have achieved exciton-polariton condensation at ambient conditions in fully integrated high-index contrast sub-wavelength grating microcavities filled with a pi-conjugated polymer as optically active material. We demonstrate ultrafast all-optical transistor action by coupling two resonators and utilizing seeded polariton condensation. With a device area as small as 2x2 um^2, we realize picosecond switching and amplification up to 60x, with extinction ratio up to 8:1. This compact ultrafast transistor device with in-plane integration is a key component for a scalable platform for all-optical logic circuits that could operate two orders of magnitude faster than electronic ones.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fitting oscillator models to variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) data can lead to non-unique, unphysical results. We demonstrate using temperature-dependent trends to prevent overfitting and ensure model physicality. As a case study, we performed mid-infrared VASE measurements on fused silica (SiO2) of various grades, from room temperature to 600 {\deg}C. We fitted oscillator models independently at each temperature, and confirmed the model's physical validity by observing the expected monotonic trends in vibrational oscillator parameters. Using this technique, we generated a highly accurate dataset for the temperature-dependent complex refractive index of fused silica for modeling mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

      <title>Non-dispersive graded impedance acoustic lenses</title>

Abstract: Lenses are typically based on refractive index profiles derived from the geometric approximation of high-frequency waves, yet the critical issue of impedance mismatch is often neglected. Mismatched devices suffer from unwanted reflections and dispersion, which can significantly degrade performance in practical applications. In this work, we propose impedance profiles for lenses to achieve efficient wave transmission while maintaining the desired refractive index and minimizing dispersion effects. A family of impedance profiles is derived from the acoustic wave equation such that the phase velocity is preserved. First, the 1D setting is considered to explain how dispersion occurs inside a lens and at its interfaces. Then, the method is applied to 2D axisymmetric configurations where the impedance mismatch is radially redistributed. These profiles are demonstrated in the acoustic setting of a Luneburg lens, but can be easily extended to more general scenarios such as imaging or cloaking in air and water, where matching the impedance of the background poses significant challenges.</description>

      <title>Tunable megawatt-scale sub-20 fs visible pulses from a fiber laser source</title>

Abstract: Ultrafast laser pulses that are both tunable in wavelength and very short in duration are essential tools in fields ranging from biomedical imaging to ultrafast spectroscopy. While resonant dispersive-wave emission in gas-filled hollow-core fibers is a powerful technique for generating such pulses, it has traditionally required complex and expensive pump laser systems. In this work, we present a more compact and accessible alternative that combines gain-managed nonlinear amplification with resonant dispersive-wave emission. Our system produces sub-20 femtosecond pulses tunable from 400 nm to beyond 700 nm, with energies up to 39 nJ and peak powers exceeding 2 MW, operating at a 4.8 MHz repetition rate. This compact and efficient laser source opens new avenues for deploying resonant dispersive-wave-based technologies for broader scientific and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-interband hybridization and anomalous production of hot electrons in aluminum nanoantennas</title>

Abstract: Strong coupling typically occurs between two separate objects or between an object and its environment (such as an atom and a cavity). However, it can also occur between two different excitations within the same object, a situation that has been much less studied. In this study, we observe strong coupling between localized surface plasmon resonances and the interband transition in aluminum nanorods, as evidenced by optical spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, and corroborated with numerical simulations. Strong coupling is observed between the interband transition and multiple orders of the surface plasmon mode, including dark ones. We also obtain experimental maps of the hybrid modes at the nanoscale. In each case, the associated Rabi energy, which corresponds to the energy splitting between the two polaritonic branches, is obtained. Finally, a dedicated numerical model was employed to calculate the hot electron generation rate in the nanorods. The calculations demonstrate that efficient generation of hot electrons can be achieved in the near-infrared region, when the interband transition is strongly coupled with a plasmon resonance. This high generation rate stems from the hybrid nature of the mode, as its plasmonic component provides a high absorption cross-section, while the IT part ensures efficient conversion to hot electrons. Consequently, aluminum nanorods represent an efficient source of hot electrons in the visible and near-infrared regions, with potential applications in local photochemistry, photodetection, and solar energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Strong Field Optical Hall Effect in 2D Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of interplay between the geometric nature of Bloch electrons and transverse responses under strong field offers new opportunities for optoelectronic applications. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the strong-field response of Weyl Dirac nodes in bilayer T'-WTe2 using time-dependent first-principles formalism. The electron dynamics is explored focusing on the mid-infrared frequency, ranging from the perturbative to nonperturbative regime. In the nonperturbative regime, the high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectra under a strong field clearly exhibit a plateau and energy cutoffs for both longitudinal and anomalous Hall (transverse) currents, with the latter being due to the large interband Berry curvature of the Weyl-Dirac semimetal. For the longitudinal harmonics, the intraband contributions increase with intensity, resulting in a complex interplay between interband polarization and intraband motions. Remarkably, if we take a comprehensive all-band perspective enabled by time-dependent density functional calculations, the anomalous Hall responses are purely attributed to the interband processes, even in the nonperturbative regime, thus Hall HHG can be crucial to understand the carrier dynamics. Our findings suggest that HHG associated with the ultrafast strong-field driven electron dynamics holds immense potential for exploring the nonlinear high Hall responses in Weyl semimetal.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Deep Surrogate Solvers for Broadband Electromagnetic Field Prediction at Unseen Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, electromagnetic surrogate solvers, trained on solutions of Maxwell's equations under specific simulation conditions, enabled fast inference of computationally expensive simulations. However, conventional electromagnetic surrogate solvers often consider only a narrow range of spectrum and fail when encountering even slight variations in simulation conditions. To address this limitation, we define spectral consistency as the property by which the spatial frequency structure of wavelength-dependent condition embeddings matches that of the target electromagnetic field patterns. In addition, we propose two complementary components: a refined wave prior, which is the condition embedding that satisfies spectral consistency, and Wave-Informed element-wise Multiplicative Encoding (WIME), which integrates these embeddings throughout the model while preserving spectral consistency. This framework enables accurate field prediction across the broadband spectrum, including untrained intermediate wavelengths. Our approach reduces the normalized mean squared error at untrained wavelengths by up to 71% compared to the state-of-the-art electromagnetic surrogate solver and achieves a speedup of over 42 times relative to conventional numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Laser ablated sub-wavelength structure anti-reflection coating on an alumina lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We used laser ablation to fabricate sub-wavelength structure anti-reflection coating (SWS-ARC) on a 5 cm diameter alumina lens. With an aspect ratio of 2.5, the SWS-ARC are designed to give a broad-band low reflectance response between 110 and 290 GHz. SWS shape measurements conducted on both sides of the lens give 303 $\mu$m pitch and total height between 750 and 790 $\mu$m, matching or exceeding the aspect ratio design values. Millimeter-wave transmittance measurements in a band between 140 and 260 GHz show the increase in transmittance expected with the ARC when compared to finite element analysis electromagnetic simulations. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of SWS-ARC on an alumina lens, opening the path for implementing the technique for larger diameter lenses.</description>
