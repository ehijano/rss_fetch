      <title>Tangent point position and atmosphere composition in limb scanning instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the forward model for limb-scanning instruments, ray tracing must be accounted for because variations in air refractivity cause the lines of sight to bend from straight paths into curves. The tangent point of a line of sight is defined as the minimum height point. The lines of sight can be adjusted by varying the nadir angles of the instrument, which must be calibrated to account for Earth's ellipticity and the actual atmospheric conditions sampled by these paths. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the nadir angles, atmospheric properties, and tangent point positions, using a configuration relevant to the CAIRT instrument. Atmospheric data from reanalysis databases are utilized, and the lines of sight are determined by numerically solving the Eikonal equation. Our findings are compared to those of a previous study conducted for the MIPAS instrument, highlighting key differences.</description>

      <title>An extreme value method to study decadal hurricane wind trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method developed using techniques from extreme value theory to estimate smooth wind-speed percentiles, allowing us to consider more extreme wind speeds while being less sensitive to the noise that stems from the scarcity of extreme data. A reliable characterisation of wind extremes is the first required step for studying decadal trends in tropical-cyclone and extra-tropical-cyclone winds. We develop a percentile-smoothing method using ASCAT-A Level-3 products, focusing on a number of tropical basins (Caribbean and Atlantic), estimate the uncertainty with the block-bootstrap technique to address the issue of dependency, and apply our method to both scatterometer winds (ASCAT-A at two different resolutions) and collocated ERA5 model data. The results obtained are very robust at basin level, without having to rely on a strong assumption for the distribution tail: they are very consistent whether we use exponential fits, generalised-Pareto fits, or even no fit at all, down to at least truly extreme wind percentiles such as 99.999th (main result), and remain quite consistent within uncertainties down to 99.9999th. As ensuring scientifically sound decadal-trend conclusions would require going back sufficiently in time, spanning the lifetimes of different instruments with different characteristics and extreme-wind statistics, a natural follow-on study would be to apply this method not only to ASCAT, but also to its predecessors on QuikSCAT and ERS - comparing each scatterometer individually against ERA5, and also to each other as partial overlaps exist between instruments.</description>

      <title>Applying the ACE2 Emulator to SST Green's Functions for the E3SMv3 Climate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green's functions are a useful technique for interpreting atmospheric state responses to changes in the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST). Here we train version 2 of the Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE2) on reference historical SST simulations of the US Department of Energy's EAMv3 global atmosphere model. We compare how well the SST Green's functions generated by ACE2 match those of EAMv3, following the protocol of the Green's Function Model Intercomparison Project (GFMIP). The spatial patterns of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative response from the individual GFMIP SST patch simulations are similar for ACE and the EAMv3 reference. The derived sensitivity of global net TOA radiation sensitivity to SST patch location is qualitatively similar in ACE as in EAMv3, but there are statistically significant discrepancies for some SST patches, especially over the subtropical northeast Pacific. These discrepancies may reflect insufficient diversity in the SST patterns sampled over the course of the EAMv3 AMIP simulation used for training ACE. Both ACE and EAMv3 Green's functions reconstruct the historical record of the global annual-mean TOA radiative flux from a reference EAMv3 AMIP simulation reasonably well. Notably, under our configuration and compute resources, ACE achieves these results approximately 100 times faster in wall-clock time compared to EAMv3, highlighting its potential as a powerful and efficient tool for tackling other computationally intensive problems in climate science.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning (RL) Meets Urban Climate Modeling: Investigating the Efficacy and Impacts of RL-Based HVAC Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control has emerged as a promising technology for reducing building energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, the efficacy of such strategies is influenced by the background climate and their implementation may potentially alter both the indoor climate and local urban climate. This study proposes an integrated framework combining RL with an urban climate model that incorporates a building energy model, aiming to evaluate the efficacy of RL-based HVAC control across different background climates, impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate, and the transferability of RL strategies across cities. Our findings reveal that the reward (defined as a weighted combination of energy consumption and thermal comfort) and the impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate exhibit marked variability across cities with different background climates. The sensitivity of reward weights and the transferability of RL strategies are also strongly influenced by the background climate. Cities in hot climates tend to achieve higher rewards across most reward weight configurations that balance energy consumption and thermal comfort, and those cities with more varying atmospheric temperatures demonstrate greater RL strategy transferability. These findings underscore the importance of thoroughly evaluating RL-based HVAC control strategies in diverse climatic contexts. This study also provides a new insight that city-to-city learning will potentially aid the deployment of RL-based HVAC control.</description>

      <title>Decadal analysis of sea surface temperature patterns, climatology, and anomalies in temperate coastal waters with Landsat-8 TIRS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental physical parameter characterising the thermal state of sea surface. Due to the intricate thermal interactions between land, sea, and atmosphere, the spatial gradients of SST in coastal waters often appear at finer spatial scales than those in open ocean waters. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its 100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale coastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution thermal sensors. In this study, we first analysed the spatiotemporal patterns of SST in South Australia's temperate coastal waters from 2014 to 2023 by developing an operational approach for SST retrieval from the Landsat-8 TIRS sensor. A buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to validate the quality of SST retrievals. Then the daily baseline climatology of SST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and analysis of anomalous SST events. Our results suggest the following: (1) the satellite-derived SST data aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values; (2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St Vincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures during winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher seasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to have a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study area; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm months than the cool months. We hope these findings would be helpful in supporting the fishing and aquaculture industries in the coastal waters of South Australia.</description>

      <title>Structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the United States (2000 to 2025) using a large language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud seeding, a weather modification technique used to increase precipitation, has been employed in the western United States since the 1940s. However, structured datasets are not currently available to analyze these efforts. To address this gap, we present a structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the U.S. from 2000 to 2025, including the year, season, state, seeding agent, apparatus used for deployment, and purpose. Using OpenAI's o4-mini large language model (LLM), combined with multi-stage PDF-to-text conversion and response-parsing code, we processed 836 historical reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to extract the data. The resulting dataset achieved 94.72% human-verified accuracy across all fields and is publicly available on Zenodo. Our results help fill the gap in structured cloud seeding data and demonstrate the potential for LLMs to extract structured environmental data from historical documents. More broadly, this work provides a scalable framework for unlocking historical data from scanned documents across scientific domains.</description>
