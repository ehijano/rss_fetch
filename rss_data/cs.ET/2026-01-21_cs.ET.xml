      <title>A Proof of Concept for a Digital Twin of an Ultrasonic Fermentation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a proof of concept digital twin for an innovative ultrasonic-enhanced beer-fermentation system, developed to enable intelligent monitoring, prediction, and actuation in yeast-growth environments. A traditional fermentation tank is equipped with a piezoelectric transducer able to irradiate the tank with ultrasonic waves, providing an external abiotic stimulus to enhance the growth of yeast and accelerate the fermentation process. At its core, the digital twin incorporates a predictive model that estimates yeast's culture density over time based on the surrounding environmental conditions. To this end, we implement, tailor and extend the model proposed in Palacios et al., allowing us to effectively handle the limited number of available training samples by using temperature, ultrasonic frequency, and duty cycle as inputs. The results obtained along with the assessment of model performance demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>COVERT: Trojan Detection in COTS Hardware via Statistical Activation of Microarchitectural Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware, such as microprocessors, are widely adopted in system design due to their ability to reduce development time and cost compared to custom solutions. However, supply chain entities involved in the design and fabrication of COTS components are considered untrusted from the consumer's standpoint due to the potential insertion of hidden malicious logic or hardware Trojans (HTs). Existing solutions to detect Trojans are largely inapplicable for COTS components due to their black-box nature and lack of access to a golden model. A few studies that apply require expensive equipment, lack scalability, and apply to a limited class of Trojans. In this work, we present a novel golden-free trust verification framework, COVERT for COTS microprocessors, which can efficiently test the presence of hardware Trojan implants by identifying microarchitectural rare events and transferring activation knowledge from existing processor designs to trigger highly susceptible internal nodes. COVERT leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate test programs that trigger rare microarchitectural events, which may be exploited to develop Trojan trigger conditions. By deriving these events from publicly available Register Transfer Level implementations, COVERT can verify a wide variety of COTS microprocessors that inherit the same Instruction Set Architecture. We have evaluated the proposed framework on open-source RISC-V COTS microprocessors and demonstrated its effectiveness in activating combinational and sequential Trojan triggers with high coverage, highlighting the efficiency of the trust verification. By pruning rare microarchitectural events from mor1kx Cappuccino OpenRISC processor design, COVERT has been able to achieve more than 80% trigger coverage for the rarest 5% of events in or1k Marocchino and PicoRV32 as COTS processors.</description>

      <title>AlphaSyndrome: Tackling the Syndrome Measurement Circuit Scheduling Problem for QEC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet repeated syndrome-measurement cycles dominate its spacetime and hardware cost. Although stabilizers commute and admit many valid execution orders, different schedules induce distinct error-propagation paths under realistic noise, leading to large variations in logical error rate. Outside of surface codes, effective syndrome-measurement scheduling remains largely unexplored. We present AlphaSyndrome, an automated synthesis framework for scheduling syndrome-measurement circuits in general commuting-stabilizer codes under minimal assumptions: mutually commuting stabilizers and a heuristic decoder. AlphaSyndrome formulates scheduling as an optimization problem that shapes error propagation to (i) avoid patterns close to logical operators and (ii) remain within the decoder's correctable region. The framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore ordering and parallelism, guided by code structure and decoder feedback. Across diverse code families, sizes, and decoders, AlphaSyndrome reduces logical error rates by 80.6% on average (up to 96.2%) relative to depth-optimal baselines, matches Google's hand-crafted surface-code schedules, and outperforms IBM's schedule for the Bivariate Bicycle code.</description>

      <title>Bounded Minds, Generative Machines: Envisioning Conversational AI that Works with Human Heuristics and Reduces Bias Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational AI is rapidly becoming a primary interface for information seeking and decision making, yet most systems still assume idealized users. In practice, human reasoning is bounded by limited attention, uneven knowledge, and reliance on heuristics that are adaptive but bias-prone. This article outlines a research pathway grounded in bounded rationality, and argues that conversational AI should be designed to work with human heuristics rather than against them. It identifies key directions for detecting cognitive vulnerability, supporting judgment under uncertainty, and evaluating conversational systems beyond factual accuracy, toward decision quality and cognitive robustness.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Paretic Propulsion Post-Stroke via a Wearable System for Real-Time Unilateral Haptic Feedback of Anterior Ground Reaction Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gait rehabilitation interventions targeting paretic propulsion can improve walking speed and function in individuals post-stroke. Previous work has demonstrated that real-time biofeedback targeting anterior ground reaction forces (AGRFs) can increase propulsion in individuals post-stroke, however this work was confined to lab-based treadmills, limiting practical utility. Here we investigate the short-term effects of real-time AGRF gait biofeedback during overground walking using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a haptic feedback device. Eight individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis completed four 3-minute training bouts. During training, faded haptic biofeedback was provided to increase paretic AGRF during terminal stance. Gait biomechanics were assessed before, during, and after training, and during a retention test conducted without biofeedback after a rest period. The primary dependent variable was peak paretic AGRF, while secondary variables included paretic peak trailing limb angle (TLA), step length and walking speed. Compared to baseline, peak AGRF increased post-feedback and at the retention tests. Similar trends were observed in TLA, and step length, although these increases were not statistically significant while speed showed a significant change from baseline. Examining individual participants 63% participants (responders) increased AGRF at retention, while 37% experienced decreases (non-responders). Non-responders had lower physical capability, evidenced by two-minute walk distance at screening and AFO use during training, suggesting this intervention may suit patients with more residual ankle mobility and strength. Nonetheless our results suggest AGRF biofeedback can be implemented in practical settings with wearable systems and is a promising gait training strategy to target propulsive deficits in individuals post stroke.</description>

      <title>Do MLLMs See What We See? Analyzing Visualization Literacy Barriers in AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to interpret visualizations, yet little is known about why they fail. We present the first systematic analysis of barriers to visualization literacy in MLLMs. Using the regenerated Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (reVLAT) benchmark with synthetic data, we open-coded 309 erroneous responses from four state-of-the-art models with a barrier-centric strategy adapted from human visualization literacy research. Our analysis yields a taxonomy of MLLM failures, revealing two machine-specific barriers that extend prior human-participation frameworks. Results show that models perform well on simple charts but struggle with color-intensive, segment-based visualizations, often failing to form consistent comparative reasoning. Our findings inform future evaluation and design of reliable AI-driven visualization assistants.</description>

      <title>NeuroShield: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial vulnerability and lack of interpretability are critical limitations of deep neural networks, especially in safety-sensitive settings such as autonomous driving. We introduce \DesignII, a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates symbolic rule supervision into neural networks to enhance both adversarial robustness and explainability. Domain knowledge is encoded as logical constraints over appearance attributes such as shape and color, and enforced through semantic and symbolic logic losses applied during training. Using the GTSRB dataset, we evaluate robustness against FGSM and PGD attacks at a standard $\ell_\infty$ perturbation budget of $\varepsilon = 8/255$. Relative to clean training, standard adversarial training provides modest improvements in robustness ($\sim$10 percentage points). Conversely, our FGSM-Neuro-Symbolic and PGD-Neuro-Symbolic models achieve substantially larger gains, improving adversarial accuracy by 18.1\% and 17.35\% over their corresponding adversarial-training baselines, representing roughly a three-fold larger robustness gain than standard adversarial training provides when both are measured relative to the same clean-training baseline, without reducing clean-sample accuracy. Compared to transformer-based defenses such as LNL-MoEx, which require heavy architectures and extensive data augmentation, our PGD-Neuro-Symbolic variant attains comparable or superior robustness using a ResNet18 backbone trained for 10 epochs. These results show that symbolic reasoning offers an effective path to robust and interpretable AI.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Cooperative Beamforming for BDRIS-Assisted Cell-Free MIMO OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a wideband cell-free multi-stream multi-user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system is considered operating within a smart wireless environment enabled by multiple Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (BDRISs). A novel decentralized active and passive beamforming framework, robust to imperfect channel state availability and with minimal cooperation among the system's multiple Base Stations (BSs) for deciding the final configurations of the shared BDRISs, is proposed, which aims to substantially reduce the overhead inherent in centralized solutions necessitating a central processing unit of high computational power. By considering a Dynamic Group-Connected (DGC) BDRIS architecture with frequency-selective responses per unit element, we formulate the system's sum-rate maximization problem with respect to the tunable capacitances and permutation matrices of the BDRISs as well as the precoding matrices of the BSs, which is solved via successive concave approximation and alternating projections as well as consensus-based updates for the BDRISs' design. Through extensive simulation results, it is showcased that the proposed robust decentralized cooperative approach with diverse BDRIS architectures outperforms non-cooperation benchmarks. It is also demonstrated that the considered DGC BDRIS architecture is able to provide sum-rate performance gains sufficiently close to the more complex fully-connected BDRIS structure.</description>

      <title>A functionally reversible probabilistic computing architecture enabled by interactions of current-controlled magnetic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic computers replace logic gates with networks of interacting random variables, creating bidirectional systems that can back-derive inputs from outputs. Such architectures enable efficient generation of random samples, implementations of novel algorithms, and natural solutions to classically hard problems such as prime factorization. We present a new physical implementation for these networks: ferromagnetic disks whose magnetization switching process is triggered by current pulses, skewed by external magnetic fields, and randomized by ambient thermal noise. We show that geometry-dependent magnetostatic interactions between these magnetic cells lead to system behavior that emulates deterministic logic gates. Furthermore, by chaining multiple "gates," we achieve a highly accurate bidirectional one-bit full-adder, a proof of concept for complex multi-gate logic functions with reversible information flow. This analog magnetic probabilistic computer methodology improves on other implementations in speed, tunability, and energy efficiency, thereby enabling a powerful new pathway towards practical solution of classically hard problems.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Federated Container Orchestration: The CODECO Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents CODECO, a federated orchestration framework for Kubernetes that addresses the limitations of cloud-centric deployment. CODECO adopts a data-compute-network co-orchestration approach to support heterogeneous infrastructures, mobility, and multi-provider operation.
  CODECO extends Kubernetes with semantic application models, partition-based federation, and AI-assisted decision support, enabling context-aware placement and adaptive management of applications and their micro-services across federated environments. A hybrid governance model combines centralized policy enforcement with decentralized execution and learning to preserve global coherence while supporting far Edge autonomy. The paper describes the architecture and core components of CODECO, outlines representative orchestration workflows, and introduces a software-based experimentation framework for reproducible evaluation in federated Edge-Cloud infrastructure environments.</description>

      <title>A Scientific Data Integrity system based on Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most High Performance Computing (HPC) projects nowadays, there is a lot of data obtained from different sources, depending on the project's objectives. Some of that data is very huge in terms of size, so copying such data sometimes is an unrealistic goal. On the other hand, science requires data used for different purposes to remain unaltered, so different groups of researchers can reproduce results, discuss theories, and validate each other. In this paper, we present a novel approach to help research groups to validate data integrity on such distributed repositories using Blockchain. Originally developed for cryptographic currencies, Blockchain has demonstrated a versatile range of uses. Our proposal ensures 1) secure access to data management, 2) easy validation of data integrity, and 3) an easy way to add new records to the dataset with the same robust integrity policy. A prototype was developed and tested using a subset of a public dataset from a real scientific collaboration, the Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) Project.</description>

      <title>TruthTensor: Evaluating LLMs Human Imitation through Prediction Market Drift and Holistic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating language models and AI agents remains fundamentally challenging because static benchmarks fail to capture real-world uncertainty, distribution shift, and the gap between isolated task accuracy and human-aligned decision-making under evolving conditions. This paper introduces TruthTensor, a novel, reproducible evaluation paradigm that measures Large Language Models (LLMs) not only as prediction engines but as human-imitation systems operating in socially-grounded, high-entropy environments. Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts. We publicly release TruthTensor at https://truthtensor.com</description>

      <title>Efficient Beam Selection for ISAC in Cell-Free Massive MIMO via Digital Twin-Assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beamforming enhances signal strength and quality by focusing energy in specific directions. This capability is particularly crucial in cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where multiple distributed access points (APs) collaborate to provide both communication and sensing services. In this work, we first derive the distribution of joint target detection probabilities across multiple receiving APs under false alarm rate constraints, and then formulate the beam selection procedure as a Markov decision process (MDP). We establish a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, in which reward shaping and sinusoidal embedding are introduced to facilitate agent learning. To eliminate the high costs and associated risks of real-time agent-environment interactions, we further propose a novel digital twin (DT)-assisted offline DRL approach. Different from traditional online DRL, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based DT module, operating as a replica of the real world, is meticulously designed to generate virtual state-action transition pairs and enrich data diversity, enabling offline adjustment of the agent's policy. Additionally, we address the out-of-distribution issue by incorporating an extra penalty term into the loss function design. The convergency of agent-DT interaction and the upper bound of the Q-error function are theoretically derived. Numerical results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed approach, which significantly reduces online interaction overhead while maintaining effective beam selection across diverse conditions including strict false alarm control, low signal-to-noise ratios, and high target velocities.</description>

      <title>LLM-enhanced Air Quality Monitoring Interface via Model Context Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03706</link>

Abstract: Air quality monitoring is central to environmental sustainability and public health, yet traditional systems remain difficult for non-expert users to interpret due to complex visualizations, limited interactivity, and high deployment costs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to make sensor data more accessible, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliability in safety-critical domains. To address these challenges, we present an LLM-enhanced Air Monitoring Interface (AMI) that integrates real-time sensor data with a conversational interface via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Our system grounds LLM outputs in live environmental data, enabling accurate, context-aware responses while reducing hallucination risk. The architecture combines a Django-based backend, a responsive user dashboard, and a secure MCP server that exposes system functions as discoverable tools, allowing the LLM to act as an active operator rather than a passive responder. Expert evaluation demonstrated high factual accuracy (4.78), completeness (4.82), and minimal hallucinations (4.84), on a scale of 5, supported by inter-rater reliability analysis. These results highlight the potential of combining LLMs with standardized tool protocols to create reliable, secure, and user-friendly interfaces for real-time environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized in an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares W_n using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local block-XY mixer that preserves the one-hot manifold and has a constant spectral gap on the one-excitation sector. At the level of expressivity, we establish per-block controllability, implying approximate universality per block. At the level of distributional behavior, we show that, after natural block and symbol permutation twirls, shallow CE-QAOA realizes an encoded unitary 1-design and supports approximate second-moment (2-design) behavior; combined with a Paley-Zygmund argument, this yields finite-shot anticoncentration guarantees.
  Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic feasibility checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is a polynomial shot budget. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r &gt;= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) minimax separation. In noiseless circuit simulations of traveling salesman problem instances with n in {4,...,10} locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem size.</description>

      <title>Unveiling and Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Recommendations: A Path to Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10825v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems excel in delivering comprehensive suggestions by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, they often inherit biases from skewed training data, favoring mainstream content while underrepresenting diverse or non-traditional options. This study explores the interplay between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, focusing on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. This paper analyzes bias in LLM-based recommendation systems across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, and Gemini), revealing its deep and pervasive impact on outcomes. Intersecting identities and contextual factors, like socioeconomic status, further amplify biases, complicating fair recommendations across diverse groups. Our findings reveal that bias in these systems is deeply ingrained, yet even simple interventions like prompt engineering can significantly reduce it. We further propose a retrieval-augmented generation strategy to mitigate bias more effectively. Numerical experiments validate these strategies, demonstrating both the pervasive nature of bias and the impact of the proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Blockchain Survey: Foundations, Trends, and Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing poses fundamental risks to classical blockchain systems by undermining widely used cryptographic primitives. In response, two major research directions have emerged: post-quantum blockchains, which integrate quantum-resistant algorithms, and quantum blockchains, which leverage quantum properties such as entanglement and quantum key distribution. This survey reviews key developments in both areas, analyzing their cryptographic foundations, architectural designs, and implementation challenges. This work provides a comparative overview of technical proposals, highlight trade-offs in security, scalability, and deployment, and identify open research problems across hardware, consensus, and network design. The goal is to offer a structured and comprehensive reference for advancing secure blockchain systems in the quantum era.</description>

      <title>Shuttling Compiler for Trapped-Ion Quantum Computers Based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped-ion quantum computers based on segmented traps rely on shuttling operations to establish long-range connectivity between sub-registers. Qubit routing dynamically reconfigures qubit positions so that all qubits involved in a gate operation are co-located within the same segment, a task whose complexity increases with system size. To address this challenge, we propose a layout-independent compilation strategy based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we fine-tune pretrained LLMs to generate the required shuttling operations. We evaluate this approach on linear and branched one-dimensional architectures using quantum circuits of up to $16$ qubits. Our results show that the fine-tuned LLMs generate valid shuttling schedules and, in some cases, outperform previous shuttling compilers by requiring approximately $15\,\%$ less shuttle overhead. However, results degrade as the algorithms increase in width and depth. In future, we plan to improve LLM-based shuttle compilation by enhancing our training pipeline using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO).</description>
