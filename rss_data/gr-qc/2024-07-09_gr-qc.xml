      <title>Stability Analysis Of Fractional Relativistic Polytropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrophysics, the gravitational stability of a self-gravitating polytropic fluid sphere is an intriguing subject, especially when trying to comprehend the genesis and development of celestial bodies like planets and stars. This stability is the sphere's capacity to stay in balance in the face of disruptions. We utilize fractional calculus to explore self-gravitating, hydrostatic spheres governed by a polytropic equation of state \P=K\rho^{1+1/n}. We focus on structures with polytropic indices ranging from 1 to 3 and consider relativistic and fractional parameters, denoted by \sigma and \alpha, respectively. The stability of these relativistic polytropes is evaluated using the critical point method, which is associated with the energetic principles developed in 1964 by Tooper. This approach enables us to pinpoint the critical mass and radius at which where polytropic spheres shift from stable to unstable states. The results highlight the critical relativistic parameter where the polytrope's mass peaks, signaling the onset of radial instability. For polytropic indices of 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 with a fractional parameter \alpha, we observe stable relativistic polytropes for \sigma values below the critical thresholds of \sigma= 0.42, 0.20, 0.10, and 0.0, respectively. Conversely, instability emerges as \sigma surpasses these critical values. Our comprehensive calculations reveal that the critical relativistic value (\sigma_{CR}) for the onset of instability tends to increase as the fractional parameter {\alpha} decreases.</description>

      <title>Spectral Variance in a Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background From a Binary Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A population of compact object binaries emitting gravitational waves that are not individually resolvable will form a stochastic gravitational wave signal. While the expected spectrum over population realizations is well known from Phinney (2001), its higher order moments have not been fully studied before or computed in the case of arbitrary binary evolution. We calculate analytic scaling relationships as a function of gravitational-wave frequency for the statistical variance, skewness, and kurtosis of a stochastic gravitational-wave signal over population realizations. If the time derivative of the binary orbital frequency can be expressed as a power-law in frequency, we find that these moment quantities also take the form of power-law relationships. We also develop a numerical population synthesis framework against which we compare our analytic results, finding excellent agreement. These new scaling relationships provide physical context to understanding spectral fluctuations in a gravitational-wave background signal and may provide additional information that can aid in explaining the origin of the nanohertz-frequency signal observed by pulsar timing array campaigns.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Apparent horizons of the Thakurta spacetime and the description of cosmological black holes"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The findings discussed in "Apparent Horizons of the Thakurta Spacetime and the Description of Cosmological Black Holes" deviate from prior research, particularly our study in Phys. Rev. D 95, 084031 (2017). We clarify this inconsistency, which arises from employing a coordinate transformation covering a distinct region of spacetime -- specifically one considered inaccessible due to its location beyond a singularity, making it unreachable from infinity. Additionally, we provide a concrete example where the distinct horizons and spacetime regions are readily discernible.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional MOG dark compact object: shadow behavior in the light of EHT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consideration of extra spatial dimensions is motivated by the unification of gravity with other interactions, the achievement of the ultimate framework of quantum gravity, and fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. Much attention has been focused on the effect of these extra dimensions on the modified theories of gravity. Analytically examining astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is one approach to understand how extra dimensions would affect the modified gravitational theories. The purpose of this study is to derive a higher dimensional metric for a dark compact object in STVG theory and then examine the behavior of the shadow shapes for this solution in STVG theory in higher dimensions. We apply the Carter method to formulate the geodesic equations and the Hamilton Jacobi method to find photon orbits around this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions and the STVG parameter alpha on the black hole shadow size. Next, we compare the shadow radius of this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object to the shadow size of the supermassive black hole M87, which has been realized by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaborations, in order to restrict these parameters. We find that extra dimensions in the STVG theory typically lead to a reduction in the shadow size of the higher dimensional MOG dark compact object, whereas the effect of parameter alpha on this black hole shadow is suppressible. Remarkably, given the constraints from EHT observations, we find that the shadow size of the four dimensional MOG dark compact object lies in the confidence levels of the EHT data. Finally, we investigate the issue of acceleration bounds in higher dimensional MOG dark compact object in confrontation with EHT data of M87.</description>

      <title>Gravitational orbital Hall effect of vortex photons in Lense-Thirring metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex photons, possessing an intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM) aligned with the direction of propagation, are described using vortex electromagnetic wave packets. Similar to the gravitational spin Hall effect (SHE), these vortex photons are expected to exhibit intrinsic OAM-dependent trajectories and separations when propagating through a gravitational field, a phenomenon termed the gravitational orbital Hall effect (OHE). In this work, we construct a vortex Laguerre-Gaussian electromagnetic wave packet and analyze its motion by solving covariant Maxwell equations within the Lense-Thirring metric. Our findings reveal that vortex photons with different intrinsic OAM not only separate perpendicular to the null geodesic plane but also within it. This behavior contrasts with the gravitational SHE, where photons of opposite spins separate primarily perpendicular to the null geodesic plane. Moreover, the relationship between the separation and intrinsic OAM differs significantly from that between the separation and spin. These results suggest a unique interaction between intrinsic OAM and gravity, distinct from the spin-gravity coupling, indicating that the gravitational OHE might not be precisely predicted by merely substituting spin with intrinsic OAM in the gravitational SHE.</description>

      <title>Identifying \textit{doppelg\"ange} Black Holes through Shadow Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, an interesting \textit{doppelg\"ange} black hole solution is obtained in the string-inspired Euler-Heisenberg theory, where the black holes have the same radii but share different charges. We found, however, they possess different ISCOs and photon spheres, and hence affect their shadow images. In this work, we investigate the optical appearances, illuminated by an optically and geometrically thin disk, are investigated, of such black hole. One finds that doppelg\"ange black holes have different optical appearances. Even the horizon radii are the same, the size of shadows are not equal. Furthermore, we found that the large magnetic charge $Q_m$ black holes give rise to novel shadow images that the usual bright rings inside shadow are not clear, The optical appearances illuminated by spherically accretions are also examined, and it can also identify two doppelg\"ange black holes.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole within the Bondi-Sachs framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes have a long and well established history. Predominantly, much research in this area has customarily focused on the equations given by Regge, Wheeler and Zerilli. In this work we study linearized perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole using the Characteristic formulation of numerical relativity, with an emphasis on the computation of QNMs. Within this formalism, the master equation describing gravitational perturbations is known to satisfy a fourth order hypergeometric differential equation. We analyse the singular points of this master equation, and obtain series solutions whose coefficients are given by three term recurrence relations, from which Leaver's continued fraction method can be applied. Using this technique, we recover the standard Schwarzschild quasinormal modes. In addition, we find that imposing purely outgoing boundary conditions, a natural feature of the Bondi-Sachs framework, leads to the recovery of the algebraically special mode.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology in Coupled Brans-Dicke Gravity: A Noether Symmetry Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work deals with a multi-field cosmological model in a spatially flat FLRW space-time geometry. The usual Brans-Dicke(BD) field and another scalar field are minimally coupled to gravity while they interact with each other through the Kinetic terms. {The main aim of the present work is to examine whether the model is compatible with cosmic observations. So cosmological solutions are obtained using symmetry analysis only.} By imposing Noether Symmetry to the Lagrangian of the system the potential of the scalar field as well as the coupling function has been determined. The classical solutions are determined after simplifying the Lagrangian using cyclic variables. Finally, Wheeler-DeWitt(WD) equation in quantum cosmology has been formulated and conserved momenta corresponding to Noether symmetry shows the periodic part of the wave function and it helps to have the complete integral for the wave function.</description>

      <title>Inferring the spin distribution of binary black holes using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin characteristics of black holes offer valuable insights into the evolutionary pathways of their progenitor stars, crucial for understanding the broader population properties of black holes. Traditional Hierarchical Bayesian inference techniques employed to discern these properties often entail substantial time investments, and consensus regarding the spin distribution of Binary Black Hole (BBH) systems remains elusive. In this study, leveraging observations from GWTC-3, we adopt a machine learning approach to infer the spin distribution of black holes within BBH systems. Specifically, we develop a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and train it using data generated from a Beta distribution. Our training strategy, involving the segregation of data into 10 bins, not only expedites model training but also enhances the DNN's versatility and adaptability to accommodate the burgeoning volume of gravitational wave observations. Utilizing Monte Carlo-bootstrap (MC-bootstrap) to generate observation-simulated samples, we derive spin distribution parameters: $\alpha=1.3^{+0.25}_{-0.18},\beta=1.70^{+0.24}_{-0.29}$ for the larger BH sample and $\alpha=1.37^{+0.31}_{-0.20},\beta=1.63^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$ for the smaller BH sample. Within our constraints, the distributions of component spin magnitudes suggest the likelihood of both black holes in the BBH merger possessing non-zero spin.</description>

      <title>Non-Axisymmetric Gravitational "Hair" for Extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various generalizations of the scalar, axisymmetric Aretakis "horizon hair" for extremal black holes have recently appeared in the literature. In this paper, we present an expression for a non- axisymmetric Aretakis gravitational charge and its potentially observable imprint at a finite distance from the horizon (Ori-coefficient) in extremal Kerr black hole backgrounds. We offer strong and robust numerical evidence for the existence of this hair and its properties. Specifically, we consider the time evolution of horizon penetrating, quadrupolar and (subdominant) octupolar gravitational perturbations with compact support on extremal Kerr (EK) spacetime. We do this by numerically solving the Teukolsky equation and determining the Aretakis charge values on the horizon and at a finite distance from the black hole.</description>

      <title>Regular out of the singular: exacts results on top of a curvature singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By constructing a model of spacetime having a strong curvature singularity in which causal geodesics are complete, but more generic causal curves are not, we explicitly show that some electrostatic field configurations on that background are regular everywhere, including \emph{there} where the spacetime ceases to be described by a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Our calculations are performed using the analogue-gravity description provided by Plebanski and Tamm, according to which the characterization of the electromagnetic field on a generic curved background is equivalent to solving Maxwell's equations in flat space with a matter content verifying certain non-trivial constitutive relations. The regularity of the electric field in what could be considered the worst conceivable physical condition, opens the door to further investigation into the possibility of propagating signals capable of crossing a spacetime singularity.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a spherically symmetric charged black hole in the presence of a Kalb--Ramond field background. We calculate the photon sphere and shadow radii and, corroborating our results, we constrain them from observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), particularly focusing on the shadow images of Sagittarius $A^{*}$. Additionally, we analyze the greybody factors, emission rate, and partial absorption cross section. We also examine the topological charge and its application to the deflection angle. Finally, we conduct the analysis of the heat capacity and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>The curvature dependence of gravitational-wave tests of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy extensions to General Relativity modify the Einstein-Hilbert action with higher-order curvature corrections and theory-specific coupling constants. The order of these corrections imprints a universal curvature dependence on observations while the coupling constant controls the deviation strength. In this Letter, we leverage the theory-independent expectation that modifications to the action of a given order in spacetime curvature (Riemann tensor and contractions) lead to observational deviations that scale with the system length-scale to a corresponding power. Focusing on gravitational wave observations, the relevant scale is the binary total mass, and deviations scale as a power of mass $p$ related to the action order. For example, $p=4,6$ arise in effective field theory for cubic and quartic theories respectively. We incorporate this universal scaling into theory-agnostic tests of General Relativity with current gravitational-wave observations, thus enabling constraints on the curvature scaling without compromising the agnostic nature of these tests. This introduces a flexible yet highly interpretable new paradigm for tests of General Relativity with gravitational-wave catalogs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a new understanding of the vacuum energy problem based on the combination of the phase space regularization and the holographic bound, we argue that quantum gravity should be understood as gravitized quantum theory, that is, quantum theory wherein the geometry and topology of the state-space if fully dynamical, in analogy with the dynamical nature of spacetime in Einstein's general relativity. Apart from the vacuum energy problem viewed as a quantum gravity problem, we discuss the "smoking gun" experiments involving higher order quantum interference, as well as experimental probes of the statistics of spacetime quanta. Finally, we address the conundrum of the intricately patterned spectrum of masses of elementary particles as well as their mixing angles, as another telltale problem of quantum gravity viewed as gravitized quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the asymptotic symmetries of electromagnetism non-minimally coupled to scalar fields, with non-minimal couplings of the Fermi type that occur in extended supergravity models. Our study is carried out at spatial infinity where minimal and non-minimal couplings exhibit very different asymptotic properties: while the former generically cannot be neglected at infinity, the latter can. Electromagnetic non-minimal couplings are in that respect similar to gravitational minimal couplings, which are also asymptotically subdominant. Because the non-minimally interacting model is asymptotic to the free one, its asymptotic symmetries are the same as the ones of the free theory, i.e., described by angle-dependent $u(1)$ gauge transformations. We also analyse the duality symmetry and show that it is broken to its compact subgroup by the asymptotic conditions. Finally, we consider logarithmic gauge transformations and use them to simplify the symmetry algebra.</description>

      <title>Origin of effective graviton mass from spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity and quantum field theory govern all fundamental physical processes, from nuclear and subatomic scales to the solar system, galactic, and cosmology. Both theories work remarkably well in their tested domains. However, there is minimal overlap between the two domains. Our work demonstrates that the non-overlapping of domains \emph{no longer} holds when non-perturbative effects are considered. We introduce a novel mechanism in which the gravitons acquire \emph{effective mass} due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of global or local symmetry of complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. In the flat space-time limit, we demonstrate that the resulting action for the graviton is identical to the extended Fierz-Pauli (FP) action, corresponding to the mass deformation parameter $\alpha = 1/2$. The extended FP action has 6 Degrees of freedom and no ghost. For local $U(1)$ SSB, we establish that the effective graviton mass is related to the mass of the gauge boson and the electric charge of the complex scalar field. Interestingly, our results indicate that the millicharged dark matter scalar fields, generating dark photons, can produce graviton mass of the same order as the Hubble constant $(H_0)$. Hence, we argue that the dark sector offers a natural explanation for the acceleration of the current Universe.</description>

      <title>Impact of lensing bias on the cosmological dispersion measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift, derived from localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), has been used as a tool for constraining the cosmic ionized fraction and cosmological parameters. For these purposes, the DM in a homogeneous cosmological model has typically been used, neglecting the inhomogeneity of matter distribution. In this study, we derive a bias in the ensemble average of the DM over many FRBs owing to gravitational lensing by the inhomogeneous matter distribution based on cosmological perturbation theory. We demonstrate that the ensemble average is $0.4 \, \%$--$1\,\%$ smaller than the DM in the corresponding homogeneous model for a source redshift of $z_{\rm s}=1$, according to recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of IllustrisTNG and BAHAMAS. This reduction occurs because light rays from FRBs tend to avoid high-density regions owing to lensing deflection. We also discuss another selection effect, magnification bias, where demagnified FRBs with low DMs, fainter than the detection threshold, are excluded from the observed sample, leading to a selective observation of magnified FRBs with high DMs. Lensing bias, including magnification bias, must be considered to achieve percent level accuracy in the DM--redshift relation.</description>

      <title>Cosmological simulations of scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a set of cosmological N-body simulations with standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology but characterized by a scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type featuring a power-law dependence of the $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}(k)$ at large scales followed by a saturation to a constant value at smaller scales where non-linear growth leads to the formation of collapsed cosmic structures. Such models are built to ensure consistency with current Cosmic Microwave Background bounds on primordial non-Gaussianity yet allowing for large effects of the non-Gaussian statistics on the properties of non-linear structure formation. We show the impact of such scale-dependent non-Gaussian scenarios on a wide range of properties of the resulting cosmic structures, such as the non-linear matter power spectrum, the halo and sub-halo mass functions, the concentration-mass relation, the halo and void density profiles, and we highlight for the first time that some of these models might mimic the effects of Warm Dark Matter for several of such observables</description>

Abstract: The Hamiltonian governing the gravitational interaction of N relativistic particles in a four-dimensional anti-de Sitter background is derived to leading order in Newton's constant. The resulting pairwise interactions, combined with the confining nature of motion in anti-de Sitter spacetime, are expected to lead to classical chaos. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the emergence of a chaotic classical limit on the gravity side has important implications for the dual three-dimensional conformal field theory, including that the spectrum of conformal primary operators at strong coupling should exhibit level repulsion in line with the Wigner surmise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the challenges of motivating, constructing, and quantizing a canonically normalized inflationary perturbation in spatially curved universes. We show that this has historically proved challenging due to the interaction of nonadiabaticity with spatial curvature. We construct a novel curvature perturbation that is canonically normalized in the sense of its equation of motion and is unique up to a single scalar parameter. With this construction it becomes possible to set initial conditions invariant under canonical transformations, overcoming known ambiguities in the literature. This corrected quantization has potentially observational consequences via modifications to the primordial power spectrum at large angular scales, as well as theoretical implications for quantization procedures in curved cosmologies filled with a scalar field.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) and the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) have significant implications for our understanding of the very early universe. We present a novel approach to generate PBHs via the NEC violation in a single-field inflationary scenario. In our scenario, the universe transitions from a first slow-roll inflation stage with a Hubble parameter $H = H_{\text{inf}1}$ to a second slow-roll inflation stage with $H = H_{\text{inf}2}\gg H_{\text{inf}1}$, passing through an intermediate stage of NEC violation. The NEC violation naturally enhances the primordial scalar power spectrum at a certain wavelength, leading to the production of PBHs with masses and abundances of observational interest. We also investigate the phenomenological signatures of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) resulting from the enhanced density perturbations. Our work highlights the potential of utilizing a combination of PBHs, SIGWs, and primordial gravitational waves as a valuable probe for studying NEC violation during inflation, opening up new avenues for exploring the early universe.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields around a rotating loop quantum gravity black hole: Waveform, quasi-normal modes and superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rotating loop quantum gravity black hole is a newly proposed non-singular black hole, which eliminates spacetime singularities when a regularization parameter is introduced through loop quantum corrections. This parameter is expected to give rise to observable effects. In this paper, the dynamical behavior of a scalar field near a rotating loop quantum gravity black hole is investigated. Given a small initial perturbation, we obtain the waveform of massless scalar fields evolving over time. By analyzing the waveform, we find that the regularization parameter only affects the damping oscillation of waveform, but not the initial outburst and late-time tail stages. This behavior is characterized by quasi-normal modes. Under scalar field perturbations, the loop quantum black holes remain stable. Moreover, we calculate the quasi-normal modes of massive scalar fields by three numerical methods, which are the Prony, WKB, and shooting methods, respectively. Our results indicate that the real part of quasi-normal modes depends only on the regularization parameter, while the imaginary part does not only on the regularization parameter but also on the angular momentum. Finally, we study the amplification effect of rotating black holes, i.e., the superradiance. Our analyses indicate the existence of stronger superradiance around loop quantum gravity black holes compared to Kerr ones.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Hamiltonian form of gravity in terms of connection and densitized triad variables admits a simpler structure close to a (spacelike) curvature singularity. To define this regime, we construct a limit to a vanishing (spatial) metric determinant. The cosmological and black hole spacetime solutions that characterize such an approach to a singularity are obtained. We also elucidate the connection of this generic limit to the `Carroll' limit which could be interpreted as a special case.</description>

      <title>Measuring the nuclear equation of state with neutron star-black hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) observations of neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers are sensitive to the nuclear equation of state (EOS). We present a new methodology for EOS inference with non-parametric Gaussian process (GP) priors, enabling direct constraints on the pressure at specific densities and the length-scale of correlations on the EOS. Using realistic simulations of NSBH mergers, incorporating both GW and electromagnetic (EM) selection to ensure sample purity, we find that a GW detector network operating at O5-sensitivities will constrain the radius of a $\unit[1.4]{M_{\odot}}$ NS and the maximum NS mass with $1.6\%$ and $13\%$ precision, respectively. With the same sample, the projected constraint on the length-scale of correlations in the EOS is $\geq~\unit[3.2]{MeV~fm^{-3}}$. These results demonstrate strong potential for insights into the nuclear EOS from NSBH systems, provided they are robustly identified.</description>

Abstract: A small quantum system within the gravitational field of a massive body will be entangled with the quantum degrees of freedom of the latter. Hence, the massive body acts as an environment, and it induces non-unitary dynamics, noise, and decoherence to the quantum system. It is impossible to shield systems on Earth from this gravity-mediated decoherence, which could severely affect all experiments with macroscopic quantum systems. We undertake a first-principles analysis of this effect, by deriving the corresponding open system dynamics. We find that near-future quantum experiments are not affected, but there is a strong decoherence effect at the human scale. The decoherence time for a superposition of two localized states of a human with an one meter separation is of the order of one second.</description>

Abstract: In this short Note, I answer the titular question: Yes, a radiation gauge can be horizon-locking. Radiation gauges are very common in black hole perturbation theory. It's also very convenient if a gauge choice is horizon-locking, i.e. the location of the horizon is not moved by a linear metric perturbation. Therefore it is doubly convenient that a radiation gauge can be horizon-locking, when some simple criteria are satisfied. Though the calculation is straightforward, it seemed useful enough to warrant writing this Note. Finally I show an example: the $\ell$ vector of the Hartle-Hawking tetrad in Kerr satisfies all the conditions for ingoing radiation gauge to keep the future horizon fixed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the old idea of using the moon as a resonant gravitational-wave (GW) detector, as well as the recent updates in modeling the lunar response to GWs, we re-evaluate the feasibility of using a network of lunar seismometers to constrain the stochastic GW background (SGWB). In particular, using the updated model of the lunar response, we derive the pattern functions for the two polarizations of GW. With these pattern functions, we further calculate the overlap reduction functions for a network of lunar seismometers, where we have relaxed the conventional assumption that lunar seismometers are perfectly leveled to measure only the vertical acceleration. We apply our calculation to two future lunar projects, namely, Chang'e and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA). We find that the two projects could constrain the SGWB to a level of $\Omega_{\text{GW}}^{\text{Chang'e}} &lt; 2.4 \times 10^{2}$ and $\Omega_{\text{GW}}^{\text{LGWA}} &lt; 2.0 \times 10^{-10}$, respectively, which corresponds to a signal-to-noise ratio of SNR $=3$. These results are better than the constraints placed previously on the SGWB in the mid-frequency band (around $10^{-3}- 10~\text{Hz}$) by various types of experiments.</description>

      <title>Pole-skipping of gravitational waves in the backgrounds of four-dimensional massive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pole-skipping is a property of gravitational waves dictated by their behaviour at horizons of black holes. It stems from the inability to unambiguously impose ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon at an infinite discrete set of Fourier modes. The phenomenon has been best understood, when such a description exists, in terms of dual holographic (AdS/CFT) correlation function that take the value of '0/0' at these special points. In this work, we investigate details of pole-skipping purely from the point of view of classical gravity in 4d massive black hole geometries with flat, spherical and hyperbolic horizons, and with an arbitrary cosmological constant. We show that pole-skipping points naturally fall into two categories: the algebraically special points and a set of pole-skipping points that is common to the even and odd channels of perturbations. Our analysis utilises and generalises (to arbitrary maximally symmetric horizon topology and cosmological constant) the 'integrable' structure of the Darboux transformations, which relate the master field equations that describe the evolution of gravitational perturbations in the two channels. Finally, we provide new insights into a number of special cases: spherical black holes, asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black branes and pole-skipping at the cosmological horizon in de Sitter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark sirens are a powerful way to infer cosmological and astrophysical parameters from the combination of gravitational wave sirens and galaxy catalogues. Importantly, the method relies on the completeness of the galaxy catalogues being well modelled. A magnitude-limited catalogue will always be incomplete to some extent, requiring a completion scheme to avoid biasing the parameter inference. Standard methods include homogeneous and multiplicative completion, which have the advantage of simplicity but underestimate or overestimate the amplitude of structure at low completeness, respectively. In this work, we propose a new method to complete galaxy catalogues which uses clustering information to incorporate knowledge of the large scale structure into the dark sirens method. We find that if the structure of the true number of galaxies is sufficiently well preserved in the catalogue, our estimator can perform drastically better than both homogeneous and multiplicative completion. We lay the foundations for a maximally informative dark sirens analysis and discuss its limitations.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive investigation of anisotropy in a holographic p-wave superconductor model, revealing novel insights into the behavior of quantum information measures in strongly coupled systems. Through rigorous semi-analytical methods, we uncover the existence of an isotropic point emerging at a critical temperature $T_{II}$, marking a significant transition in the system's anisotropic properties. We offer a systematic analysis of the mechanisms driving anisotropy and isotropy transitions, finding that this phenomenon is unique to the p-wave model and absent in other anisotropic systems like anisotropic axion models with metal-insulator transitions. We propose that the explicit component dependence of the vector field manifesting anisotropy is the key driver of the emergent isotropy. Our analysis of holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), and butterfly velocity demonstrates their distinct sensitivities to bulk anisotropy, with EWCS and butterfly velocity emerging as superior probes for detecting the isotropic point.</description>

      <title>Duality constraints on thermal spectra of 3d CFTs and 4d quasinormal modes</title>

Abstract: Thermal spectra of correlation functions in holographic 3d large-N CFTs correspond to quasinormal modes of classical gravity and other fields in asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole spacetimes. Using general properties of such spectra along with constraints imposed by the S-duality (or the particle-vortex duality), we derive a spectral duality relation that all such spectra must obey. Its form is universal in that each such relation (expressed as an infinite product over QNMs) only depends on a single function of a spatial wavevector that corresponds to the bulk algebraically special frequencies. In the process, we also derive a new sum rule constraining products over QNMs. The spectral duality relation, which imposes an infinite set of constraints on the QNMs, is then investigated and a number of well-known holographic examples that demonstrate its validity are examined. Our results also allow us to understand several new aspects of the pole-skipping phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Janus Deformation of de Sitter Space and Transitions in Gravitational Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-dependent $\mathcal{O}(1/G)$ deformation of pure de Sitter (dS) space in dS gravity coupled to a massless scalar field. It is the dS counterpart of the AdS Janus deformation and interpolates two asymptotically dS spaces in the far past and the far future with a single deformation parameter. The Penrose diagram can be elongated along the time direction indefinitely as the deformation becomes large. After studying the classical properties of the geometry such as the area theorem and the fluctuation by a matter field, we explore the algebraic structure of the field operators on the deformed spacetime. We argue that the algebra is a von Neumann factor of type II$_\infty$ for small deformations, but there occurs a transition to type I$_\infty$ as the deformation increases so that the neck region of the deformed space becomes a Lorentzian cylinder.</description>
