      <title>A sub-solar metallicity on the ultra-short period planet HIP 65Ab</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying and understanding the physical and chemical processes that govern hot Jupiters gives us insights on the formation of these giant planets. Having a constraint on the molecular composition of their atmosphere can help us pinpoint their evolution timeline. Namely, the metal enrichment and carbon-to-oxygen ratio can give us information about where in the protoplanetary disk a giant planet may have accreted its envelope, and subsequently, indicate if it went through migration. Here we present the first analysis of the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HIP 65Ab. Using near-infrared high-resolution observations from the IGRINS spectrograph, we detect H$_2$O and CO absorption in the dayside atmosphere of HIP 65Ab. Using a high-resolution retrieval framework, we find a CO abundance of log(CO) = $-3.85^{+0.33}_{-0.36}$, which is slightly under abundant with expectation from solar composition models. We also recover a low water abundance of log(H$_2$O) = $-4.42\pm{0.18}$, depleted by 1 order of magnitude relative to a solar-like composition. Upper limits on the abundance of all other relevant major carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules are also obtained. Overall, our results are consistent with a sub-stellar metallicity but slightly elevated C/O. Such a composition may indicate that HIP 65Ab accreted its envelope from beyond the water snowline and underwent a disk-free migration to its current location. Alternatively, some of the oxygen on HIP 65Ab could be condensed out of the atmosphere, in which case the observed gas-phase abundances would not reflect the true bulk envelope composition.</description>

      <title>The intermittently-resonant coevolution of migrating planets and their pulsating stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are expected to form far from their host star and move toward close-in, circular orbits via a smooth, monotonic decay due to mild and constant tidal dissipation. Yet, three systems have recently been found exhibiting planet-induced stellar pulsations suggesting unexpectedly strong tidal interactions. Here we combine stellar evolution and tide models to show that dynamical tides raised by eccentric gas giants can give rise to chains of resonance locks with multiple modes, enriching the dynamics seen in single-mode resonance locking of circularized systems. These series of resonance locks yield orders-of-magnitude larger changes in eccentricity and harmonic pulsations relative to those expected from a single episode of resonance locking or nonresonant tidal interactions. Resonances become more frequent as a star evolves off the main sequence providing an alternative explanation to the origin of some stellar pulsators and yielding the concept of "dormant migrating giants". Evolution trajectories are characterized by competing episodes of inward/outward migration and spin-up/-down of the star which are sensitive to the system parameters, revealing a new challenge in modeling migration paths and in contextualizing the observed populations of giant exoplanets and stellar binaries. This sensitivity however offers a new window to constrain the stellar properties of planetary hosts via tidal asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Astrometric detection of exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the most ancient branch of astronomy, astrometry has been developed for thousands of years. However, it has only recently become possible to utilize astrometry for the detection of exoplanets. Gaia, an astrometric surveyor of 1 billion stars, is capable of measuring the position of stars with a precision as high as 20 $\mu$as. Gaia is expected to discover more than 10,000 exoplanets by the end of its mission, surpassing the productivity of most exoplanet surveys.
  In this chapter, I will introduce different techniques used to achieve high-precision astrometry. Subsequently, I will explore how both relative and absolute astrometry can be employed to detect exoplanets. Finally, I will present the detection limit of the Gaia astrometric survey.</description>

      <title>Crash Chronicles: relative contribution from comets and carbonaceous asteroids to Earth's volatile budget in the context of an Early Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent models of solar system formation suggest that a dynamical instability among the giant planets happened within the first 100 Myr after disk dispersal, perhaps before the Moon-forming impact. As a direct consequence, a bombardment of volatile-rich impactors may have taken place on Earth before internal and atmospheric reservoirs were decoupled. However, such a timing has been interpreted to potentially be at odds with the disparate inventories of Xe isotopes in Earth's mantle compared to its atmosphere. This study aims to assess the dynamical effects of an Early Instability on the delivery of carbonaceous asteroids and comets to Earth, and address the implications for the Earth's volatile budget. We perform 20 high-resolution dynamical simulations of solar system formation from the time of gas disk dispersal, each starting with 1600 carbonaceous asteroids and 10000 comets, taking into account the dynamical perturbations from an early giant planet instability. Before the Moon-forming impact, the cumulative collision rate of comets with Earth is about 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of carbonaceous asteroids. After the Moon-forming impact, this ratio either decreases or increases, often by orders of magnitude, depending on the dynamics of individual simulations. An increase in the relative contribution of comets happens in 30\% of our simulations. In these cases, the delivery of noble gases from each source is comparable, given that the abundance of 132Xe is 3 orders of magnitude greater in comets than in carbonaceous chondrites. The increase in cometary flux relative to carbonaceous asteroids at late times may thus offer an explanation for the Xe signature dichotomy between the Earth's mantle and atmosphere.</description>

      <title>The Massalia asteroid family as the origin of ordinary L chondrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of micrometeorites in mid-Ordovician limestones and Earth's impact craters indicate that our planet witnessed a massive infall of ordinary L chondrite material 466 million years (My) ago (Heck et al. 2017, Schmieder &amp; Kring 2020, Kenkmann 2021) that may have been at the origin of the first major mass extinction event (Schmitz et al. 2019). The breakup of a large asteroid in the main belt is the likely cause of this massive infall. In modern times, material originating from this breakup still dominates meteorite falls (&gt;20% of all falls) (Swindle et al. 2014). Here, we provide spectroscopic observations and dynamical evidence that the Massalia collisional family is the only plausible source of this catastrophic event and of the most abundant class of meteorites falling on Earth today. It is suitably located in the inner belt, at low-inclination orbits, which corresponds to the observed distribution of L-chondrite-like near-Earth objects (NEOs) and of interplanetary dust concentrated at 1.4 degrees (Sykes 1990, Reach et al. 1997).</description>

      <title>Young asteroid families as the primary source of meteorites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of bright shooting stars and their meteorite samples is among the most ancient astronomy-related questions that at larger scales has human consequences [1-3]. As of today, only ${\sim}\,6\%$ of meteorite falls have been firmly linked to their sources (Moon, Mars, and asteroid (4) Vesta [4-6]). Here, we show that ${\sim}\,70\%$ of meteorites originate from three recent breakups of $D &gt; 30\,{\rm km}$ asteroids that occurred 5.8, 7.5 and less than ${\sim}\,40$ million years ago. These breakups, including the well-known Karin family [7], took place in the prominent yet old Koronis and Massalia families and are at the origin of the dominance of H and L ordinary chondrites among meteorite falls. These young families distinguish themselves amidst all main belt asteroids by having a uniquely high abundance of small fragments. Their size-frequency distribution remains steep for a few tens of millions of years, exceeding temporarily the production of metre-sized fragments by the largest old asteroid families (e.g., Flora, Vesta). Supporting evidence includes the existence of associated dust bands [8-10], the cosmic-ray exposure ages of H-chondrite meteorites [11,12], or the distribution of pre-atmospheric orbits of meteorites [13-15].</description>

      <title>Feasibility of detecting shadows in disks induced by infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations performed with high-resolution imaging techniques revealed the existence of shadows in circumstellar disks that can be explained by the misalignment of an inner with respect to an outer disk. The cause of misalignment, however, is still debated. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of observing shadows induced by one prominent scenario that may lead to misalignment, which involves the late infall of material onto a protostellar system. In particular, we use previously performed hydrodynamical simulations of such events, and generate flux maps in the visible, near-infrared, submillimeter, and millimeter wavelength range using Monte Carlo radiative transfer. Based on that, we derive synthetic observations of these systems performed with the instruments SPHERE/VLT and ALMA, which we use as a basis for our subsequent analysis. We find that near-infrared observations with SPHERE are particularly well suited for detecting shadows via direct imaging alongside other features such as gaps, arcs, and streamers. On the contrary, performing a shadow detection based on reconstructed ALMA observations is very challenging due to the high sensitivity that is required for this task. Thus, in cases that allow for a detection, sophisticated analyses may be needed, for instance by the utilization of carefully constructed azimuthal profiles, aiding the search for potentially shallow shadows. Lastly, we conclude that late infall-induced disk misalignment offers a plausible explanation for the emergence of shadows that are observed in various systems.</description>

      <title>The origin and evolution of wide Jupiter Mass Binary Objects in young stellar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently observed population of 540 free-floating Jupiter-mass objects, including 40 dynamically soft pairs in the Trapezium cluster have raised interesting questions on their formation and evolution. We test various scenarios for the origin and survivability of these free floating Jupiter-mass objects and Jupiter-mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) in the Trapezium cluster. The numerical calculations are performed by direct N-body integration of the stars and planets in the Trapezium cluster starting with a wide variety of planets in various configurations. We discuss four models: SPP, in which selected stars have two outer orbiting Jupiter-mass planets; SPM, where selected stars are orbited by Jupiter-mass planet-moon pairs; ISF in which JuMBOs form in situ with the stars, and FFC, where we introduce a population of free-floating single Jupiter-mass objects, but no initialized binaries. Models FFC and SPP fail to produce enough JuMBOs. Models SPM can produce sufficient JuMBOs, but requires unusually wide orbits for the planet-moon system around the star. The observed JuMBOs and free-floating Jupiter-mass objects in the Trapezium cluster are best reproduced if they formed in pairs and as free-floaters together with the other stars in a smooth (Plummer) density profile with a virial radius of 0.5pc. A fractal stellar distribution also works, but requires relatively recent formations (&gt;0.2Myr after the other stars formed) or a high (50%) initial binary fraction. This would make the primordial binary fraction of JuMBOs even higher than the already large observation fraction of 8%. The fraction of JuMBOs will continue to drop with time, and the lack of JuMBOs in Upper Scorpius could then result in its higher age, causing more JuMBOs to be ionized. We then also predict that the interstellar density of Jupiter-mass objects (mostly singles with 2% lucky surviving binaries) is 0.05/pc$^{3}$.</description>
