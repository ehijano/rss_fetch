      <title>TMA-Grid: An open-source, zero-footprint web application for FAIR Tissue MicroArray De-arraying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background:
  Tissue Microarrays (TMAs) significantly increase analytical efficiency in histopathology and large-scale epidemiologic studies by allowing multiple tissue cores to be scanned on a single slide. The individual cores can be digitally extracted and then linked to metadata for analysis in a process known as de-arraying. However, TMAs often contain core misalignments and artifacts due to assembly errors, which can adversely affect the reliability of the extracted cores during the de-arraying process. Moreover, conventional approaches for TMA de-arraying rely on desktop solutions.Therefore, a robust yet flexible de-arraying method is crucial to account for these inaccuracies and ensure effective downstream analyses.
  Results:
  We developed TMA-Grid, an in-browser, zero-footprint, interactive web application for TMA de-arraying. This web application integrates a convolutional neural network for precise tissue segmentation and a grid estimation algorithm to match each identified core to its expected location. The application emphasizes interactivity, allowing users to easily adjust segmentation and gridding results. Operating entirely in the web-browser, TMA-Grid eliminates the need for downloads or installations and ensures data privacy. Adhering to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), the application and its components are designed for seamless integration into TMA research workflows.
  Conclusions:
  TMA-Grid provides a robust, user-friendly solution for TMA dearraying on the web. As an open, freely accessible platform, it lays the foundation for collaborative analyses of TMAs and similar histopathology imaging data.

      <title>Air-blood interface engineered microfluidic device to mimic shear rate gradient induced human bleeding model</title>

Abstract: Microfluidic technology has emerged as a powerful tool for studying complex biological processes with enhanced precision and control. A microfluidic chip was designed to emulate human-like microvascular networks with precise control over channel geometry and flow conditions. By simulating blood flow dynamics during bleeding events, we successfully observed the real-time interactions of platelets and their aggregation induced by shear rate gradient at the wound site. Platelet dynamics is primarily influenced by physico-mechanical condition of blood vessels with pathophysiological condition of blood at close proximity of vascular injury site. This microfluidic platform facilitated the investigation of platelet adhesion, activation, and clot formation, providing a unique opportunity to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of platelet aggregation and blood clot. Our findings shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying thrombus formation and platelet-mediated aggregation, offering a more accurate and dynamic representation of human haemostasis compared to traditional animal models. In the conventional approach, the human bleeding model is tried on mouse due to anatomy and pathological similarities between mouse and humans. This study will simplify and standardize the blood and vasculature conditions. The microfluidic-based replication of the bleeding model holds significant promise in advancing our understanding of clotting disorders and wound healing processes. Furthermore, it paves the way for targeted therapeutic interventions in managing bleeding disorders and enhancing clinical strategies for promoting efficient wound closure. Ultimately, this study demonstrates the potential of microfluidics to revolutionize haemostasis research and opens up new avenues for the development of personalized medicine approaches in the field of clotting disorders.</description>
