      <title>Milliwatt-level UV generation using sidewall poled lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated coherent sources of ultra-violet (UV) light are essential for a wide range of applications, from ion-based quantum computing and optical clocks to gas sensing and microscopy. Conventional approaches that rely on UV gain materials face limitations in terms of wavelength versatility; in response frequency upconversion approaches that leverage various optical nonlinearities have received considerable attention. Among these, the integrated thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic platform shows particular promise owing to lithium niobate's transparency into the UV range, its strong second order nonlinearity, and high optical confinement. However, to date, the high propagation losses and lack of reliable techniques for consistent poling of cm-long waveguides with small poling periods have severely limited the utility of this platform. Here we present a sidewall poled lithium niobate (SPLN) waveguide approach that overcomes these obstacles and results in a more than two orders of magnitude increase in generated UV power compared to the state-of-the-art. Our UV SPLN waveguides feature record-low propagation losses of 2.3 dB/cm, complete domain inversion of the waveguide cross-section, and an optimum 50% duty cycle, resulting in a record-high normalized conversion efficiency of 5050 %W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$, and 4.2 mW of generated on-chip power at 390 nm wavelength. This advancement makes the TFLN photonic platform a viable option for high-quality on-chip UV generation, benefiting emerging applications.</description>

      <title>Prospects to bypass nonlocal phenomena in metals using phonon-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic design relies on an accurate understanding of light-matter interactions, yet often overlooks electronic length scales. Under extreme confinement, this omission can lead to nonclassical effects, such as nonlocal response. Here, we use mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) screened by monocrystalline gold flakes to push the limits of nanolight confinement unobstructed by nonlocal phenomena, even when the polariton phase velocity approaches the Fermi velocities of electrons in gold. We employ near-field imaging to probe polaritons in nanometre-thin crystals of hBN on gold and extract their complex propagation constant, observing effective indices exceeding 90. We further show the importance of sample characterisation by revealing a thin low-index interfacial layer naturally forming on monocrystalline gold. Our experiments address a fundamental limitation posed by nonlocal effects in van der Waals heterostructures and outline a pathway to bypass their impact in high-confinement regimes.</description>

      <title>Probing Peptide Adsorption Kinetics and Regioselectivity via Multipolar Plasmonic Modes of Gold Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient peptide adsorption on metasurfaces is essential for advanced biosensing applications. In this study, we demonstrate how ellipsometric measurements coupled with numerical simulations allow for real-time tracking of temporin-SHa peptide adsorption on gold metasurfaces. By characterizing spectral shifts at 660 nm, 920 nm, and 1000 nm, we reveal a rapid saturation of surface coverage after 3.5 hours, with a significant preferential adsorption at the resonator ends. Our approach provides a novel methodology for monitoring peptide binding, which could be applied to a wide range of biosensor designs.</description>

      <title>Alignment-Tolerant Optical Fi-Wi-Fi Bridge Assisted by a Focal Plane Array Beamformer as Air Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) links are an ideal candidate to extend the bandwidth continuum offered by fiber networks, yet at the expense of unfavorable cost credentials due to highly complex opto-mechanical setups. As a response to this challenge, we present a simple fiber-based focal plane array (FPA) architecture which contributes beamforming functionality to an FSO link that bridges the gap between two single-mode fiber ports. Through use of space-switched and wavelength-routed beamforming networks, which together with a photonic lantern provide a compact arrangement of up to 61 fine-pitched optical antenna elements on a fiber tip, we experimentally demonstrate that our FPA can assist the channel optimization of an FSO link after rough initial beam pointing. We show that favorable coupling conditions can be accomplished between two standard single-mode fibers, which enables us to successfully retain the fiber continuum by achieving error-free 10 Gb/s/{\lambda} data transmission in a space-switched out-door fiber-wireless-fiber scenario.</description>

      <title>Observation of Light Localization at the Edges of Quasicrystal Waveguide Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are unique systems that, unlike periodic structures, lack translational symmetry but exhibit long-range order dramatically enriching the system properties. While evolution of light in the bulk of photonic quasicrystals is well studied, experimental evidences of light localization near the edge of truncated photonic quasicrystal structures are practically absent. In this Letter, we observe both linear and nonlinear localization of light at the edges of radially cropped quasicrystal waveguide arrays, forming an aperiodic Penrose tiling. Our theoretical analysis reveals that for certain truncation radii, the system exhibits linear eigenstates localized at the edge of the truncated array, whereas for other radii, this localization does not occur, highlighting the significant influence of truncation on edge light localization. Using single-waveguide excitations, we experimentally confirm the presence of localized states in Penrose arrays inscribed by a femtosecond laser and investigate the effects of nonlinearity on these states. Our theoretical findings identify a family of edge solitons, and experimentally, we observe a transition from linear localized states to edge solitons as the power of the input pulse increases. Our results represent the first experimental demonstration of localization phenomena induced by the selective truncation of quasiperiodic photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Fabrication Optimization of van der Waals Metasurfaces: Inverse Patterning Boosts Resonance Quality Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) materials have garnered growing interest for use as nanophotonic building blocks that offer precise control over light-matter interaction at the nanoscale, such as optical metasurfaces hosting sharp quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances. However, traditional fabrication strategies often rely on lift-off processes, which inherently introduce imperfections in resonator shape and size distribution, ultimately limiting the resonance performance. Here, an optimized fabrication approach for vdW-metasurfaces is presented that implements inverse patterning of the etching mask, resulting in increased resonator quality solely limited by the resolution of the electron beam lithography resist and etching. Applying this inverse fabrication technique on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), quality (Q) factors exceeding $10^3$ in the visible spectral range were demonstrated, significantly surpassing previous results shown by lift-off fabricated structures. Additionally, the platforms potential as a biosensor was displayed, achieving competitive sensitivity and figure of merit of 220 in a refractive index sensing experiment. The inverse technique was applied to create chiral metasurfaces from hBN, using a two-height resonator geometry to achieve up to 50 % transmittance selectivity. This inverse lithography technique paves the way towards high-performances vdW-devices with high-Q resonances, establishing hBN as a cornerstone for next-generation nanophotonic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>High-energy chirped nanosecond pulsed laser system for particle diagnostics and manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An upgraded high-energy nanosecond pulsed laser system tailored for optical particle diagnostics and manipulation capable of pulse energies beyond Joule-level is presented. In addition to the notable output energy increase, the laser system maintains its capability to generate laser pulses with customizable temporal profiles and variable durations ($1$ ns to $1$ $\mu$s) along with a chirping range of several GHz over the pulse duration. The expanded output energy range is anticipated to greatly broaden the laser system's application potential, both for thermodynamic diagnostics via coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering, by substantially lowering the particle density detection thresholds, as well as for particle manipulation, by facilitating more efficient optical trapping potentials for particle acceleration and deceleration.</description>

      <title>Inverse freeform design of a parallel-to-two-target reflector system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an inverse method for transforming a given parallel light emittance to two light distributions at different parallel target planes using two freeform reflectors. The reflectors control both the spatial and directional target coordinates of light rays. To determine the shape and position of the reflectors, we derive generating functions and use Jacobian equations to find the optical mappings to the two targets. The model is solved numerically by a three-stage least-squares algorithm. A feasibility condition is derived, which ensures that the reflectors are not self-intersecting. Several examples validate this condition and demonstrate the algorithm's capability of realizing complex distributions.</description>

      <title>Dual phase transitions in a 1D lattice with PT-symmetric Floquet defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems with non-Hermitian potential or Floquet modulation often result in phase transition related phenomena. In this paper, we study the dual phase transitions in a one-dimensional lattice by introducing a defect containing both Floquet modulation and PT-symmetric potential. In such a configuration, we demonstrate how the gain-loss from PT-symmetry and the control parameters in Floquet modulation adjust the wave dynamic behaviors. When these parameters change, the system will undergo dual phase transitions from an energy-delocalized phase to a localized phase where energy oscillates with time, and then to a PT-symmetry broken phase with energy boost. In particular, we find that the energy oscillations in the second phase is resulted from the beating of two energy oscillations: one is introduced by the PT-symmetric potential and the other is introduced by the Floquet modulation, rather than the field interference of the defect modes. Furthermore, we find that the first phase transition can be non-exist and the second phase transition is affected by the Floquet parameters. Our results reveal the underlying physics of dual phase transitions that occur in simple lattice systems with PT-symmetric Floquet defect, which extends the study of non-Hermitian Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Controlled Floquet Dynamics and Topological Bound States in Continuum via Colored Quantum Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence and control of Floquet states and topological bound states in the continuum (TBICs) in a two-dimensional colored quantum random walk (cQRW) on a square lattice. By introducing three internal degrees of freedom-termed "colors"-and leveraging SU(3) group representations, we realize dispersive TBICs and intrinsic Floquet dynamics without the need for external periodic driving. Through Chern number calculations, we identify three distinct topological bands, revealing color-induced band mixing as a key mechanism underlying the natural formation of Floquet states. The cQRW framework enables precise tuning of quasi-energy spectra, supporting the emergence of localized edge states in topological band gaps and dispersive TBICs embedded within the bulk of other bands. These TBICs exhibit tunable group velocity, controllable excitation across energy regimes, and robustness, providing theoretical validation for their existence in a first-order Floquet system. Our findings position cQRWs as a powerful platform for investigating and harnessing TBICs and Floquet states, with potential applications in quantum information and communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Observation of a generalized Gibbs ensemble in photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Making the unmodulated pyramid wavefront sensor smart II. First on-sky demonstration of extreme adaptive optics with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFSs) are the preferred choice for current and future extreme adaptive optics (XAO) systems. Almost all instruments use the PWFS in its modulated form to mitigate its limited linearity range. However, this modulation comes at the cost of a reduction in sensitivity, a blindness to petal-piston modes, and a limit to the sensor's ability to operate at high speeds. Therefore, there is strong interest to use the PWFS without modulation, which can be enabled with nonlinear reconstructors. Here, we present the first on-sky demonstration of XAO with an unmodulated PWFS using a nonlinear reconstructor based on convolutional neural networks. We discuss the real-time implementation on the Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (MagAO-X) instrument using the optimized TensorRT framework and show that inference is fast enough to run the control loop at &gt;2 kHz frequencies. Our on-sky results demonstrate a successful closed-loop operation using a model calibrated with internal source data that delivers stable and robust correction under varying conditions. Performance analysis reveals that our smart PWFS achieves nearly the same Strehl ratio as the highly optimized modulated PWFS under favorable conditions on bright stars. Notably, we observe an improvement in performance on a fainter star under the influence of strong winds. These findings confirm the feasibility of using the PWFS in its unmodulated form and highlight its potential for next-generation instruments. Future efforts will focus on achieving even higher control loop frequencies (&gt;3 kHz), optimizing the calibration procedures, and testing its performance on fainter stars, where more gain is expected for the unmodulated PWFS compared to its modulated counterpart.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Magnetization Reversal in Ferromagnetic Spin Valves Enabled by Heat Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study laser-induced ultrafast magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic spin valve by comparing the effect of a direct laser excitation and an ultrashort hot-electron pulse. A wedged Cu layer is grown on top of the spin valve in order to tune the energy transmission to the magnetic stack, for both optical and hot-electron pulses. We demonstrate single-pulse magnetization reversal of the free layer by a hot-electron pulse. The influence of laser fluence, Cu thickness ($t_{\mathrm{Cu}}$), and pulse duration is investigated in detail. These results suggest that free layer heating plays a significant role in magnetization reversal. This work contributes to the understanding of ultrafast magnetization reversal due to nonlocal heat and spin transport occurring under strongly out-of-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-Lorentzian model for strong exciton-plasmon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-Lorentzian approach for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the exact LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of Maxwell-Bloch equations which describe LSP in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE coupled to the LSP, we obtain an explicit expression for the system effective optical polarizability which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the classical coupled oscillator (CO) model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from the temporal dispersion of metal dielectric function affect dramatically the optical spectra as the system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight is shifted towards the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</description>

      <title>Conversion of photon temporal shape using single gradient metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By applying phase modulation across different frequencies, metasurfaces possess the ability to manipulate the temporal dimension of photons at the femtosecond scale. However, there remains a fundamental challenge to shape the single wavepacket at the nanosecond scale by using of metasurfaces. Here, we propose that the single photon temporal shape can be converted through the multi-photon wavepacket interference on a single metasurface. By selecting appropriate input single-photon temporal shapes and metasurfaces beam splitting ratio, controllable photon shape conversion can be achieved with high fidelity. For examples, photons with an exponentially decaying profile can be shaped into a Gaussian profile; by tuning the relative time delays of input photons, Gaussian-shaped photons can be transformed into exponentially decaying or rising profiles through the same metasurface. The proposed mechanism provides a compact way for solving the temporal shape mismatch issues in quantum networks, facilitating the realization of high-fidelity on-chip quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Efficient inverse design of large-area metasurfaces for incoherent light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incoherent light is ubiquitous, yet designing optical devices that can handle its random nature is very challenging, since directly averaging over many incoherent incident beams can require a huge number of scattering calculations. We show how to instead solve this problem with a reciprocity technique which leads to three orders of magnitude speedup: one Maxwell solve (using any numerical technique) instead of thousands. This improvement enables us to perform efficient inverse design, large scale optimization of the metasurface for applications such as light collimators and concentrators. We show the impact of the angular distribution of incident light on the resulting performance, and show especially promising designs for the case of "annular" beams distributed only over nonzero angles.</description>

      <title>A gradient atmospheric model reveals enhanced radiative cooling potential and demonstrates the advantages of broadband emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive radiative cooling toward the sky is a developing technology for adaptation in hot climates. Previous calculations of cooling performance have generally used uniform atmospheric models that assume a single sky temperature and atmospheric transmittance spectrum. Here, we introduce a gradient atmospheric model that accounts for altitude-dependent temperature and gas composition, revealing that uniform models underestimate cooling power by 10 - 40%. Using our improved model, we systematically compared broadband emitters (BEs) and wavelength-selective emitters (SEs) for sky-facing radiative cooling at various locations on Earth. We find that the differences in cooling power between the two types of emitters in the sub-ambient temperature range are generally small, even under ideal conditions. Furthermore, in practice, BEs actually have superior performance than realistic SEs, because they have fewer design degrees of freedom and thus can be engineered to have lower solar absorption. Our analysis suggests that large-scale deployment of sky-facing passive radiative cooling technologies should prioritize the development of scalable, low-cost surfaces with minimal solar absorption, rather than focusing on achieving selective thermal emission.</description>

      <title>All-passive upconversion of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 10$^{-7}$ W/cm$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry emergence in a Hermitian system of coupled oscillators without symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12497v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in systems with symmetry is a cornerstone phenomenon accompanying second-order phase transitions. Here, we predict the opposite phenomenon, namely, spontaneous symmetry emergence in a system that lacks symmetry. In the example of two coupled oscillators interacting non-symmetrically with a set of oscillators whose frequencies uniformly fill a finite frequency range, we demonstrate that the system state can acquire symmetry that is not inherent in the system Hamiltonian. The emergence of symmetry is manifested as a change in the system dynamics, which can be interpreted as a phase transition in a Hermitian system that lacks symmetry.</description>

      <title>All-optical autoencoder machine learning framework using linear diffractive processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffractive deep neural network (D2NN), known for its high speed and strong parallelism, has been widely applied across various fields, including pattern recognition, image processing, and image transmission. However, existing network architectures primarily focus on data representation within the original domain, with limited exploration of the latent space, thereby restricting the information mining capabilities and multifunctional integration of D2NNs. Here, we propose an all-optical autoencoder (OAE) framework that linearly encodes the input wavefield into a prior shape distribution in the diffractive latent space (DLS) and decodes the encoded pattern back to the original wavefield. By leveraging the bidirectional multiplexing property of D2NN, the OAE models function as encoders in one direction of wave propagation and as decoders in the opposite direction. We further apply the models to three key areas: image denoising, noise-resistant reconfigurable image classification, and image generation. Proof-of-concept experiments have been conducted to validate numerical simulations. Our OAE framework fully exploits the potential of latent representations, enabling a single set of diffractive processors to simultaneously achieve image reconstruction, representation, and generation. This work not only offers fresh insights into the design of optical generative models but also paves the way for developing multifunctional, highly integrated, and general optical intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Near-field dynamical Casimir effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the dynamical Casimir effect in a time-modulated near-field system at finite temperatures. The system consists of two bodies made of polaritonic materials, that are brought in close proximity to each other, and the modulation frequency is approximately twice the relevant resonance frequencies of the system. We develop a rigorous fluctuational electrodynamics formalism to explore the produced Casimir flux, associated with the degenerate as well as non-degenerate two-polariton emission processes. We have identified flux contributions from both quantum and thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures, with a dominant quantum contribution even at room temperature under the presence of a strong near-field effect. We have found that the Casimir flux can be generated with a smaller modulation frequency through higher-order dynamical Casimir effect. We have conducted a nonclassicality test for the total radiative flux at finite temperatures, and shown that nonclassical states of emitted photons can be obtained for a high temperature up to $\sim 250\,$K. Our findings open an avenue for the exploration of dynamical Casimir effect beyond cryogenic temperatures, and may be useful for creating tunable nanoscale nonclassical thermal states.</description>

      <title>Observation of the acoustic Purcell effect with a color-center and a nanomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiative properties of atoms are inherently linked to their surrounding environment. Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.</description>
