      <title>Construction of approximate invariants for non-integrable Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to construct high-order polynomial approximate invariants (AI) for non-integrable Hamiltonian dynamical systems, and apply it to modern ring-based particle accelerators. Taking advantage of a special property of one-turn transformation maps in the form of a square matrix, AIs can be constructed order-by-order iteratively. Evaluating AI with simulation data, we observe that AI's fluctuation is actually a measure of chaos. Through minimizing the fluctuations with control knobs in accelerators, the stable region of long-term motions could be enlarged.</description>

      <title>Relation between particle beam eigen-emittances and canonical vorticity flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.01218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle beams provided by accelerators occupy a finite volume of the four dimensional transverse phase space. The latter is spanned by the four degrees of freedom, i.e., horizontal/vertical position and momentum. This volume is referred to as emittance. Horizontal and vertical emittances are obtained through projections onto the two transverse sub-phase spaces. Eigen-emittances are obtained from the latter by removing all horizontal-vertical correlations through an appropriate beam optics section. Canonical vorticity flux is used for instance for modelling dynamics of tubes formed by magnetic field lines and particle currents embedded into plasmas. This report is on the relation of eigen-emittances and canonical vorticity flux. Change of beam eigen-emittances is equivalent to change of beam canonical vorticity flux.</description>

      <title>Prototype design of a digital Low-Level RF system for S3FEL S-band Transverse Deflecting Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transverse Deflecting Cavities (TDCs) are generally adopted for electron beam diagnosis. Three sets of S-band and two sets of X-band TDCs are planned at Shenzhen Superconducting Soft X-ray Free Electron Laser (S3FEL) to accurately measure the temporal distribution of ultra-short electron bunches. The microwave system of one TDC consisting of a Low-Level Radio-Frequency system (LLRF), a solid-state amplifier, a klystron, and several waveguide couplers is operated in pulse mode with a maximum repetition rate of 50 Hz. Its microwave stabilities for amplitude and phase are required to be better than 0.05%/0.05{\deg} (RMS). This article will introduce the prototype design of the hardware, firmware, and software of the digital LLRF system for S-band TDCs. We use a homemade local oscillator and commercial cards based on the MicroTCA standard in hardware design. The firmware design will use an IQ demodulation and a reference-tracking algorithm to eliminate the measurement noise and drift. The software design is based on the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS), achieving data acquisition, slow control, and interface display functions. This technical report will also show some preliminary test results.</description>

      <title>Partially Coherent Crystalline Undulator Radiation from a Positron Bunch Modulated via the SASE XFEL Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline undulator (CU), where the positrons of a bunch are channeled planarly, is considered. In contrast to channeling radiation, CU radiation (CUR) occurs due to the average sinusoidal motion of positrons. Taking into account the medium polarization, besides hard photons, soft photons are also generated. In the SASE XFEL process, microbunching occurs with a longitudinal size on the order of the wavelength of the stimulated radiation due to the interaction between positrons and generated photons at zero angle. These microbunches in CU will radiate coherently, and the radiation of the bunch will be partially coherent. Charged particles organized into a microbunch with a well-defined spatial phase distribution can emit coherent (synergistic or collective) radiation when the wavelength of the emitted radiation is comparable to or longer than the longitudinal size of the microbunch. The CU parameters, the spatial period and the amplitude, are selected to preserve both the channeling phenomenon of positrons and the coherence of CUR from positron microbunches. The gain of spontaneous radiation depends on the modulation depth of the microbunch, which is a critical parameter of the bunch and can also be determined through the proposed experiment. A numerical analysis has been conducted for a specific case involving CUR generated by a positron bunch modulated during the SASE XFEL, at a corresponding wavelength of the process.</description>

      <title>Cavity as Radio Telescope for Galactic Dark Photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, as a minimal extension of the Standard Model through an additional Abelian gauge group, may propagate relativistically across the galaxy, originating from dark matter decay or annihilation, thereby contributing to a galactic dark photon background. The generation of dark photons typically favors certain polarization modes, which are dependent on the interactions between dark matter and dark photons. We introduce a framework in which a resonant cavity is utilized to detect and differentiate these polarizations, leveraging the daily variation in expected signals due to the anisotropic distribution of dark photons and the rotation of the Earth. We conduct an experimental search using superconducting radio-frequency cavities, noted for their exceptionally high quality factors, proving them to be effective telescopes for observing galactic dark photons. This approach establishes the most stringent limits yet on the kinetic mixing coefficient between dark photons and electromagnetic photons, thereby unveiling a novel avenue for the indirect search for dark matter via multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Super-Resolution Diffusion for 6D Phase Space Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive physics-informed super-resolution diffusion is developed for non-invasive virtual diagnostics of the 6D phase space density of charged particle beams. An adaptive variational autoencoder (VAE) embeds initial beam condition images and scalar measurements to a low-dimensional latent space from which a 326 pixel 6D tensor representation of the beam's 6D phase space density is generated. Projecting from a 6D tensor generates physically consistent 2D projections. Physics-guided super-resolution diffusion transforms low-resolution images of the 6D density to high resolution 256x256 pixel images. Un-supervised adaptive latent space tuning enables tracking of time-varying beams without knowledge of time-varying initial conditions. The method is demonstrated with experimental data and multi-particle simulations at the HiRES UED. The general approach is applicable to a wide range of complex dynamic systems evolving in high-dimensional phase space. The method is shown to be robust to distribution shift without re-training.</description>
