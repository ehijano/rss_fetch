      <title>Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Ground-roll Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-roll attenuation is a challenging seismic processing task in land seismic survey. The ground-roll coherent noise with low frequency and high amplitude seriously contaminate the valuable reflection events, corrupting the quality of seismic data. The transform-based filtering methods leverage the distinct characteristics of the ground roll and seismic reflections within the transform domain to attenuate the ground-roll noise. However, the ground roll and seismic reflections often share overlaps in the transform domain, making it challenging to remove ground-roll noise without also attenuating useful reflections. We propose to apply a conditional diffusion denoising probabilistic model (c-DDPM) to attenuate the ground-roll noise and recover the reflections efficiently. We prepare the training dataset by using the finite-difference modelling method and the convolution modelling method. After the training process, the c-DDPM can generate the clean data given the seismic data as condition. The ground roll obtained by subtracting the clean data from the seismic data might contain some residual reflection energy. Thus, we further improve the c-DDPM to allow for generating the clean data and ground roll simultaneously. We then demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method by using the synthetic data and the field data. The methods based on the local time-frequency (LTF) transform and U-Net are also applied to these two examples for comparing with our proposed method. The test results show that the proposed method perform better in attenuating the ground-roll noise from the seismic data than the LTF and U-Net methods.</description>

      <title>Number of aftershocks in epidemic-type seismicity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let V(M, m0) be the number of m&gt;M aftershocks caused by m0 event. We consider the V(M, m0) distribution within epidemic-type seismicity models, ETAS(F). These models include the Gutenberg-Richter law for magnitude and Utsu law for average productivity of m0, but differ in the type of F distribution for the number v(m0) of direct aftershocks. The class of F is quite broad and includes both the Poisson distribution, which is the basis for the regular ETAS model, and its possible alternative, the Geometric distribution. Instead of the traditional threshold M=m0-d we consider M=ma-d, where ma is the mode in the distribution of the strongest aftershock. Under these conditions we find the limit V(M, m0) distribution at m0&gt;&gt;1. In the subcritical case, the limit distribution is extremely simple and identical to the v(m) distribution with a suitable magnitude m=m(d). Theoretical results of this kind are lacking even for the regular ETAS model. Our results provide an additional opportunity to test the type of F-distribution, Bath law, and the very concept of epidemic-type clustering.</description>

      <title>Aftershocks as a time independant phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequences of aftershocks following Omori's empirical law are observed after most major earthquakes, as well as in laboratory-scale fault-mimicking experiments. Nevertheless, the origin of this memory effect is still unclear. In this letter, we present an analytical framework for treating labquake and earthquake catalogs on an equal footing. Using this analysis method, we show that when memory is considered to be in deformation and not in time, all data collapse onto a single master curve, showing that the timescale is entirely fixed by the inverse of the strain rate.</description>

      <title>Random interfaces generated by the addition of structures of variable size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the random deposition of objects of variable width and height over a line. The successive additions of these structures create a random interface. We focus on the regime of heavy tailed distributions of the structure width. When the structure center is chosen at random, the problem is exactly solvable and we prove that the interfaces generically tend towards self-affine random curves. The asymptotic behavior reached after a large number of iterations is universal in the sense that it depends on only three parameters: the shape of the added structure at its maximum, the power-law exponent of the width distribution and the exponent that relates height and width. The parameter space displays several transitions that separate different asymptotic behaviors. In particular for a set of parameters, the interface tends towards a fractional Brownian motion. Our results reveal the existence of a new class of random interfaces which properties appear to be robust. The mechanism that generates correlations at large distance is identified and it explains the appearance of such correlations in several situations of interest such as the physics of earthquakes or the propagation of energy through a diffusive medium.</description>

      <title>High-Rate Phase Association with Travel Time Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of regional seismicity from multi-station seismograms relies on the ability to associate arrival phases with their originating earthquakes. Deep-learning-based phase detection now detects small, high-rate arrivals from seismicity clouds, even at negative magnitudes. This new data could give important insight into earthquake dynamics, but it is presents a challenging association task. Existing techniques relying on coarsely approximated, fixed wave speed models fail in this unexplored dense regime where the complexity of unknown wave speed cannot be ignored. We introduce Harpa, a high-rate association framework built on deep generative modeling and neural fields. Harpa incorporates wave physics by using optimal transport to compare arrival sequences. It is thus robust to unknown wave speeds and estimates the wave speed model as a by-product of association. Experiments with realistic, complex synthetic models show that Harpa is the first seismic phase association framework which is accurate in the high-rate regime, paving the way for new avenues in exploratory Earth science and improved understanding of seismicity.</description>
