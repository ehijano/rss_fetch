      <title>Soliton resolution for the coupled complex short pulse equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the long-time asymptotics of the solution to the Cauchy problem of ccSP (coupled complex short pulse) equation on the line for decaying initial data that can support solitons. The ccSP system describes ultra-short pulse propagation in optical fibers, which is a completely integrable system and posses a $4\times4$ matrix Wadati--Konno--Ichikawa type Lax pair. Based on the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of the Deift--Zhou steepest descent method, we obtain the long-time asymptotic approximations of the solution in two kinds of space-time regions under a new scale $(\zeta,t)$. The solution of the ccSP equation decays as a speed of $O(t^{-1})$ in the region $\zeta/t&gt;\varepsilon$ with any $\varepsilon&gt;0$; while in the region $\zeta/t&lt;-\varepsilon$, the solution is depicted by the form of a multi-self-symmetric soliton/composite breather and $t^{-1/2}$ order term arises from self-symmetric soliton/composite breather-radiation interactions as well as an residual error order $O(t^{-1}\ln t)$.</description>

      <title>Novel pathways in $k$-contact geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study of Goursat distributions originates new types of $k$-contact distributions and Lie systems with applications. In particular, families of generators for Goursat distributions on $\mathbb{R}^4, \mathbb{R}^5$ and $\mathbb{R}^6$ give rise to Lie systems and we characterise Goursat structures that are $k$-contact distributions. Our results are used to study the zero-trailer and other systems via Lie systems and $k$-contact manifolds. New ideas for the development of superposition rules via geometric structures and the characterisation of $k$-contact distributions are given and applied. Some relations of $k$-contact geometry with parabolic Cartan geometries are inspected.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix of the XXZ chain in the massless regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free energy per lattice site of a quantum spin chain in the thermodynamic limit is determined by a single `dominant' Eigenvalue of an associated quantum transfer matrix in the infinite Trotter number limit. For integrable quantum spin chains, related with solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, an appropriate choice of the quantum transfer matrix enables to study its spectrum, e.g.\ by means of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. In its turn, the knowledge of the full spectrum allows one to study its universality properties such as the appearance of a conformal spectrum in the low-temperature regime. More generally, accessing the full spectrum is a necessary step for deriving thermal form factor series representations of the correlation functions of local operators for the spin chain under consideration. These are statements that have been established by physicists on a heuristic level and that are calling for a rigorous mathematical justification. In this work we implement certain aspects of this programme with the example of the XXZ quantum spin chain in the antiferromagnetic massless regime and in the low-temperature limit. We rigorously establish the existence, uniqueness and characterise the form of the solutions to the non-linear integral equations that are equivalent to the Bethe Ansatz equations for the quantum transfer matrix of this model. This allows us to describe that part of the quantum transfer matrix spectrum that is related to the Bethe Ansatz and that does not collapse to zero in the infinite Trotter number limit. Within the considered part of the spectrum we rigorously identify the dominant Eigenvalue and show that those correlations lengths that diverge in the low-temperature limit are given, to the leading order, by the spectrum of the free Boson $c=1$ conformal field theory. This rigorously establishes a long-standing conjecture present in the physics literature.</description>
