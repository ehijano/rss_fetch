      <title>Singularities of Weingarten Line Congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among line congruences, the class of W-congruences occupies a significant place. Nevertheless, their singularities has not been extensively studied. In this paper we propose a new characterization of W-congruences that allow us to study their discriminant and umbilical points. We give examples of stable W-umbilical points of type $A_k$, with $k$ small. We also propose some open questions related to the types of stable discriminant and umbilical points of a W-congruence.</description>

      <title>Convex spacelike hypersurface of constant curvature with boundary on a hyperboloid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider convex, spacelike hypersurfaces with boundaries on some hyperboloid (or lightcone) in the Minkowski space. If the hypersurface has constant higher order mean curvature, and the angle between the normal vectors of the hypersurface and the hyperboloid (or the lightcone) is constant on the boundary, then the hypersurface must be a part of another hyperboloid.</description>

      <title>A perspective on totally geodesic submanifolds of the symmetric space $G_2/SO(4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an independent proof of the classification of the maximal totally geodesic submanifolds of the symmetric spaces $G_2$ and $G_2/SO(4)$, jointly with very natural descriptions of all of these submanifolds. The description of the totally geodesic submanifolds of $G_2$ is in terms of (1) principal subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}_2$; (2) stabilizers of nonzero points of $\mathbb{R}^7$; (3) stabilizers of associative subalgebras; (4) the set of order two elements in $G_2$ (and its translations). The space $G_2/SO(4)$ is identified with the set of associative subalgebras of $\mathbb{R}^7$ and its maximal totally geodesic submanifolds can be described as the associative subalgebras adapted to a fixed principal subalgebra, the associative subalgebras orthogonal to a fixed nonzero vector, the associative subalgebras containing a fixed nonzero vector, and the associative subalgebras intersecting both a fixed associative subalgebra and its orthogonal. A second description is included in terms of Grassmannians, the advantage of which is that the associated Lie triple systems are easily described in matrix form.</description>

      <title>Isometric Splitting of Metrics Without Conjugate Points on $\Sigma \times S^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of Riemannian metrics without conjugate points on manifolds which are diffeomorphic to $M = \Sigma \times S^1$, where $\Sigma$ is a compact orientable surface of genus $g \ge 2$.
  This addresses a question related to the generalized Hopf conjecture: whether such metrics must necessarily exhibit a product structure on the universal cover, despite the negatively curved nature of $\Sigma$. We prove that any such metric $g$ forces the universal cover $(\tM, \tg)$ to split isometrically as a Riemannian product $(\Hyp, g_0) \times (\R, c^2 du^2)$, where $(\Hyp, g_0)$ is the hyperbolic plane equipped with a complete $\pi_1(\Sigma)$-invariant metric and $c&gt;0$ is a constant. This affirmatively resolves the question and extends rigidity theorems known for flat tori and manifolds of non-positive curvature. We present two proofs: the main proof relies on the analysis of Busemann functions associated with the lifted $S^1$-action, while an alternative proof utilizes Jacobi field analysis along the flow lines of the corresponding Killing field. Both approaches show that the absence of conjugate points compels the horizontal distribution orthogonal to the Killing field flow to be parallel and integrable, leading to a global isometric splitting via the de Rham theorem. Several geometric and dynamical consequences follow from this rigid structure.</description>

      <title>Conformally weighted Einstein manifolds: the uniqueness problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss smooth metric measure spaces admitting two weighted Einstein representatives of the same weighted conformal class. First, we describe the local geometries of such manifolds in terms of certain Einstein and quasi-Einstein warped products. Secondly, a global classification result is obtained when one of the underlying metrics is complete, showing that either it is a weighted space form, a special Einstein warped product, or a specific family of quasi-Einstein warped products. As a consequence, it must be a weighted sphere in the compact case.</description>

      <title>Conformal product structures on compact Einstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we generalize our previous result, stating that if $(M_1,g_1)$ and $(M_2,g_2)$ are compact Riemannian manifolds, then any Einstein metric on the product $M:=M_1\times M_2$ of the form $g=e^{2f_1}g_1+e^{2f_2}g_2$, with $f_1\in C^\infty(M_2)$ and $f_2\in C^\infty(M_1\times M_2)$, is a warped product metric. Namely, we show that the same conclusion holds if we replace the assumption that the manifold $M$ is globally the product of two compact manifolds by the weaker assumption that $M$ is compact and carries a conformal product structure.</description>

      <title>A Steklov eigenvalue estimate for affine connections and its application to substatic triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choi-Wang obtained a lower bound of the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on closed minimal hypersurfaces. On minimal hypersurfaces with boundary, Fraser-Li established an inequality giving a lower bound of the first Steklov eigenvalue as a counterpart of the Choi-Wang type inequality. These inequalities were shown under lower bounds of the Ricci curvature. In this paper, under non-negative Ricci curvature associated with an affine connection introduced by Wylie-Yeroshkin, we give a generalization of Fraser-Li type inequality. Our results hold not only for weighted manifolds under non-negative $1$-weighted Ricci curvature but also for substatic triples.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the Liouville entropy along the Ricci flow on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using geometric and microlocal methods, we show that the Liouville entropy of the geodesic flow of a closed surface of non-constant negative curvature is strictly increasing along the normalized Ricci flow. This affirmatively answers a question of Manning from 2004. More generally, we obtain an explicit formula for the derivative of the Liouville entropy along arbitrary area-preserving conformal perturbations in this setting. In addition, we show the mean root curvature, a purely geometric quantity which is a lower bound for the Liouville entropy, is also strictly increasing along the normalized Ricci flow.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Approach to Hyperbolic Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic quantum error correction codes (HQECCs) leverage the unique geometric properties of hyperbolic space to enhance the capabilities and performance of quantum error correction. By embedding qubits in hyperbolic lattices, HQECCs achieve higher encoding rates and improved error thresholds compared to conventional Euclidean codes. Building on recent advances in hyperbolic crystallography, we present a systematic framework for constructing HQECCs. As a key component of this framework, we develop a novel algorithm for computing all plaquette cycles and logical operators associated with a given HQECC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we utilize this framework to simulate two HQECCs based respectively on two relevant examples of hyperbolic tilings. In the process, we evaluate key code parameters such as encoding rate, error threshold, and code distance for different sub-lattices. This work establishes a solid foundation for a systematic and comprehensive analysis of HQECCs, paving the way for the practical implementation of HQECCs in the pursuit of robust quantum error correction strategies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we determine all the simply connected non-degenerate CR Lie groups, which are flat with respect to the Cartan connection: in terms of associated Lie algebras, we assert that the only Cartan flat non-degenerate CR Lie algebras are $\mathfrak{su}(2)$, $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$, $\mathfrak{aff}(\mathbb{R}) \oplus \mathbb{R}$, and $\mathfrak{h}_{2m+1}$ with its modifications, where $\mathfrak{aff}(\mathbb{R})$ is the affine Lie algebra of dimension 2 and $\mathfrak{h}_{2m+1}$ is the Heisenberg Lie algebra of dimension $2m+1$. Furthermore, we determine all the (flat and non-flat) non-degenerate CR structures on each of these Lie groups.</description>

      <title>On geometric properties of holomorphic isometries between bounded symmetric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study holomorphic isometries between bounded symmetric domains with respect to the Bergman metrics up to a normalizing constant. In particular, we first consider a holomorphic isometry from the complex unit ball into an irreducible bounded symmetric domain with respect to the Bergman metrics. In this direction, we show that images of (nonempty) affine-linear sections of the complex unit ball must be the intersections of the image of the holomorphic isometry with certain affine-linear subspaces. We also construct a surjective holomorphic submersion from a certain subdomain of the target bounded symmetric domain onto the complex unit ball such that the image of the holomorphic isometry lies inside the subdomain and the holomorphic isometry is a global holomorphic section of the holomorphic submersion. This construction could be generalized to any holomorphic isometry between bounded symmetric domains with respect to the \emph{canonical K\"ahler metrics}. Using some classical results for complex-analytic subvarieties of Stein manifolds, we have obtained further geometric results for images of such holomorphic isometries.</description>
