      <title>YIG Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first demonstration of a nanofabricated photonic crystal made from the magnetic material yttrium iron garnet (YIG). YIG is a compelling material for quantum technologies due to its unique magnetic and optical properties; however, experiments involving YIG have primarily been limited to millimeter-scale spheres. The successful nanofabrication of YIG structures opens new avenues for advancing quantum technology applications. Notably, the ability to co-localize magnons, phonons, and optical photons within a nanostructured environment paves the way for novel approaches in quantum information processing, including quantum wavelength transduction and enhanced magnon-photon interactions. This work marks a significant step toward integrating YIG-based devices into scalable quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sensitivity and Wave-Structure Interaction in Nonsingular Flat-Band Lattices with Compact Localized States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of compact localized modes in one-dimensional flat-band elastic lattices. Flat dispersion arises from destructive interference between neighboring elements, resulting in a zero group velocity across all momenta. This unique condition enables the formation of wave modes that are not only highly localized in space and inherently non-propagative-protected by the flatness of the dispersion relation-but also exceptionally sensitive to structural variations due to enhanced wave-structure interaction. These features are first explored on a simple spring-mass lattice and later applied to a microelectromechanical (MEMS) system of oscillators. By exploring the role of flat-band dispersion in mechanics, this work provides new insights into their fundamental dynamics while opening new opportunities for applications in vibration control and the sensitivity analysis of mechanical structures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fenton-like Photo-degradation and Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) in Fe-doped Copper Oxide (CuO) Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although hydrogen generation by water electrolysis is the cheapest of all other available sources, water splitting still occurs with sluggish kinetics. It is a challenging barrier for H2 production on a large scale. Moreover, research is still underway to understand the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and design the catalysts with improved OER performance. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and OER performance of iron-doped copper oxide (CuO) as low-cost catalysts for water oxidation. The OER occurs at about 1.49 V versus the RHE with a Tafel slope of 69 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH solution. The overpotential of 338 mV at 10 mA/cm2 is among the lowest compared with other copper-based materials. The catalyst can deliver a stable current density of &gt;10 mA/cm2 for more than 10 hours. Additionally, wastewater treatment, particularly synthetic dye wastewater, is vital for preventing water scarcity and adverse effects on human health and ecotoxicology. The as-synthesized catalysts are also utilized for Fenton-like photo-degradation under low-power visible household LED lights toward the most commonly industrially used simulated Methylene blue dye wastewater. Almost complete degradation of the MB dye has been achieved within 50 minutes of visible light irradiation with a first-order rate constant of 0.0973/min. This dual functionality feature can open new pathways as a non-noble, highly efficient, and robust catalyst for OER and wastewater treatments.</description>

      <title>Research on Composite Bit Technology for Hard Formations and Its Application in Igneous Rock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The igneous rocks in deep formation have the characteristics of hardness, poor drillability and high abrasiveness, which is a difficulty in speeding up drilling. The drilling efficiency of existing conventional bits is low in igneous rocks. Based on the characteristics of igneous rocks, rock mechanical parameters and drillability experiments of granite, sandstone and other rocks were carried out. The rock drilling experiments of composite bit, tri-cone bit and PDC bit were carried out. Experiments have shown that in granite with very high strength, the drilling efficiency of conventional cone bit is very low, and it is extremely difficult for PDC bit to penetrate. The impact crushing effect of the cone of the composite bit can make the rock at the bottom of the well produce pits and cracks, which can assist the PDC cutters to penetrate into the formation, and solve the problem of the PDC cutters difficulty in penetrating in hard formations. In softer formations, the rock-breaking advantage of composite bit is not obvious, and the rock-breaking efficiency is lower than that of PDC bit. However, in hard formations, the advantage of composite bit is obvious, with higher drilling efficiency than PDC bit and cone bits. The personalized composite bit developed for deep igneous rocks formations has fast drilling speed, strong sustained drilling ability, long footage, and significant drilling speed-up effect. It significantly reduces the number of runs in deep drilling operations and achieves good application results. The composite bit is suitable for drilling in deep igneous hard-to-drill formations, and it has obvious advantages in deep igneous formations. It is a good choice for drilling speed-up in this kind of hard-to-drill formation.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond laser processing for blast-hole analysis: laser removal of slurry and effect on rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the possibility of using a femtosecond pulse laser to remove iron ore slurry used to stabilise blast-hole structures by mining industries, intending to preserve the wall's stability and the chemical and compositional properties of the underlying rock. In situ minerals are often coated in other material deposits, such as dust or slurry in blast holes. To analyse the rock materials beneath, its surface must be exposed by removal of the surface layer. The ablation depth per pulse and ablation efficiency of the slurry were determined using femtosecond laser pulses. Then, the ablation of rocks of economic interest in Australia, including banded iron, limonite, goethite, shale, and hematite, was studied to establish their ablation thresholds and rates. Any damage induced by the laser was investigated by optical microscopy, optical profilometry, colourimetry, VIS/NIR spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).</description>

      <title>Anderson transition at complex energies in one-dimensional parity-time-symmetric disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of disorder can severely impede wave transport, resulting in the famous Anderson localization. Previous theoretical studies found that Anderson transition can exist in one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian disordered rings with chiral hopping, defying the scaling theory of localization for Hermitian systems. In these systems, localized (extended) modes are associated with real (complex) energies. Here, we report that Anderson localized modes with complex energies can also exist in such systems. The emergence of the complex-energy localized modes (CELMs) directly ties to the properties of the corresponding pristine non-Hermitian system. Specifically, the density of states of the complex spectrum under the periodic boundary condition and the non-Bloch parity-time transition of the open-boundary chain both play critical roles in the emergence of the CELMs. The coexistence of extended modes, real-energy localized modes (RELMs), and CELMs should be a generic phenomenon for 1D non-Hermitian disordered systems under class AI. Our work shows that the interplay between Anderson mechanism and non-Hermitian physics enriches the properties of disordered media and opens new possibilities for controlling wave transport.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Stochastic Signal Manipulation in Superparamagnetic Tunnel Junctions via Voltage-Controlled Exchange Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJs) are emerging as promising components for stochastic units in neuromorphic computing, owing to their tunable random switching behavior. Conventional MTJ control methods, such as spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT), often require substantial power. Here, we introduce the voltage-controlled exchange coupling (VCEC) mechanism, enabling switching between antiparallel and parallel states in sMTJs with an ultralow power consumption of only 40 nW, approximately two orders of magnitude lower than conventional STT-based sMTJs. This mechanism yields a sigmoid-shaped output response, making it ideally suited for neuromorphic computing applications. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of integrating VCEC with the SOT current control, offering an additional dimension for magnetic state manipulation. This work marks the first practical demonstration of VCEC effect in sMTJs, highlighting its potential as a low-power control solution for probabilistic bits in advanced computing systems.</description>

      <title>Energy absorption of sustainable lattice structures under static compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice-like cellular materials, with their unique combination of lightweight, high strength, and good deformability, are promising for engineering applications. This paper investigates the energy-absorbing properties of four truss-lattice structures with two defined volume fractions of material in static compression experiments. The mass-specific energy absorption is derived. The specimens are manufactured by SLA printing of viscoelastic polymeric material. Sustainability implies that the lattice structures can withstand multiple loads and return to their original state after some recovery. Additionally, we present finite element simulations of our experiments and show that these calculations are, in principle, able to predict the different responses of the lattices. Like in the experiments, the truncated octahedron-lattice structure proved to be the most effective for energy absorption under strong compression.</description>

      <title>Energy absorption of sustainable lattice structures under impact loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice structures are increasingly used in various fields of application due to the steady growth of additive manufacturing technology. Depending on the type of lattice, these structures are more or less suitable for energy absorption due to the deformation of diagonal struts. The energy absorption properties depend significantly on the type of the selected lattice structure and its density, material properties, printing process, and post-treatment. Here, five lattice types (Octet, BFCC, Diamond, Truncated Octahedron and Rhombicuboctahedron) with different volume fractions are compared. Stereolithography is used to print the different lattices made from liquid resin. This allows good results to be achieved with tiny structures. In particular, the sustainability of energy-absorbing structures plays a significant role in many processes to withstand multiple loads. The lattice structures are made of TPU resin and offer different energy absorption properties without being destroyed under load. The structures are loaded abruptly using the Split-Hopkinson pressure bar test in a modified setup. From the measured strain pulses, we can calculate how much of the applied energy was absorbed by the different structures</description>

      <title>Critical assessment of contact resistance and mobility in tin perovskite semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports highlight the potential of tin-based perovskite semiconductors for high-performance p-type field-effect transistors (FETs) with mobilities exceeding 20 cm2V-1s-1. However, these high mobilities--often obtained via two-probe (2P) methods on devices with small channel length-to-width ratios (L/W &lt; 0.5) operating in the saturation regime at high drain-source currents--raise concerns about overestimation due to contact resistance and non-ideal FET characteristics. Here, we performed gated four-point probe (4PP) FET measurements on Hall bar devices (L/W = 6) of Cs0.15FA0.85SnI3, obtaining a consistent mobility of 3.3 cm2V-1s-1. Upon comparing these with gated 2P measurements of narrow-channel FETs (L/W = 0.1) on the same chip, we resolved the contact resistance (R_C). The 2P linear mobility is underestimated due to voltage drops across R_C, while the 2P saturation mobility is overestimated because of high (dR_C)/(dV_G) near the threshold. Contact resistance effects become more pronounced at lower temperatures. Contact-corrected four-point-probe (4PP) mobilities are independent of bias conditions and are observed to flatten at temperatures lower than 180 K. Future reports of perovskite FET mobilities should include gated 4PP measurements and use devices with larger L/W ratios to minimize nonidealities arising from contact resistance effects.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Circuit Modeling and Design of a Reconfigurable Loaded Dogbone Metasurface Element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerating trend of active metasurfaces -- such as those incorporating non-Foster matching, programmable control, or space-time modulation -- adds complexity to the computational electromagnetic (CEM) simulation landscape. In this work, we present an equivalent circuit model (ECM) for a particular periodic array element -- the dogbone element -- that incorporates an arbitrary sub-cell electronic circuit. The ECM is capable of predicting the overall surface impedance with any changes in the circuit's impedance. Three full-wave CEM simulations fully determine the EC, and the scattering parameters computed from the ECM for an embedded circuit, however complex, should be substantially similar to those produced by the full-wave code. With metasurfaces for which it is possible to obtain an ECM by this method, the reflection or transmission behavior of the surface under varying circuit conditions can be computed quickly without need of any further full-wave solutions. After highlighting the importance of fully characterizing parasitics in embedded components, we apply the method to the design of a varactor-based tunable metasurface, which upon fabrication and focused beam measurement demonstrates excellent model-measure agreement.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic ellipsometry of CsPbCl${_3}$ perovskite thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing optoelectronic devices based on cesium lead chloride (CsPbCl${_3}$) perovskites requires accurate values of their optical constants. Unfortunately, experimental data for this material is very limited thus far. Therefore, here, we applied spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) to measure the complex optical constants of thermally evaporated CsPbCl${_3}$ thin films with different thicknesses on Si/SiO${_2}$ substrates. The data were corroborated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and absorption spectroscopy. An optical dispersion model was developed to derive the complex optical constants and film thicknesses. The Tauc-Lorentz model, in conjunction with two harmonic oscillators, was used to extract the required parameters. The extinction coefficient spectrum exhibited a sharp absorption edge at 411 nm, consistent with the absorption spectrum. In addition, the optical bandgap of the film was calculated from the absorption spectra and SE data. The experimental values agree well with the simulation results, with values of $\sim$ 2.99 eV for different film thicknesses. This work provides fundamental information for designing and modeling CsPbCl3-based optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional passive metacrystals for enhancing wireless communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent surfaces have emerged as a promising solution to enhance coverage and mitigate signal fading in future wireless communication systems, thereby improving bandwidth and data rates. Passive intelligent surfaces, in particular, demonstrate significant potential for reducing both energy consumption and operational costs. However, their current functionalities are typically constrained to operation within a single polarization, frequency band, and angle of arrival, limiting their applicability in realistic scenarios. In this work, we introduce volumetric dielectric composites, referred to as metacrystals, which are designed through computer optimization to greatly extend the capabilities of intelligent surfaces. Owing to their three-dimensional geometry, which supports a large number of degrees of freedom, metacrystals can simultaneously provide complex multiplexing responses for multiple signals. Each signal can be characterized by distinct parameters, including polarization, angle of incidence, frequency, and/or orbital angular momentum. The proposed metacrystals feature binarized permittivity contrast between low-permittivity materials and air gaps, and can thus be fabricated using filament-based additive manufacturing, supporting frequencies up to 100 GHz. By being cost-effective and scalable, these structures are well-suited for industrial applications, such as integration into building walls, where they can redirect or absorb signals in both indoor and outdoor environments with high versatility at millimeter-wave frequencies and beyond.</description>

      <title>A high-performance all-silicon photodetector enabling telecom-wavelength detection at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are crucial for advancing optical communications, promising substantial gains in data transmission speed, bandwidth, and energy efficiency compared to conventional electronics. Telecom-wavelength photodetectors, operating near 1550 nm, are indispensable in PICs, where they enable the sensitive and low-noise conversion of optical signals to electrical signals for efficient data processing. While silicon is ideal for passive optical components, its limited absorption in the optical telecommunication range (1260-1625 nm) typically necessitates integrating an alternative material, such as germanium, for photodetection - a process that introduces significant fabrication challenges. Here, we present a high-performance, all-silicon photodetector, grating- and waveguide-coupled, which operates at room temperature within the optical telecom C band. By introducing deep-level impurities into silicon at concentrations close to the solid-solubility limit, we enable efficient sub-bandgap absorption without compromising recombination carrier lifetimes and mobilities. This detector achieves a responsivity of 0.56 A/W, a quantum efficiency of 44.8%, a bandwidth of 5.9 GHz, and a noise-equivalent power of 4.2E-10 W/(Hz)1/2 at 1550 nm, fulfilling requirements for telecom applications. Our approach provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for the monolithic integration of telecom-wavelength photodetectors into silicon-based PICs, advancing the development of compact photonic systems for modern communication infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Electronic Light Scattering Drives Optical Heating of Nonlocal Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light absorption in opaque solids is directly governed by optical transitions between the electronic states near the bandgap. This physical mechanism underlies the optical heating of a medium that efficiently absorbs light at resonance. However, such a strategy is true for a homogeneous bulk medium that is temporally dispersive. This work focuses on the optical heating of spatially dispersive (or nonlocal) materials due to broadband inelastic light scattering rather than absorption. A light-induced optical inhomogeneity (vacancy, ad-atom, etc.) produces an optical near-field photon with expanded momentum that enhances light-matter interaction. As a result, indirect optical transitions become accessible throughout the entire Brillouin zone due to electron-photon momentum matching. The real refractive index of nonlocal media can greatly increase over a wide spectral range beyond resonance. According to the Kramers-Kronig relation, such nonlocal media can capture light solely through electronic light scattering. Herein, we experimentally demonstrate this effect by melting spatially confined semiconductors (silicon atomic-force-microscopy cantilever) and metals (gold shear-force-microscopy tip) under off-resonance continuous-wave laser pump. Light scattering based on electron-photon interaction becomes the dominant physical process in media with strong spatial dispersion. These findings will be critical for cutting-edge technologies in optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Phase-locked feed forward stabilization for dual comb spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sustained mutual coherence between two combs over extended periods is a prerequisite for dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS), particularly in achieving high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and precise spectral measurements. However, achieving long coherence times remains a challenge for Yb-doped frequency combs. This work introduces an experimental approach for phase-stable DCS using Yb-doped frequency combs at 1.03 ${\mu}$m with a novel feed-forward method, combatting the limitations of mutual coherence. Without relying on computer-based phase correction, we achieve a coherence time of 1000 seconds - three orders of magnitude longer than the current state of the art for DCS. This extended coherence enables time-domain averaging, resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2045. We demonstrate high-resolution monitoring of weak overtone transitions in the P and R branches of C${_2}$H${_2}$, with good agreement with HITRAN. The phase-locked multiheterodyne system also enables phase spectrum measurements with a scatter down to 7 mrad. Furthermore, we successfully extend our technique to the visible wavelength range using second harmonic generation, achieving high-resolution spectra of NO${_2}$ with excellent SNR. The method offers high-frequency accuracy and demonstrates the potential of Yb-doped systems for multiplexed metrology, effectively extending the capabilities of DCS as a powerful tool for multi-disciplinary applications.</description>

      <title>Large Bidirectional Refractive Index Change in Silicon-rich Nitride via Visible Light Trimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-sensitive integrated photonic devices are highly susceptible to minor manufacturing deviations, resulting in significant performance inconsistencies. This variability has limited the scalability and widespread adoption of these devices. Here, a major advancement is achieved through continuous-wave (CW) visible light (405 nm and 520 nm) trimming of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) silicon-rich nitride (SRN) waveguides. The demonstrated method achieves precise, bidirectional refractive index tuning with a single laser source in CMOS-compatible SRN samples with refractive indices of 2.4 and 2.9 (measured at 1550 nm). By utilizing a cost-effective setup for real-time resonance tracking in micro-ring resonators, the resonant wavelength shifts as fine as 10 pm are attained. Additionally, a record red shift of 49.1 nm and a substantial blue shift of 10.6 nm are demonstrated, corresponding to refractive index changes of approximately 0.11 and -0.02. The blue and red shifts are both conclusively attributed to thermal annealing. These results highlight SRN's exceptional capability for permanent optical tuning, establishing a foundation for stable, precisely controlled performance in phase-sensitive integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional focusing of light using structured diffractive surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unidirectional optical systems enable selective control of light through asymmetric processing of radiation, effectively transmitting light in one direction while blocking unwanted propagation in the opposite direction. Here, we introduce a reciprocal diffractive unidirectional focusing design based on linear and isotropic diffractive layers that are structured. Using deep learning-based optimization, a cascaded set of diffractive layers are spatially engineered at the wavelength scale to focus light efficiently in the forward direction while blocking it in the opposite direction. The forward energy focusing efficiency and the backward energy suppression capabilities of this unidirectional architecture were demonstrated under various illumination angles and wavelengths, illustrating the versatility of our polarization-insensitive design. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these designs are resilient to adversarial attacks that utilize wavefront engineering from outside. Experimental validation using terahertz radiation confirmed the feasibility of this diffractive unidirectional focusing framework. Diffractive unidirectional designs can operate across different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum by scaling the resulting diffractive features proportional to the wavelength of light and will find applications in security, defense, and optical communication, among others.</description>

      <title>Responsivity evaluation of photonics integrated photodetectors via pairwise measurements with an attenuation circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonics platforms offer a compact and scalable solution for developing next-generation optical technologies. For precision applications involving weak signals, the responsivity as well as the accurate calibration of the integrated photodetectors at low optical powers become increasingly important. It remains challenging to perform a calibration traceable to mW-level primary standards without relying on external attenuation setups. Here, we utilize an on-chip attenuation circuit, composed of a series of cascaded directional couplers (DCs), to evaluate the responsivity of integrated photodetectors (PDs) at uW optical power levels with mW inputs to the chip. Moreover, we show that a pairwise measurement method, involving the simultaneous measurement of the integrated PD photocurrent and an auxiliary optical output which is coupled off-chip, systematically improves the experimental uncertainties compared to a direct PD photocurrent measurement. For 3 cascaded DCs, the pairwise measurement improves the repeatability error from 1.21% to 0.22%, with an overall expanded calibration uncertainty (k=2) of 10.13%. The latter is dominated by the scattering noise floor and fiber-to-chip coupling errors, which can be significantly improved with better device fabrication control. Our method can be extended to a fully integrated calibration solution for waveguide-integrated single-photon detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional electromagnetic induction-based current transformers suffer from issues such as bulky and complex structures, slow response times, and low safety levels. Consequently, researchers have explored combining various sensing technologies with optical fibers to develop optical current transformers that could become the primary choice for power systems in the future. With the maturation of optoelectronic technology, optical current transformers have emerged. They offer outstanding advantages, including high sensitivity, integration, stability, and the ability to operate in complex environments. This review categorizes optical current transformers based on different principles, including all-fiber current transformers, those based on magnetostrictive effects, magneto-optic effects, and thermal effects. It also discusses their principles, structures, manufacturing techniques, and signal processing, while forecasting their future development trends.</description>

      <title>Filamentation-Assisted Isolated Attosecond Pulse Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs) generated by few-cycle femtosecond lasers are essential for capturing ultrafast dynamics in atoms, molecules, and solids. Nonetheless, the advancement of attosecond science critically depends on achieving stable, high-temporal-contrast IAPs. Our study reveals a universal scenario in which self-compression of the infrared driver in high harmonic generation in extended gas media leads to high-contrast high-frequency IAP generation. Our experimental and theoretical results reveal that filamentation in a semi-infinite gas cell not only shapes the infrared driving pulse spatially and temporally, but also creates a stable propagation region where high harmonic generation is phase-matched, leading to the production of bright IAPs. In an argon-filled gas cell, filamentation notably reduces the pulse duration of Yb-based 1030 nm pulses from 4.7 fs to 3.5 fs, while simultaneously generating high-contrast 200-attosecond IAPs at 70 eV. We demonstrate the universality of filamentation-assisted IAP generation, showing that post-compressed Yb-based laser filaments in neon and helium yield even shorter IAPs: 69-attoseconds at 100 eV, and 65-attoseconds IAPs at 135 eV, respectively. This spatiotemporal reshaping of few-cycle pulses through filamentation possesses immediate impacts on both post-compression techniques and attosecond-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Order-disorder phase transition of cell membrane induced by THz irradiation studied via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To elucidate the mechanism by which THz radiation non-thermally affects living organisms, the lateral diffusion constants of lipid molecules in the cell membranes of HeLa cells were measured using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching under THz wave irradiation (THz-FRAP) at frequencies of 0.10, 0.29, and 0.48 THz, with power densities ranging from 20 to 89 mW/cm2. The potential heating effects of the THz irradiation were eliminated through temperature calibration using an ultrathin thermocouple, allowing for the investigation of the non-thermal effects of THz radiation. Irradiation at 0.10 and 0.29 THz induced an increase in diffusion constants at temperatures lower than the cell growth temperature. This suggests that THz irradiation induces the order-disorder phase transition of the cell membrane lipids by affecting the dynamics of bound water molecules. Our findings have important implications for the establishment of safety standards for THz radiation and for the potential development of new methods for cell manipulation using THz irradiation in the future</description>

      <title>Oxygen Vacancy-Induced Monoclinic Dead Layers in Ferroelectric $Hf_xZr_{1-x}O_2$ With Metal Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze dead layer comprising non-polar monoclinic (m) phase in $Hf_xZr_{1-x}O_2$ (HZO)-based ferroelectric (FE) material using first principles analysis. We show that with widely used tungsten (W) metal electrode, the spatial distribution of the oxygen vacancy across the cross-section plays a key role in dictating the favorability of m- phase formation at the metal-HfO2 interface. The energetics are also impacted by the polarization direction as well as the depth of oxygen vacancy, i.e., position along the thickness. At the metal - $HfO_2$ interface, when polarization points towards the metal and vacancy forms at trigonally bonded O atomic site, both interfacial relaxation and m- phase formation can lead to dead layers. For vacancies at other oxygen atomic sites and polarization direction, dead layer is formed due to sole interfacial relaxation with polar phase. We also establish the relative favorability of the m-phase dead layer for different Zr concentrations (x=1 and x = 0.5) and metal electrodes. According to our analysis, 50% Zr doped $HfO_2$ exhibits less probability of m-phase dead layer formation compared to pure $HfO_2$. Moreover, with electrodes consisting of noble metal (Pt, Pd, Os, Ru, Rh), m-phase dead layer formation is less likely. Therefore, for these metals, dead layer forms mainly due to the interfacial relaxation with polar phase.</description>

Abstract: Multi-pulse femtosecond laser irradiation of a monolayer of polystyrene microspheres deposited on a polystyrene substrate leads to the formation of carbon nanomaterial exhibiting broadband excitation-dependent luminescence both within the microspheres and in the substrate. Initial polystyrene substrate and microspheres are transparent at the laser wavelength (800 nm). Peak intensity of the laser irradiation focusing by the microspheres reaches 1013 W/cm2, resulting in multiphoton absorption followed by ionization and further carbonization processes. Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy analysis show that carbonization products contain carbon crystalline nanoobjects.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the design, construction and testing of a dual-band monopole microstrip patch antenna to operate in the GSM and DCS bands. For compactness the monopole antenna is mounted on top of a FR4 substrate and is designed as a planar structure which can be wrapped into a box like structure. The performance characteristics of the wrapped dual band monopole antenna are simulated on Ansoft HFSS before fabrication and testing on a Network Analyzer. The simulated HFSS return loss of the antenna shows broad agreement with experiment over the frequency range from 500MHz to 4GHz. Radiation patterns are generated in each band of operation of the antenna. The effect of feedline impedance matching on the performance of the monopole antenna is discussed.</description>

      <title>Polaritons in non-fullerene acceptors for high responsivity angle-independent organic narrowband infrared photodiodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrowband infrared organic photodetectors are in great demand for sensing, imaging, and spectroscopy applications. However, most existing strategies for narrowband detection depend on spectral filtering either through saturable absorption, which requires active layers exceeding 500 nm, restricting the choice of materials for producing high-quality films, or cavity effects, which inherently introduce strong angular dispersion. Microcavity exciton-polariton (polariton) modes, which emerge from strong exciton-photon coupling, have recently been explored as an angular dispersion suppression strategy for organic optoelectronics. In this work, we present the first narrowband infrared polariton organic photodiode that combines angle-independent response with a record-high responsivity of 0.24 A/W at 965 nm and -2 V. This device, featuring a 100-nm-thin active layer comprising a non-fullerene acceptor, exhibits a detection mode with a full-width at half maximum of less than 30 nm and a marginal angular dispersion of under 15 nm across $\pm$$45^\circ$. This study highlights the potential of polaritons as an innovative platform for developing next-generation optoelectronic devices that achieve simultaneous enhancements in optical and electronic performance.</description>

Abstract: In the new perspective of spatial quantization, this article systematically studies the advantages of reconfigurable reflectarray (RRA) designed with closely spaced elements in terms of sidelobe level (SLL), scanning accuracy and scan loss, including theoretical analysis and simulation verification. This article sequentially studies RRAs with element periods of {\lambda}/2, {\lambda}/4 and {\lambda}/8. Both theoretical and simulation results show that under the condition of the same aperture size, with the number of spatial quantization bits increasing, the SLL performance of 1bit RRA using closely spaced structure will have a improvement of about 5dB. The scanning accuracy at 60{\deg} is improved from 54.52{\deg} at {\lambda}/2 to 57.97{\deg} at {\lambda}/8, while the scan loss is improved from 5.02dB at {\lambda}/2 to 2.85dB at {\lambda}/8. This study has an important reference value for reconfigurable reflectarray design, communication system and radar design.</description>

      <title>TriMe++: Multi-threaded triangular meshing in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TriMe++, a multi-threaded software library designed for generating two-dimensional meshes for intricate geometric shapes using the Delaunay triangulation. Multi-threaded parallel computing is implemented throughout the meshing procedure, making it suitable for fast generation of large-scale meshes. Three iterative meshing algorithms are implemented: the DistMesh algorithm, the centroidal Voronoi diagram meshing, and a hybrid of the two. We compare the performance of the three meshing methods in TriMe++, and show that the hybrid method retains the advantages of the other two. The software library achieves significant parallel speedup when generating large-scale meshes containing between $10^4$ to $10^7$ points. TriMe++ can handle complicated geometries and generates adaptive meshes of high quality.</description>

      <title>Precise and Fast LIDAR via Electrical Asynchronous Sampling Based on a Single Femtosecond Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a laser-based ranging method for precise environmental 3D sensing, LiDAR has numerous applications in science and industry. However, conventional LiDAR face challenges in simultaneously achieving high ranging precision and fast measurement rates, which limits their applicability in more precise fields, such as aerospace, smart healthcare and beyond. By employing an asynchronous electrical pulse sampling strategy on a single optical frequency comb with a stable repetition rate and femtosecond-pulse width, we exploit the advantages of optical-frequency-comb ranging method and overcome the limitations of sampling aliasing and low data-utilization inherent in traditional approaches. This enables a significant improvement of LiDAR's performance to achieve micrometer-level precision and megahertz-regimes update rates over meter-range on non-cooperative targets. Specifically, we achieve 38.8-${\mu}$m Allan deviation at 1-MHz update rate and 8.06-${\mu}$m Allan deviation after 2-ms time-averaging based on a 56.091-MHz femtosecond laser. This enhancement enables various advanced measurement applications, including metrology monitoring on high-speed objects, 1-megapixel/s precise 3D scanning imaging and first-ever contactless vital sign detection using time-of-flight LiDAR. This LiDAR unlock new possibilities for precise and fast real-time measurements in diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Micro-Bunching based on Transverse-Longitudinal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, three specific scenarios of a novel accelerator light source mechanism called steady-state micro-bunching (SSMB) have been studied, i.e., longitudinal weak focusing, longitudinal strong focusing and generalized longitudinal strong focusing (GLSF). At present, GLSF is the most promising among them in realizing high-power short-wavelength coherent radiation with a mild requirement on the modulation laser power. Its essence is to exploit the ultrasmall natural vertical emittance of an electron beam in a planar storage ring for efficient microbunching formation, like a partial transverse-longitudinal emittance exchange at the optical laser wavelength range. Based on indepth investigation of related beam physics, a solution of a GLSF SSMB storage ring which can deliver 1 kW-average-power EUV light is presented. The work in this paper, such as the generalized Courant-Snyder formalism, the analysis of theoretical minimum emittances, transverse-longitudinal coupling dynamics, and the derivation of bunching factor and modulation strengths for laser-induced microbunching schemes, is expected to be useful not only for the development of SSMB but also for future accelerator light sources in general that demand increasingly precise electron beam phase space manipulations.</description>

      <title>Two-tone spectroscopy of high-frequency quantum circuits with a Josephson emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform two-tone spectroscopy on quantum circuits, where high-frequency radiation is generated by a voltage-biased superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junction and detection is carried out by an ancillary microwave resonator. We implement this protocol on two different systems, a transmon qubit and a $\lambda/4$ resonator. We demonstrate that this two-tone Josephson spectroscopy operates well into the millimeter-wave band, reaching frequencies larger than 80 GHz, and is well-suited for probing highly coherent quantum systems.</description>
