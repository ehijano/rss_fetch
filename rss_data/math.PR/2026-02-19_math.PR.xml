      <title>Generalized noise sensitivity of eigenvectors: All eigenvectors, inhomogeneous variance profiles, and dependent resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chatterjee (2016) proved, as an application of his general framework relating superconcentration and chaos, that after the entries of an $n \times n$ matrix drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble undergo an entrywise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process for time greater than $n^{-1/3}$, the top eigenvector of the matrix becomes almost completely decorrelated from its initial position. More recently, Bordenave, Lugosi, and Zhivotovskiy (2020) showed that the same happens under a discrete resampling model, once more than $n^{5/3}$ randomly chosen entries of a Wigner random matrix are resampled. We generalize these results in several directions: (1) we analyze the decorrelation of any eigenvector under continuous and discrete resampling dynamics, (2) we analyze the discrete resampling process for generalized Wigner matrices with inhomogeneous variance profiles, (3) we analyze a combination of continuous and discrete resampling where an OU process is repeatedly run for a certain time on randomly chosen entries, and (4) we analyze a dependent version of resampling where entries grouped into "blocks" of arbitrary shapes are resampled together. In each case, we show that a given eigenvector decorrelates provided that enough entries have been resampled or that the associated dynamics have been run for a long enough time. Our proofs take a different approach from prior work, relying more directly on the characterization of eigenvectors as derivatives of eigenvalues and reducing the problem of establishing eigenvector noise sensitivity to variants of standard and robust properties of random matrices such as bounds on eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector delocalization.</description>

      <title>Martin Boundary and the Nonlinear Multiplicative Heat Equation in Weak disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear multiplicative heat equation on Dirichlet spaces with white in time noise under weak disorder. We show that positive invariant random fields with uniformly bounded second moments are in one-to-one correspondence with bounded positive harmonic functions. The proof combines a remote past pullback construction with a uniqueness argument that applies a contraction inspired by chaos expansion. As a consequence, the space of invariant measures inherits geometric structure from the Martin Boundary. We further establish a small-noise Gaussian fluctuation result within each harmonic sector and show that the long-time behavior of solutions is completely determined by the Martin boundary data of the initial condition. These results reveal a direct connection between stochastic PDE dynamics and boundary theory in potential analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a sequence of Markov processes $X^1, X^2,...$ with state space $E$, where $X^N$ has a strong drift to $D \subseteq E$, such that $\Phi(X^N)$ is slow for some appropriate $\Phi: E\to D$. Using the method of martingale problems, we give a limit result, such that $\Phi(X^N) \xRightarrow{N\to\infty} Z$ in the space of c\`adl\`ag paths, and $X^N \xRightarrow{N\to\infty} X$ in measure. \\ We apply the general limit result to models for copy number variation of genetic elements in a diploid Moran model of size $N$. The population by time $t$ is described by $X^N \in \mathcal P(\mathbb N_0)$, where $X^N_k$ is the frequency of individuals with copy number $k$, and $\Phi: \mathcal P(\mathbb</description>

      <title>Linear Landau equation as a limit of a tagged particle in mean field interaction with a free gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a tagged particle in mean field interaction with a free gas of density N at equilibrium. In dimensions $d\geq4$, we prove the convergence of its trajectory, as N goes to infinity, to the one of a diffusion process associated with the linear Landau equation. The proof of the convergence of the martingale problem relies on two key ingredients: long time stability results of the microscopic dynamics, and controls on the probability of particle recollisions.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for random walk in degenerate divergence-free random environment: $\mathcal H_{-1}$ reloaded with relaxed ellipticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper enhances the result of the work [G. Kozma, B. T\'oth, Ann. Probab. vol. 45 (2017) 4307-4347] . We prove the central limit theorem (in probability w.r.t. the environment) for the displacement of a random walker in divergence-free (or, doubly stochastic) random environment, with substantially relaxed ellipticity assumptions. Integrability of the reciprocal of the symmetric part of the jump rates is only assumed (rather than their boundedness, as in previous works on this type of RWRE). Relaxing ellipticity involves substantial changes in the proof, making it conceptually elementary in the sense that it does not rely on Nash's inequality in any disguise.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits for some Mittag-Leffler queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider five models of heavy-tailed queues involving Mittag-Leffler distributions that generalize the classical $M/M/1$ queues. These models are suitable modifications of previously defined models in such a way that the classical $M/M/1$ queue can be recovered by a suitable selection of parameters. We provide the distribution of inter-arrival and service times of both the original and modified queueing models. We then study the scaling limits of all the proposed models and we argue that the behaviour of the limiting processes can be used to characterise the traffic regime of the queues.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration of Random Sums in $\mathbb{Z}_p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the probability distribution of the sum $Y$ of $\ell$ independent identically distributed random variables taking values in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Our main focus is the regime of small values of $\ell$, which is less explored compared to the asymptotic case $\ell \to \infty$.
  Starting with the case $\ell=3$, we prove that if the distributions of the $Y_i$ are uniformly bounded by $\lambda &lt; 1$ and $p &gt; 2/\lambda$, then there exists a constant $C_{3,\lambda} &lt; 1$ such that \[ \max_{x \in \mathbb{Z}_p} \mathbb{P}[Y = x] \leq C_{3,\lambda}\lambda. \] Moreover, when the distributions are uniformly separated from $1$, the constant $C_{3,\lambda}$ can be made explicit. By iterating this argument, we obtain effective anticoncentration bounds for larger values of $\ell$, yielding nontrivial estimates already in small and moderate regimes where asymptotic results do not apply.</description>

      <title>ERGMs on block models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical edge-triangle Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) to an inhomogeneous setting in which vertices carry types determined by an underlying partition. This leads to a block-structured ERGM where interaction parameters depend on vertex types. We establish a large deviation principle for the associated sequence of measures and derive the corresponding variational formula for the limiting free energy. In the ferromagnetic regime, where the parameters governing triangle densities are nonnegative, we reduce the variational problem to a scalar optimization problem, thereby identifying the natural block counterpart of the replica symmetric regime. Under additional restrictions on the parameters, comparable to the classical Dobrushin's uniqueness region, we prove uniqueness of the maximizer and derive a law of large numbers for the edge density.</description>

      <title>A Rough Functional Breuer-Major Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the functional Breuer-Major theorem by Nourdin and Nualart (2020) to the space of rough paths. The proof of tightness combines the multiplication formula for iterated Malliavin divergences, due to Furlan and Gubinelli (2019), with Meyer's inequality and a Kolmogorov-type criterion for the r-variation of cadlag rough paths, due to Chevyrev et al. (2022). Since martingale techniques do not apply, we obtain the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions through a bespoke version of Slutsky's lemma: First, we overcome the lack of hypercontractivity by an iterated integration-by-parts scheme which reduces the remaining analysis to finite Wiener chaos; crucially, this argument relies on Malliavin differentiability of the nonlinearity but not on chaos decay and, as a consequence, encompasses the centred absolute value function. Second, in the spirit of the law of large numbers, we show that the diagonal of the second-order process converges to an explicit symmetric correction term. Finally, we compute all the moments of the remaining process and, through a fine combinatorial analysis, show that they converge to those of the Stratonovich Brownian rough path perturbed by an antisymmetric area correction, as computed by a suitable amendment of Fawcett's theorem. All of these steps benefit from a major combinatorial reduction that is implied by the original argument of Breuer and Major (1983).</description>

      <title>On the distance between mean and geometric median in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12926v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric median, a notion of center for multivariate distributions, has gained recent attention in robust statistics and machine learning. Although conceptually distinct from the mean (i.e., expectation), we demonstrate that both are very close in high dimensions when the dependence between the distribution components is suitably controlled. Concretely, we find an upper bound on the distance that vanishes with the dimension asymptotically, and derive a rate-matching first order expansion of the geometric median components. Simulations illustrate and confirm our results.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-like fixed point and variational properties of integral discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider partition functions Z(g) = exp (-g(x))dx where g is a nonnegative polynomial action (a degree-2n form) vanishing only at the origin. Such integrals, known as integral discriminants, appear in statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, and the theory of exponential families. We show that the associated Boltzmann measure d$\mu$ = exp(-g(x))dx satisfies a fixed-point property identity relating in a simple manner its degree-2n moments to the coefficients of g. This generalizes familiar identities for the exponential distribution (degree-1) on the positive orthant and the Gaussian measure (degree-2). We further show that g is characterized by three variational principles, including a maximum-entropy principle under scaled moments constraints, extending the Gaussian extremality principle to arbitrary even-degree homogeneous actions. Exploiting these identities in a truncatedmoment numerical scheme (known as the Moment-SOS hierarchy), strengthens the standard semidefinite relaxations, and results in a much faster convergence, thus allowing more efficient approximations of the partition function Z(g) as well as moments of $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Partially observed controlled Markov chains and optimal control of the Wonham filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimal control problems, with finite or infinite horizon, for a continuous-time Markov chain with finite state space. In this case, the control process affects the transition rates. We suppose that the controlled process can not be observed, and at any time the control actions are chosen based on the observation of a related stochastic process perturbed by an exogenous Brownian motion. We describe a construction of the controlled Markov chain, having stochastic transition rates adapted to the observation filtration. By a change of probability measure of Girsanov type, we introduce the so-called separated optimal control problem, where the state is the conditional (unnormalized) distribution of the controlled Markov chain and the observation process becomes a driving Brownian motion, and we prove the equivalence with the original control problem. The controlled equations for the separated problem are an instance of the Wonham filtering equations. Next we present an analysis of the separated problem: we characterize the value function as the unique viscosity solution to the dynamic programming equations (both in the parabolic and the elliptic case) we prove verifications theorems and a version of the stochastic maximum principle in the form of a necessary conditions for optimality.</description>

      <title>Regularity and Pathwise bounds for probabilistic solutions of PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build a procedure that allows to establish regularity and controls in time for probabilistic solutions to PDEs. Probabilistic approaches to global wellposedness problems usually provide ensemble bounds on the solutions. These bounds are the main tools to ensure convergence procedures yielding the existence and uniqueness of global solutions. A question of interest consists in transforming such ensemble bounds into individual controls on the flow ; this, among other uses, gives valuable information on the long-time behavior of the solutions. Toward such question of bounds transformation, Bourgain initiated a successful procedure that exploited the local wellposedness of the PDE, with an estimate of the time of size-doubling. In this note, we construct an estimation procedure which relies on a different local requirement. It turns out that this substitute is flexible enough to be possible to fulfill with the help of the ensemble bound itself. For applications of the procedure, we are able to provide new pathwise controls on solutions to NLS equations.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process in the Continuum and Free Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum symmetric simple exclusion process (QSSEP) is a recent extension of the symmetric simple exclusion process, designed to model quantum coherent fluctuating effects in noisy diffusive systems. It models stochastic nearest-neighbor fermionic hopping on a lattice, possibly driven out-of-equilibrium by boundary processes. We present a direct formulation in the continuum, and establish how this formulation captures the scaling limit of the discrete version. In the continuum, QSSEP emerges as a non-commutative process, driven by free increments, conditioned on the algebra of functions on the ambiant space to encode spatial correlations. We actually develop a more general framework dealing with conditioned orbits with free increments which may find applications beyond the present context. We view this construction as a preliminary step toward formulating a quantum extension of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.</description>

      <title>Learning Distributed Equilibria in Linear-Quadratic Stochastic Differential Games: An $\alpha$-Potential Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze independent policy-gradient (PG) learning in $N$-player linear-quadratic (LQ) stochastic differential games. Each player employs a distributed policy that depends only on its own state and updates the policy independently using the gradient of its own objective. We establish global linear convergence of these methods to an equilibrium by showing that the LQ game admits an $\alpha$-potential structure, with $\alpha$ determined by the degree of pairwise interaction asymmetry. For pairwise-symmetric interactions, we construct an affine distributed equilibrium by minimizing the potential function and show that independent PG methods converge globally to this equilibrium, with complexity scaling linearly in the population size and logarithmically in the desired accuracy. For asymmetric interactions, we prove that independent projected PG algorithms converge linearly to an approximate equilibrium, with suboptimality proportional to the degree of asymmetry. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results across both symmetric and asymmetric interaction networks.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quantitative implications of the notion of log-concavity through a probabilistic interpretation. In particular, we derive concentration inequalities, moment and entropy bounds for random variables satisfying a precise degree of log-concavity. Along the way, we recover, improve, and simplify several results existing in the literature. Our approach is based on majorization in the convex order.</description>

      <title>Persistence of AR($1$) sequences with Rademacher innovations and linear mod $1$ transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the probability that an AR(1) Markov chain $X_{n+1}=aX_n+\xi_{n+1}$, where $a\in(0,1)$ is a constant, stays non-negative for a long time. We find the exact asymptotics of this probability and the weak limit of $X_n$ conditioned to stay non-negative, assuming that the i.i.d.\ innovations $\xi_n$ take only two values $\pm1$ and $a \le \frac23$. This limiting distribution is quasi-stationary. It has no atoms and is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure when $\frac12&lt; a \le \frac23$, except for the case $a=\frac23$ and $\mathbb{P}(\xi_n=1)=\frac12$, where this distribution is uniform on the interval $[0,3]$. This is similar to the properties of Bernoulli convolutions. For $0 &lt; a \le \frac12$, the situation is much simpler, and the limiting distribution is a $\delta$-measure.
  To prove these results, we uncover a close connection between $X_n$ killed at exiting $[0, \infty)$ and the classical dynamical system defined by the piecewise linear mapping $x \mapsto \frac1a x + \frac12 \pmod 1$. Namely, the trajectory of this system started at $X_n$ deterministically recovers the values of the killed chain in reversed time. We use this fact to construct a suitable Banach space, where the transition operator of the killed chain has the compactness properties that allow us to apply a conventional argument of the Perron--Frobenius type.</description>

      <title>Higher equations of motion at level 2 in Liouville CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove conjectures of Zamolodchikov and Belavin-Belavin in Liouville conformal field theory (CFT), which are generalisations of the celebrated Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov equations known as the higher equations of motion. Algebraically, these equations give examples of non-zero singular states in Virasoro modules, which is a relatively rare phenomenon in the physical study of CFT. In probability theory, these equations and their variants have been instrumental in the rigorous derivation of the structure constants of Liouville CFT in the unit disc. The proof builds on a previous work of ours studying the analytic continuation of the Poisson operator of Liouville theory. The main novelty is that this operator admits poles on the Kac table, and the higher equations of motions are obtained via a residue computation.</description>

      <title>Rates of Bulk Convergence for Ensembles of Classical Compact Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers random matrices distributed according to Haar measure in different classical compact groups. Utilizing the determinantal point structures of their nontrivial eigenangles, with respect to the $L_1$-Wasserstein distance, we obtain the rate of convergence for different ensembles to the sine point process when the dimension of matrices $N$ is sufficiently large. Specifically, the rate is roughly of order $N^{-2}$ on the unitary group and of order $N^{-1}$ on the orthogonal group and the compact symplectic group.</description>

Abstract: We present an extension of the famous Littlewood-Offord problem when Bernoulli distributions are replaced with discrete log-concave distributions. A variant of the Littlewood-Offord problem for arithmetic progressions, as well as an entropic version, is also discussed.

      <title>Quantitative convergence rates for extended mean field games with volatility control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of symmetric stochastic differential games with interactions via control, where the volatility terms of both idiosyncratic and common noises are controlled. We apply the stochastic maximum principle, following the approach of Lauri\`{e}re and Tangpi, to reduce the convergence analysis to the study of forward-backward propagation of chaos. Under the standard monotonicity conditions, we derive quantitative convergence rates for open-loop Nash equilibria of $N$-player stochastic differential games toward the corresponding mean field equilibrium. As a prerequisite, we also establish the well-posedness of the conditional McKean--Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations by the method of continuation. Moreover, we analyze a specific class of linear-quadratic settings to demonstrate the applicability of our main result.</description>

      <title>A uniformity principle for spatial matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Platforms matching spatially distributed supply to demand face a fundamental design choice: given a fixed total budget of service range, how should it be allocated across supply nodes ex ante, i.e. before supply and demand locations are realized, to maximize fulfilled demand? We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases. Our results provide theoretical guidance for service-range allocation and incentive design in ride-hailing, on-demand labor markets, and drone delivery platforms, highlighting the benefits of reducing disparities in supply-side flexibility.</description>

      <title>Columnar order in random packings of $2\times2$ squares on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random packings of $2\times2$ squares with centers on the square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, in which the probability of a packing is proportional to $\lambda$ to the number of squares. We prove that for large $\lambda$, typical packings exhibit columnar order, in which either the centers of most tiles agree on the parity of their $x$-coordinate or the centers of most tiles agree on the parity of their $y$-coordinate. This manifests in the existence of four extremal and periodic Gibbs measures in which the rotational symmetry of the lattice is broken while the translational symmetry is only broken along a single axis. We further quantify the decay of correlations in these measures, obtaining a slow rate of exponential decay in the direction of preserved translational symmetry and a fast rate in the direction of broken translational symmetry. Lastly, we prove that every periodic Gibbs measure is a mixture of these four measures.
  Additionally, our proof introduces an apparently novel extension of the chessboard estimate, from finite-volume torus measures to all infinite-volume periodic Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Large-sample analysis of cost functionals for inference under the coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coalescent is a foundational model of latent genealogical trees under neutral evolution, but suffers from intractable sampling probabilities. Methods for approximating these sampling probabilities either introduce bias or fail to scale to large sample sizes. We show that a class of cost functionals of the coalescent with recurrent mutation and a finite number of alleles converge to tractable processes in the infinite-sample limit. A particular choice of costs yields insight about importance sampling methods, which are a classical tool for coalescent sampling probability approximation. These insights reveal that the behaviour of coalescent importance sampling algorithms differs markedly from standard sequential importance samplers, with or without resampling. We conduct a simulation study to verify that our asymptotics are accurate for algorithms with finite (and moderate) sample sizes. Our results constitute the first theoretical description of large-sample importance sampling algorithms for the coalescent, provide heuristics for the a priori optimisation of computational effort, and identify settings where resampling is harmful for algorithm performance. We observe strikingly different behaviour for importance sampling methods under the infinite sites model of mutation, which is regarded as a good and more tractable approximation of finite alleles mutation in most respects.</description>

      <title>Availability is all you need: achieving optimal regret with minimal information for dynamic matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a centralized discrete-time dynamic two-way matching model with finitely many agent types. Agents arrive stochastically over time and join their type-dedicated queues waiting to be matched. We focus on availability-based policies that make matching decisions based solely on agent availability across types (i.e., whether queues are empty or not), rather than relying on complete queue-length information (e.g., the longest-queue policy). We aim to achieve constant regret at all times with optimal scaling in terms of the general position gap, $\epsilon$, which measures the distance of the fluid relaxation from degeneracy.
  We classify availability-based policies into global and local policies based on the scope of information they utilize. First, for general networks (possibly cyclic), we propose a global availability-based policy, probabilistic matching, and prove that it achieves the optimal all-time regret scaling of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$, matching the known lower bound established by [KAG24]. Second, for acyclic networks, we focus on the class of local availability-based policies, specifically static priority policies that prioritize matches based on a fixed order. Within this class, we derive the first explicit regret bound for the previously proposed tree priority policy, showing all-time regret scaling of $O(\epsilon^{-(d+1)/2})$, where $d$ is the network depth. Next, we introduce a new truncated tree priority policy and prove that it is the first static priority policy to achieve the optimal all-time regret scaling of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. These policies are appealing for matching systems such as queueing and load balancing; they reduce operational costs by using minimal information while effectively balancing the trade-off between immediate and future rewards.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we contribute to the study of the dynamics induced by the conjugation action on the space of subgroups of Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(m,n), via the mixing properties of elements asymptotically produced by suitable random walks on the group. In an acylindrically hyperbolic context, the authors of [HMO] demonstrated strong mixing situations, namely topological mu-mixing, a strengthening of high topological transitivity. Regarding non-metabelian and non-unimodular BS(m,n), we exhibit here a radically different situation on each of the pieces except one of the partition introduced in [CGLMS22] (although it is highly topologically transitive on each piece). On the other hand, when BS(m,n) is unimodular, we demonstrate the topological mu-mixing character on each of the pieces.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional learning dynamics of multi-pass Stochastic Gradient Descent in multi-index models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the learning dynamics of a multi-pass, mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure for empirical risk minimization in high-dimensional multi-index models with isotropic random data. In an asymptotic regime where the sample size $n$ and data dimension $d$ increase proportionally, for any sub-linear batch size $\kappa \asymp n^\alpha$ where $\alpha \in [0,1)$, and for a commensurate ``critical'' scaling of the learning rate, we provide an asymptotically exact characterization of the coordinate-wise dynamics of SGD. This characterization takes the form of a system of dynamical mean-field equations, driven by a scalar Poisson jump process that represents the asymptotic limit of SGD sampling noise. We develop an analogous characterization of the Stochastic Modified Equation (SME) which provides a Gaussian diffusion approximation to SGD.
  Our analyses imply that the limiting dynamics for SGD are the same for any batch size scaling $\alpha \in [0,1)$, and that under a commensurate scaling of the learning rate, dynamics of SGD, SME, and gradient flow are mutually distinct, with those of SGD and SME coinciding in the special case of a linear model. We recover a known dynamical mean-field characterization of gradient flow in a limit of small learning rate, and of one-pass/online SGD in a limit of increasing sample size $n/d \to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that under convergence in measure of probability density functions, differential entropy converges whenever the entropy integrands $f_n |\log f_n|$ are uniformly integrable and tight -- a direct consequence of Vitali's convergence theorem. We give an entropy-weighted Orlicz condition: $\sup_n \int f_n\, \Psi(|\log f_n|) &lt; \infty$ for a single superlinear~$\Psi$, strictly weaker than the fixed-$\alpha$ condition of Godavarti and Hero (2004). We also disprove the Godavarti-Hero conjecture that $\alpha &gt; 1$ could be replaced by $\alpha_n \downarrow 1$. We recover the sufficient conditions of Godavarti--Hero, Piera--Parada, and Ghourchian-Gohari-Amini as corollaries. On bounded domains, we prove that uniform integrability of the entropy integrands is both necessary and sufficient -- a complete characterization of entropy convergence.</description>
