      <title>Benchmarking field-level cosmological inference from galaxy redshift surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-level inference has emerged as a promising framework to fully harness the cosmological information encoded in next-generation galaxy surveys. It involves performing Bayesian inference to jointly estimate the cosmological parameters and the initial conditions of the cosmic field, directly from the observed galaxy density field. Yet, the scalability and efficiency of sampling algorithms for field-level inference of large-scale surveys remain unclear. To address this, we introduce a standardized benchmark using a fast and differentiable simulator for the galaxy density field based on \texttt{JaxPM}. We evaluate a range of sampling methods, including standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) without and within a Gibbs scheme, and both adjusted and unadjusted microcanonical samplers (MAMS and MCLMC). These methods are compared based on their efficiency, in particular the number of model evaluations required per effective posterior sample. Our findings emphasize the importance of carefully preconditioning latent variables and demonstrate the significant advantage of (unadjusted) MCLMC for scaling to $\geq 10^6$-dimensional problems. We find that MCLMC outperforms adjusted samplers by over an order-of-magnitude, with a mild scaling with the dimension of our inference problem. This benchmark, along with the associated publicly available code, is intended to serve as a basis for the evaluation of future field-level sampling strategies. The code is readily open-sourced at https://github.com/hsimonfroy/benchmark-field-level</description>

      <title>A forest of gravitational waves in our Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the Galactic Centre, we can expect a population of a few tens of early extreme-mass ratio inspirals (E-EMRIs) and extremely large mass ratio inspirals (XMRIs). Depending on their evolutionary stage, they can be highly eccentric, with moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of tens or hundreds, or nearly circular, with SNRs as large as a few thousand. Their individual signals combine into a common signal, which can complicate the resolution of other types of sources. We have calculated the foreground signal of continuous E-EMRIs and XMRIs using a catalog based on the expected number of sources and a realistic phase-space distribution. The forest of E-EMRIs will cover a large portion of the LISA sensitivity curve, obscuring the signals of some massive black hole binaries, verification binaries, and harmonics of EMRIs in their polychromatic phase. The combined signal from XMRIs will be much weaker but still affect intermediate-mass black hole binaries. Due to the large SNR, this forest can be also found in other galactic nuclei, such as that of the Andromeda galaxy. Even under conservative assumptions, the forest created by E-EMRIs and XMRIs in our Galactic Centre will likely pose a challenge for resolving other types of sources, as their contribution is non-coherent and exhibits large SNRs.</description>

      <title>The differences of baryonic and dark matter scaling relations in galaxy clusters between IllustrisTNG simulations and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the self-similar baryonic mass fraction scaling relations between galaxy clusters from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey and the IllustrisTNG state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Using samples of 218 (TNG100) and 1605 (TNG300) friends-of-friends (FoF) haloes within $0.0 \leq z \leq 1.5$ and $M_{200c} \geq 7 \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, we fit the scaling relations using Simple Power Law (SPL), Broken Power Law (BPL), and General Double Power Law (GDPL) models through non-linear least squares regression. The SPL model reveals null slopes for the baryonic fraction as a function of redshift, consistent with self-similarity. Observations and simulations agree within $1{-}2\sigma$, suggesting comparable baryonic scaling slopes. We identify $\sim$13.8$-$14.1 per cent of baryons as "missing", primarily in the form of intracluster light (ICL) across all halo masses and warm gas in low-mass haloes. High-mass haloes ($\log_{10}(M_{500c}/M_{\odot}) \geq 14$) adhere to self-similarity, while low-mass haloes exhibit deviations, with the breakpoint occurring at $\log_{10}(M_{500c}/M_{\odot}) \sim 14$, where baryons are redistributed to the outskirts. Our findings suggest that the undetected warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) and baryon redistribution by feedback mechanisms are complementary solutions to the "missing baryon" problem.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Evolution of CIV Absorbers at $1.4&lt;z&lt;4.5$: Insights from $100,000$ Systems in DESI Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest catalog to \modify{date} of triply ionized carbon (CIV) absorbers detected in quasar spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Using an automated matched-kernel convolution method with adaptive signal-to-noise thresholds, we identify $101,487$ CIV systems in the redshift range $ 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 4.8 $ from $300,637$ quasar spectra. Completeness is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations and catalog is $50\%$ complete at $\mathrm{EW}_{\mathrm{CIV}} \geq 0.4$ Angstrom. The differential equivalent width frequency distribution declines exponentially and shows weak redshift evolution. The absorber incidence per unit comoving path increases by a factor of $2-5$ from $ z \approx 4.5 $ to $ z \approx 1.4 $, with stronger redshift evolution for strong systems. Using column densities derived from the apparent optical depth method, we constrain the cosmic mass density of CIV, $\Omega_{\mathrm{CIV}}$, which increases by a factor of $\sim 3.6$ from $ (0.46 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{-8} $ at $ z \approx 4.5 $ to $ (1.65 \pm 0.04) \times 10^{-8} $ at $ z \approx 1.4 $. From $ \Omega_{\rm CIV} $, we estimate a lower limit on intergalactic medium metallicity $ \log(Z_{\rm IGM}/Z_{\odot}) \gtrsim -3.5 $ at $ z \sim 2.3 $, with a smooth decline at higher redshifts. These trends trace the cosmic star formation history and HeII photoheating rate, suggesting a link between CIV enrichment, star formation, and UV background over $\sim 3$ Gyr. The catalog also provides a critical resource for future studies connecting circumgalactic metals to galaxy evolution, especially near cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Positive neutrino masses with DESI DR2 via matter conversion to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is a massively parallel spectroscopic survey on the Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak, which has released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations determined from over 14 million extragalactic targets. We combine DESI Data Release 2 with CMB datasets to search for evidence of matter conversion to dark energy (DE), focusing on a scenario mediated by stellar collapse to cosmologically-coupled black holes (CCBH). In this physical model, which has the same number of free parameters as $\Lambda$CDM, DE production is determined by the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), allowing for distinct early- and late-time cosmologies. Using two SFRDs to bracket current observations, we find that the CCBH model: accurately recovers the cosmological expansion history, agrees with early-time baryon abundance measured by BBN, reduces tension with the local distance ladder, and relaxes constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$. For these SFRDs, we find a peaked positive $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.149\,\rm eV$ (95\% confidence) and $\sum m_\nu = 0.106^{+0.050}_{-0.069}\,\rm eV$ respectively, in good agreement with lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments. A peak in $\sum m_\nu &gt; 0$ results from late-time baryon consumption in the CCBH scenario and is expected to be a general feature of any model that converts sufficient matter to dark energy during and after reionization.</description>

      <title>Tomographic Alcock-Paczynski Test with Marked Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tomographic Alcock-Paczynski (AP) method, developed over the past decade, exploits redshift evolution for cosmological determination, aiming to mitigate contamination from redshift distortions and capture nonlinear scale information. Marked Correlation Functions (MCFs) extend information beyond the two-point correlation. For the first time, this study integrated the tomographic AP test with MCFs to constrain the flat $w$CDM cosmology model. Our findings show that multiple density weights in MCFs outperform the traditional two-point correlation function, reducing the uncertainties of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and dark energy equation of state $w$ by 48\% and 45\%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a novel principal component analysis (PCA) compression scheme that efficiently projects high-dimensional statistical measurements into a compact set of eigenmodes while preserving most of the cosmological information. This approach retains significantly more information than traditional coarse binning methods, which simply average adjacent bins in a lossy manner. Applying PCA compression also enables the effective use of marked correlation functions in 2D $(s,\mu)$ space, yielding an additional $\sim 50\%$ reduction in error margins. To assess robustness, we incorporate realistic redshift errors expected in future spectroscopic surveys. While these errors modestly degrade cosmological constraints, our combined framework, which utiizes MCFs and PCA compression within tomographic AP tests, is less affected and always yield to tight cosmological constraints. This scheme remains highly promising for upcoming slitless spectroscopic surveys, such as the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST).</description>

      <title>Challenging $\Lambda$CDM: 5$\sigma$ Evidence for a Dynamical Dark Energy Late-Time Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been considerable debate regarding potential evidence for the dynamical nature of dark energy (DE), particularly in light of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements released by DESI survey. In this work, we propose an agnostic test that simultaneously constrains the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) and probes the possibility of a transition between the quintessence and phantom regimes, or vice versa. Our initial approach is independent of physical priors, allowing the data to determine which behavior best fits the parameters. We then consider a minimally modified gravity theory known as VCDM, into which we can map our initial approximation, placing it within a theoretically stable framework. To this end, we incorporate the most up-to-date datasets available, including BAO measurements from DESI-DR2, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3 samples, as well as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis reveals strong and statistically significant evidence for a quintessence-phantom transition across various data combinations. \textit{The strongest evidence is found for Planck+DESI+DESY5, with a significance exceeding $\sim$5$\sigma$ in favor of a quintessence-phantom transition at $z_{\dag} = 0.493^{+0.063}_{-0.081}$}. Beyond this redshift, the EoS remains within the phantom regime, while for $z &lt; z_{\dag}$, it favors the quintessence regime. Despite this strong indication, \textit{we find that such transitions do not resolve the $H_0$ tension}.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2: Cross-correlations with luminous red galaxies from eBOSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We cross-correlated galaxies from the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) second data release (DR2) radio source with the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample to extract the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal and constrain the linear clustering bias of radio sources in LoTSS DR2.
  In the LoTSS DR2 catalogue, employing a flux density limit of $1.5$ mJy at the central LoTSS frequency of 144 MHz and a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of $7.5$, additionally considering eBOSS LRGs with redshifts between 0.6 and 1, we measured both the angular LoTSS-eBOSS cross-power spectrum and the angular eBOSS auto-power spectrum. These measurements were performed across various eBOSS redshift tomographic bins with a width of $\Delta z=0.06$. By marginalising over the broadband shape of the angular power spectra, we searched for a BAO signal in cross-correlation with radio galaxies, and determine the linear clustering bias of LoTSS radio sources for a constant-bias and an evolving-bias model. Using the cross-correlation, we measured the isotropic BAO dilation parameter as $\alpha=1.01\pm 0.11$ at $z_{\rm eff}=0.63$. By combining four redshift slices at $z_{\rm eff}=0.63, 0.69, 0.75$, and $0.81$, we determined a more constrained value of $\alpha = 0.968^{+0.060}_{-0.095}$. For the entire redshift range of $z_{\rm eff}=0.715$, we measured $b_C = 2.64 \pm 0.20$ for the constant-bias model, $b(z)=b_C$, and then $b_D = 1.80 \pm 0.13$ for the evolving-bias model, $b(z) = b_D / D(z)$, with $D(z)$ denoting the growth rate of linear structures. Additionally, we measured the clustering bias for individual redshift bins.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2: Counts-in-Cells Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical distribution of source counts-in-cells in the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2) and we test a computationally cheap method based on the counts-in-cells to estimate the two-point correlation function. We compare three stochastic models for the counts-in-cells which result in a Poisson distribution, a compound Poisson distribution, and a negative binomial distribution. By analysing the variance of counts-in-cells for various cell sizes, we fit the reduced normalised variance to a single power-law model representing the angular two-point correlation function. Our analysis confirms that radio sources are not Poisson distributed, which is most likely due to multiple physical components of radio sources. Employing instead a Cox process, we show that there is strong evidence in favour of the negative binomial distribution above a flux density threshold of 2 mJy. Additionally, the mean number of radio components derived from the negative binomial distribution is in good agreement with corresponding estimates based on the value-added catalogue of LoTSS-DR2. The scaling of the counts-in-cells normalised variance with cell size is in good agreement with a power-law model for the angular two-point correlation. At a flux density threshold of 2 mJy and a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.5 for individual radio sources, we find that for a range of angular scales large enough to not be affected by the multi-component nature of radio sources, the value of the exponent of the power law ranges from -0.8 to -1.05. This closely aligns with findings from previous optical, infrared, and radio surveys of the large scale structure. The scaling of the counts-in-cells statistics with cell size provides a computationally efficient method to estimate the two-point correlation properties, offering a valuable tool for future large-scale structure studies.</description>

      <title>Refined Predictions for Starobinsky Inflation and Post-inflationary Constraints in Light of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), combined with Planck and DESI data, suggest a higher value for the spectral index $n_s$. This places Starobinsky inflation at the edge of the $2\sigma$ constraints for a number of e-folds $N_\star$ around $60$ when using the usual analytical approximations. We present refined predictions for Starobinsky inflation that go beyond the commonly used analytical approximations. By evaluating the model with these improved expressions, we show that for $N_\star \gtrsim 60$ it remains consistent with current observational constraints at the $2\sigma$ level. Additionally, we examine the implications of the ACT results for post-inflationary reheating parameters. Specifically, we find a lower bound on the effective equation of state parameter during reheating of approximately $\omega \gtrsim 0.462$; this excludes purely perturbative reheating, which leads to $\omega \simeq 0$. We also show that the reheating temperature is constrained to be $T_{\text{rh}} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{12}~\text{GeV}$, assuming $\omega \leq 1$. Furthermore, we find that the predictions for the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can lie within $1\sigma$ of the recent ACT constraints if the reheating temperature satisfies $4~\text{MeV} \lesssim T_{\text{rh}} \lesssim 10~\text{GeV}$ for $0.8 \lesssim \omega \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing CMB noise anisotropies from CMB delensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Un-doing the effect of gravitational lensing on the Cosmic Microwave Background ('de-lensing') is essential in shaping constraints on weak signals limited by lensing effects on the CMB, for example on a background of primordial gravitational waves. Removing these anisotropies induced by large-scale structures from the CMB maps also generally helps our view of the primordial Universe, by sharpening the acoustic peaks and the damping tail. However, delensing does transfer parts of these anisotropies to the noise maps. This will induce a new large scale 'mean-field' bias to any anisotropy estimator applied to the delensed CMB, and this bias directly traces large-scale structures. This paper analytically quantifies this delensed noise mean-field and its impact on quadratic (QE) and likelihood-based lensing estimators. We show that for Simons-Observatory-like surveys, this mean-field bias can reach 15% in cross-correlation with large-scale structures if unaccounted for. We further demonstrate that this delensed noise mean-field can be safely neglected in likelihood-based estimators without compromising the quality of lensing reconstruction or $B$-mode delensing, provided the resulting lensing map is properly renormalized.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from Quaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the large-scale angular clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalog, Quaia, and their cross-correlation with maps of the lensing convergence of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), to constrain the level of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Specifically, we target the scale-dependent bias that would be induced by PNG on biased tracers of the matter inhomogeneities on large scales. The Quaia sample is particularly well suited for this analysis, given the large effective volume covered, and our ability to map out the main potential sources of systematic contamination and mitigate their impact. Using the universality relation to characterise the response of the quasar overdensity to PNG ($p_\phi=1$), we report constraints on the local-type PNG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ of $f_{\rm NL}=-20.5^{+19.0}_{-18.1}$ (68\% C.L.) by combining the quasar auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with CMB lensing in two tomographic redshift bins (or $f_{\rm NL}=-28.7^{+26.1}_{-24.6}$ if assuming a lower response for quasars, $p_\phi=1.6$). Using the CMB lensing cross-correlations alone, we find $f_{\rm NL}=-13.8^{+26.7}_{-25.0}$. These are the tightest constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$ to date from angular clustering statistics and cross-correlations with CMB lensing.</description>

      <title>Cosmic superstrings in large volume compactifications: PTAs, LISA and time-varying tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) from cosmic superstrings offers one of the few known possibilities to test String Theory within current experimental reach. However, in order to be compatible with the existing constraints, the tension of a cosmic superstring network is required to lie several orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. This is naturally realized in string compactifications where the volume of the extra dimensions is parametrically large (in string units). We estimate the GW spectrum arising from cosmic superstrings in such scenarios, providing analytical formulae as well as numerical results. Crucially, we do so within a fully-fledged string cosmology, taking into account various modified cosmological epochs (such as kination or early matter domination) induced by the presence of moduli and a time-dependent string tension. We show that part of the spectrum generically lies within reach of LISA and ET, with a large class of models predicting a characteristic drop in the amplitude which may be robustly probed by LISA. The corresponding signal would encode information on the dynamics of moduli and reheating. On the other hand, the ultra-high frequency part of the spectrum can be significantly enhanced by a long, early phase of kination with time-varying tension, yielding a spectral index unique to this set-up.</description>

      <title>Wandering intermediate-mass black holes in Milky Way-mass galaxies in cosmological simulations: myth or reality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15404v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the following question: ``can we use the current cosmological simulations to identify intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and quantify a putative population of wandering IMBHs?''. We compare wandering-IMBH counts in different simulations with different sub-grid methods and post-processing recipes, the ultimate goal being to aid future wandering-IMBH detection efforts. In particular, we examine simulations in which IMBHs are identified as BH seeds forming at high redshift and those in which they are identified using star clusters as proxies, which implicitly appeals to a stellar dynamical formation channel. In addition, we employ the extremely high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical ``zoom-in'' simulation GigaEris with the star cluster proxies method to identify IMBHs. We find consistent counts of wandering high-redshift IMBHs across most of the different cosmological simulations employed so far in the literature, despite the different identification approaches, resulting in 5 to 18 wandering IMBHs per Milky Way-sized galaxy at $z \geq 3$. Nevertheless, we argue this is only coincidental, as a significant discrepancy arises when examining the formation sites and the mass ranges of the wandering IMBHs. Furthermore, we cannot determine how many of the IMBHs identified at high redshift in GigaEris will be wandering IMBHs at $z = 0$ as opposed to how many will accrete to the central supermassive BH, promoting its growth. All of this casts doubts on the ability of current cosmological simulations to inform observational searches for wandering IMBHs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the fate of primordial discs in Milky Way-sized galaxies with the GigaEris simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations with JWST and ALMA have unveiled galaxies with regular discs at significantly higher redshifts than previously expected. This appears to be in contrast with constraints on the stellar populations of the Milky Way, suggesting that the bulk of the Galactic thin disc formed after $z=1$, and raises questions about the history, evolution, and survivability of primordial discs. Here, we use GigaEris, a state-of-the-art $N$-body, hydrodynamical, cosmological ``zoom-in'' simulation with a billion particles within the virial radius, to delve into the formation of the early kinematically cold discs (KCDs), defined by their ratio between the mean rotational velocity and the radial velocity dispersion, of a Milky Way-sized galaxy at redshifts $z\gtrsim 4$. Our analysis reveals a primarily inward migration pattern for disc stars formed at $z \gtrsim 6$, turning into a mix of inward and outward migration at later times. Stars migrating outwards undergo minimal kinematic heating, and might be identified as part of the thin disc forming at much later epochs. We find that approximately 76 per cent of all stars formed in the KCD at $z \sim 7$ become part of a pseudo-bulge by $z = 4.4$. This proportion decreases to below 10 per cent for KCD stars formed at $z \lesssim 5$. The inward migration of stars born in our KCDs at $z \gtrsim 4$ deviates from the expected inside-out formation scenario of thin discs at lower redshifts. Our results suggest a novel ``two-phase'' disc formation process, whereby the early disc transforms primarily into the pseudo-bulge within less than a billion years, whereas the present-day disc forms subsequently from higher-angular momentum material accreted at later times.</description>

      <title>Interaction of domain walls with scalar particles in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of solitons (such as closed domain walls) in the super-Early Universe is predicted in a number of theories of the formation of primordial black holes. However, the interaction of particles of the surrounding medium with the solitons should affect their dynamics. In the paper, we consider the interaction between domain walls and scalar particles which can play a role of dark matter. It is shown that when the temperature of the scalar particle gas, caused by the expansion of the Universe, decreases below a certain threshold value, the wall abruptly becomes opaque and locks particles inside itself. We discuss the dynamics of a single domain wall taking into account pressure of scalar particles locked inside a closed wall. It is shown, this effect leads to a time delay of domain wall collapse and the deferred formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Expanding Ejecta Method: I. Mapping Supernova Morphology with Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of optical intensity interferometry to extract angularly resolved information from supernova explosions, introducing the "expanding ejecta method" (EEM) as a robust alternative to the classical expanding photosphere method (EPM). Foreseeing future improvements to intensity interferometers of large light collection area ($25\pi\,\rm{m}^2$ per telescope) equipped with spectral multiplexing ($10^4$ spectral resolution) and fast photodetectors ($10\,\mathrm{ps}$ timing resolution, $50\%$ overall efficiency), we demonstrate that high signal-to-noise measurements of the visibility modulus are achievable for Type IIP (Type Ia) supernovae out to $3~(12)\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. By focusing on generic line emission and absorption in ballistic ejecta, the EEM can relax assumptions about spherical symmetry, blackbody radiation, and extinction. The EEM enables angular diameter distances to be determined with $\sim2\%$ precision for supernovae of apparent magnitude $m = 12$ from a 60-hour observation by an intensity interferometer with those same instrumental specifications. We argue that the EEM is significantly more robust to modeling uncertainties and systematic effects than (variants of) the EPM. In a companion paper, we show how the EEM can be used to provide geometric anchors for cosmic distance ladder calibration, or to construct a wholly independent Hubble diagram based on angular diameter distances.</description>

      <title>Induced Gravitational Waves as Cosmic Tracers of Leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that induced gravitational waves (IGWs) can naturally emerge within the framework of thermal leptogenesis models, thereby providing a robust probe for exploring this theory at remarkably high energy scales. To illustrate this principle, we put forth a basic leptogenesis model in which an early matter-dominated phase, tracing the leptogenesis scale, enhances the generation of gravitational waves induced by an early structure formation. Leveraging recent N-body and lattice simulation results for IGW computations in the non-linear regime, we show that it is possible to establish a direct link between the frequency and amplitude of these IGWs and the thermal leptogenesis scale.</description>

      <title>How black hole mimickers and Shapiro-free lenses signal effective dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of two exotic compact objects in the leading relativistic model of modified Newtonian dynamics, namely aether-scalar-tensor theory. This model is consistent with precision cosmology and gravitational wave constraints on tensor speed. Black hole mimickers could subtly change observations: gravitational waves from their mergers might show unusual echoes or altered ringdown patterns, and images of their horizon-scale shadows might be slightly different from those of a true black hole. Shapiro-free lenses are massless objects that deflect light without any gravitational time delay, producing distinctive lensing events. These predictions connect to ongoing and future gravitational-wave searches, horizon-scale imaging, and time-domain lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Growth of a Black Hole in a Scalar Field Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical relativity study of the accretion properties of a non-spinning black hole in a cosmology driven by a scalar field. The simulations are carried out with a modified moving-puncture gauge condition suitable for cosmological space-times. We considered a scalar field with potential $ V=\lambda \,\varphi^4/4$ and derived the black hole mass growth formula for this scenario using the dynamical horizon framework. As with perturbative studies, we find that the accretion rate $\dot M \propto M^2$ with $M$ the mass of the black hole, and that $\dot M \propto \dot\varphi^2$. We verify that the results of the simulations satisfy the mass growth formula. Unexpectedly, the dynamics of the scalar field in the neighborhood of the black hole is not significantly different from the behavior of the field far away from the hole. We found situations in which the black hole can growth $\sim 15\%$ of its initial mass before the scalar field reaches the bottom of its potential.</description>

      <title>F-Term Hybrid Inflation, Metastable Cosmic Strings and Low Reheating in View of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the formation of metastable cosmic strings in a left-right unified theory. The produced monopoles are diluted by a stage of F-term hybrid inflation (FHI) which is realized consistently with the SUSY breaking and a global $U(1)$ $R$ symmetry in the context of a $U(1)_{\rm R}\times U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of MSSM. The hidden-sector Kaehler manifold enjoys an enhanced $SU(1,1)/U(1)$ symmetry with the scalar curvature determined by the achievement of a SUSY-breaking de Sitter vacuum without ugly tuning. FHI turns out to be compatible with data -- including the recent ACT results --, provided that the magnitude of the emergent soft tadpole term is confined in the range $(0.1-70)$ TeV, and it is accompanied with the production of cosmic strings. Their dimensionless tension $G\mu_{\rm cs}\simeq(1-11)\cdot10^{-8}$ interprets the present observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves. The $\mu$ parameter of MSSM arises by appropriately adapting the Giudice-Masiero mechanism and facilitates the out-of-equilibrium decay of the $R$ saxion at a reheat temperature lower than about $34$ GeV. The SUSY mass scale turns out to lie in the PeV region.</description>

      <title>Merger-Driven Turbulence and Coherent Transport in the Intracluster Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of metals and temperature in the intracluster medium (ICM) provides key insights into galaxy cluster evolution, revealing information about chemical enrichment and heating and cooling processes, respectively. To access this information, it is crucial to understand the transport processes in the ICM. Here, we systematically study the transport mechanisms in the ICM with tracer particle resimulations of the Omega500 cosmological hydrosimulation, using a sample of four galaxy clusters of comparable masses but different mass assembly histories. Through the analysis of particle pair dispersion statistics, we find a time-dependent scaling index linked to the cluster's dynamical state. It reaches or exceeds Richardson scaling briefly during major mergers but remains much lower in relaxed clusters. We identify a coherent transport mode during major mergers that causes directional flow in the ICM. Although coherent transport can move particles to outer regions, the particles transported to the cluster outskirts compose only a small fraction of the density there; thus the anisotropy it creates in the overall density distribution is limited. Moreover, strong turbulence generated by mergers quickly disperses these particles, further limiting this effect. We also provide useful statistics on the radial evolution of the ICM and the fraction of particles that ever reached the inner regions as a function of radius. Our results show that major mergers primarily drive particle transport, linking ICM transport to merger-driven dynamics, and highlighting the interplay between coherent and turbulent transport.</description>

      <title>Static black hole horizons in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite previous results that rule out the possibility of a static black hole horizon in cosmology we present a black hole metric that has a static horizon whilst mimicking the cosmological behavior at large scales away from the black hole horizon. By a suitable choice of coordinates, we show that it is possible to have a static black hole horizon in cosmology that does not suffer from issues like singularities in curvature invariants at the horizon. The resulting metric is consistent with the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric for constant Hubble parameter. It should be noted that this metric does not lead to isotropic pressure, i.e. $p_\perp\neq p_r$ for radial distances comparable to Schwarzschild radius, but for large $r$ the stress tensor (assuming general relativity) tends to the cosmological value. Turning to a more realistic framework, we study the cases of black hole$+$cosmological matter and black hole$+$matter$+$cosmological constant where we assume the pressure component takes its cosmological value and show that although the resulting metric does not have a static horizon, the physical radius of the apparent horizon can tend to a constant value for large cosmological time. This metric does not suffer from issues like a singular horizon for asymptotically vanishing Hubble parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal warm inflation scenario proposed in Ref. [1] -- featuring an axion-like inflaton coupled to Standard Model (SM) gluons via the standard interaction $\phi G \tilde G$ -- offers a compelling bridge between inflationary dynamics and SM particle content. While the model retains only the inflaton as a beyond-SM field, its original analysis relied on some approximate treatments of warm inflation's (WI) dynamics. Here, we revisit this scenario using WI2easy, a precision computational tool for WI dynamics [2], to rigorously evaluate the model's viability and full range of model's parameters compatible with the observational parameters. Overall, we find that the results of Ref. [1] hold, but with significant differences in the weak and strong dissipative regimes of WI.</description>

      <title>Seeding Supermassive Black Holes with Self-Interacting Dark Matter: A Unified Scenario with Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.15132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations show that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with a mass of $\sim10^9 M_\odot$ exist when the Universe is just $6\%$ of its current age. We propose a scenario where a self-interacting dark matter halo experiences gravothermal instability and its central region collapses into a seed black hole. The presence of baryons in protogalaxies could significantly accelerate the gravothermal evolution of the halo and shorten collapse timescales. The central halo could dissipate its angular momentum remnant via viscosity induced by the self-interactions. The host halo must be on high tails of density fluctuations, implying that high-$z$ SMBHs are expected to be rare in this scenario. We further derive conditions for triggering general relativistic instability of the collapsed region. Our results indicate that self-interacting dark matter can provide a unified explanation for diverse dark matter distributions in galaxies today and the origin of SMBHs at redshifts $z\sim6-7$.</description>

      <title>Recovering CMB polarization maps with neural networks: Performance in realistic simulations</title>

Abstract: Recovering the polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) is crucial for shading light on the exponential growth of the very early Universe called Cosmic Inflation. For achieving this task, not only improving the instrument sensitivities but also mathematical methods with different natures should be developed. In this work we aim to use a neural network previously and accurately tested with Planck realistic temperature simulations called the CMB extraction neural network (CENN), and train it for recovering both Q and U maps. After mixing them into $E$ and $B$ modes, we found a mean absolute error of about $0.1\pm0.3 \hspace{1pt}\mu K^{2}$ for both, and residuals of $10^{-1} \hspace{1pt} \mu K^{2}$ up to $l \sim 1000$, after smoothing the maps with a 15' FWHM. In an ideal case (without instrumental noise) we recover the signal with a similar error but lower residuals in the output maps. We also found that residuals decrease when smoothing the maps with larger FWHM, although we loss the smaller scales. Based on these results, we conclude that neural networks could be worth using as component separation methods for polarization data, especially for future CMB experiments with higher sensitivity than Planck.</description>

      <title>Exact treatment of weak dark matter-baryon scattering for linear-cosmology observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic scattering of dark matter (DM) particles with baryons induce cosmological signals that may be detectable with modern or future telescopes. For DM-baryon scattering cross sections scaling with negative powers of relative velocity, $\sigma_{\chi b}(v) \propto v^{-2}, v^{-4}$, such interactions introduce a momentum-exchange rate that is nonlinear in DM-baryon bulk relative velocities, thus not amenable for inclusion as-is into standard linear cosmological Boltzmann codes. Linear ansatzes have been adopted in past works, but their accuracy is unknown as they do not arise from first-principles derivations. In this work, for the first time, we construct a rigorous framework for computing linear-cosmology observables as a perturbative expansion in $\sigma_{\chi b}$. We argue that this approach is accurate for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) angular power spectra when most or all of the DM is scattering with baryons with cross section $\sigma_{\chi b}(v) \propto v^{-2}, v^{-4}$. We derive exact formal expressions for CMB power spectra at linear order in $\sigma_{\chi b}$, and show that they only depend on a specific velocity integral of the momentum-exchange rate. Consequently, we can obtain the exact power spectra at linear order in $\sigma_{\chi b}$ by substituting the original nonlinear momentum-exchange rate with a uniquely specified linear rate. Serendipitously, we find that the exact substitution we derive from first principles precisely coincides with the most widely used linear ansatz, thus placing previous CMB-anisotropy upper bounds on a more solid footing. In addition to finally providing an exact cosmological solution to the DM-baryon scattering problem in a well-defined region of parameter space, the framework we construct opens the way to computing higher-order correlation functions, beyond power spectra, which are promising yet unexplored probes of DM-baryon scattering.</description>

      <title>Fast, Accurate and Perturbative Forward Modeling of Galaxy Clustering Part I: Galaxies in the Restframe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forward models of the galaxy density field enable simulation based inference as well as field level inference of galaxy clustering. However, these analysis techniques require forward models that are both computationally fast and robust to modeling uncertainties in the relation between galaxies and matter. Both requirements can be addressed with the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure. Here, we focus on the physical and numerical convergence of the LEFTfield model. Based on the perturbative nature of the forward model, we derive an analytic understanding of the leading numerical errors, and we compare our estimates to high-resolution and N-body references. This allows us to derive a set of best-practice recommendations for the numerical accuracy parameters, which are completely specified by the desired order of the perturbative solution and the cut-off scale. We verify these recommendations by an extended set of parameter recovery tests from fully nonlinear mock data and find very consistent results. A single evaluation of the forward model takes seconds, making cosmological analyses of galaxy clustering data based on forward models computationally feasible.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the missing mass of galaxy clusters in MOND: the view from gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) has long been known to fail in galaxy clusters, implying a residual missing mass problem for clusters in this context. Here, using mass profiles derived from strong- and weak-lensing shear, as well as magnification data, for a sample of clusters from the CLASH survey, we characterize the density profile of this residual MOND missing mass in the central Mpc of galaxy clusters. In line with results obtained in the literature from the hydrostatic equilibrium of hot gas, we find that an inner constant density core and an outer power-law slope sharper than $-3.5$ provides a good description within $\sim 1$~Mpc. We also show that the data in the central parts of clusters can be even better represented by a `dark mass-follows-gas' profile with an exponential cut-off. Clusters in the sample display a remarkable uniformity for the missing-to-hot-gas density ratio in the inner parts, of order $\sim$10, as well as for the exponential cut-off radius, of order $\sim 400$~kpc. These lensing results can in principle serve as a crucible for relativistic theories of MOND in galaxy clusters, or for any other tentative hypothesis regarding the nature of the clusters residual missing mass in the MOND context.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO project: Baryon effects on the matter power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of baryon physics associated with galaxy formation onto the large-scale matter distribution of the Universe is a key uncertainty in the theoretical modelling required for the interpretation of Stage IV surveys. We use the FLAMINGO simulations to study the baryon response due to galaxy formation of the total matter power spectrum. We find that it is only well converged for simulation volumes in excess of $200^3$ Mpc$^3$. We report results for simulations of varying feedback intensity, which either match the X-ray inferred gas fractions in clusters and the $z=0$ stellar mass function, or shifted versions of the data, as well as for different implementations of AGN feedback. We package our results in the form of a Gaussian process emulator which can rapidly reproduce all the simulations' predictions to better than one per cent up to the comoving wavenumber $k = 10~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and up to $z=3$ for all the feedback models present in the FLAMINGO suite. We find that the response becomes stronger, the range of scales affected increases, and the position of the minimum of the response moves to smaller scales as the redshift decreases. We find that lower gas fractions in groups and clusters lead to a stronger response and that the use of collimated jets instead of thermally driven winds for AGN feedback enhances the effect. Lowering the stellar masses at fixed cluster gas fractions also increases the magnitude of the response. We find only a small (1% at $k&lt;10~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$) dependence of our results on the background cosmology, but a wider range of cosmology variations will be needed to confirm this result. The response we obtain for our strongest feedback models is compatible with some of the recent analyses combining weak lensing with external data. Such a response is, however, in strong tension with the X-ray inferred gas fractions in clusters used to calibrate the FLAMINGO model.</description>

      <title>Combining strongly lensed and unlensed fast radio bursts: To be a more precise late-universe probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Soliton-Halo Relation in Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soliton cores at the center of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos provide a promising way to distinguish FDM from other dark matter models. However, the relation between solitons and their host halos remains contentious. Here, we rigorously examine this soliton-halo relation (SHR) using a rich set of cosmological simulations across various FDM particle masses, halo masses, and redshifts. We explicitly demonstrate thermal equilibrium between solitons and surrounding halo granules, energy equipartition within halos, and an FDM concentration-mass-nonisothermality relation. For each FDM halo, we confirm that its density profile outside the central soliton matches a collisionless N-body simulation from the same initial condition, serving as stringent numerical convergence tests. Our refined SHR agrees well with virialized halos in simulations, with a $1\sigma$ deviation of less than $30\%$. These findings not only reaffirm the SHR proposed by Schive et al. (2014) but also offer a more comprehensive understanding that extends its applicability. The simulation code GAMER is accessible at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer. A Python script for computing the theoretical SHR is available at https://github.com/calab-ntu/fdm-soliton-halo-relation.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytic modelling of Pop. III star formation and metallicity evolution -- II. Impact on 21cm power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating Population (Pop.) III star formation in mini-halos in a large cosmological simulation is an extremely challenging task but it is crucial to estimate its impact on the 21cm power spectrum. In this work, we develop a framework within the semi-analytical code meraxes to estimate the radiative backgrounds from Pop. III stars needed for the computation of the 21cm signal. We computed the 21cm global signal and power spectrum for different Pop. III models varying star formation efficiency, initial mass function (IMF) and specific X-ray luminosity per unit of star formation (LX/SFR). In all the models considered, we find Pop. III stars have little to no impact on the reionization history but significantly affect the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) due to the strong injection of X-ray photons from their remnants that heat the neutral IGM at $z \geq$ 15. This is reflected not only on the 21cm sky-averaged global signal during the Cosmic Dawn but also on the 21cm power spectrum at $z \leq$ 10 where models with strong Pop. III X-ray emission have larger power than models with no or mild Pop. III X-ray emission. We estimate observational uncertainties on the power spectrum using 21cmsense and find that models where Pop. III stars have a stronger X-ray emission than Pop. II are distinguishable from models with no or mild Pop. III X-ray emission with 1000 hours observations of the upcoming SKA1-low.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent cosmological surveys have provided unprecedented datasets that can be used to reconstruct the history of the dark energy equation of state. In this work, a free-form "flexknot'' parameterisation is employed to represent $w(a)$ as a linear spline between free-moving nodes, the number of which may vary. By combining DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements with Pantheon+ or DES5Y supernovae, the functional posteriors of $w(a)$ reveal an unexpected W-shaped structure. While the Bayesian evidence may still favour $\Lambda$CDM, the robustness of these results suggests the structure is indeed present in the data. The tension $R$-statistic and suspiciousness have been marginalised over models, and demonstrate that while the reconstructions from DESI and Pantheon+ agree, DESI and DES5Y do not. We conclude that, while there is no smoking gun for dynamical dark energy, the structure unearthed in this work is generally too complex to be captured by the restrictive $w$CDM or CPL parameterisations.</description>

      <title>Comparison of dynamical dark energy with {\Lambda}CDM in light of DESI DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state, $w(a)$, using the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data in combination with Pantheon+ and DES5Y Type Ia supernovae measurements, respectively. Building on our previous analysis in arXiv:2503.08658, which employed a nonparametric flexknot reconstruction approach, we examine whether the evidence for dynamical dark energy persists with the improved precision of the DESI DR2 dataset. We find that while the overall qualitative structure of $w(a)$ remains consistent with our earlier findings, the statistical support for dynamical dark energy is reduced when considering DESI DR2 data alone, particularly for more complex flexknot models with higher numbers of knots. However, the evidence for simpler dynamical models, such as $w$CDM and CPL (which correspond to $n=1$ and $n=2$ knots respectively), increases relative to $\Lambda$CDM with DESI DR2 alone, with CPL being the preferred dynamical model, consistent with previous DESI analyses. When combined with Pantheon+ data, the conclusions remain broadly consistent with our earlier work, but when instead combined with DES5Y supernovae data, there is an increased preference for flexknot models for all values of $n$ considered. This results in all such models being preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, with the CPL model being the most favoured by a Bayes factor of $\sim 2.3$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in Extended Parameter Space with DESI DR2 BAO: A 2$\sigma$+ Detection of Non-zero Neutrino Masses with an Update on Dynamical Dark Energy and Lensing Anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain constraints in a 12 parameter cosmological model using the recent DESI Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data, combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra (Planck Public Release (PR) 4) and lensing (Planck PR4 + Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release (DR) 6) data, uncalibrated type Ia Supernovae (SNe) data from Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL: DES Year 1) data. The cosmological model consists of six $\Lambda$CDM parameters, and additionally, the dynamical dark energy parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the effective number of non-photon radiation species ($N_{\textrm{eff}}$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\textrm{lens}}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). Our major findings are the following: i) With CMB+BAO+DESY5+WL, we obtain the first 2$\sigma$+ detection of a non-zero $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.19^{+0.15}_{-0.18}$ eV (95%). Replacing DESY5 with Pantheon+ still yields a $\sim$1.9$\sigma$ detection. ii) The cosmological constant lies at the edge of the 95% contour with CMB+BAO+Pantheon+, but is excluded at 2$\sigma$+ with DESY5, leaving evidence for dynamical dark energy inconclusive, contrary to claims by DESI collaboration. iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, $A_{\textrm{lens}} = 1$ is excluded at $&gt;2\sigma$, while it remains consistent with unity without WL data - suggesting for the first time that the existence of lensing anomaly may depend on non-CMB datasets. iv) The Hubble tension persists at 3.6-4.2$\sigma$ with CMB+BAO+SNe; WL data has minimal impact.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight (or fuzzy) dark matter (ULDM) is an alternative to cold dark matter. A key feature of ULDM is the presence of solitonic cores at the centers of collapsed halos. These would potentially increase the drag experienced by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, changing their merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave background. We perform detailed simulations of high-mass SMBH binaries in the soliton of a massive halo. We find more rapid decay than previous simulations and semi-analytic approximations. We confirm expectations that the drag depends strongly on the ULDM particle mass, finding masses greater than $10^{-21}$ eV could potentially alleviate the final parsec problem and that ULDM may even suppress gravitational wave production at lower frequencies in the pulsar timing band.</description>

      <title>FLIMFLAM DR1: The First Constraints on the Cosmic Baryon Distribution from 8 FRB sightlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measure of fast radio bursts (FRBs), arising from the interactions of the pulses with free electrons along the propagation path, constitutes a unique probe of the cosmic baryon distribution. Their constraining power is further enhanced in combination with observations of the foreground large-scale structure and intervening galaxies. In this work, we present the first constraints on the partition of the cosmic baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM), inferred from the FLIMFLAM spectroscopic survey. In its first data release, the FLIMFLAM survey targeted galaxies in the foreground of 8 localized FRBs. Using Bayesian techniques, we reconstruct the underlying ~Mpc-scale matter density field that is traced by the IGM gas. Simultaneously, deeper spectroscopy of intervening foreground galaxies (at impact parameters $b_\perp \lesssim r_{200}$) and the FRB host galaxies constrains the contribution from the CGM. Applying Bayesian parameter inference to our data and assuming a fiducial set of priors, we infer the IGM cosmic baryon fraction to be $f_{\rm igm}=0.59^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$, and a CGM gas fraction of $f_{\rm gas} = 0.55^{+0.26}_{-0.29}$ for $10^{10}\,M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm halo}\lesssim 10^{13}\,M_\odot$ halos. The mean FRB host dispersion measure (rest-frame) in our sample is $\langle \rm{DM_{host}}\rangle = 90^{+29}_{-19}\rm{pc~cm^{-3}}$, of which $\langle{\rm DM_{host}^{unk}}\rangle =69^{+28}_{-19}~\rm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ arises from the host galaxy ISM and/or the FRB progenitor environment. While our current $f_{\rm igm}$ and $f_{\rm gas}$ uncertainties are too broad to constrain most galactic feedback models, this result marks the first measurement of the IGM and CGM baryon fractions, as well as the first systematic separation of the FRB host dispersion measure into two components: arising from the halo and from the inner ISM/FRB engine.</description>

      <title>In Situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter Using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photon dark matter (DPDM) emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits derived from early-universe observations.</description>

      <title>Phasing out of Darkness: From Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter to Neutrino Masses via Time-Dependent Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are a compelling candidate for generating neutrino masses and for elucidating the nature of dark matter. Astrophysical X-ray constraints on sterile neutrino dark matter decays, however, largely exclude the active-sterile mixing required to produce simultaneously the correct left-handed neutrino spectrum and keV-scale right-handed neutrino dark matter within a type-I seesaw framework. In this study, we demonstrate how these X-ray constraints can be circumvented through a time-dependent approach, thereby reviving a broad range of active-sterile mixing scenarios. Our minimal model incorporates two right-handed neutrinos, which form a two-component dark matter candidate, and an auxiliary scalar field that experiences a very late and still ongoing phase transition, leading to the spontaneous breaking of a global $ U(1)_N $ symmetry. Prior to this phase transition, only the right-handed neutrinos are massive, while the left-handed neutrinos remain massless because of the scalar field's vanishing expectation value. As the phase transition develops, the growing expectation value of the scalar field increases the active-sterile mixing, thereby opening dark matter decay channels and inducing neutrino masses. The time dependence allows the scenario to be consistent with X-ray constraints as well as current measurements of left-handed neutrino masses. The anticipated level of active-sterile mixing today is within the detection capabilities of the forthcoming TRISTAN (KATRIN) tritium-beta decay project. Additionally, cosmological surveys such as DESI or EUCLID and supernova neutrino observations can test the prediction of massless left-handed neutrinos prior to the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves Induced by Scalar Perturbations with a Broken Power-law Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an analytical approximation for the energy spectrum of the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by a broken power-law power spectrum, and find that both the asymptotic power-law tails and the intermediate peak contribute distinct features to the SIGW spectrum. Moreover, the broken power-law power spectrum has abundant near-peak features and our results can be used as a near-peak approximation that covers a wide range of models. Our analytical approximation is useful in the rapid generation of the SIGW energy spectrum, which is beneficial for gravitational wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Scalar kicks and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A scalar field coupled conformally and disformally to matter affects both the linear memory effect for binary systems on hyperbolic orbits, as well as the kick velocity for binaries on bound or unbound orbits. We study these corrections in detail, their order of magnitude, and discuss their detectability. In particular, we find that the disformal interaction does not contribute to the memory effect and the emitted power spectrum at zero frequency. The conformal interaction corrects the GR linear memory and the quadrupole emitted power at zero frequency resulting in a breaking of the GR memory-power spectrum relationship. On the other hand, disformal interactions give rise to a change of momentum for the centre of mass. Hence, measuring both the linear memory effect and the kicks for hyperbolic orbits would give access to the conformal and disformal couplings of nearly massless scalars to matter.</description>

      <title>C-parity, magnetic monopoles and higher frequency gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to the left-right symmetric model $SU(3)_c \times SU(3)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ with C-parity also unbroken [$C$ converts $Q\to -Q$, where $Q$ is the electric charge operator in $SO(10)$.] This breaking produces the topologically stable GUT monopole as well as a GUT scale C-string. The subsequent breaking at an intermediate scale of C-parity produces domain walls bounded by C-strings, found by Kibble, Lazarides and Shafi. A limited number of inflationary $e$-foldings experienced during these breakings can yield an observable number density of primordial GUT monopoles. The C-strings also experience this inflationary phase, and the subsequent string-wall network decays through the emission of gravitational waves. We estimate the gravitational wave spectrum from these composite structures over a range of values of the domain wall tension $\sigma$. Depending on $\sigma$ the spectrum displays a peak in the higher frequency range between $10^2$ to $10^5$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Latest developments in wide-field VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) combines the signals of telescopes distributed across thousands of kilometres to provide some of the highest angular resolution images of astrophysical phenomena. Due to computational expense, typical VLBI observations are restricted to a single target and a small (few arcseconds) field-of-view per pointing. The technique of wide-field VLBI was born to enable the targeting of multiple sources and has been successful in providing new insights into Active Galactic Nuclei, the interstellar medium, supernovae, gravitational lenses and much more. However, this technique is still only employed in a few experiments, restricting the scientific potential of VLBI observations. In this conference proceeding, we outline new developments in wide-field VLBI, including an end-to-end correlation and calibration workflow, distributed correlation, and new calibration routines. These developments aim to enable wide-field VLBI to be a standard observing mode on all major VLBI arrays.</description>
