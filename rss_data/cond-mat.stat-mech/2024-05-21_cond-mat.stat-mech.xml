      <title>Pathway to Fractional Integrals, Fractional Differential Equations and the Role of H-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pathway model for the real scalar variable case is re-explored and its connections to fractional integrals, solutions of fractional differential equations, Tsallis statistics and superstatistics in statistical mechanics, reaction-rate probability integral, Kraetzel transform, and pathway transform are explored. It is shown that the common thread in these connections is the H-function representations. The pathway parameter is shown to be connected to the fractional order in fractional integrals and fractional differential equations.</description>

      <title>Path-Integral Formulation of Truncated Wigner Approximation for Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) enables us to calculate bosonic quantum many-body dynamics while accounting for the effects of quantum fluctuations. In this work, we formulate the TWA for bosonic Markovian open quantum systems described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation from the coherent-state path-integral approach using the Wigner function. We derive an analytical expression for the GKSL equation in the TWA where we consider a bosonic system with an arbitrary Hamiltonian with jump operators that do not couple different states. We numerically confirm that the time evolution of physical quantities and the non-equal time correlation functions obtained in our formulation agree well with the exact ones in the numerically solvable models.</description>

      <title>Nucleation and growth manifest universal scaling, surely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a system is brought to a metastable state, nuclei of the equilibrium phase form and grow. This is the well-known nucleation and growth of first-order phase transitions. Near a critical point of a continuous phase transition, critical phenomena such as critical opalescence characterized by universal scaling emerge. These two sets of behavior are so completely different that it might appear absurd to ask whether nucleation and growth exhibit even a slight universal scaling. Here we show that universal scaling is indeed manifested in standard nucleation and growth by introducing a non-universal initial time to a recently proposed method. This generalizes the method and provides a different perspective for studying universal scaling behavior and hence universality classes of nucleation and growth.</description>

      <title>Boundary homogenization for partially reactive patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes involve diffusive particles interacting with surfaces containing reactive patches. The theory of boundary homogenization seeks to encapsulate the effective reactivity of such a patchy surface by a single trapping rate parameter. In this paper, we derive the trapping rate for partially reactive patches occupying a small fraction of a surface. We use matched asymptotic analysis, double perturbation expansions, and homogenization theory to derive formulas for the trapping rate in terms of the far-field behavior of solutions to certain partial differential equations (PDEs). We then develop kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithms to rapidly compute these far-field behaviors. These KMC algorithms depend on probabilistic representations of PDE solutions, including using the theory of Brownian local time. We confirm our results by comparing to KMC simulations of the full stochastic system. We further compare our results to prior heuristic approximations.</description>

      <title>Memory corrections to Markovian Langevin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of non-Markovian systems and memory induced phenomena poses an everlasting challenge for physics. As a paradigmatic example we consider a classical Brownian particle of mass $M$ subjected to an external force and exposed to correlated thermal fluctuations. We show that the recently developed approach to this system, in which its non-Markovian dynamics given by the Generalized Langevin Equation is approximated by its memoryless counterpart but with the effective particle mass $M^* &lt; M$, can be derived within the Markovian embedding technique. Using this method we calculate the first and the second order memory correction to Markovian dynamics of the Brownian particle for the memory kernel represented as the Prony series. The second one lowers the effective mass of the system further and improves precision of the approximation. Our work opens the door for the derivation of higher order memory corrections to Markovian Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Circuits II: Nonequilibrium conductance matrix for a thermoelectric converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a linear flux-force relation of a thermoelectric material in local equilibrium, we derive non-linear relations between the currents and forces of a thermoelectric converter (TEC) driven far from equilibrium. Our investigation focuses on a one-dimensional TEC of finite thickness. Building on the achievements of the first paper of this series, we unveil the conservation laws governing physical currents (ie linearly dependent currents). Using the latter allows to put forward two relevant bases of physical and fundamental currents. For these bases, we introduce the concept of non equilibrium conductance matrix to describe the current-force relations of a TEC. This concept will be at the core of the third paper of this series in which we illustrate the serial and parallel association on composite TECs. Finally, we determine in a unified way the optimal working points of the TEC in its two operating modes: the electric generator and the heat pump.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models apply the concept of Langevin dynamics in physics to machine leaning, attracting a lot of interest from industrial application, but a complete picture about inherent mechanisms is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a transparent physics analysis of the diffusion models, deriving the fluctuation theorem, entropy production, Franz-Parisi potential to understand the intrinsic phase transitions discovered recently. Our analysis is rooted in non-equlibrium physics and concepts from equilibrium physics, i.e., treating both forward and backward dynamics as a Langevin dynamics, and treating the reverse diffusion generative process as a statistical inference, where the time-dependent state variables serve as quenched disorder studied in spin glass theory. This unified principle is expected to guide machine learning practitioners to design better algorithms and theoretical physicists to link the machine learning to non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Estimating transmission noise on networks from stationary local order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study networks of nodes characterised by binary traits that change both endogenously and through nearest-neighbour interaction. Our analytical results show that those traits can be ranked according to the noisiness of their transmission using only measures of order in the stationary state. Crucially, this ranking is independent of network topology. As an example, we explain why, in line with a long-standing hypothesis, the relative stability of the structural traits of languages can be estimated from their geospatial distribution. We conjecture that similar inferences may be possible in a more general class of Markovian systems. Consequently, in many empirical domains where longitudinal information is not easily available the propensities of traits to change could be estimated from spatial data alone.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics and Artificial Neural Networks: Principles, Models, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of neuroscience and the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) have mutually influenced each other, drawing from and contributing to many concepts initially developed in statistical mechanics. Notably, Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines are versions of the Ising model, a model extensively studied in statistical mechanics for over a century. In the first part of this chapter, we provide an overview of the principles, models, and applications of ANNs, highlighting their connections to statistical mechanics and statistical learning theory.
  Artificial neural networks can be seen as high-dimensional mathematical functions, and understanding the geometric properties of their loss landscapes (i.e., the high-dimensional space on which one wishes to find extrema or saddles) can provide valuable insights into their optimization behavior, generalization abilities, and overall performance. Visualizing these functions can help us design better optimization methods and improve their generalization abilities. Thus, the second part of this chapter focuses on quantifying geometric properties and visualizing loss functions associated with deep ANNs.</description>

      <title>Physics of a granular pile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the onset of the subject, granular media have been defying the toolkit of statistical mechanics thus preventing from understanding their thermodynamical and rheological properties and making them one of the key remaining mysteries in science. In the present work, we offer a resolution to this problem in the case of static granular media by considering a collective behavior of 2D identical balls forming a granular pile in the gravity field, which allows us to develop its thermodynamics and rheology from the first principles. Besides the uncertainty due to rough substrate on which the pile is built, we uncover another one due to ambiguities occurring in the positions of some interior balls. Both are responsible for the thermodynamic description of the granular pile, which proves to be anything but ordinary. In particular, we show that a pile is characterized by three temperatures: one is infinite, the other is negative, and the third is of higher-order. Also, considering the fields of ball displacements $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ and the normal force deviations $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$ from the ideal isosceles triangular structure of a regular pile reveals the hyperbolic nature of the $\boldsymbol{\xi}$-field and ability of the $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$-field to change the characteristic type from hyperbolic to elliptic. The latter property not only explains the origin of force chains and provides an adequate description of the rheology of static granular media, but turned out to be instrumental for understanding of granular media thermodynamics. Our model should provide a basis for further grasping of granular media properties, in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for local temperature variations and the ensuing stochastic effects. This framework provides a deeper understanding of energy balance, second law of thermodynamics, and thermostated steady states in active matter, while also addressing the systematic violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorem and detailed balance. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: The paper utilizes data from the SuperKamiokande solar neutrino detection experiment and analyses them by diffusion entropy analysis and standard deviation analysis. The result indicates that solar neutrinos are subject to Levy flights (anomalous diffusion, superdiffusion). Subsequently, the paper derives the probability density function, represented as Fox H-function, and the governing fractional diffusion equation (fractional Fokker-Planck Equation) for solar neutrino Levy flights.</description>

      <title>Spread and Spectral Complexity in Quantum Spin Chains: from Integrability to Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore spread and spectral complexity in quantum systems that exhibit a transition from integrability to chaos, namely the mixed-field Ising model and the next-to-nearest-neighbor deformation of the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain. We corroborate the observation that the presence of a peak in spread complexity before its saturation, is a characteristic feature in chaotic systems. We find that, in general, the saturation value of spread complexity post-peak depends not only on the spectral statistics of the Hamiltonian, but also on the specific state. However, there appears to be a maximal universal bound determined by the symmetries and dimension of the Hamiltonian, which is realized by the thermofield double state (TFD) at infinite temperature. We also find that the time scales at which the spread complexity and spectral form factor change their behaviour agree with each other and are independent of the chaotic properties of the systems. In the case of spectral complexity, we identify that the key factor determining its saturation value and timescale in chaotic systems is given by minimum energy difference in the theory's spectrum. This explains observations made in the literature regarding its earlier saturation in chaotic systems compared to their integrable counterparts. We conclude by discussing the properties of the TFD which, we conjecture, make it suitable for probing signatures of chaos in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres predicts the stability of atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spite of the empirical success of the Weizsaecker mass formula, a predictive, physics-based, analytical estimate of the stability chart of nuclei has remained elusive. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides an excellent description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory is able to predict the most quoted ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$ for stable nuclides, in agreement with experimental observations without any fitting parameter. This solves a 90-year old mystery in nuclear physics: until now, the stability of atomic nuclei was empirically described by the Bethe-Weizsaecker mass formula, which, only thanks to 4-5 adjustable fitting parameters, can capture the tendency of large nuclei to be rich in neutrons. The latter phenomenon was traditionally (qualitatively) explained in terms of a subtle balance between electrostatics and asymmetry effects due to the Pauli exclusion principle. We show that the larger stability of neutron-rich nuclei is the result of a maximized nuclear density, which is controlled by geometric packing considerations.</description>

      <title>Role of correlations in the maximum distribution of multiscale stationary Markovian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in investigating the statistical properties of extreme values for strongly correlated variables. The starting motivation is to understand how the strong-correlation properties of power-law distributed processes affect the possibility of exploring the whole domain of a stochastic process (the real axis in most cases) when performing time-average numerical simulations and how this relates to the numerical evaluation of the autocorrelation function.
  We show that correlations decrease the heterogeneity of the maximum values. Specifically, through numerical simulations we observe that for strongly correlated variables whose probability distribution function decays like a power-law $1/x^\alpha$, the maximum distribution has a tail compatible with a $1/x^{\alpha+2}$ decay, while for i.i.d. variables we expect a $1/x^\alpha$ decay. As a consequence, we also show that the numerically estimated autocorrelation function converges to the theoretical prediction according to a factor that depends on the length of the simulated time-series $n$ according to a power-law: $1/n^{\alpha^\delta}$ with $\delta&lt;1$, This accounts for a very slow convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Competitive ligand binding kinetics to linear polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different types of ligands compete in binding to polymers with different consequences for the physical and chemical properties of the resulting complex. Here, we derive a general kinetic model for the competitive binding kinetics of different types of ligands to a linear polymer, using the McGhee and von Hippel detailed binding site counting procedure. The derived model allows the description of the competitive binding process in terms of the size of the ligand, binding and release rates, and cooperativity parameters. We illustrate the implications of the general theory showing the equations for the competitive binding of two ligands. The size of the ligand, given by the number of monomers occluded, is shown to have a great impact in competitive binding. Ligands requiring a large available gap for binding are strongly inhibited by smaller ligands. Ligand size then has a leading role compared to binding affinity or cooperativity. For ligands that can bind in different modes (i.e., different number of monomers), this implies that they are more effective in covering or passivating the polymer in lower modes, if the different modes have similar binding energies.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram and Coarsening dynamics in dry apolar Active Nematics with Reciprocal local alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Lebwohl-Lasher interaction for reciprocal local alignment, we present a comprehensive phase diagram for a dry, apolar, active nematic system using its stochastic dynamics. The nematic-isotropic transition in this system is first-order and fluctuation-dominated. Our phase diagram identifies three distinct regions based on activity and orientational noise relative to alignment strength: a homogeneous isotropic phase, a nematic phase with giant density fluctuations, and a coexistence region. Using mean-field analysis and hydrodynamic theory, we demonstrate that reciprocal interactions lead to a density fluctuation-induced first-order transition and derive a phase boundary consistent with numerical results. Quenching from the isotropic to nematic phase reveals coarsening dynamics with distinctive scaling behaviors for density and nematic fields, exhibiting exponents between 2 and 3, typical of non-conserved and conserved dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic spin-wave theory tailored to describe quantum trajectories in continuously monitored long-range interacting spin systems. Our method, based on the bosonization of spin-wave excitations on top of a strong collective polarization, enables the efficient simulation of large-scale interacting spins, offering insights into nonlinear features of the dynamics such as entanglement and trajectory correlations. We showcase the versatility of our framework by exploring an entanglement phase transition in a monitored spin system with power-law interactions and dwelling on how our method mitigates the experimental challenges of post-selection in detecting monitored quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Tunable Spatiotemporal Orders in Driven Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that driving polar optical phonons above a threshold fluence induces spatiotemporal orders, where polarization or magnetization oscillate at an incommensurate wavevector $q_0$ in space and at half the drive frequency in time. The order is robust against temperature on timescales much larger than the lifetime of the excited modes and is accompanied by a static $2q_0$ modulation for certain symmetries. We predict its signatures in time-resolved diffraction and provide estimates for candidate materials. Our results open the way to realizing tunable density waves in solids on the nanoscale using THz or IR light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of universality has shaped our understanding of many-body physics, but is mostly limited to homogenous systems. Here, we present a study of universality on a non-homogeneous graph, the long-range diluted graph (LRDG). Its scaling theory is controlled by a single parameter, the spectral dimension $d_{s}$, which plays the role of the relevant parameter on complex geometries. The graph under consideration allows us to tune the value of the spectral dimension continuously also to noninteger values and to find the universal exponents as continuous functions of the dimension. By means of extensive numerical simulations, we probe the scaling exponents of a simple instance of $O(\mathcal{N})$ symmetric models on the LRDG showing quantitative agreement with the theoretical prediction of universal scaling in real dimensions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent flocking: From discontinuous to continuous transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09901v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of lattice-gas models of flocking, whose thermodynamically consistent dynamics admits a proper equilibrium limit at vanishing self-propulsion. These models are amenable to an exact coarse-graining which allows us to study their hydrodynamic behavior analytically. We show that the equilibrium limit here belongs to the universality class of Model C, and that it generically exhibits tricritical behavior. Self-propulsion has a non-perturbative effect on the phase diagram, yielding novel phase behaviors depending on the type of aligning interactions. For aligning interactions that increase monotonically with the density, the tricritical point diverges to infinite density reproducing the standard scenario of a discontinuous flocking transition accompanied by traveling bands. In contrast, for models where the aligning interaction is non-monotonic in density, the system can exhibit either (the nonequilibrium counterpart of) an azeotropic point, associated with a continuous flocking transition, or a state with counterpropagating bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time random walk on a line starting at $x_0\geq 0$ where a cost is incurred at each jump. We obtain an exact analytical formula for the distribution of the total cost of a trajectory until the process crosses the origin for the first time. The formula is valid for arbitrary jump distribution and cost function (heavy- and light-tailed alike), provided they are symmetric and continuous. We analyze the formula in different scaling regimes, and find a high degree of universality with respect to the details of the jump distribution and the cost function. Applications are given to the motion of an active run-and-tumble particle in one dimension and extensions to multiple cost variables are considered. The analytical results are in perfect agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>First-Order Vortex Lattice Melting in Bilayer Ice: A Monte Carlo Method Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the stable bilayer water ice grown in the laboratory (Nature 577, 60, 2020), we propose a model representing water ice as a two-layer six-vertex model. Using the loop update Monte Carlo method, we unveil meaningful findings. While the square lattice six-vertex model exhibits an antiferromagnetic to disordered phase transition known as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, we observe a different scenario for the bilayer six-vertex model, where the transition type transforms into an Ising transition. We discover the emergence of vortices in the disordered phase, and to stabilize them, vortex excitation is induced. This leads to the presence of distinct 1/2 filling and 2/3 filling vortex lattice phases. More importantly, we identify the phase transitions between the vortex lattice phase and the disordered phase, as well as between the 1/2 and 2/3 vortex lattices, as being of first order. We also propose an experimental scheme for realizing a two-layer six-vertex model based on the artificial ice of particles in a double well trap array. Our findings provide valuable insight into the nature of phase transitions occurring in layered water ice and artificial spin ice systems in experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Interplay between short-range and critical long-range fluctuations in the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the particle density at quantum transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium behavior of the particle density in many-body systems undergoing quantum transitions driven by the chemical potential $\mu$. They originate from a nontrivial interplay between noncritical short-range and critical long-range quantum fluctuations. As a paradigmatic model we consider the one-dimensional fermionic Kitaev chain, for which very accurate numerical studies can be performed, up to $O(10^4)$ sites. The search for dynamic scaling behaviors of the particle density is complicated by the fact that its equilibrium (ground state) behavior is dominated by short-range fluctuations, giving rise to regular background terms and peculiar logarithmic terms from resonances between renormalization-group perturbations associated with the energy and identity operator families within the conformal field theory. To study these issues, we focus on two dynamic protocols, either instantaneous quenches or quasi-adiabatic changes of $\mu$ to the critical value $\mu_c$, unveiling out-of-equilibrium scaling behaviors of the particle density, which arise from the critical modes, within a dynamic finite-size scaling framework.</description>

      <title>Thermally activated particle motion in biased correlated Gaussian disorder potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermally activated particle motion in disorder potentials is controlled by the large-$\Delta V$ tail of the distribution of height $\Delta V$ of the potential barriers created by the disorder. We employ the optimal fluctuation method to evaluate this tail for correlated quenched Gaussian potentials in one dimension in the presence of a small bias of the potential. We focus on the mean escape time (MET) of overdamped particles averaged over the disorder. We show that the bias leads to a strong (exponential) reduction of the MET in the direction along the bias. The reduction depends both on the bias, and on detailed properties of the covariance of the disorder, such as its derivatives and asymptotic behavior at large distances. We verify our theoretical predictions, as well as earlier predictions for zero bias, by performing large-deviation simulations of the potential disorder. The simulations employ correlated random potential sampling based on the circulant embedding method and the Wang-Landau algorithm, which enable us to probe probability densities smaller than $10^{-1200}$.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group Perspective on Gravitational Critical Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose extremal black holes (BH) as critical points of a new class of gravitational collapses. The conjecture is made by observing the Continuous Self Similarity (CSS) and Discrete Self Similarity (DSS) behaviours of perturbations of an extremal black hole spacetime and compare them to similar properties of Choptuik-type critical solutions. By performing analytical perturbation studies on extremal black holes, we explicitly show that the DSS solution found here can be interpreted as renormalization group (RG) limit cycles, and the transition between CSS and DSS regimes occurs as the stable and unstable fixed points collide and move to the complex plane. We argue that the DSS solutions found in spherically symmetric gravitational collapses can be similarly interpreted. We identify various phenomena in non-gravitational systems with RG limit cycles, including DSS correlation function, DSS scaling laws in correlation length and order parameters, which are observed in gravitational critical collapses. We also discuss a version of gravitational Efimov effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of $1/f$ noise in semiconductors based on the drift of individual charge carriers and their interaction with the trapping centers. We assume a homogeneous distribution of the trapping centers in the material. The trapping centers are assumed to be heterogeneous and have unique detrapping rates, which are sampled from a uniform distribution. We show that the uniform detrapping rate distribution is a natural consequence of the vacant trap depths following the Boltzmann distribution, and the detrapping process obeying Arrhenius law. If the trapping rate is low in comparison to the maximum detrapping rate, $1/f$ noise in the form of Hooge's relation is recovered. Hooge's parameter, $\alpha_{H}$, is shown to be a ratio between the characteristic trapping rate and the maximum detrapping rate. The proposed model implies that $1/f$ noise arises from the temporal charge carrier number fluctuations, not from the spatial mobility fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-boson model usually considers a spin coupled to a single bosonic bath. However, some physical situations require coupling of the spin to multiple environments. For example, spins interacting with phonons in three-dimensional magnetic materials. Here, we consider a spin coupled isotropically to three independent baths. We show that coupling to multiple baths can significantly increase entanglement between the spin and its environment at zero temperature. The effect of this is to reduce the spin's expectation values in the mean force equilibrium state. In contrast, the classical three-bath spin equilibrium state turns out to be entirely independent of the environmental coupling. These results reveal purely quantum effects that can arise from multi-bath couplings, with potential applications in a wide range of settings, such as magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary t-designs are distributions on the unitary group whose first t moments appear maximally random. Previous work has established several upper bounds on the depths at which certain specific random quantum circuit ensembles approximate t-designs. Here we show that these bounds can be extended to any fixed architecture of Haar-random two-site gates. This is accomplished by relating the spectral gaps of such architectures to those of 1D brickwork architectures. Our bound depends on the details of the architecture only via the typical number of layers needed for a block of the circuit to form a connected graph over the sites. When this quantity is independent of width, the circuit forms an approximate t-design in linear depth. We also give an implicit bound for nondeterministic architectures in terms of properties of the corresponding distribution over fixed architectures.</description>

      <title>Stable Attractors for Neural networks classification via Ordinary Differential Equations (SA-nODE)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel approach for supervised classification is presented which sits at the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems theory. At variance with other methodologies that employ ordinary differential equations for classification purposes, the untrained model is a priori constructed to accommodate for a set of pre-assigned stationary stable attractors. Classifying amounts to steer the dynamics towards one of the planted attractors, depending on the specificity of the processed item supplied as an input. Asymptotically the system will hence converge on a specific point of the explored multi-dimensional space, flagging the category of the object to be eventually classified. Working in this context, the inherent ability to perform classification, as acquired ex post by the trained model, is ultimately reflected in the shaped basin of attractions associated to each of the target stable attractors. The performance of the proposed method is here challenged against simple toy models crafted for the purpose, as well as by resorting to well established reference standards. Although this method does not reach the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, it illustrates that continuous dynamical systems with closed analytical interaction terms can serve as high-performance classifiers.</description>

      <title>A Modified Cosmic Brane Proposal for Holographic Renyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for computing holographic Renyi entropies in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. Our proposal is based on computing the wave function in the basis of fixed-area states and assuming a diagonal approximation for the Renyi entropy. For Renyi index $n\geq1$, our proposal agrees with the existing cosmic brane proposal for holographic Renyi entropy. For $n&lt;1$, however, our proposal predicts a new phase with leading order (in Newton's constant $G$) corrections to the cosmic brane proposal, even far from entanglement phase transitions and when bulk quantum corrections are unimportant. Recast in terms of optimization over fixed-area states, the difference between the two proposals can be understood to come from the order of optimization: for $n&lt;1$, the cosmic brane proposal is a minimax prescription whereas our proposal is a maximin prescription. We demonstrate the presence of such leading order corrections using illustrative examples. In particular, our proposal reproduces existing results in the literature for the PSSY model and high-energy eigenstates, providing a universal explanation for previously found leading order corrections to the $n&lt;1$ Renyi entropies.</description>

      <title>On the approximability of random-hypergraph MAX-3-XORSAT problems with quantum algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A canonical feature of the constraint satisfaction problems in NP is approximation hardness, where in the worst case, finding sufficient-quality approximate solutions is exponentially hard for all known methods. Fundamentally, the lack of any guided local minimum escape method ensures both exact and approximate classical approximation hardness, but the equivalent mechanism(s) for quantum algorithms are poorly understood. For algorithms based on Hamiltonian time evolution, we explore this question through the prototypically hard MAX-3-XORSAT problem class. We conclude that the mechanisms for quantum exact and approximation hardness are fundamentally distinct. We review known results from the literature, and identify mechanisms that make conventional quantum methods (such as Adiabatic Quantum Computing) weak approximation algorithms in the worst case. We construct a family of spectrally filtered quantum algorithms that escape these issues, and develop analytical theories for their performance. We show that, for random hypergraphs in the approximation-hard regime, if we define the energy to be $E = N_{\mathrm{unsat}}-N_{\mathrm{sat}}$, spectrally filtered quantum optimization will return states with $E \leq q_m E_{\mathrm{GS}}$ (where $E_{\rm GS}$ is the ground state energy) in sub-quadratic time, where conservatively, $q_m \simeq 0.59$. This is in contrast to $q_m \to 0$ for the hardest instances with classical searches. We test all of these claims with extensive numerical simulations. We do not claim that this approximation guarantee holds for all possible hypergraphs, though our algorithm's mechanism can likely generalize widely. These results suggest that quantum computers are more powerful for approximate optimization than had been previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Engineered Ordinary Differential Equations as Classification Algorithm (EODECA): thorough characterization and testing</title>

Abstract: EODECA (Engineered Ordinary Differential Equations as Classification Algorithm) is a novel approach at the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems theory, presenting a unique framework for classification tasks [1]. This method stands out with its dynamical system structure, utilizing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to efficiently handle complex classification challenges. The paper delves into EODECA's dynamical properties, emphasizing its resilience against random perturbations and robust performance across various classification scenarios. Notably, EODECA's design incorporates the ability to embed stable attractors in the phase space, enhancing reliability and allowing for reversible dynamics. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive analysis by expanding on the work [1], and employing a Euler discretization scheme. In particular, we evaluate EODECA's performance across five distinct classification problems, examining its adaptability and efficiency. Significantly, we demonstrate EODECA's effectiveness on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving impressive accuracies of $98.06\%$ and $88.21\%$, respectively. These results are comparable to those of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), underscoring EODECA's potential in complex data processing tasks. We further explore the model's learning journey, assessing its evolution in both pre and post training environments and highlighting its ability to navigate towards stable attractors. The study also investigates the invertibility of EODECA, shedding light on its decision-making processes and internal workings. This paper presents a significant step towards a more transparent and robust machine learning paradigm, bridging the gap between machine learning algorithms and dynamical systems methodologies.</description>

      <title>Bi-Hamiltonian in Semiflexible Polymer as Strongly Coupled System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When many body system in Classical Mechanics is described using bi-Hamiltonian for its group of particles which forms a coarse grained bead, the damping energy from the heat bath perturbs the motion of a particle which is along the trajectory of multiple Hamiltonian system simultaneously. As managing the coarse grained modeling of the suspended semiflexible polymer like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) in vacuum, the authors discovered that such interconnection between Hamiltonian systems as sharing a heat bath builds a strongly coupled system. The consequence of this interconnection is revealed to form certain form of cross correlated momentum in coarsed grained system as well as in the original atomic scales. In this paper, we adapt the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics to describe the cross correlation of bi-Hamiltonian system which replicates the macroscopic behaviour of SWCNT under the Smoluchowski picture for cross correlation between Hamiltonian systems. The numerical experiments using collision between tubes confirms the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the abnormaly from cross correlated momentum.</description>

      <title>Optimal input reverberation and homeostatic self-organization towards the edge of synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transient or partial synchronization can be used to do computations, although a fully synchronized network is frequently related to epileptic seizures. Here, we propose a homeostatic mechanism that is capable of maintaining a neuronal network at the edge of a synchronization transition, thereby avoiding the harmful consequences of a fully synchronized network. We model neurons by maps since they are dynamically richer than integrate-and-fire models and more computationally efficient than conductance-based approaches. We first describe the synchronization phase transition of a dense network of neurons with different tonic spiking frequencies coupled by gap junctions. We show that at the transition critical point, inputs optimally reverberate through the network activity through transient synchronization. Then, we introduce a local homeostatic dynamic in the synaptic coupling and show that it produces a robust self-organization toward the edge of this phase transition. We discuss the potential biological consequences of this self-organization process, such as its relation to the Brain Criticality hypothesis, its input processing capacity, and how its malfunction could lead to pathological synchronization.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field with Triangle Window Functions on Quantum Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum phase space (CPS) formulation of finite-state quantum systems has recently revealed that the triangle window function approach is an isomorphic representation of the exact population-population correlation function of the two-state system. We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is competent in faithfully capturing the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs. In comparison to the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method where triangle window functions were originally proposed, the performance of NaF-TW is significantly better when the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion in the asymptotic region is important.</description>
