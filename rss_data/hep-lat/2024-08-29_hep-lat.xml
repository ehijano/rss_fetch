      <title>Exploring the $ \Omega^- $ spectrum in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exploratory lattice QCD analysis of the $ \Omega $-baryon spectrum. Using smeared three-quark operators in a correlation matrix analysis, we report masses for the ground, first and second excited states of the $ J^P = 1/2^\pm,\, 3/2^\pm $ spectra across a broad range in the light quark mass. We investigate the parity and spin quantum numbers for the states observed on the lattice, looking to reconcile these with the resonances encountered in experiment. We find that the $ \Omega^-(2012) $ as reported by the Particle Data Group corresponds to two overlapping resonances with $ J^P = 1/2^- $ and $ 3/2^- $. We also propose quantum number assignments for the higher energy resonances, and identify successive radial excitations within the spectra.</description>

      <title>Lattice spectra of $DDK$ three-body system with Lorentz covariant kinematic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $DDK$ system has gain increasing attention in recent research due to its potential to contain a three-hadron bound state. This article utilizes an extension of the Non-Relativistic Effective Field Theory (NREFT) and the finite volume particle-dimer framework to derive Lorentz-invariant quantization conditions for the $DDK$ three-body system. Using current model input conditions, the finite volume energy spectrum of the $DDK$ three-body system was calculated. This new calculation incorporates relativistic kinematics, allowing it to be applicable across a broader energy range starting from the threshold. In this work, we present a comprehensive \( O(p^{2}) \) calculation. The spurious pole is effectively subtracted within the framework of relativistic kinematics. The spectra in the moving frame are also obtained. These analyses provide a broader testing ground for future lattice simulations. They are expected to reveal more detailed properties of the $DDK$ system and other three-hadron systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gaugino condensates on a twisted $\mathbb T^4$: In the beginning, there was semi-classics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the gaugino condensates, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle $ for $1$ $\leq$ $k$ $\le$ $N-1$, in $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory on a small four-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^4$, subject to 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions. Two recent advances are crucial to performing the calculations and interpreting the result: the understanding of generalized anomalies involving $1$-form center symmetry and the construction of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted $\mathbb T^4$. These self-dual classical configurations have topological charge $k/N$ and can be described as a sum over $k$ closely packed lumps in an instanton liquid. Using the path integral formalism, we perform the condensate calculations in the semi-classical limit and find, assuming gcd$(k,N)=1$, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle = {\bf n}^{-1} \; N^2\left(16\pi^2 \Lambda^3\right)^k$, where $\Lambda$ is the strong-coupling scale and ${\bf n}$ is a normalization constant. We determine the normalization constant, using path integral, as ${\bf n} = N^2$, which is $N$ times larger than the normalization used in our earlier publication arXiv:2210.13568. This finding resolves the extra-factor-of-$N$ discrepancy encountered there, aligning our results with those obtained through direct supersymmetric methods on $\mathbb R^4$. The normalization constant ${\bf n}$ can be interpreted within the Euclidean path-integral formulation as the Witten index $I_W$. It is well-established that a Hamiltonian calculation of $I_W$ yields $I_W=N$, suggesting that while ${\bf n}=N^2$ correctly reproduces the condensate result, it presents a puzzle in reconciling the Witten index computation via the path integral formalism, an issue warranting further investigation.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence from complex saddle points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum decoherence is the effect that bridges quantum physics to well-understood classical physics. As such, it plays a crucial role in understanding the mysterious nature of quantum physics represented by Schr\"odinger's cat, for example. Quantum decoherence is also a source of quantum noise that has to be well under control in quantum computing and in various experiments based on quantum technologies. Here we point out that quantum decoherence can be captured by $\textit{complex}$ saddle points in the Feynman path integral in much the same way as quantum tunneling can be captured by instantons. In particular, we present some first-principle calculations in the Caldeira-Leggett model, which reproduce the predicted scaling behavior of quantum decoherence with respect to the parameters of the environment such as the temperature and the coupling to the system of interest. We also discuss how to extend our work to general models by Monte Carlo calculations using a recently developed method to overcome the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Pseudogap regime of the unitary Fermi gas with lattice auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo in the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unitary Fermi gas (UFG) is a strongly correlated system of two-species (spin-1/2) fermions with a short-range attractive interaction modeled by a contact interaction and has attracted much interest across different disciplines. The UFG is considered a paradigm for strongly correlated superfluids and has been investigated extensively, with generally good agreement found between theory and experiment. However, the extent of a pseudogap regime above the critical temperature $T_c$ for superfluidity is still debated both theoretically and experimentally. Here we study thermodynamic properties of the UFG across the superfluid phase transition using finite-temperature lattice auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFMC) methods in the canonical ensemble of fixed particle numbers. We extrapolate our lattice AFMC results to the continuous time and continuum limits, thus removing the systematic error associated with the finite filling factor of previous AFMC studies. We determine the critical temperature to be $T_c=0.16(1)\, T_{F}$. For the largest particle number studied $N=114$, the energy-staggering pairing gap is suppressed above a pairing scale temperature of $T^{*}\approx 0.2\,T_F$. The spin susceptibility displays moderate suppression above $T_c$ with a spin gap temperature of $T_s\approx 0.2 \,T_F$. We also calculate a free energy-staggering pairing gap, which shows substantially reduced statistical errors when compared with the energy-staggering gap, allowing for a clear signature of pairing correlations in the finite-size system. All results indicate that the pseudogap regime is narrow, with pseudogap signatures emerging at temperatures below $T^{*}\approx 0.2 \, T_F$. The reduced statistical errors of the free energy gap enable an extrapolation at low temperatures, allowing an estimate of the zero-temperature pairing gap $\Delta_E = 0.576(24) \, \epsilon_F$.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis of Monopole Current Networks in $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>On the (in)consistency of perturbation theory at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known difficulty of perturbative approaches to quantum field theory at finite temperature is the necessity to address theoretical constraints that are not present in the vacuum theory. In this work, we use lattice simulations of scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory to analyse the extent to which these constraints affect the perturbative predictions. We find that the standard perturbative predictions deteriorate even in the absence of infrared divergences at relatively low temperatures, and that this is directly connected to the analytic structure of the propagators used in the expansion. This suggests that the incorporation of non-perturbative thermal effects in the propagators is essential for a consistent perturbative formulation of scalar quantum field theories at finite temperature. By utilising the spectral constraints imposed on finite-temperature correlation functions, we explore how these effects manifest themselves in the lattice data, and discuss why the presence of distinct thermoparticle excitations provides a potential resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>Corrections to adiabatic behavior for long paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cost and the error of the adiabatic theorem for preparing the final eigenstate are discussed in terms of path length. Previous studies in terms of the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivatives with the spectral gap are limited in their ability to describe the cost of adiabatic state preparation for certain physically large systems. We argue that total time is not a good measure for determining the computational difficulty of adiabatic quantum computation by developing a no-go theorem. From the result of time-periodic Hamiltonian cases, we suggest that there are proxies for computational cost which typically grow as path length increases when the error is kept fixed and small and consider possible conjectures on how general the behavior is.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for Scaling Dimensions of Composite Operators in the $\phi^4$ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimension $\Delta_n$ for the class of composite operators $\phi^n$ in the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory taking the double scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with fixed $\lambda n$ via a semiclassical approach. Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any loop order. In the small $\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic results and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate values of $\lambda n$ we find that $\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically approaching a $(\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\lambda n \to \infty$ limit. We further generalize our results to the $\displaystyle{\left(\vec{\phi} \cdot \vec{\phi}\right)^{n/2}}$ operators in the $O(N)$ model.</description>
