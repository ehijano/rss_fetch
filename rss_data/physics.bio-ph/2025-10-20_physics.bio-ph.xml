      <title>Control of Neuronal Survival and Development Using Conductive Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the control of neuronal survival and development using nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD). We highlight the role of N-UNCD in regulating neuronal activity via near-infrared illumination, demonstrating the generation of stable photocurrents that enhance neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth and foster a more active, synchronized neuronal network. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing reveals that diamond substrates improve cellular-substrate interaction by upregulating extracellular matrix and gap junction-related genes. Our findings underscore the potential of conductive diamond as a robust and biocompatible platform for noninvasive and effective neural tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Sparing of DNA irradiated with Ultra-High Dose-Rates under Physiological Oxygen and Salt conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer treatment with radiotherapy aims to kill tumor cells and spare healthy tissue.Thus,the experimentally observed sparing of healthy tissue by the FLASH effect during irradiations with ultra-high dose rates (UHDR) enables clinicians to extend the therapeutic window.However, the underlying radiobiological and chemical mechanisms are far from being understood.DNA is one of the main molecular targets for radiotherapy.Ionizing radiation damage to DNA in water depends strongly on salt,pH,buffer and oxygen content of the solvent.Here we present a study of plasmid DNA pUC19,irradiated with 18MeV electrons at low dose rates (LDR) and UHDR under tightly controlled ambient and physiological oxygen conditions in PBS at pH 7.4.For the first time a sparing effect of DNA strand-break induction between UHDR(&gt;10MGy/s) and LDR(&lt;0.1Gy/s) irradiated plasmid DNA under physiological oxygen, salt and pH is observed for total doses above 10Gy.Under physiological oxygen (physoxia,5%O2,40mmHg),more single (SSB) and double strand-breaks (DSB) are observed when exposed to LDR, than to UHDR.This behaviour is absent for ambient oxygen (normoxia,21%O2,150-160mmHg).The experiments are accompanied by TOPAS-nBio based particle-scattering and chemical MCS to obtain information about the yields of reactive oxygen species (ROS).Hereby,an extended set of chemical reactions was considered, which improved upon the discrepancy between experiment and simulations of previous works, and allowed to predict DR dependent g-values of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).To explain the observed DNA sparing effect under FLASH conditions at physoxia,the following model was proposed:The interplay of O2 with OH induced H-abstraction at the phosphate backbone,and the conversion of DNA base-damage to SSB,under consideration of the dose-rate dependent H3O+ yield via beta elimination processes is accounted for, to explain the observed behavior.</description>

      <title>Genesis of Horizontal Membrane Electric Field by Bilayer-Embedded Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over a century, the electric field of biological membranes has been treated as a one-dimensional entity, defined exclusively by the voltage across its thickness (V_VERT). Here, we challenge this conventional view by developing a device that can apply a horizontal membrane voltage (V_HORZ) across a synthetic lipid bilayer. The device consists of electrodes embedded between bilayer leaflets, allowing the steady application of V_HORZ. Applied V_HORZ selectively and reversibly accelerated the slow inactivation of a voltage-gated potassium channel. Physical considerations revealed that V_HORZ is generated from spatially inhomogeneous V_VERT in cell membranes, thus occurring ubiquitously in membrane physiological functions, such as at the action-potential wave front. Our V_HORZ system enables the generation of three-dimensional membrane electric fields, mimicking hitherto overlooked physiological membrane electric activities.</description>

      <title>Airway Mucus Rheology: Physical Insights for Navigating through Health to Pathology and Clinical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Airway mucus is a complex gel with an anisotropic three-dimensional network structure. As a crucial component of the respiratory defense barrier, it plays a vital role in maintaining airway hydration and supporting the function of airway epithelial cells. Through linear and nonlinear rheological mechanisms such as ciliary motion and coughing, airway mucus expels foreign pathogens and toxic nano- and microparticles while selectively allowing the passage of specific nutrients and proteins. These protective and clearance functions depend on the proper rheological properties of mucus under normal physiological conditions. However, in respiratory disease such as CF, COPD, asthma, and COVID-19, excessive mucus secretion is often accompanied by abnormal rheological behaviors. This leads to impaired mucus flow, airway obstruction, and potentially life-threatening conditions. Therefore, this review examines the rheological behaviors of airway mucus in relation to health and disease, focusing on both macrorheology and microrheology. The review highlights those changes in the chemical composition and microstructure of airway mucus, especially under pathological conditions, that can significantly alter its rheological behavior. Rheological parameters can also serve as biological indicators to study the role of mucus in clearance functions and aid in developing pulmonary drug delivery systems. By integrating findings from both macro- and microrheological studies, this review aims to enhance our understanding of the complex behavior of airway mucus, supporting better diagnosis, treatment, and management of chronic respiratory diseases.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Induced Magnetization and Its Implications for RNA Homochirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The single-handedness of biomolecules is a characteristic feature of life on Earth, yet achieving and maintaining a homochiral prebiotic network is a significant challenge. In our previous studies, we reached homochirality in an RNA precursor, ribo-aminooxazoline (RAO), using magnetized magnetite surfaces as chiral reagents, due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. We further demonstrated that RAO can induce net magnetization on previously demagnetized magnetite, indicating a self-reinforcing feedback between chiral molecules and magnetic surfaces. However, these processes depend on spin interactions that generally weaken at higher temperatures, raising concerns about the robustness of our mechanisms in natural settings. Additionally, the temperature dependence of CISS remains poorly understood and highly debated. To address these questions, we investigated the temperature dependence of chirality-induced magnetization. Contrary to classical expectations, we observed a significant increase in the magnetic coercivity with increasing temperatures, suggesting a phonon-assisted process. Our results support a vibronic contribution to CISS and indicate that spin-controlled processes leading to RNA homochirality can occur reliably and effectively over a range of temperatures likely present in prebiotic environments.</description>
