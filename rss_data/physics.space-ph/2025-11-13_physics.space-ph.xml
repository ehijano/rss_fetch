      <title>Time-Dependent Radiation Quality Factor &lt;Q&gt; of Galactic Cosmic Rays in Deep Space and Shielding Environments: Modeling and Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the long-term variation of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) radiation environment is critical for assessing radiation risks in space exploration missions. In this study, we systematically model the linear energy transfer (LET) spectra of GCRs and the corresponding radiation quality factor, &lt;Q&gt;, in deep space and shielding environments. The Badhwar-O'Neill 2020 (BON20) model is used to represent GCR fluxes under different solar modulation potentials (phi), which characterize the level of solar activity. GCR interactions with spherical shielding of different thicknesses are simulated to obtain the LET spectra, absorbed dose, dose equivalent, and &lt;Q&gt;. We present a comprehensive dataset of these quantities for a range of phi values and shielding thicknesses. The results show that &lt;Q&gt; depends strongly on the shielding thickness but only weakly on solar activity. Furthermore, model predictions are validated against long-term measurements from the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) orbiting the Moon, and the Liulin-MO detector on board the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) orbiting Mars. In this comparison, we consider factors for anomalous cosmic ray (ACR) contributions and radial gradients of both GCRs and ACRs, applying scaling factors of 6.3% at 1 AU and 11.0% at 1.5 AU to the calculated absorbed dose rate. With these corrections, the modeled absorbed dose rate and &lt;Q&gt; exhibit consistent temporal variations with the observations under both thin and thick shielding conditions. Moreover, we investigate the distinct temporal evolution of &lt;Q&gt; for light and heavy GCR nuclei, revealing how solar modulation influences the elemental radiation quality factor across GCR species. These results offer new insights into the temporal and environmental dependence of the space radiation quality factor, with implications for radiation dose estimate and crewed mission design.</description>

      <title>Superhot (&gt; 30 MK) flare observations with STIX: Joint spectral fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic analysis of large flares (&gt;X1) in the hard X-ray (HXR) range offers unique insights into the hottest (&gt; 30 MK) flare plasma, the so-called superhot thermal component. To manage the high count rates in large flares, an attenuator is typically placed in front of the HXR detectors. However, this significantly limits the spectral diagnostic capabilities at lower energies, and consequently, it restricts the analysis of the lower temperatures in flares. The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board the Solar Orbiter mission was designed to observe solar flares in hard X-rays. The imaging detectors use an attenuator during periods of high flux level. In contrast, the background (BKG) detector of STIX is never covered by the attenuator and is therefore dedicated to measure the unattenuated flux using differently sized apertures placed in front of the detector. We aim to demonstrate that joint spectral fitting using different detector configurations of STIX allows us to reliably diagnose both the hot and the superhot components in large flares. We jointly fit the HXR spectra of the STIX BKG detector and the STIX imaging detectors using SUNKIT-SPEX software package to determine the spectral parameters of both the hot and superhot thermal components in solar flares. Using joint fitting on 32 STIX flares, we corroborate that for GOES X-class flares, the HXR spectrum is better represented by two thermal components instead of an isothermal component. At the temperature peak time, the superhot HXR flux above 15 keV is typically stronger than the hot HXR flux. The GOES long-wavelength channel is dominated by the hot component with a superhot contribution up to 10%. This paper demonstrates that joint spectral fitting of the same detector type with different attenuation schemes is a simple and powerful method to monitor multithermal flare plasma.</description>
