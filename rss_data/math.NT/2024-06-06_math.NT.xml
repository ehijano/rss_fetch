      <title>Dedekind sums and mean square value of $L(1,\chi)$ over subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An explicit formula for the quadratic mean value at $s=1$ of the Dirichlet $L$-functions associated with the odd Dirichlet characters modulo $f&gt;2$ is known. Here we present a situation where we could prove an explicit formula for the quadratic mean value at $s=1$ of the Dirichlet $L$-functions associated with the odd Dirichlet characters modulo not necessarily prime moduli $f&gt;2$ that are trivial on a subgroup $H$ of the multiplicative group $({\mathbb Z}/f{\mathbb Z})^*$. This explicit formula involves summation $S(H,f)$ of Dedekind sums $s(h,f)$ over the $h\in H$. A result on some cancelation of the denominators of the $s(h,f)$'s when computing $S(H,f)$ is known. Here, we prove that for some explicit families of $f$'s and $H$'s this known result on cancelation of denominators is the best result one can expect. Finally, we surprisingly prove that for $p$ a prime, $m\geq 2$ and $1\leq n\leq m/2$, the values of the Dedekind sums $s(h,p^m)$ do not depend on $h$ as $h$ runs over the elements of order $p^n$ of the multiplicative cyclic group $({\mathbb Z}/p^m{\mathbb Z})^*$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for $t$-Core Partitions and Stanton's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A partition is a $t$-core partition if $t$ is not one of its hook lengths. Let $c_t(N)$ be the number of $t$-core partitions of $N$. In 1999, Stanton conjectured $c_t(N) \le c_{t+1}(N)$ if $4 \le t \ne N-1$. This was proved for $t$ fixed and $N$ sufficiently large by Anderson, and for small values of $t$ by Kim and Rouse. In this paper, we prove Stanton's conjecture in general. Our approach is to find a saddle point asymptotic formula for $c_t(N)$, valid in all ranges of $t$ and $N$. This includes the known asymptotic formulas for $c_t(N)$ as special cases, and shows that the behavior of $c_t(N)$ depends on how $t^2$ compares in size to $N$. For example, our formula implies that if $t^2 = \kappa N + o(t)$, then $c_t(N) = \frac{\exp\left(2\pi\sqrt{A N}\right)}{B N} (1 + o(1))$ for suitable constants $A$ and $B$ defined in terms of $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Statistic of zeros of Riemann auxiliary function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have computed all zeros $\beta+i\gamma$ of $\mathop{\mathcal R }(s)$ with $0&lt;\gamma&lt;215946.3$. A total of 162215 zeros with 25 correct decimal digits. In this paper we offer some statistic based on this set of zeros. Perhaps the main interesting result is that $63.9\%$ of these zeros satisfies $\beta&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>On a parity result for the symmetric square of modular forms with congruent residual representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parity of Selmer ranks for elliptic curves defined over the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ with good ordinary reduction at an odd prime $p$ has been studied by Shekhar. The proof of Shekhar relies on proving a parity result for the $\lambda$-invariants of Selmer groups over the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $\mathbb{Q}_\infty$ of $\mathbb{Q}$.
  This has been further generalized for elliptic curves with supersingular reduction at $p$ by Hatley and for modular forms by Hatley--Lei. In this paper, we prove a parity result for the $\lambda$-invariants of Selmer groups over $\mathbb{Q}_\infty$ for the symmetric square representations associated to two modular forms with congruent residual Galois representations. We treat both the ordinary and the non-ordinary cases.</description>

      <title>Statistics for 3-isogeny induced Selmer groups of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sixth power free integer $a$, let $E_a$ be the elliptic curve defined by $y^2=x^3+a$. We prove explicit results for the lower density of sixth power free integers $a$ for which the $3$-isogeny induced Selmer group of $E_a$ over $\mathbb{Q}(\mu_3)$ has dimension $\leq 1$. The results are proven by refining the strategy of Davenport--Heilbronn, by relating the statistics for integral binary cubic forms to the statistics for $3$-isogeny induced Selmer groups.</description>

      <title>Joint distribution of Hecke eigenforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate conjectures on the joint distribution of several Hecke eigenforms. We prove an asymptotic formula of the joint mass of two Hecke eigenforms under the generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) and the generalized Ramanujan conjecture (GRC). We also show that a higher decorrelation of two Hecke eigenforms asymptotically vanishes under GRH. As a consequence, we prove an asymptotic formula for the first moment of the triple product $L$-functions under GRH and GRC.</description>

      <title>Characteristic ideal of the fine Selmer group and results on $\mu$-invariance under isogeny in the function field case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a function field $K$ with characteristic $p&gt;0$. We investigate the $\Lambda$-module structure of the Mordell-Weil group of an abelian variety over $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$, generalizing results due to Lee. Next, we study the algebraic structure and prove a control theorem for the S-fine Mordell-Weil groups, the function field analogue for Wuthrich's fine Mordell-Weil groups, over a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$. In case of unramified $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension, $K_\infty$, we compute the characteristic ideal of the Pontryagin dual of the S-fine Mordell group. This provides an answer to an analogue of Greenberg's question for the characteristic ideal of the dual fine Selmer group in the function field setup. In the $\ell\neq p$ case, we prove the triviality of the $\mu$-invariant for the Selmer group (same as the fine Selmer group in this case) of an elliptic curve over a non-commutative $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}_\ell)$-extension of $K$ and thus extending Conjecture A. In the $\ell=p$ case, we compute the change of $\mu$-invariants of the dual Selmer groups of elliptic curves under isogeny, giving a lower bound for the $\mu$-invariant.</description>

      <title>Elliptic curves over Hasse pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a pair of distinct prime powers $(q_1,q_2) = (p_1^{a_1},p_2^{a_2})$ a Hasse pair if $|\sqrt{q_1}-\sqrt{q_2}| \leq 1$. For such pairs, we study the relation between the set $\mathcal{E}_1$ of isomorphism classes of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q_1}$ with $q_2$ points, and the set $\mathcal{E}_2$ of isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_{q_2}$ with $q_1$ points. When both families $\mathcal{E}_i$ contain only ordinary elliptic curves, we prove that their isogeny graphs are isomorphic. When supersingular curves are involved, we describe which curves might belong to these sets. We also show that if both the $q_i$'s are odd and $\mathcal{E}_1 \cup \mathcal{E}_2 \neq \emptyset$, then $\mathcal{E}_1 \cup \mathcal{E}_2$ always contains an ordinary elliptic curve. Conversely, if $q_1$ is even, then $\mathcal{E}_1 \cup \mathcal{E}_2$ may contain only supersingular curves precisely when $q_2$ is a given power of a Fermat or a Mersenne prime. In the case of odd Hasse pairs, we could not rule out the possibility of an empty union $\mathcal{E}_1 \cup \mathcal{E}_2$, but we give necessary conditions for such a case to exist. In an appendix, Moree and Sofos consider how frequently Hasse pairs occur using analytic number theory, making a connection with Andrica's conjecture on the difference between consecutive primes.</description>

      <title>Cycle integrals of meromorphic Hilbert modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a rationality result for linear combinations of traces of cycle integrals of certain meromorphic Hilbert modular forms. These are meromorphic counterparts to the Hilbert cusp forms $\omega_m(z_1,z_2)$, which Zagier investigated in the context of the Doi-Naganuma lift. We give an explicit formula for these cycle integrals, expressed in terms of the Fourier coefficients of harmonic Maass forms. A key element in our proof is the explicit construction of locally harmonic Hilbert-Maass forms on $\mathbb{H}^2$, which are analogous to the elliptic locally harmonic Maass forms examined by Bringmann, Kane, and Kohnen. Additionally, we introduce a regularized theta lift that maps elliptic harmonic Maass forms to locally harmonic Hilbert-Maass forms and is closely related to the Doi-Naganuma lift.</description>

      <title>Improved stability for the size and structure of sumsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A \subset \mathbb{Z}^d$ be a finite set. It is known that the sumset $NA$ has predictable size ($\vert NA\vert = P_A(N)$ for some $P_A(X) \in \mathbb{Q}[X]$) and structure (all of the lattice points in some finite cone other than all of the lattice points in a finite collection of exceptional subcones), once $N$ is larger than some threshold. In previous work, joint with Shakan, the first and third named authors established the first effective bounds for both of these thresholds for an arbitrary set $A$. In this article we substantially improve each of these bounds, coming much closer to the corresponding lower bounds known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks readily learn a subset of the modular arithmetic tasks, while failing to generalize on the rest. This limitation remains unmoved by the choice of architecture and training strategies. On the other hand, an analytical solution for the weights of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) networks that generalize on the modular addition task is known in the literature. In this work, we (i) extend the class of analytical solutions to include modular multiplication as well as modular addition with many terms. Additionally, we show that real networks trained on these datasets learn similar solutions upon generalization (grokking). (ii) We combine these "expert" solutions to construct networks that generalize on arbitrary modular polynomials. (iii) We hypothesize a classification of modular polynomials into learnable and non-learnable via neural networks training; and provide experimental evidence supporting our claims.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize and put in a new light part of ``Fouier analysis on Number fields and Hecke's zeta function''[14] by Tate. We express the relative Euler characteristic using purely adelic language. By using certain natural normalization of Haar measure on adeles we obtain the relative Riemann-Roch theorem. In particular we show that using our relative normalization of the Haar measure on adeles we can obtain the relative Riemann-Roch theorem from the adelic Poisson summation formulae. In addition, using our methods we define the relative 'size of cohomology' numbers, i.e. extract the $h^0$ and $h^1$ part of the relative Euler characteristic. Our theory not only covers both absolute and relative cases, but also the case of an arithmetic curve and a nonsingular, projective curve over a finite field.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm which uses Fujiwara's inequality to bound algebraic functions over ellipses of a certain type, allowing us to concretely implement a rigorous Gauss-Legendre integration method for algebraic functions over a line segment. We consider path splitting strategies to improve convergence of the method and show that these yield significant practical and asymptotic benefits. We implemented these methods to compute period matrices of algebraic Riemann surfaces and these are available in SageMath.</description>

      <title>Oscillating asymptotics for a Nahm-type sum and conjectures of Andrews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1986, Andrews [2,3] studied the function $\sigma(q)$ from Ramanujan's "Lost" Notebook, and made several conjectures on its Fourier coefficients $S(n)$, which count certain partition ranks. In 1988, Andrews-Dyson-Hickerson [5] famously resolved these conjectures, relating the coefficients $S(n)$ to the arithmetic of $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{6})$; this relationship was further expounded upon by Cohen [9] in his work on Maass waveforms, and was more recently extended by Zwegers [43] and by Li and Roehrig [25]. A closer inspection of Andrews' original work on $\sigma(q)$ reveals additional related functions and conjectures, which we study in this paper. In particular, we study the function $v_1(q)$, also from Ramanujan's "Lost" Notebook, a Nahm-type sum with partition-theoretic Fourier coefficients $V_1(n)$, and prove two of Andrews' conjectures on $V_1(n)$ which are parallel to his original conjectures on $S(n)$. Our methods differ from those used in [5], and require a blend of novel techniques inspired by Garoufalidis' and Zagier's recent work on asymptotics of Nahm sums [13,14], with classical techniques including the Circle Method in Analytic Number Theory; our methods may also be applied to determine the asymptotic behavior of other Nahm-type sums of interest which are not amenable to classical techniques. We also offer explanations of additional related conjectures of Andrews, ultimately connecting the asymptotics of $V_1(n)$ to the arithmetic of $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{-3})$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{O}$ be a Dedekind domain whose field of fractions $K$ is a global field. Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional separable $K$-algebra and let $\Lambda$ be an $\mathcal{O}$-order in $A$. Let $n$ be a positive integer and suppose that $X$ is a $\Lambda$-lattice such that $K \otimes_{\mathcal{O}} X$ is free of rank $n$ over $A$. Then $X$ contains a (non-unique) free $\Lambda$-sublattice of rank $n$. The main result of the present article is to show there exists such a sublattice $Y$ such that the generalised module index $[X : Y]_{\mathcal{O}}$ has explicit upper bounds with respect to division that are independent of $X$ and can be chosen to satisfy certain conditions. We give examples of applications to the approximation of normal integral bases and strong Minkowski units, and to the Galois module structure of rational points over abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Rank deviations for overpartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove general fomulas for the deviations of two overpartition ranks from the average. These formulas are in terms of Appell--Lerch series and sums of quotients of theta functions and can be used, among other things, to recover any of the numerous overpartition rank difference identities in the literature. We give two illustrations.</description>

      <title>On $r$-isogenies over $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_r)$ of elliptic curves with rational $j$-invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to determine for which prime numbers $r\geq 3$ can an elliptic curve~$E$ defined over $\mathbb Q$ have an $r$-isogeny over $\mathbb Q(\zeta_r)$. We study this question under various assumptions on the 2-torsion of $E$. Apart from being a natural question itself, the mod~$r$ representations attached to such $E$ arise in the Darmon program for the generalized Fermat equation of signature $(r,r,p)$, playing a key role in the proof of modularity of certain Frey varieties in the recent work of Billerey, Chen, Dieulefait and Freitas.</description>

      <title>A primitive normal pair in a finite field with prescribed traces and norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given ${\mathbb{F}_{p^t}}$, a field with $p^t$ elements, where $p$ is a prime power, $t$ is a positive integer. Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_{p^t}$ of degree $m$ with some restrictions. In this paper, we construct a sufficient condition on $(p,t)$ which guarantees the existence of a primitive normal pair $(\epsilon,f(\epsilon))$ such that $Tr_{\mathbb{F}_{p^t}/\mathbb{F}_p}(\epsilon)=a$, $Tr_{\mathbb{F}_{p^t}/\mathbb{F}_p}(f(\epsilon))=b$ and $N_{\mathbb{F}_{p^t}/\mathbb{F}_p}(\epsilon)=c$, $N_{\mathbb{F}_{p^t}/\mathbb{F}_p}(f(\epsilon))=d$ where $c,d\in\mathbb{F}_{p}$ are primitive elements and $a,b\in\mathbb{F}_{p}^*$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, for $p=11^k;$ $k\geq1,$ $m=8$ and $t\geq 15$, there are only $4$ possible exceptions where such pairs may not exist.</description>

      <title>An explicit lower bound for large gaps between some consecutive primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06951v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p_{n}$ denote the $n$th prime and for any fixed positive integer $k$ and $X\geq 2$, put \[ G_{k}(X):=\max _{p _{n+k}\leq X} \min \{ p_{n+1}-p_{n}, \ldots , p_{n+k}-p_{n+k-1} \}. \] Ford, Maynard and Tao proved that there exists an effective absolute constant $c_{LG}&gt;0$ such that \[ G_{k}(X)\geq \frac{c_{LG}}{k^{2}}\frac{\log X \log \log X \log \log \log \log X}{\log \log \log X} \] holds for any sufficiently large $X$. The main purpose of this paper is to determine the constant $c_{LG}$ above. We see that $c_{LG}$ is determined by several factors related to analytic number theory, for example, the ratio of integrals of functions in the multidimensional sieve of Maynard, the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions to large moduli, and the coefficient of upper bound sieve of Selberg. We prove that the above inequality is valid at least for $c_{LG}\approx 2.0\times 10^{-17}$.</description>

      <title>Irrational Acceleration of a Continued Fraction of $\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An application of (iterated) Bauer-Muir acceleration can give an Ap\'ery-like continued fraction for $\pi$ with irrational coefficients, and much faster convergence. It can be considered a generalized continued fraction with the same matrix representation as the standard case, but the dimension increased due to irrationality. The construction is also given for $\ln(2)$ and $\sqrt[3]{2}$.</description>

      <title>Integrality of mirror maps and arithmetic homological mirror symmetry for Greene--Plesser mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the `integrality of Taylor coefficients of mirror maps' conjecture for Greene--Plesser mirror pairs as a natural byproduct of an arithmetic refinement of homological mirror symmetry. We also prove homological mirror symmetry for Greene--Plesser mirror pairs in all characteristics such that the B-side family has good reduction, generalizing work of the fifth author and Smith over the complex numbers. A key technical ingredient is a new versality argument which allows us to work throughout over a Novikov-type ring with integer coefficients.</description>

      <title>The Riemann hypothesis and dynamics of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new variant of Newton's method - named Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN) - was recently introduced by the second author. This method has good global convergence guarantees, specially concerning finding roots of meromorphic functions. This paper explores using BNQN for the Riemann xi function. We show in particular that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to that all attractors of BNQN lie on the critical line. We also explain how an apparent relation between the basins of attraction of BNQN and Voronoi's diagram can be helpful for verifying the Riemann hypothesis or finding a counterexample to it. Some illustrating experimental results are included, which convey some interesting phenomena. The experiments show that BNQN works very stably with highly transcendental functions like the Riemann xi function and its derivatives. Based on insights from the experiments, we discuss some concrete steps on using BNQN towards the Riemann hypothesis, by combining with de Bruijn -Newman's constant. Ideas and results from this paper can be extended to other zeta functions.</description>
