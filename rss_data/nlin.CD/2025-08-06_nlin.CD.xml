      <title>Transition to chaos with conical billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt ideas from geometrical optics and classical billiard dynamics to consider particle trajectories with constant velocity on a cone with specular reflections off an elliptical boundary formed by the intersection with a tilted plane, with tilt angle $\gamma$. We explore the dynamics as a function of $\gamma$ and the cone deficit angle $\chi$ that controls the sharpness of the apex, where a point source of positive Gaussian curvature is concentrated. We find regions of the ($\gamma, \chi$) plane where, depending on the initial conditions, either (A) the trajectories sample the entire cone base and avoid the apex region; (B) sample only a portion of the base region while again avoiding the apex; or (C) sample the entire cone surface much more uniformly, suggestive of ergodicity. The special case of an untilted cone displays only type A trajectories which form a ring caustic at the distance of closest approach to the apex. However, we observe an intricate transition to chaotic dynamics dominated by Type (C) trajectories for sufficiently large $\chi$ and $\gamma$. A Poincar\'e map that summarizes trajectories decomposed into the geodesic segments interrupted by specular reflections provides a powerful method for visualizing the transition to chaos. We then analyze the similarities and differences of the path to chaos for conical billiards with other area-preserving conservative maps.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics applied to the levitation of acoustically large objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many studies on acoustic radiation forces focus on characterizing the behavior of acoustic fields. However, the dynamic response of objects, particularly those larger than the wavelength, remains underexplored. Here we bridge this gap by deriving nonlinear equations of motion for a trapped spherical object under acoustic radiation forces and external excitation, where the Gorkov formulation fails to provide accurate results. Using Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy), we derive the corresponding nonlinear equation of motion from analytical time series data obtained through the Gorkov formulation and external excitation for acoustically small objects, and which recovers the governing equation with less than 0.05% error in coefficient values compared to the analytical solution.. We conduct experiments with the TinyLev levitator with external excitation to generate time series for acoustically large particles. Then, SINDy is applied to reconstruct governing equations from experimental data to see how external excitation amplitude influences the dynamics of acoustically large objects. Our findings demonstrate that the SINDy can effectively be used as a tool for deriving governing equations from complex data to improve and refine theoretical developments; in the present case, for acoustically large objects, where the Gorkov formulation fails to provide an accurate prediction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear science has evolved significantly over the 35 years since the launch of the journal Chaos. This Focus Issue, dedicated to the 80th Birthday of its founding editor-in-chief, David K. Campbell, brings together a selection of contributions on influential topics, many of which were advanced by Campbell's own research program and leadership role. The topics include new phenomena and method development in the realms of network dynamics, machine learning, quantum and material systems, chaos and fractals, localized states, and living systems, with a good balance of literature review, original contributions, and perspectives for future research.</description>

      <title>Using Dynamical Systems Theory to Quantify Complexity in Asymptotic Lenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous cellular automata (CCAs) have evolved from discrete lookup tables to continuous partial differential equation (PDE) formulations in the search for novel forms of complexity. Despite innovations in qualitative behavior, analytical methods have lagged behind, reinforcing the notion that emergent complexity defies simple explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the PDE formulation of Asymptotic Lenia enables rigorous analysis using dynamical systems theory. We apply the concepts of symmetries, attractors, Lyapunov exponents, and fractal dimensions to characterize complex behaviors mathematically. Our contributions include: (1) a mathematical explanation for the four distinct solution classes (solitons, rotators, periodic and chaotic patterns), (2) conditions for the existence of a global attractor with fractal dimension $&gt;4$, (3) identification of Kaplan-Yorke dimension as an effective complexity measure for CCAs, and (4) an efficient open-source implementation for calculating Lyapunov exponents and the covariant Lyapunov vectors for CCAs. We conclude by identifying the minimal set of properties that enable complex behavior in a broader class of CCAs. This framework provides a foundation for understanding and measuring complexity in artificial life systems.</description>

      <title>A class of 2 X 2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01514v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of 2x2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained finite sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present class of models, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2x2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues. Various generalizations and extensions are discussed including a simple modification that effectuates cross-over transitions between other classes of eigenvalue spacing statistics. The case of a cross-over transition between semi-Poisson and Ginibre spacing statistics is presented as a novel example.</description>

      <title>Chaos in Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature $(T_x, T_y)$ Nos\'e-Hoover Cell Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10863v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nos\'e-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners at $(x,y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)$ to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, grows nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy and follows a superquadratic power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, deviating from linear-response theory, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2}$. We compare this behavior to a quartic correction to the linear-response prediction and discuss both fits in light of their empirical and theoretical implications. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear dissipation scaling emerges naturally even in minimal driven systems. The approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension reveals a fractal attractor that concentrates as $|T_x - T_y|$ increases. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.</description>
