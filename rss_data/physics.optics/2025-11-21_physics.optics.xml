      <title>Near-Field Topology-Optimized Superchiral Metasurfaces for Enhanced Chiral Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and discrimination of molecular chirality are essential for advancing pharmaceutical and biological applications. While nanophotonic platforms offer a route to enhance chiral light-matter interactions, existing device concepts for chiral sensing remain heuristic, resulting in limited chiral enhancement and control over chiral hotspot placement within nanostructures. Here, we introduce an inverse-design framework that directly optimizes superchiral near fields in photonic nanostructures and demonstrate its powerful opportunities for enantioselective analysis. We first show that freeform achiral metasurfaces can be optimized to achieve an 800-fold chiral density enhancement, with fully customizable chiral hotspot placement for direct molecular interaction. We further demonstrate ultrasensitive detection of chiral analytes and achieve a 116-fold increase in detection sensitivity over the native enantiomeric response. Lastly, we extend our platform to determine chiral-molecule concentration and resolve enantiomeric excess in chiral mixtures. Our framework offers a generic route to enabling nanophotonic platforms for detecting chiral compounds and can be integrated with a broad range of spin-based photonic materials for applications in valleytronics, chiral emission control, and topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Design of Rectangular Waveguide-fed Metasurfaces for Near-Field Shaping using a Coupled Dipole Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design of rectangular waveguide-excited metasurfaces for near-field shaping using a coupled dipole framework. Waveguide-fed metasurfaces are array-like radiating systems typically constructed from one or more waveguides loaded with a series of subwavelength metamaterial apertures that function as radiators. The use of subwavelength radiating elements distributed across the aperture enables electromagnetic field control with subwavelength precision, offering significant potential for near-field shaping. Leveraging these capabilities, we demonstrate that the near-field patterns of rectangular waveguide-fed metasurfaces can be tailored using the coupled dipole model, which accounts for mutual interactions between metamaterial radiating elements. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach are verified through full-wave simulations and experiments in the X-band.</description>

      <title>Single-mode magnon-polariton lasing and amplification controlled by dissipative coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate single-mode lasing of magnon polaritons in a cavity magnonic system enabled by dissipative coupling between two passive modes, microwave cavity mode and magnon mode in a ferrimagnetic spin ensemble. The cavity mode is partially compensated through a feedback circuit, which reduces its linewidth but retains its dissipative nature. By tuning the compensation strength and dissipative coupling strength, we reach a system cooperativity of unity, marking the lasing threshold and the formation of a zero-linewidth polariton mode. This mode also corresponds to a perfect Friedrich-Wintgen bound state in the continuum. Further increase of the cooperativity drives the system into the strong dissipative coupling regime, where magnon polariton amplification arises between two real frequency scattering poles. These results reveal that dissipative coupling cooperativity carries a clear physical meaning and serves as a key parameter for controlling phase transitions. Dissipative coupling offers an alternative paradigm for tailoring light matter interactions, paving the way for advances in both information processing and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Understanding and improving axial detection in optical tweezers based on the interference of forward- and backward- scattered light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D position detection in optical tweezers (OT) is essential for quantitatively monitoring subtle variations in the mechanical properties of microscopic systems ranging from biomolecules to cells and colloids. Because standard OT configurations do not provide direct access to the axial position, axial detection typically relies on temporal fluctuations in forward-scattered optical power to infer the position of the particle. This approach generally assumes a linear-response regime in which the signal arises from the interference between the forward scattered and the nonscattered optical fields; however, under certain conditions, the backward-scattered contribution becomes non-negligible, leading to deviations from the linear response. Here, we present a simple yet comprehensive model for axial detection in standard OT while explicitly accounting for the backward-scattered field. Together with experimental validation, this framework neatly explains the standing-wave response observed when the backward-scattered field interferes with the nonscattered and the forward-scattered components, enabling accurate estimation of trap stiffness and particle diffusion under more general conditions. This work deepens our understanding of the phenomenology observed in real optical-tweezers measurements and extends their capabilities to conditions where standard approaches fail.</description>

      <title>End-to-end deep learning for superoscillatory subtraction imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking the diffraction limit in optical imaging is crucial for resolving subwavelength details in a wide range of applications, where superoscillatory imaging and subtraction imaging are two common strategies for surpassing conventional resolution limits. We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates superoscillatory focusing and subtraction imaging into a single jointly-optimized vectorial Debye integral neural network pipeline, eliminating the traditional two-step acquisition and manual weighting process. With this end-to-end neural network, we further improve the focusing capability of the system to the sub-100-nm regime, enabling deep-subwavelength imaging resolution.</description>

      <title>CoSP: Reconfigurable Multi-State Metamaterial Inverse Design via Contrastive Pretrained Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials, known for their ability to manipulate light at subwavelength scales, face significant design challenges due to their complex and sophisticated structures. Consequently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to streamline their design process. Reconfigurable multi-state metamaterials (RMMs) with adjustable parameters can switch their optical characteristics between different states upon external stimulation, leading to numerous applications. However, existing deep learning-based inverse design methods fall short in considering reconfigurability with multi-state switching. To address this challenge, we propose CoSP, an intelligent inverse design method based on contrastive pretrained large language model (LLM). By performing contrastive pretraining on multi-state spectrum, a well-trained spectrum encoder capable of understanding the spectrum is obtained, and it subsequently interacts with a pretrained LLM. This approach allows the model to preserve its linguistic capabilities while also comprehending Maxwell's Equations, enabling it to describe material structures with target optical properties in natural language. Our experiments demonstrate that CoSP can design corresponding thin-film metamaterial structures for arbitrary multi-state, multi-band optical responses, showing great potentials in the intelligent design of RMMs for versatile applications.</description>

      <title>Nanoelectromechanical spectral control of silicon bowtie nanocavities for quantum light sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of tunable waveguide-coupled silicon bowtie cavities with strong spatial electromagnetic field confinement. We use nanoelectromechanical in-plane actuation for the tuning, as this combines cryocompatibility with an ultralow power consumption. Our device leverages a mode volume below 0.2 cubic wavelengths in the material to reach theoretical Purcell factors above 6,500 and waveguide-coupling efficiency above 30% across the full experimentally measured spectral-tuning range of 11 nm. Notably, the Purcell factor in our cavity depends only weakly on the applied voltage. Our spectral measurements demonstrate reversible tuning of bowtie cavities, and we directly show the in-plane actuation using in-situ characterization in a scanning electron microscope. Our results constitute the first demonstration of a low-loss dielectric tunable bowtie nanocavity with strong light confinement. This solves a key issue for experiments on strong light-matter interactions for cavity quantum electrodynamics and scalable photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Optical Waveguide-Pair Design for CMOS-Compatible Hybrid III-V-on-Silicon Quantum Dot Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of compact, energy-efficient integrated lasers operating at 1.3 um remains a critical focus in silicon photonics, essential for advancing data communications and optical interconnect technologies. This paper presents a numerical study of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) hybrid III-V-on-silicon lasers, analyzing design trade-offs and optimization strategies based on supermode theory. The III-V section of the design incorporates InAs/(Al)GaAs quantum dots (QDs), which offer improved temperature insensitivity at the cost of more complex III-V/Si optical coupling, due to the high refractive index of (Al)GaAs. Consequently, many current laser designs rely on silicon waveguides with a thickness exceeding 220 nm, which helps coupling but limits their compatibility with standard CMOS technologies. To address this challenge, we perform detailed simulations focusing on 220-nm-thick silicon waveguides. We first examine how the mode profiles jointly depend on the silicon waveguide dimensions and the geometry and composition of the III-V stack. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel epitaxial design that enables effective III-V/Si coupling, with the optical mode strongly confined within the III-V waveguide in the gain section and efficiently transferred to the silicon waveguide in the passive sections. Moreover, the final design is shown to be robust to fabrication-induced deviations from nominal parameters.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Chirped Pulse Effects on Plasma Formation in Water Liquid Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of how linear chirp controls plasma density in a water jet using a two-stage framework. Stage I solves carrier-population and current equations at a single point, driven by a chirped super-Gaussian pulse. By fixing bandwidth and normalizing for intensity, we isolate a chirp-only response of plasma density, which exceeds unity and shows a consistent advantage for negative over positive chirp. Stage II propagates the field in water via the angular-spectrum method and applies the same equations across space. Normal dispersion reverses the trend: the chirp-only plasma density decreases as chirp grows, negative chirp remains less detrimental, and suppression is strongest for longer FTL pulses (e.g., 80 fs) due to dispersion-induced temporal spreading and spatio-temporal desynchronization. This study separates spectral-phase effects from bandwidth and intensity, yields testable predictions for water jets, and provides a foundation for future experiments and self-consistent propagation models.</description>

      <title>Mode-programmable comb spectroscopy enabling non-cooperative computational sensing with single-photon sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency comb spectroscopy provides broadband access to molecular fingerprints with mode-defined spectral resolution. However, its deployment in non-cooperative gas sensing remains challenging because conventional implementations require cooperative reflectors or well-controlled optical returns. Here, we overcome this limitation by introducing a computational sensing scheme based on a mode-programmable optical comb and a high-sensitivity single-pixel detector. In our approach, a two-dimensional disperser and a high-speed digital micromirror device encode individual comb modes, enabling broadband, mode-resolved spectral acquisition without relying on coherent detection. This architecture supports measurements through highly scattering media and from non-cooperative targets while retaining the core advantages of frequency-comb spectroscopy. Our method achieves picometer-level spectral resolution, a 10-nm (1.27-THz) instantaneous bandwidth, single-photon sensitivity down to 10^-4 photons per pulse, and compressed spectral acquisition with 2.5% sampling for &lt;10% reconstruction error. These capabilities establish a powerful platform for diverse gas-sensing applications, including remote environmental monitoring, industrial leak localization, and explosive-threat detection.</description>

      <title>Observation of nonlinear higher-order topological insulators with unconventional boundary truncations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), topologically nontrivial phases are usually associated with the shift of Wannier centers to topologically nontrivial positions on the edges of the unit cells, and the emergence of fractional spectral charges in the corners of the lattice upon its truncation that keeps the number of its unit cells integer. Here we propose theoretically and illustrate experimentally a different approach to the construction of HOTIs. This approach utilizes lattices with incomplete unit cells and achieves localized modes of topological origin across a broader parameter space. When truncation disrupts translational symmetry by cutting through the interior of multiple unit cells, boundary modes in our system emerge for both trivial and topologically nontrivial positions of the Wannier centers. We link these modes to the appearance of fractional Wannier centers. We also demonstrate that linear boundary states give rise to rich families of stable solitons bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity. Multiple types of thresholdless topological solitons with different internal symmetries are observed in waveguide arrays with triangular configurations featuring incomplete unit cells for any dimerization of waveguide spacings. Our results expand the family of HOTIs and pave the way for the observation of boundary states with different symmetries.</description>

      <title>Stable high-charge vortex dissipative solitons in azimuthally modulated waveguide arrays with localized gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and dynamical properties of vortex solitons in Kerr media supported by azimuthally modulated waveguide lattices with localized gain and nonlinear loss. In this dissipative system, we find that the accessible topological charge of vortex solitons is strongly determined by the number of waveguide channels, with higher-order charges requiring progressively larger arrays. Power curves of vortex solitons with different charges exhibit clear separation in large arrays but become less distinguishable in smaller ones. Furthermore, these robust vortex solitons can be excited with nearly vanishing power thresholds, and higher-charge vortices display enhanced propagation stability compared with lower-charge states. These findings expand the family of dissipative vortex solitons supported by waveguide lattices and provide a route to the realization of stable high-symmetry vortex states.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Attoclock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attoclock provides a powerful tool for studying ultrafast electron dynamics on the attosecond timescale. We demonstrate an all-optical terahertz (THz) attoclock that reconstructs electron dynamics during photoionization by detecting THz radiation emitted from gases ionized by the fundamental and second harmonic two-color laser fields, without the need for photoelectron detection. The polarization direction of the emitted THz field reflects the direction of the photoelectron drift velocity and thus encodes the effective delay. By measuring the THz waves from argon atoms ionized by the two-color fields, and by precisely controlling their relative phase and ellipticity, we observe intensity-dependent rotations of the THz polarization direction. Both experiment and time-dependent Schrodinger equation simulations reveal that the effective delay extracted from the THz polarization direction decreases with increasing laser intensity, consistent with conventional photoelectron attoclock results. Our experiment establishes the feasibility of the THz attoclock as a contactless probe of tunneling dynamics, with promising applications to condensed matter systems where photoelectron detection is impractical.</description>

      <title>Tunable integrated ring resonators by femtosecond laser micromachining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond Laser Micromachining (FLM) is a powerful technology for the fabrication of photonic devices. In this context, the integration of resonant elements within the platform represents a key advancement, enhancing both its versatility and its compatibility with a wide range of optical and fluidic components specifically enabled by this technique. Here, we report the realization of a tunable racetrack resonator fabricated by FLM and operating at telecom wavelengths. Leveraging low-loss waveguides, we obtained a Q factor of the resonator as high as 8 x 10^5 at critical coupling. Moreover, by integrating two thermo-optic phase shifters, we achieved both resonance tuning and dynamic control of the Q factor. This capability makes the device highly versatile for applications requiring dynamic spectral control, such as tunable filters, gyroscopes, and sensors.</description>

Abstract: Optical phased arrays (OPAs) are a promising technology for realizing fast and on-chip non-mechanical beam steering. In this work, we propose and analyze the performance of a non-uniformly spaced antenna arrangement based on the Fibonacci Spiral. A unique prime-number-based parameterization for antenna positioning and a tunable positional-control parameter ($\alpha$) are introduced. We show that, depending on the intended application of the OPA, by adjusting $\alpha$, we can achieve $\approx$ 56,562 resolvable points with 93 antennas arranged according to the prime-parametrization. To the best of our knowledge, this result exceeds the reported values in existing literature for comparable non-redundant array configurations. We analyze the robustness of this design by evaluating the sensitivities of the three key performance metrics of an OPA: side-lobe suppression ratio (SLSR), field of view (FoV), and the far-field full width at half-maximum (FWHM), to the random disturbances in antenna positions that may occur for practical implementation on a photonic chip.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-controlled high-speed tunable external cavity lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable lasers are essential for optical communication, spectroscopy, and precision sensing, where flexible and fast control of the laser wavelength is needed. However, conventional tunable laser systems often rely on mechanical actuation, which limits their tuning speed, stability, and repeatability. Alternative tuning methods, such as adjusting the temperature of the gain medium or the injection current, are either slow or suffer from unwanted coupling between frequency and intensity. Electro-optic modulators implemented after the laser offer fast frequency tunability but these components are bulky and prone to high insertion losses. Here, we introduce an external cavity semiconductor laser that achieves ultrafast frequency and amplitude tunability within a compact footprint without any moving parts. The laser employs a resonant electro-optic metasurface as the external mirror, providing narrowband feedback that enables simultaneous single-mode operation and voltage-controlled tuning across a wide range of currents. Leveraging a narrow linewidth design, we demonstrate mode-hop-free linear frequency tuning with rates of up to 70 THz/s, and frequency excursions reaching 110 MHz under a 10 V peak RF drive, clearly surpassing rates attainable through mechanical actuation. Moreover, by biasing the laser near its threshold, our platform enables intensity modulation with an efficiency above 100% at a peak voltage of 4 V. These results highlight the platform's potential for applications requiring high-speed and mode-hop-free tunable lasers, such as free-space optical communication, laser ranging, and high-resolution spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Chip-integrated Brillouin Saser Gyroscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip Brillouin laser gyroscopes harnessing opto-acoustic interaction are an emerging approach to detect rotation, due to their small footprint, excellent stability and low power consumption. However, previous implementations rely solely on optical readout, leaving the simultaneously generated saser (sound amplification by stimulated emission) undetected due to the lack of capability to access the acoustic output. Here, we propose a gyroscope based on saser detection using a suspension-free chip platform that supports low-loss confinement of both optical and acoustic modes. With experimental feasible parameter with optical and acoustic quality factors of 10^5 and 5000, respectively, sasers show significantly suppressed thermal and frequency noises, leading to gyroscope performance that outperforms its optical counterparts. We predict an angle random walk ~0.1 deg/sqrt(h) by saser gyroscope, while a conventional Brillouin laser gyroscope requires significantly higher pump power and optical quality factor to achieve comparable performance. Our work establishes the foundation for active phononic integrated circuits with Brillouin gain, opening avenues in inertial sensing, quantum transduction, and RF signal processing.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue-accelerated LDOS optimization of high-Q optical resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a new method that yields orders-of-magnitude acceleration in inverse design (e.g. topology optimization) of high-$Q$ resonant cavities to maximize the local density of states (LDOS), and which is also applicable to other resonant-response metrics. The key idea is that, once conventional LDOS optimization has identified a strong resonance, subsequent optimizations can exploit a fast shift-invert eigensolver to ensure that the LDOS remains centered at the resonance peak. We show that this eliminates ill-conditioning at sharp resonances that otherwise dramatically slows LDOS (and similar) optimization for $Q \gg 100$. Our method is demonstrated by design of $Q &gt; 10^6$ resonant cavities in 1d and 2d dielectric systems.</description>

      <title>A physics-inspired momentum-based gradient method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a nonlinear momentum method is introduced to improve the convergence performance of momentum-based gradient optimization algorithms. The method is motivated by the dynamics of non-Newtonian mechanical systems, where conventional momentum schemes can be interpreted as a dynamical model with quadratic kinetic energy and linear damping. Based on this analogy, a generalized optimization dynamics is constructed by extending the kinetic energy formulation and incorporating a nonlinear damping term. An anharmonic kinetic energy function can be employed to represent the inertial effect of accumulated gradient information during the iterations, while the nonlinear damping mechanism enables a more flexible control of the momentum contribution along the convergence trajectory. Numerical experiments indicate that the method exhibits faster convergence and higher robustness compared to classical momentum algorithms. Moreover, its strong performance on nonconvex objectives makes it particularly suitable for inverse photonic design problems. The results suggest that dynamical systems from physics can provide a view towards the development of efficient optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Strongly confined Mid-infrared to Terahertz Phonon Polaritons in Ultra-thin SrTiO3</title>

Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) enable subwavelength light control for infrared sensing, imaging, and optoelectronics, but conventional polar materials have narrow Reststrahlen bands, limiting applications. Materials that support PhPs with broad spectral range, strong field confinement, slow group velocity, and high quality factor are therefore needed. Here, using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we demonstrate that ultra-thin SrTiO3 membranes possess the desired properties. Systematic measurements across varying thicknesses reveal two PhP branches with wide spectral dispersion, strong confinement, and anomalously slow group velocities spanning from the mid-infrared to terahertz range. Notably, in 3-nm-thick membranes, these polaritons exhibit unprecedented confinement factors exceeding 500 and group velocities as low as ~ 7 x 10-5c, rivaling the best-performing van der Waals materials. These findings establish perovskite oxide such as SrTiO3 as versatile platforms for tailoring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing critical insights for the design of next-generation photonic devices requiring broadband operation and enhanced optical confinement.</description>

      <title>Generalized Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for Guided Resonances in Photonic Crystal Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a generalized non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formalism for guided resonances in photonic crystal slabs, derived directly from Maxwell's equations through a systematic guided-mode expansion. By expanding the electromagnetic fields over the complete mode basis of an unpatterned slab and systematically integrating out radiative Fabry--P\'erot channels, we obtain the analytical operator structure of the Hamiltonian, which treats guided-mode coupling and radiation losses on equal footing. The resulting Hamiltonian provides explicit expressions for both dispersive and radiative coupling terms in terms of modal overlap integrals and Fourier components of the permittivity modulation. For specific geometries, the Hamiltonian coefficients can be extracted from full-wave simulations enabling accurate modeling without phenomenological assumptions. As a case study, we investigate hexagonal lattices with both preserved and broken $C_6$ symmetry, demonstrating predictive agreement for complex band structures, near-field distributions, and far-field polarization patterns. In particular, the formalism reproduces symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) at the $\Gamma$ point, accidental off-$\Gamma$ BICs near the $\Gamma$ point, and the emergence of chiral exceptional points (EPs). It also captures the tunable behavior of eigenmodes near the $K$ point, including Dirac-point shifts and the emergence of quasi-BICs or bandgap openings, depending on the nature of $C_6$ symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate in the Appendix that the same formalism extends naturally to other symmetry classes, including $C_2$ (1D grating) and $C_4$ (square lattice) photonic crystal slabs. This approach enables predictive and efficient modeling of complex photonic resonances, revealing their topological and symmetry-protected characteristics in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable on-chip vortex beam generation via acoustically stimulated Brillouin nonlinear optical radiation</title>

Abstract: The integrated devices that generate structured optical fields with non-trivial orbital angular momentum (OAM) hold great potential for advanced optical applications, but are restricted to complex nanostructures and static functionalities. Here, we demonstrate a reconfigurable OAM beam generator from a simple microring resonator without requiring grating-like nanostructures. Our approach harnesses Brillouin interaction between confined phonon and optical modes, where the acoustic field is excited through microwave input. The phonon stimulate the conversion from a guided optical mode into a free-space vortex beam. Under the selection rule of the radiation, the OAM order of the emitted light is determined by the acousto-optic phase matching and is rapidly reconfigurable by simply tuning the microwave frequency. Furthermore, this all-microwave control scheme allows for the synthesis of arbitrary high-dimensional OAM superpositions by programming the amplitudes and phases of the driving fields. Analytical and numerical models predict a radiation efficiency over 25\% for experimentally feasible on-chip microcavities. This work introduces a novel paradigm for chip-to-free-space interfaces, replacing fixed nanophotonic structures with programmable acousto-optic interactions for versatile structured light generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the topology of spatiotemporal media poses a fundamental challenge: their remarkable properties stem from breaking spatial and temporal symmetries, yet this same breaking obscures their topological characterization. Here, we show that space-time symmetries persist in crystals with travelling-wave modulation, enabling the study of their topological properties and the prediction of spatiotemporal interface states. Using a Lorentz transformation to the frame comoving with the modulation, we identify a conserved joint parity-time-reversal symmetry in the new variables that enforces the quantization of the Zak phase, elevating it to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant. We then calculate the associated interface states and uncover unique features arising from time-varying effects, including selective directional excitation, propagation along moving boundaries, frequency-converted replicas, and broadband amplification even in the absence of momentum gaps.</description>

Abstract: Optogenetics has emerged as a powerful tool for disease modeling, enabling precise control of cellular activities through light stimulation and providing a valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Innovative materials and technologies such as micro-LEDs, optical fibers and micro/nano probes have been developed to allow precise spatial and temporal control of light delivery to target cells. Recent advances in 3D printing have further enhanced optogenetic applications by enabling the fabrication of implantable, customizable, and miniaturized light stimulation systems with high spatial resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of a 3D printed light delivery system for brain organoid stimulation exploring the capabilities of projection microstereolithography (P$\mu$SL). We characterized the optical properties of the high-resolution acrylate-based 3D print resin, i.e., refractive index and extinction coefficient, to evaluate if the light transmission efficiency might limit the performance of the optogenetic stimulation systems. Finite element method simulations were employed to optimize the 3D printed design. An optogenetic setup was developed for optimal light delivery, and initial tests with optogenetically modified cells showed light-induced dopamine release with a stimulation efficiency of 2.8\%, confirming the 3D printed waveguide functionality and guiding future optimization. Our results demonstrate that this light stimulation tool offers strong potential for advancing customizable optogenetic applications.</description>

      <title>A modified recursive transfer matrix algorithm for radiation and scattering computation of a multilayer sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems of multilayered spheres, reviewing the history of the Lorentz-Mie theory and the numerical stability issues encountered in handling multilayered spheres. By combining recursive methods with the transfer matrix method, we propose a modified transfer matrix algorithm designed for the stable and efficient calculation of electromagnetic scattering coefficients of multilayered spheres. The new algorithm simplifies the recursive formulas by introducing Debye potentials and logarithmic derivatives, effectively avoiding numerical overflow issues associated with Bessel functions under large complex variables. Moreover, by adopting a hybrid recursive strategy, this algorithm can resolve the singularity problem associated with logarithmic derivatives in previous algorithms. Numerical test results demonstrate that this algorithm offers superior stability and applicability when dealing with complex cases such as thin shells and strongly absorbing media.</description>

      <title>Compactifying linear optical unitaries using multiport beamsplitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any $N$-dimensional unitary matrix can be realized using a finite sequence of concatenated identical fixed multiport beamsplitters (MBSs) and phase shifters (PSs). Our construction is based on a Lie group theorem applied to existing decompositions. Using the Bell-Walmsley-Clements framework, we prove that any $N$-dimensional unitary requires $N+2$ phase masks, $N-1$ fixed MBSs, and $N-1$ BSs. Our scheme requires only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ fixed, identical components (MBSs and BSs) compared to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ fixed BSs required by conventional schemes (e.g., Clements), all while keeping the same number of PSs. Experimentally, these MBS can be realized as a monolithic element via femtosecond laser writing, offering superior performance through reduced insertion losses. As an application, we present a reconfigurable linear optical circuit that implements a three-dimensional unitary emerging in the unambiguous discrimination of two nonorthogonal qubit states.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Jaynes-Cummings model with time-dependent coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model stands as a fully quantized, fundamental framework for exploring light-matter interactions, a timely reflection on a century of quantum theory. The time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (TDJC) model introduces temporal variations in certain parameters, which often require numerical methods. However, under the resonance condition, exact solutions can be obtained, offering insight into a variety of physical scenarios. In this work, we study the resonant TDJC model considering different modulations of the atom-field coupling. The model is presented and an analytical solution derived in a didactic way, allowing us to examine how time-dependent couplings affect atomic population inversion and atom-field entanglement. We also consider an atom traversing a partially cooled cavity, which induces periodicity and reveals the combined effects of atomic motion and thermal fluctuations. The Bloch vector is used to analyze the dynamics of the system, including the atomic state purity, and reveals phenomena such as atomic dipole alignment with the field due to the oscillating coupling, as well as atomic population trapping, which arises by increasing the initial mean thermal photon number.</description>
