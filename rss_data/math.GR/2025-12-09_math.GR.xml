      <title>The Hurwitz existence problem and the prime-degree conjecture: A computational perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06545v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Hurwitz existence problem from a computational viewpoint. Leveraging the symmetric-group algorithm by Zheng and building upon implementations originally developed by Baroni, we achieve a complete and non-redundant enumeration of all non-realizable partition triples for positive integers up to $31$. These results are further categorized into four types according to their underlying mathematical structure; it is observed that nearly nine-tenths of them can be explained by known theoretical results. As an application, we verify the prime-degree conjecture for all primes less than $32$. In light of the exponential memory growth inherent in existing computational approaches -- which limits their feasibility at higher degrees -- we propose a novel software architecture designed to stabilize memory usage, thereby facilitating further detection of exceptional cases in the Hurwitz existence problem. The complete dataset of non-realizable partition triples, along with our implementation, will been made public on GitHub.</description>

      <title>The Lipschitz Liouville Property, Affine Rigidity, and Coarse Harmonic Coordinates on Groups of Polynomial Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantitative theory of Lipschitz harmonic functions (LHF) on finitely generated groups, with emphasis on the Lipschitz Liouville property, affine rigidity, and quasi-isometric invariance for groups of polynomial growth. On finitely generated nilpotent groups we prove an affine rigidity theorem: for any adapted, smooth, Abelian-centered probability measure $\mu$, every Lipschitz $\mu$-harmonic function is affine, $f(x)=c+\varphi([x])$. For any finite generating set $S$ this yields a canonical isometric identification $$
  \mathrm{LHF}(G,\mu)/\mathbb{C} \cong \mathrm{Hom}(G_{\mathrm{ab}},\mathbb{C}),\qquad
  \|\nabla_S f\|_\infty=\max_{s\in S}|\varphi([s])|, $$ independent of the choice of centered measure. Next, for any finite-index subgroup $H\le G$ and adapted smooth $\mu$ we prove a quantitative induction-restriction principle: restriction along $H$ and an explicit averaging operator give a linear isomorphism $\mathrm{LHF}(G,\mu)\cong\mathrm{LHF}(H,\mu_H)$, where $\mu_H$ is the hitting measure, with two-sided control of the Lipschitz seminorms. For groups of polynomial growth equipped with SAS measures we then show that $\mathrm{LHF}$ is a quasi-isometry invariant, and use this to construct coarse harmonic coordinates that straighten quasi-isometries up to bounded error. Finally, within the Lyons-Sullivan / Ballmann-Polymerakis discretization framework, we prove a quantitative discrete-to-continuous extension theorem: Lipschitz harmonic data on an orbit extend to globally Lipschitz $L$-harmonic functions on the ambient manifold, with gradient bounds controlled by the background geometry.</description>

      <title>A toolbox for left-orders of low complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores how concepts of formal language theory can be used to study left-orderable groups. It analyses the languages formed by their positive cones and demonstrates how the abstract families of languages (AFLs) in the Chomsky hierarchy (in particular regular and context-free languages) interact with core group-theoretic constructions under subgroups, extensions, finite generation and taking direct products with $\mathbb{Z}$. These investigations yield new insights into the interplay between decidability and geometry in group theory.
  Some results which may be improvements to the existing literature are included in the thesis. There is a classification of the complexity of positive cones of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, a more constructive proof on finding regular positive cone languages of language-convex subgroups compared to a result of Su (2020), a construction of countably infinite many regular positive cones of $\mathrm{BS}(1,q)$ for $q \geq -1$ which are all automorphic to each other extending a result of Antol\'in, Rivas, and Su (2022), and a construction of positive cones with finite generating set for groups of the form $F_{2n} \times \mathbb{Z}$ extending a result of Malicet, Mann, Rivas, and Triestino (2019).</description>

      <title>A new generalization of the McKay conjecture for $p$-solvable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07073v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite $p$-solvable group $G$, where $p$ is a prime. Using a normal $p$-series $\mathcal{N}$ of $G$, we introduce the notion of $(\mathcal{N},p)$-stable characters and prove that $G$ and ${\bf N}_G(P)$ have equal numbers of such characters, which gives a new generalization of the McKay conjecture for $p$-solvable groups. Also, we establish a canonical bijection between these characters in the case where $G$ has odd order. Our proofs depend heavily on the theory of self-stabilizing pairs founded by M. L. Lewis, as well as some results of $\pi$-special characters due to I. M. Isaacs.</description>

      <title>Decidability of equations and first-order theory in Seifert 3-manifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [arXiv:1405.6274, Question 5.2 &amp; Question 5.3] Aschenbrenner, Friedl and Wilton ask: (1) Is the equation problem solvable for the fundamental group of any $3$-manifold? and (2) Is the first-order theory of the fundamental group of any $3$-manifold decidable? In this paper we answer both of these questions by proving that Hilbert's tenth problem over the integers can be encoded in equations over any non-virtually abelian fundamental group of any Seifert fibered 3-manifold whose orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. We use this to show that the equation problem (and hence also the first-order theory) is undecidable in this infinite family of $3$-manifold groups and then apply it to classify the Seifert 3-manifold groups with decidable equation problems and decidable first-order theories, in the case that the orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. In contrast, we show that for this class of Seifert 3-manifold groups the single equation problem is decidable. For every Seifert 3-manifold group $G$ where the orbifold has negative Euler characteristic we show that either $G$ has decidable equation problem or $G$ has a finite index subgroup of index $2$ that has decidable equation problem. These negative Euler characteristic results follow from work of Liang on central extensions of hyperbolic groups. We also discuss why Liang's results do not suffice to deal with all the negative Euler characteristic cases. We show how to construct several other infinite families of $3$-manifold groups with undecidable equation problem (and hence also undecidable first-order theory) including examples that are not Seifert manifold groups and examples that are not virtually nilpotent. In addition, we observe that there are numerous other infinite families for which the first-order theory is undecidable such as fundamental groups of manifolds modeled on 3-dimensional Sol geometry.</description>

      <title>Normal closure of finite subgroups of $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ and $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $n\geq 3$, let $G$ be a nontrivial finite subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ with $|G|$ not a power of $2$. We prove that the normal closure $N(G)$ is $\mathrm{SAut}(F_n)$ if $G\subset\mathrm{SAut}(F_n)$ and $N(G)$ is $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$ otherwise. When $|G|$ is a power of $2$, we have a partial theorem. Similarly, let $G'$ be a nontrivial finite subgroup of $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ with $|G'|$ not a power of $2$. Then the normal closure $N(G')$ is $\mathrm{SOut}(F_n)$ if $G'\subset\mathrm{SOut}(F_n)$ and $N(G')$ is $\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ otherwise. When $|G'|$ is a power of $2$, we have a partial theorem as well.</description>

      <title>On stable equivalences of Morita type with twisted diagonal vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof, by using simplified terminology and notation, to a result of Puig stating that if a bimodule of two block algebras of finite groups over an algebraically closed field induces a stable equivalence of Morita type and has a twisted diagonal vertex, then it has an endopermutation module as a source. We also extend this result to arbitrary fields under a mild assumption.</description>

      <title>Left regular bands with symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The representation theory of left regular band semigroup algebras is well-studied and known to have close connections with combinatorial topology, as established in the work of Margolis--Saliola--Steinberg ('15, '21). In this paper, we investigate the representation theory of the invariant subalgebras of left regular band semigroup algebras carrying the action of a finite group through the lens of group-equivariant combinatorial topology.
  We characterize when the invariant subalgebra is semisimple or commutative and examine the equivariant structure of the Peirce components of the semigroup algebra. For CW left regular bands, we interpret these Peirce components in terms of the equivariant topology of intervals in the support semilattice, yielding the Cartan invariants of the invariant subalgebras of left regular bands associated to CAT(0)-cube complexes. We also give a topological formula for the Peirce components for left regular bands with hereditary algebras. Finally, in specializing to left regular bands associated to geometric lattices, we explore generalizations of the Desarm\'{e}ni\'{e}n--Wachs derangement representation and their connections to Markov chains.</description>

      <title>On $\pi_1$-injectivity of self-maps in low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that all self-maps of non-zero degree of $3$-manifolds not covered by $S^3$ and of Thurston geometric $4$-manifolds and their connected sums not covered by $N\#(\#_{p\geq0}S^2\times S^2)\#(\#_{q\geq0}\mathbb C P^2)$, where $N$ is an $S^2\times\mathbb X^2$ or $S^3\times\mathbb R$ manifold, are $\pi_1$-injective. We thus determine when these maps induce $\pi_1$-isomorphisms. The results in dimension three were previously established by Shicheng Wang. We give a uniform group theoretic proof in all cases based only on the residual finiteness of the fundamental groups for the $\pi_1$-injectivity and then only on numerical invariants for the $\pi_1$-isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Alperin's weight conjecture, Galois automorphisms, alternating sums, and functorial equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that functorial equivalences can offer new insight into the blockwise Galois Alperin weight conjecture (BGAWC). Inspired by Kn\"orr and Robinson's work, we first formulate the BGAWC in terms of alternating sums indexed by chains of $p$-subgroups, and we also give a functorial reformulation in the Grothendieck group of diagonal $p$-permutation functors. We prove that these formulations are equivalent. We further show that if a functorial equivalence between a block with abelian defect group and its Brauer correspondent descends to the minimal field of the block, then the BGAWC holds for that block. Finally, we prove that Galois conjugate blocks are functorially equivalent over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>Expansivity of algebraic semigroup actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a semigroup $S$ and a right $\mathbb{Z}[S]$-submodule $J\leq \mathbb{Z}[S]^n$, we study expansivity of the algebraic action of $S$ induced on the Pontryagin dual of $\mathbb{Z}[S]^n/J$. We completely determine the class of semigroups for which expansivity of this action is characterized by the triviality of $J^\perp$, in terms of the existence of a finite subset $K\subseteq S$ such that $S=KS$. This condition is satisfied in particular by every monoid, and more generally by every semigroup with a left unital convolution Banach algebra, in which case we are able to extend the characterization of expansivity in terms of an invertibility condition when $J$ is finitely generated. We also exhibit examples of non-unital semigroups satisfying the hypotheses of our results.</description>

      <title>Quantitative indistinguishability and sparse and dense clusters in factor of IID percolations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chifan-Ioana (2010) implies that, for any factor of IID percolation on any nonamenable Cayley graph $G$, there is a countable set of (strong) indistinguishability classes for non-hyperfinite clusters. We introduce quantitative strengthenings, called (qI) and (qSI): for $\eta$-non-hyperfinite clusters, there are at most $M(G,\eta)&lt;\infty$ (strong) indistinguishability classes, for any FIID percolation.
  We first show that (qI) and (qSI) for any $G$ are equivalent to the ``sparse implies thin'' property (SiT): any FIID percolation with $\eta$-non-hyperfinite clusters has density at least $c(G,\eta)&gt;0$. Also, (SiT) is independent of the finite generating set of a group. We prove, using entropy inequalities, that (SiT) holds for free groups, even for weak FIIDs. On the other hand, recent work of Jard\'on-S\'anchez, Mellick, Poulin, and Wr\'obel implies that (SiT) fails for weak FIIDs on non-exact, i.e., not property (A) groups.
  Furthermore, (SiT) implies that the Bernoulli graphing over any non-hyperfinite FIID cluster is strongly ergodic, and that indistinguishability for non-hyperfinite FIID clusters is equivalent to strong indistinguishability. These results follow from the work of Chifan-Ioana for every nonamenable Cayley graph, but with non-probabilistic proofs.
  We also prove, again using entropy inequalities, this time for all nonamenable Cayley graphs, that any FIID percolation with high enough expected degree must have a density close to 1, and there must be a single indistinguishability class of such clusters. On Kazhdan groups, there must be a single such cluster.
  Our results have finite counterparts: in any large girth $d$-regular graph sequence, any FIID subgraph of average degree at least $2+\delta$ must have density at least $c(d,\delta)&gt;0$. In the uniform random d-regular graph $G_{n,d}$, this holds for every subgraph of average degree at least $2+\delta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a criterion on pairs $(G,S)$ - where $G$ is a virtually $s$-step nilpotent group and $S$ is a finite generating set - saying whether the geodesic growth is exponential or strictly sub-exponential. Whenever $s=1,2$, this goes further and we prove the geodesic growth is either exponential or polynomial. For $s\ge 3$ however, intermediate growth is possible. We provide an example of virtually $3$-step nilpotent group for which $\gamma_{\mathrm{geod}}(n) \asymp \exp\!\big(n^{3/5}\cdot \log(n)\big)$. This is the first known example of group with intermediate geodesic growth. Along the way, we prove results on the geometry of virtually nilpotent groups, including asymptotics with error terms for their volume growth.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every right-angled Coxeter group (RACG) is profinitely rigid amongst all Coxeter groups. On the other hand we exhibit RACGs which have infinite profinite genus amongst all finitely generated residually finite groups. We also establish profinite rigidity results for graph products of finite groups. Along the way we prove that the Higman-Thompson groups $V_{n}$ are generated by $4$ involutions, generalising a classical result of Higman for Thompson's group $V$.</description>

Abstract: In this research we continue our previous investigation of wreath product normal structure \cite{SkuESL}. We generalize the group of unimodular matrices \cite{Amit} and find its structure. For this goal we propose one extension of the special linear group. Groups generated by three involutions, two of which are permutable, have long been of interest in the theory of matrix groups \cite{Maz}, for instance such generating set was researched for $S{{L}_{2}}({{\mathbb{Z}+ i\mathbb{Z}}})$. But for size of matrix 3 on 3 this is imposable for some groups. We research this question for $ES{{L}_{3}}({{\mathbb{Z}}})$. An analytical formula of root in $SL(3, \mathbb{Z}$) is found, recursive formula for $n$-th power root in $SL(2, \mathbb{Z}$) is found too.</description>

      <title>A computable version of Hall's Harem Theorem and Geometric von Neumann Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.06304v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a computable version of the Hall Harem Theorem where the matching realizes a unary function with controlled sizes of cycles. We apply it to non-amenable computable coarse spaces. As a result, we obtain a computable version of the geometric von Neumann conjecture.</description>

      <title>Lifting Brauer indecomposability of a Scott module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is proven that if a finite group $G$ has a normal subgroup $H$ with $p'$-index (where $p$ is a prime) and $G/H$ is solvable, then for a $p$-subgroup $P$ of $H$, if the Scott $kH$-module with vertex $P$ is Brauer indecomposable, then so is the Scott $kG$-module with vertex $P$, where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. This has several applications.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Orbit Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of orbit equivalence to the non-commutative setting by introducing a new equivalence relation on groups, which we call von Neumann orbit equivalence (vNOE). We prove the stability of this equivalence relation under taking free products and graph products of groups. To achieve this, we introduce von Neumann orbit equivalence of tracial von Neumann algebras, show that two countable discrete groups $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$ are vNOE if and only if the corresponding group von Neumann algebras $L\Gamma$ and $L\Lambda$ are vNOE, and that vNOE of tracial von Neumann algebras is stable under taking free products and graph products of tracial von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of Zalcman's Lemma on Complex Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zalcman's Lemma makes significant applications in normal families, complex dynamics and related problems in complex analysis. In the present paper, we are devoted to generalizing the classical Zalcman's lemma to complex Lie groups by means of exponential mappings defined by holomorphic one-parameter subgroups.</description>
