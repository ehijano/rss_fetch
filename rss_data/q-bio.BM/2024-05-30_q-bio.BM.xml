      <title>Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification for Anaerobic Digestion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical for ensuring adequate predictive power of computational models used in biology. Focusing on two anaerobic digestion models, this article introduces a novel generalized Bayesian procedure, called VarBUQ, ensuring a correct tradeoff between flexibility and computational cost. A benchmark against three existing methods (Fisher's information, bootstrapping and Beale's criteria) was conducted using synthetic data. This Bayesian procedure offered a good compromise between fitting ability and confidence estimation, while the other methods proved to be repeatedly overconfident. The method's performances notably benefitted from inductive bias brought by the prior distribution, although it requires careful construction. This article advocates for more systematic consideration of uncertainty for anaerobic digestion models and showcases a new, computationally efficient Bayesian method. To facilitate future implementations, a Python package called 'aduq' is made available.</description>

      <title>Representing Molecules as Random Walks Over Interpretable Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research in molecular discovery has primarily been devoted to small, drug-like molecules, leaving many similarly important applications in material design without adequate technology. These applications often rely on more complex molecular structures with fewer examples that are carefully designed using known substructures. We propose a data-efficient and interpretable model for representing and reasoning over such molecules in terms of graph grammars that explicitly describe the hierarchical design space featuring motifs to be the design basis. We present a novel representation in the form of random walks over the design space, which facilitates both molecule generation and property prediction. We demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods in terms of performance, efficiency, and synthesizability of predicted molecules, and we provide detailed insights into the method's chemical interpretability.</description>
