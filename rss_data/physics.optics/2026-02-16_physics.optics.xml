      <title>Image-based investigation of the zebrafish developmental process using in vivo dynamic and multi-contrast optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate in vivo dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) imaging of zebrafish development from 2 weeks to 12 months post-fertilization, integrated with polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA), and histological validation. Two DOCT algorithms were utilized: logarithmic intensity variance and late OCT correlation decay speed, which characterize the occupancy of dynamic scatterers and their motion speeds, respectively. Our results show that skin stripes exhibit high DOCT signals and it varies among the pigment-cell types. Furthermore, the combination of DOCT and PS-OCT captures the maturation of these stripes. In addition, DOCT and OCTA successfully visualized the developmental progression of blood and lymphatic vessels, as well as spinal tissues.</description>

      <title>Torus-Projected Electromagnetic Wormholes Enabled by Anisotropic Singularity Reconstruction of Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformation optics uses coordinate mappings to emulate curved geometries and control electromagnetic fields. However, existing approaches primarily focus on geometric deformation while offering limited control over the global topology of the resulting optical space. Here we introduce a torus projection combined with a conformal mapping to construct a wormhole-like virtual optical geometry, providing a controllable route to manipulate optical-space topology within transformation optics. By tuning a single torus parameter, the virtual-space refractive index switches between isotropic and anisotropic forms, transforming point-like singularities in a disconnected geometry into extended transport channels that connect the optical space. This topology transition manifests as the opening or closure of an electromagnetic wormhole and is accompanied by pronounced changes in ray dynamics and cavity modes. Our results demonstrate how refractive-index anisotropy governs singularity structure and topology in transformation optics, providing a route to photonic systems with tunable optical geometry and connectivity.</description>

      <title>The Refractive Index of Gallium Antimonide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium antimonide (GaSb) is a key material for near- and mid-infrared photonics, enabling high-performance laser architectures and detectors. Design and simulation of such devices depend on accurate optical material data, especially the complex refractive index $n^*_{\text{GaSb}} = n_{\text{GaSb}} +ik_{\text{GaSb}}$, consisting of the real part $n_{\text{GaSb}}$ (refractive index) and the imaginary part $k_{\text{GaSb}}$ (extinction coefficient). However, GaSb refractive index values are based either on theoretical models, typically informed by legacy experimental data, or on experimental measurements without quantified uncertainties. This limits their reliability for state-of-the-art devices. Here, we present measurement results of $n^*_{\text{GaSb}}$ in the near- to mid-infrared range from \SIrange{1}{3.1}{\micro \metre} with a relative uncertainty &lt;\num{7.8e-5} for $n_{\text{GaSb}}$, and &lt;\num{2.0e-3} for $k_{\text{GaSb}}$. As a side result of our method, we also report $n_{\text{AlAsSb}}$ for aluminium arsenide antimonide ($\mathrm{AlAs_{0.08}Sb_{0.92}}$) with a relative uncertainty &lt;\num{3.9e-4}. Our results are based on two complementary measurements on a GaSb/AlAsSb-based heteroepitaxial structure under controlled environmental conditions: photometric transmission and layer-thickness analysis by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy. We simultaneously retrieve the refractive indices of the two materials by fitting a Sellmeier equation and a theoretical dispersion model by Djuri\v{s}i\'c \textit{et al.}~\cite{djurisic_modeling_2000}. The uncertainties of $n^*_{\text{GaSb}}$ and $n_{\text{AlAsSb}}$ are quantified using a Monte Carlo-based approach. Our results provide accurate complex refractive index values for GaSb, which are vital to advance photonics-related technologies in the near- and mid infrared spectral region.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Multiplexed Bloch Surface Wave Sensing of Single-Strand DNA Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractometric biosensing is a vital label-free tool for the real time detection and interaction analysis of biological and chemical substances. Nanophotonic platforms like Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) have played a critical role in providing refractometric sensing capabilities for clinical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. However, traditional systems operating in a single-polarization state cannot fully characterize complex optical properties such as birefringence, which is crucial to resolve many complex biological interactions. Although Bloch Surface Wave (BSW) sensors can support both TE and TM modes, a key capability SPR lacks, they have historically been implemented in single-mode configurations. In this paper, we present a polarization multiplexed BSW refractometric sensing system, simultaneously tracking the resonant wavelength shifts of both TE and TM BSW modes through time. Our technique was applied to investigate single-strand DNA growth during rolling circle amplification (RCA). To accurately recover the time-dependent birefringence, capturing dynamics of the DNA growth and orientation of its chains, we implemented a two-stage modeling approach based on the TMM. First, we utilized a wavelength-dependent surface sensitivity model, confining refractive index changes to the immediate layer above the crystal, to distinguish isotropic background dynamics from birefringent signals. Following the onset of RCA, we transitioned to a model that accounted for the vertical growth of the DNA layers in time. By fitting this model to the TE and TM resonant shifts, we monitor the growth rate of the single-strand DNA layer as well as the refractive index along the two polarization components. Our findings demonstrate the platform's ability to resolve the structural evolution of complex bimolecular interactions associated with conformational changes.</description>

      <title>Polariton-mediated binding of anti-aligned dipolar excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting bosonic quasiparticles are the cornerstone for exploring many-body physics and nonlinear quantum phenomena in correlated light-matter systems. Strongly interacting dipolar excitons in van der Waals heterostructures have attracted significant interest due to their out-of-plane electric dipole moments and high tunability via the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE). However, leveraging these tunable dipolar excitons in strongly coupled exciton-photon systems to explore exotic many-body physics and macroscopic quantum phenomena remains experimentally elusive. Here, we report the strong coupling of dipolar excitons in a gated bilayer MoS2 device integrated with a one-dimensional photonic crystal hosting bound-states-in-continuum (BIC). The resulting polaritons hybridize cavity photons with a coherent superposition of two electrically tunable anti-aligned dipolar excitons, effectively binding them into composite quasiparticle states. By tuning the dipolar excitons into non-degenerate states via the QCSE, we realize in situ reconfiguration of the polariton wavefunction and observe an emergent polariton branch exhibiting non-monotonic Stark shifts. Notably, these tunable polaritons allow for customized control over nonlinear interactions through distinct excitonic hybridization and dipolar configurations. This in situ tunability offers a scalable pathway toward electrically programmable quantum fluids of light and correlated polariton phases in on-chip photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Femtosecond Laser and Ion-Implantation Processing for Controlled, Deep, High-Efficiency Ablation in Fused Silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser modification of fused silica enables precise surface tailoring for the fabrication of micro-optical components such as microlenses and diffractive elements. However, the process is governed by laser-matter interactions where the local fluence determines the processing depth, often limiting control over feature geometry and efficiency. Here, we present a hybrid approach combining localized Au implantation (1.8 MeV Au2+ ions) into SiO2 samples with femtosecond laser irradiation (250 fs), effectively tuning the laser-matter interaction and resulting morphology. At both 515 nm and 1030 nm irradiation wavelengths, single-shot femtosecond pulses produce cylindrical craters with sharp edges and flat-bottom profiles. Independently of the fluence, these craters exhibit a constant depth of 550 nm, corresponding to the region of maximum Au concentration. The effect manifests already at moderate fluence (app. 4 J/sq.cm) and yields high ablation efficiency, up to 15 cubic micrometers per microjoule. The hybrid method also works effectively at lower implantation doses that preserve the excellent transmission of fused silica, offering a promising pathway for the high-quality fabrication of flat optical components such as binary phase masks, phase lenses, or fused-silica micromolds.</description>

      <title>Towards Trapped-Ion Thermometry Using Cavity-Based EIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a technique for measuring ion temperature using cavity-based electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) applicable for cavity-qed systems in the strong coupling regime. This method enables efficient extraction of the ion's phonon occupation number following sub-Doppler cooling close to the motional ground state. The proposed method relies on monitoring the cavity probe transmission while scanning the probe laser frequency once cavity EIT is established using the control beam, significantly simplifying the measurement procedure. We theoretically establish a model that demonstrates influence of thermal state of the trapped ion vis a vis the EIT linewidth measured. We show how the cavity EIT transmission may be used as a thermometry tool to deduce the ion temperature as well as the motional state for an ion in the sub-Doppler cooling regime. The current method can only be used for operation in the resolved-sideband regime, where individual motional states can be selectively addressed for all relevant transitions either by selecting appropriate energy levels for the three-level system or by employing strong confinement with high secular frequencies ($\sim 10 MHz$).</description>

      <title>Subcycle videography of lightwave-driven Landau-Zener-Majorana transitions in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong light fields have unlocked previously unthinkable possibilities to tailor coherent electron trajectories, engineer band structures and shape emergent phases of matter all-optically. Unravelling the underlying quantum mechanisms requires a visualisation of the lightwave-driven electron motion directly in the band structure. While photoelectron momentum microscopy has imaged optically excited electrons averaged over many cycles of light, actual subcycle band-structure videography has been limited to small electron momenta. Yet lightwave-driven elementary processes in quantum materials often occur throughout momentum space. Here, we introduce attosecond-precision, subcycle band-structure videography covering the entire first Brillouin zone (BZ) and visualize one of the most fundamental but notoriously elusive strong-field processes: non-adiabatic Landau-Zener-Majorana (LZM) tunnelling. The interplay of field-driven acceleration within the Dirac-like band structure of graphene and periodic LZM interband tunnelling manifest in a coherent displacement and distortion of the momentum distribution at the BZ edge. The extremely non-thermal electron distributions also allow us to disentangle competing scattering processes and assess their impact on coherent electronic control through electron redistribution and thermalization. Our panoramic view of strong-field-driven electron motion in quantum materials lays the foundation for a microscopic understanding of some of the most discussed light-driven phenomena in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Optical Thermodynamics Beyond the Weak Nonlinearity Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical thermodynamics has recently emerged as a theoretical framework describing a Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) modal power distribution of multimoded nonlinear photonic circuits. However, its applicability is constrained to systems exhibiting weak nonlinear mode-mode interactions. Here, by employing a Transfer Integral Operator, we circumvent this limitation and establish a steady-state interacting RJ modal distribution -- referred to as non-ideal RJ (NIRJ) -- with renormalized temperature and optical chemical potential. This also builds a natural bridge with earlier work on grand-canonical statistical-mechanical formulations of discrete nonlinear systems. The theory derives the optical analogue of the compressibility factor, which controls the transition from an ideal, non-interacting equation of state (EoS) to a van der Waals-like interacting EoS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an absorption imaging technique for ultracold gases that suppresses interference fringes and coherence-induced artifacts by reducing the transverse spatial coherence of the imaging light. The method preserves the narrow spectral bandwidth required for resonant absorption imaging and is implemented as a modular extension to standard imaging setups using a rotating diffuser. We demonstrate tunability of the illumination light's coherence without modifying the imaging optics. Using this approach, we achieve reliable imaging of ultracold atomic clouds in micron-scale proximity to complex surfaces, where standing waves, edge diffraction, and speckle severely limit conventional absorption imaging.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Multijunction Solar Cells Toward the Multicolor Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and other van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors enable transfer-printed, lattice-mismatch-free stacking of many photovoltaic junctions (N), motivating a re-examination of multijunction detailed-balance limits under realistic material and optical constraints. Here we develop an unlimited-junction detailed-balance framework for split-spectrum, multi-terminal vdW multijunction solar cells and apply it to a conservative TMD bandgap window (1.0-2.1 eV). Dynamic-programming optimization shows that the accessible bandgap window imposes a large-N efficiency limit: under full concentration, unconstrained ladders approach 84.5% at N=50, whereas the TMD window plateaus near 63.4%. This plateau is set by photons outside the gaps, so radiative quality and optics dominate beyond five junctions for realistic transfer-printed stacks. We identify an experimentally achievable N=5 ladder Eg~(2.10,1.78,1.50,1.24, and 1.00) eV and map each rung to candidate vdW and TMD absorbers. Using reciprocity and luminescence thermodynamics, we quantify penalties from finite external radiative efficiency, two-sided emission, and luminescent coupling, and introduce the upward-emitted luminescence power as a computable entropy-loss proxy. Incorporating excitonic absorptance and nanophotonic thickness bounds yields practical thickness and light-management targets for transfer-printed stacks. Finally, inserting an idealized nonreciprocal multijunction model into the reciprocity-optimized ladders provides conservative efficiency gain estimates, consistent with negligible benefit for single junctions but measurable gains for multijunction TMD stacks.</description>

      <title>Topology-Enabled Switchable Unidirectional Radiative Band in a Bilayer Photonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling how an open photonic system exchanges energy with its environment-and in particular how it radiates into the far field-is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian wave physics and a key enabler for directional photonic functionalities. Here, we propose a new route to robust unidirectional emission based on the non-Hermitian hybridization of resonances localized in spatially separated layers of a hetero-bilayer photonic crystal. By tailoring the interlayer coupling, we engineer hybrid photonc bands that exhibit strong unidirectional radiation across a broad spectral and momentum range while maintaining theoretically high quality factors. This asymmetric emission is organized by a topological vortex in a pseudo-polarization field defined from the front/back intensity imbalance, which endows the directionality with robustness against perturbations. We further show that, by tuning the surrounding refractive index, this singularity can be displaced in parameter space, enabling reversible switching of the emission direction and a reconfigurable far-field response. This framework opens perspectives for topological photonic sensing and for directional and switchable light sources, including unidirectional lasing supported by high-quality-factor modes.</description>

      <title>The Role of Exceptional Points and Transmission Peak Degeneracies in Non-Hermitian Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09141v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs) have emerged as a promising alternative to exceptional points (EPs) for non-Hermitian sensing, providing square-root frequency splitting without the eigenbasis collapse and associated noise amplification that limit EP sensors. However, existing treatments of TPDs remain fragmented, lacking a unified theoretical framework, systematic figures of merit, or design principles for practical implementation. Here, we develop a comprehensive theory of two-dimensional TPDs that clarifies their relationship to EPs, maps their locations in parameter space, and provides analytic figures of merit for sensor design. We validate our theory using a tunable cavity-magnonics platform with in situ control of mode frequency, dissipation, and complex coupling via an effective synthetic gauge field. Our platform enables systematic exploration of six representative EP-TPD configurations spanning PT-symmetric, anti-PT-symmetric and anyonic-PT-symmetric regimes. Crucially, we show that TPDs, unlike EPs, retain square-root splitting even under nuisance parameter drift through generalized transmission extrema degeneracies (TEDs). We further identify specific robust TPD configurations that minimize the impact of nuisance drift. These findings establish a unified theoretical and experimental framework for TPD-based non-Hermitian sensing.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust entanglement-assisted synchronization framework for indoor optical wireless systems that explicitly captures the coupling between spatial beam geometry and temporal synchronization accuracy. Unlike conventional approaches that treat beam steering and timing estimation independently, a unified spatio temporal model is developed that links user position uncertainty to the Cramer Rao lower bound of the synchronization error. The framework incorporates key physical impairments, including multipath dispersion, non Gaussian detector jitter, and spatially correlated localization errors. Through analytical modeling and extensive simulations, we show that the proposed system exhibits graceful performance degradation under heavy tailed positioning uncertainty and remains stable in the presence of multipath induced bias. Using realistic single photon detector parameters, the results indicate that synchronization accuracy below $10$ picoseconds can be maintained across a wide range of operating conditions. This level of precision provides a scalable foundation for quantum enabled indoor wireless networks.</description>

Abstract: Single-photon detection underpins a wide range of emerging photonic technologies, from quantum information processing and secure communications to photon-starved biomedical imaging. Among the available detector technologies, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) combine high detection efficiency, low noise, and excellent timing resolution, making them a leading platform for photon-counting applications. However, despite decades of materials and fabrication research, detector performance has never been shown to match theoretical performance expectations. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from its typical, suboptimal operation, to a regime limited only by material quality, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector that redistribute current across its width to achieve its peak performance. This technique not only reduces the dark count rate by ten orders of magnitude, but also enables future detectors to overcome the Pearl limit for device width, paving the way for arbitrarily large detectors. We show operation at this intrinsic performance limit for devices up to 0.1 mm wide, and also demonstrate near-unity internal detection efficiency (IDE) at a wavelength of 4um for a 20um-wide detector--a factor of 20 wider than the current state of the art.</description>
