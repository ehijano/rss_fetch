      <title>On Estimation of Angles of Arrival in Monostatic ISAC Without Instantaneous Transmit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the fundamental limits of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) in a more realistic setting compared to previous literature when the Base Staion (BS) has only statistical CSI of the communication user rather than full CSI. We analyze a monostatic setting where the BS performs multi-target Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation while simultaneously communicating with one of the targets. We assume that the BS has statistical CSI about all AoAs, with less uncertainty in the AoA of the communication receiver. The communication receiver is assumed to have perfect CSI. Utilizing a Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound (BCRB) framework to characterize the fundamental limits of sensing under minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria, we derive achievable BCRB-rate trade-off regions. Our approach introduces a number of transmission strategies that share power across sensing and communication beams over a coherence time. Our analysis reveals that beam allocation strategies leveraging the principal eigenvectors of the target-specific sensing matrices minimize individual AoA estimation errors, while strategies balancing sensing and communication directions optimize joint estimation performance at the cost of individual accuracy. We demonstrate that leveraging updated BCRB-based sensing information for the communication receiver, due to its lower channel uncertainty, enables significantly improved communication rates.</description>

      <title>Observation Matrix Design for Densifying MIMO Channel Estimation via 2D Ice Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, densifying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has attracted much attention from the communication community. Thanks to the subwavelength antenna spacing, the strong correlations among densifying antennas provide sufficient prior knowledge about channel state information (CSI). This inspires the careful design of observation matrices (e.g., transmit precoders and receive combiners), that exploits the CSI prior knowledge, to boost channel estimation performance. Aligned with this vision, this work proposes to jointly design the combiners and precoders by maximizing the mutual information between the received pilots and densifying MIMO channels. A two-dimensional ice-filling (2DIF) algorithm is proposed to efficiently accomplish this objective. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that the eigenspace of MIMO channel covariance can be decoupled into two sub-eigenspaces, which are associated with the correlations of transmitter antennas and receiver antennas, respectively. By properly setting the precoder and the combiner as the eigenvectors from these two sub-eigenspaces, the 2DIF promises to generate near-optimal observation matrices. Moreover, we further extend the 2DIF method to the popular hybrid combining systems, where a two-stage 2DIF (TS-2DIF) algorithm is developed to handle the analog combining circuits realized by phase shifters. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed 2DIF and TS-2DIF methods can achieve superior channel estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Soft Guessing Under Logarithmic Loss Allowing Errors and Variable-Length Source Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of soft guessing under a logarithmic loss distortion measure while allowing errors. We find an optimal guessing strategy, and derive single-shot upper and lower bounds for the minimal guessing moments as well as an asymptotic expansion for i.i.d. sources. These results are extended to the case where side information is available to the guesser. Furthermore, a connection between soft guessing allowing errors and variable-length lossy source coding under logarithmic loss is demonstrated. The R\'enyi entropy, the smooth R\'enyi entropy, and their conditional versions play an important role.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Detector for XL-MIMO Uplink: A Cross Splitting Based Information Geometry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the cross splitting based information geometry approach (CS-IGA), a novel and low complexity iterative detector for uplink signal recovery in extralarge-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. Conventional iterative detectors, such as the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm and the traditional information geometry algorithm (IGA), suffer from a per iteration complexity that scales with the number of base station (BS) antennas, creating a computational bottleneck. To overcome this, CS-IGA introduces a novel cross matrix splitting of the natural parameter in the a posteriori distribution. This factorization allows the iterative detection based on the matched filter, which reduces per iteration computational complexity. Furthermore, we extend this framework to nonlinear detection and propose nonlinear CSIGA (NCS-IGA) by seamlessly embedding discrete constellation constraints, enabling symbol-wise processing without external interference cancellation loops. Comprehensive simulations under realistic channel conditions demonstrate that CS-IGA matches or surpasses the bit error rate (BER) performance of Bayes optimal AMP and IGA for both linear and nonlinear detection, while achieving this with fewer iterations and a substantially lower computational cost. These results establish CS-IGA as a practical and powerful solution for high-throughput signal detection in next generation XL-MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal binary codes from $\mathcal{C}_{D}$-codes over a non-chain ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{shi2022few-weight}, Shi and Li studied $\mathcal{C}_D$-codes over the ring $\mathcal{R}:=\mathbb{F}_2[x,y]/\langle x^2, y^2, xy-yx\rangle$ and their binary Gray images, where $D$ is derived using certain simplicial complexes. We study the subfield codes $\mathcal{C}_{D}^{(2)}$ of $\mathcal{C}_{D}$-codes over $\mathcal{R},$ where $D$ is as in \cite{shi2022few-weight} and more. We find the Hamming weight distribution and the parameters of $\mathcal{C}_D^{(2)}$ for various $D$, and identify several infinite families of codes that are distance-optimal. Besides, we provide sufficient conditions under which these codes are minimal and self-orthogonal. Two families of strongly regular graphs are obtained as an application of the constructed two-weight codes.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid I/O Relation Estimation Scheme for Zak-OTFS Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the delay-Doppler (DD) domain input-output (I/O) relation in Zak-OTFS modulation, which is needed for signal detection. Two approaches, namely, model-dependent and model-free approaches, can be employed for this purpose. The model-dependent approach requires explicit estimation of the physical channel parameters (path delays, Dopplers, and gains) to obtain the I/O relation. Such an explicit estimation is not required in the model-free approach, where the I/O relation can be estimated by reading off the samples in the fundamental DD period of the received pilot frame. Model-free approach has the advantage of acquiring fractional DD channels with simplicity. However, the read-off in the model-free approach provides an estimate of the effective channel only over a limited region in the DD plane but it does not provide an estimate for the region outside, and this can affect the estimation performance depending on the pulse shaping characteristics of the DD pulse shaping filter used. A poorly localized DD pulse shape leads to an increased degradation in performance. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a novel, yet simple, I/O relation estimation scheme that alleviates the above issue in the model-free approach. We achieve this by obtaining a coarse estimate of the effective channel outside the model-free estimation region using a novel model-dependent scheme and using this estimate along with the model-free estimate to obtain an improved estimate of the overall I/O relation. We devise the proposed estimation scheme for both exclusive and embedded pilot frames. Our simulation results using Vehicular-A, TDL-A and TDL-C channel models with fractional DDs show that the proposed hybrid estimation approach achieves superior performance compared to the pure model-free approach.</description>

      <title>Serial Polar Automorphism Ensemble Decoders for Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) involve challenging practical applications of error-correcting codes (ECCs), requiring extremely low failure rates on the order of $10^{-6}$ and below despite raw input bit error rates as high as 22%. These requirements call for an efficient ultra-low rate code design. In this work, we propose a novel coding scheme tailored for PUFs based on Polar codes and a low-complexity version of automorphism ensemble decoding (AED). Notably, our serial AED scheme reuses a single successive cancellation (SC) decoder across multiple decoding attempts. By introducing cascaded and recursive interleavers, we efficiently scale the number of AED candidates without requiring expensive large multiplexers. An aggressive quantization strategy of only 3 bits per message further reduces the area requirements of the underlying SC decoder. The resulting coding scheme achieves the same block error rate of $10^{-6}$ as our baseline based on Bose-Ray-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes while requiring 1.75x fewer codeword bits to encode the same K = 312 payload bits. This reduction translates directly into 1.75x less helper data storage and, consequently, a smaller overall chip area.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific RIS Deployment in Cellular Networks via Calibrated Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a fully-automated RIS deployment strategy validated through a digital twin, powered by Sionna ray tracing, of a UK city. On a scene calibrated with measured data, the method jointly optimizes RIS placement, orientation, configuration, and BS beamforming across 4G, 5G, and hypothetical 6G frequencies. Candidate RIS sites are identified via scattering-based rays, while user clustering reduces deployment overhead. Results show that meaningful coverage enhancement requires dense, large-aperture RIS deployments, raising questions about the practicality and cost of large-scale RIS adoption.</description>

      <title>Precoder Design in Multi-User FDD Systems with VQ-VAE and GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust precoding is efficiently feasible in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems by incorporating the learnt statistics of the propagation environment through a generative model. We build on previous work that successfully designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized by fewer pilots or feedback bits.</description>

      <title>Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12694v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</description>

      <title>An MDL-Style Cost Functional KC, Distribution-Preserving Reductions ($A2^d$), and an $AC^0$+log Lower Bound for 3SAT via Balanced 3XOR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model-agnostic MDL-style cost functional $K_C$ for resource-bounded classifiers and prove a Total-Variation stable reduction lemma ($A2^d$) for distribution-preserving many-to-one reductions. On a balanced distribution of random 3XOR instances (with co-rank $t'=\Theta(n)$) we obtain a size-aware lower bound against P-uniform AC^0+log models: $\Pr[M=\chi] \le \frac{1}{2} + s(N)\exp(-\alpha_d m^{c/d})$ with an absolute $c \in (0,1)$ (e.g., $c=1/3$ gives $\beta_d=1/(3d)$). A deterministic, injective 3XOR-&gt;3SAT translation (four 3-clauses per XOR, no auxiliaries) is $\delta=0$ measure-preserving on its image window; by $A2^d$ the bound transfers to 3SAT. This yields, to our knowledge, the first explicit $K_C$-reading of such size-aware bounds under a $\delta=0$ measure-preserving reduction in small-depth circuit lower bounds. We provide artifacts (generator -&gt; DIMACS -&gt; verification) with match-rate 1.0.</description>

      <title>A Frequency-Domain Analysis of the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem: A New Perspective on the Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive parameter adjustment.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Radio for Asymmetric Cellular Downlink with Multi-User MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive radio (CR) is an important technique for improving spectral efficiency, letting a secondary system operate in a wireless spectrum when the primary system does not make use of it. While it has been widely explored over the past 25 years, many common assumptions are not aligned with the realities of 5G networks. In this paper, we consider the CR problem for the following setup: (i) infrastructure-based systems, where downlink transmissions might occur to receivers whose positions are not, or not exactly, known; (ii) multi-beam antennas at both primary and secondary base stations. We formulate a detailed protocol to determine when secondary transmissions into different beam directions can interfere with primary users at potential locations and create probability-based interference rules. We then analyze the "catastrophic interference" probability and the "missed transmission opportunity" probability, as well as the achievable throughput, as a function of the transmit powers of the primary and secondary base stations and the sensing window of the secondary base station. Results can serve to more realistically assess the spectral efficiency gains in 5G infrastructure-based cognitive systems.</description>

      <title>3C Resources Joint Allocation for Time-Deterministic Remote Sensing Image Backhaul in the Space-Ground Integrated Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites assist observation satellites (OSs) to compress and backhaul more time-determined images (TDI) has become a new paradigm, which is used to enhance the timeout caused by the limited computing resources of OSs. However, how to capture the time-varying and dynamic characteristics of multi-dimensional resources is challenging for efficient collaborative scheduling. Motivated by this factor, we design a highly succinct multi-dimensional resource time-expanded graph (MDR-TEG) modell. Specifically, by employing a slots division mechanism and introducing an external virtual node, the time-varying communication, caching, and computing (3C) resources are depicted in low complexity by the link weights within, between, and outside the slots. Based on the MDR-TEG, the maximizing successful transmission ratio of TDI (MSTR-TDI) is modeled as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Which further relaxed decomposed into two tractable sub-problems: maximizing the successful transmission rate of images (MSTRI) and ensuring the timeliness problem (ETP). Subsequently, an efficient subgradient of relaxation computing constraint (SRCC) algorithm is proposed. The upper and lower bounds of MSTR-TDI are obtained by solving the two subproblems and the dual problem (DP), and the direction of the next iteration is obtained by feedback. Furthermore, arranging the sending sequences of images to improve the quality of the solution. The approximate optimal solution of MSTR-TDI is eventually obtained through repeated iterations. The simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed MDR-TEG model and the effectiveness of the SRCC.</description>

      <title>Locally Optimal Private Sampling: Beyond the Global Minimax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in $f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class $\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this, we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$. Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of $f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Vector Linear Computation over a Noiseless Quantum Multiple Access Channel with Entangled Transmitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network function computation is an active topic in network coding, with much recent progress for linear (over a finite field) computations over broadcast (LCBC) and multiple access (LCMAC) channels. Over a quantum multiple access channel (QMAC) with quantum-entanglement shared among transmitters, the linear computation problem (LC-QMAC) is non-trivial even when the channel is noiseless, because of the challenge of optimally exploiting transmit-side entanglement through distributed coding. Given an arbitrary linear function of data streams defined in a finite field $\mathbb{F}_d$, the LC-QMAC problem seeks the optimal communication cost (minimum number of qudits that need to be sent by the transmitters to the receiver, per computation instance) over a noise-free QMAC, when the independent input data streams originate at the corresponding transmitters, who share quantum entanglement in advance. As our main result, we fully solve this problem for $K=3$ transmitters ($K\geq 4$ settings remain open). Coding schemes based on the $N$-sum box protocol (along with time-sharing and batch-processing) are shown to be information theoretically optimal in all cases.</description>

      <title>On the impact of the parametrization of deep convolutional neural networks on post-training quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces novel theoretical approximation bounds for the output of quantized neural networks, with a focus on convolutional neural networks (CNN). By considering layerwise parametrization and focusing on the quantization of weights, we provide bounds that gain several orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art results on classical deep convolutional neural networks such as MobileNetV2 or ResNets. These gains are achieved by improving the behaviour of the approximation bounds with respect to the depth parameter, which has the most impact on the approximation error induced by quantization. To complement our theoretical result, we provide a numerical exploration of our bounds on MobileNetV2 and ResNets.</description>

      <title>Neural Beam Field for Spatial Beam RSRP Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) is essential for beam management in dense multi-user wireless networks, yet challenging due to high measurement overhead and fast channel variations. This paper proposes Neural Beam Field (NBF), a hybrid neural-physical framework for efficient and interpretable spatial beam RSRP prediction. Central to our approach is the introduction of the Multi-path Conditional Power Profile (MCPP), a learnable physical intermediary representing the site-specific propagation environment. This approach decouples the environment from specific antenna/beam configurations, which helps the model learn site-specific multipath features and enhances its generalization capability. We adopt a decoupled ``blackbox-whitebox" design: a Transformer-based deep neural network (DNN) learns the MCPP from sparse user measurements and positions, while a physics-inspired module analytically infers beam RSRP statistics. To improve convergence and adaptivity, we further introduce a Pretrain-and-Calibrate (PaC) strategy that leverages ray-tracing priors for physics-grounded pretraining and then RSRP data for on-site calibration. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that NBF significantly outperforms conventional table-based channel knowledge maps (CKMs) and pure blackbox DNNs in prediction accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization, while maintaining a compact model size. The proposed framework offers a scalable and physically grounded solution for intelligent beam management in next-generation dense wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Using nonassociative algebras to classify skew polycyclic codes up to isometry and equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing isomorphisms between their ambient algebras, we propose new definitions of equivalence and isometry for skew polycyclic codes that will lead to tighter classifications than existing ones. This reduces the number of previously known isometry and equivalence classes. In the process, we classify classes of skew $(f,\sigma,\delta)$-polycyclic codes with the same performance parameters, to avoid duplicating already existing codes, and state precisely when different notions of equivalence coincide.
  The generator of a skew polycyclic code is in one-one correspondence with the generator of a principal left ideal in its ambient algebra. We allow the ambient algebras to be nonassociative, thus eliminating the need on restrictions on the length of the codes. Algebra isomorphisms that preserve the Hamming distance (called isometries) map generators of principal left ideals to generators of principal left ideals and preserve length, dimension and Hamming distance of the codes. The isometries between the ambient algebras can also be used to classify corresponding linear codes equipped with the rank metric.</description>

Abstract: Distance relays detect faults on transmission lines. They face uncertainty from the fault's location and resistance, as well as the current from the line's remote terminal. In this paper, we aggregate this uncertainty with the Minkowski sum. This allows us to explicitly model the power grid surrounding the relay's line, and in turn accommodate any mix of synchronous machines and inverter-based resources. To make the relay's task easier, inverters can inject perturbations, or auxiliary signals, such as negative-sequence current. We use Farkas' lemma to construct an optimization for designing inverter auxiliary signals.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Computation Using Bias-Preserving Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain types of quantum computing platforms, such as those realized using Rydberg atoms or Kerr-cat qubits, are natively more susceptible to Pauli-Z noise than Pauli-X noise, or vice versa. On such hardware, it is useful to ensure that computations use only gates that maintain the Z-bias (or X-bias) in the noise. This is so that quantum error-correcting codes tailored for biased-noise models can be used to provide fault-tolerance on these platforms. In this paper, we follow up on the recent work of Fellous-Asiani et al. (npj Quantum Inf., 2025) in studying the structure and properties of bias-preserving gates. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We give a novel characterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition as a linear combination of Pauli operators. (2) We show that any Z-bias-preserving gate can be approximated arbitrarily well using only gates from the set {X,R_z(\theta),CNOT,CCNOT}, where \theta is any irrational multiple of 2\pi. (3) We prove, by drawing a connection with coherence resource theory, that any Z-bias-preserving logical operator acting on the logical qubits of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code can be realized by applying Z-bias-preserving gates on the physical qubits. Along the way, we also demonstrate that Z-bias-preserving gates are far from being universal for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>On the optimization dynamics of RLVR: Gradient gap and step size thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels. Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through controlled bandit simulations.</description>
