      <title>Integrable variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a novel variant of the Blaszak-Szum lattice equation by introducing a new class of trigonometric-type bilinear operators. By employing Hirota's bilinear method, we obtain the Gram-type determinant solution of the variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation. One-soliton and two-soliton solutions are constructed, with a detailed analysis of the asymptotic behaviors of the two-soliton solution. A B\"acklund transformation for the variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation is established. By virtue of this B\"acklund transformation, multi-lump solutions of the equation are further constructed. Rational solutions are derived by introducing two differential operators applied to the determinant elements; in particular, lump solutions derived via these differential operators can be formulated in terms of Schur polynomials. Through parameter variation, three types of breather solutions are obtained, including the Akhmediev breather, Kuznetsov-Ma breather, and a general breather that propagates along arbitrary oblique trajectories. Finally, numerical three-periodic wave solutions to the variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation are computed using the Gauss-Newton method.</description>

      <title>Curvature-driver d.dynamics on $S^3$: a geometric atlas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric atlas of dynamical regimes on the rotation group SU(2), combining geodesic flows, heavy rigid body dynamics, and a curvature-based decomposition of the Euler-Poisson equations. We represent the equations of motion in a curvature form that interprets rigid-body motion as the interaction of inertial and external curvature fields. This unified viewpoint recovers classical integrable cases (Lagrange, Kovalevskaya, Goryachev-Chaplygin) from a single geometric mechanism and clarifies their geodesic prototypes on SU(2). The central new result is the identification and geometric explanation of a pure-precession family in the inertia ratio (2,2,1), obtained from a curvature-balanced geodesic regime with the same inertia ratio. The corresponding pure-precession regime for the (2,2,1) heavy top was first identified in previous work; here we place it into a curvature-based atlas and interpret it as a balance between inertial and external curvature fields. We also exhibit a schematic curvature diagram organizing the main dynamical regimes. Finally, we outline GCCT (Geometric Curvature Control Theory), a curvature-driven approach to control on S^3 designed to produce smooth globally regular controls suitable for benchmark maneuvers; a detailed comparison with Pontryagin-type optimal solutions is left for future work.</description>

      <title>An integrable hierarchy associated with loop extension of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hierarchy of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded integrable equations is constructed using the loop extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$. This hierarchy includes $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extensions of the Liouville, sinh-Gordon, cosh-Gordon, and, in particular, the mKdV equations. The $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded KdV equation is also derived from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-mKdV equation via the Miura transformation. We present explicit formulas for the conserved charges of the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-KdV and $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-mKdV equations. A distinctive feature of these $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded integrable systems is the existence of conserved charges with nontrivial grading.</description>

      <title>Polynomial vector fields in $\mathbb{C}^\infty$ determining differentiation of hyperelliptic functions of any genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we give direct proofs of two theorems concerning explicitly defined polynomial vector fields connected to differentiation of hyperelliptic functions of any genus. We prove that the operators determining the fields commute, and we show that each of them annul polynomials defined in terms of generating functions in $\mathbb{C}^\infty$.</description>

      <title>Matrix Lax pairs under the gauge equivalence relation induced by the gauge group action and Miura-type transformations for lattice equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore interconnections of differential-difference matrix Lax representations (Lax pairs), gauge transformations, and discrete Miura-type transformations (MTs), which belong to the main tools in the theory of integrable differential-difference (lattice) equations.
  For a given equation, two matrix Lax representations (MLRs) are said to be gauge equivalent if one of them can be obtained from the other by means of a (local) matrix gauge transformation. Matrix gauge transformations constitute an infinite-dimensional group called the matrix gauge group, which acts naturally on the set of MLRs of a given equation. Two MLRs are gauge equivalent if and only if they belong to the same orbit of the matrix gauge group action.
  For a wide class of MLRs of (vector) evolutionary differential-difference equations, we present results on the following questions:
  1. When and how can one simplify a given MLR by matrix gauge transformations and bring the MLR to a form suitable for constructing MTs?
  2. A MLR is called fake if it is gauge equivalent to a trivial MLR. How to determine whether a given MLR is not fake?
  This allows us to construct new integrable equations (with new MLRs) connected by new MTs to known equations.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability Of Entanglement For Arbitrary Initial State in an Infinite-Range Floquet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharma and Bhosale [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.014412}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.064313}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N&gt;12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.</description>
