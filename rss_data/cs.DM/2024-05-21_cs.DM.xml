      <title>Metric Dimension and Resolvability of Jaccard Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of points in a metric space is said to resolve it if each point in the space is uniquely characterized by its distance to each point in the subset. In particular, resolving sets can be used to represent points in abstract metric spaces as Euclidean vectors. Importantly, due to the triangle inequality, points close by in the space are represented as vectors with similar coordinates, which may find applications in classification problems of symbolic objects under suitably chosen metrics. In this manuscript, we address the resolvability of Jaccard spaces, i.e., metric spaces of the form $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, where $2^X$ is the power set of a finite set $X$, and $\text{Jac}$ is the Jaccard distance between subsets of $X$. Specifically, for different $a,b\in 2^X$, $\text{Jac}(a,b)=\frac{|a\Delta b|}{|a\cup b|}$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes size (i.e., cardinality) and $\Delta$ denotes the symmetric difference of sets. We combine probabilistic and linear algebra arguments to construct highly likely but nearly optimal (i.e., of minimal size) resolving sets of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$. In particular, we show that the metric dimension of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, i.e., the minimum size of a resolving set of this space, is $\Theta(|X|/\ln|X|)$.</description>

      <title>On Tuza's Conjecture in Dense Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1982, Tuza conjectured that the size $\tau(G)$ of a minimum set of edges that intersects every triangle of a graph $G$ is at most twice the size $\nu(G)$ of a maximum set of edge-disjoint triangles of $G$. This conjecture was proved for several graph classes. In this paper, we present three results regarding Tuza's Conjecture for dense graphs. By using a probabilistic argument, Tuza proved its conjecture for graphs on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $\frac{7n}{8}$. We extend this technique to show that Tuza's conjecture is valid for split graphs with minimum degree at least $\frac{3n}{5}$; and that $\tau(G) &lt; \frac{28}{15}\nu(G)$ for every tripartite graph with minimum degree more than $\frac{33n}{56}$. Finally, we show that $\tau(G)\leq \frac{3}{2}\nu(G)$ when $G$ is a complete 4-partite graph. Moreover, this bound is tight.</description>

      <title>Fully graphic degree sequences and P-stable degree sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of P-stability played an influential role in approximating the permanents, sampling rapidly the realizations of graphic degree sequences, or even studying and improving network privacy. However, we did not have a good insight of the structure of P-stable degree sequence families. In this paper we develop a remedy to overstep this deficiency.
  We will show, that if an infinite set of graphic degree sequences, characterized by some simple inequalities of their fundamental parameters, is $P$-stable, then it is ``fully graphic'' -- meaning that every degree sequence with an even sum, meeting the specified inequalities, is graphic. The reverse statement also holds: an infinite, fully graphic set of degree sequences characterized by some simple inequalities of their fundamental parameters is P-stable.
  Along the way, we will significantly strengthen some well-known, older results, and we construct new P-stable families of degree sequences.</description>

      <title>Automated Market Makers for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.01676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper compares mathematical models for automated market makers including logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR), liquidity sensitive LMSR (LS-LMSR), constant product/mean/sum, and others. It is shown that though LMSR may not be a good model for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, LS-LMSR has several advantages over constant product/mean based automated market makers. However, LS-LMSR requires complicated computation (i.e., logarithm and exponentiation) and the cost function curve is concave. In certain DeFi applications, it is preferred to have computationally efficient cost functions with convex curves to conform with the principle of supply and demand. This paper proposes and analyzes constant circle/ellipse based cost functions for automated market makers. The proposed cost functions are computationally efficient (only requires multiplication and square root calculation) and have several advantages over widely deployed constant product cost functions. For example, the proposed market makers are more robust against front-runner (slippage) attacks.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of symmetric vs. functional PCSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of the promise constraint satisfaction problem $\operatorname{PCSP}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$ is largely unknown, even for symmetric $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, except for the case when $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are Boolean.
  First, we establish a dichotomy for $\operatorname{PCSP}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$ where $\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}$ are symmetric, $\mathbf{B}$ is functional (i.e. any $r-1$ elements of an $r$-ary tuple uniquely determines the last one), and $(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$ satisfies technical conditions we introduce called dependency and additivity. This result implies a dichotomy for $\operatorname{PCSP}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$ with $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}$ symmetric and $\mathbf{B}$ functional if (i) $\mathbf{A}$ is Boolean, or (ii) $\mathbf{A}$ is a hypergraph of a small uniformity, or (iii) $\mathbf{A}$ has a relation $R^{\mathbf{A}}$ of arity at least 3 such that the hypergraph diameter of $(A, R^{\mathbf{A}})$ is at most 1.
  Second, we show that for $\operatorname{PCSP}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$, where $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ contain a single relation, $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies a technical condition called balancedness, and $\mathbf{B}$ is arbitrary, the combined basic linear programming relaxation (BLP) and the affine integer programming relaxation (AIP) is no more powerful than the (in general strictly weaker) AIP relaxation. Balanced $\mathbf{A}$ include symmetric $\mathbf{A}$ or, more generally, $\mathbf{A}$ preserved by a transitive permutation group.</description>

      <title>On the Relationship Between Several Variants of the Linear Hashing Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13016v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Linear Hashing ($\mathsf{LH}$) with $\beta$ bins on a size $u$ universe ${\mathcal{U}=\{0,1,\ldots, u-1\}}$, items $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n\}\subset \mathcal{U}$ are placed in bins by the hash function $$x_i\mapsto (ax_i+b)\mod p \mod \beta$$ for some prime $p\in [u,2u]$ and randomly chosen integers $a,b \in [1,p]$. The "maxload" of $\mathsf{LH}$ is the number of items assigned to the fullest bin. Expected maxload for a worst-case set of items is a natural measure of how well $\mathsf{LH}$ distributes items amongst the bins.
  Fix $\beta=n$. Despite $\mathsf{LH}$'s simplicity, bounding $\mathsf{LH}$'s worst-case maxload is extremely challenging. It is well-known that on random inputs $\mathsf{LH}$ achieves maxload $\Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)$; this is currently the best lower bound for $\mathsf{LH}$'s expected maxload. Recently Knudsen established an upper bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1 / 3})$. The question "Is the worst-case expected maxload of $\mathsf{LH}$ $n^{o(1)}$?" is one of the most basic open problems in discrete math.
  In this paper we propose a set of intermediate open questions to help researchers make progress on this problem. We establish the relationship between these intermediate open questions and make some partial progress on them.</description>

      <title>Nearly Orthogonal Sets over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d$ and $k$, a set of vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$ is called $k$-nearly orthogonal if its members are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ of them include an orthogonal pair. We prove that for every prime $p$ there exists a positive constant $\delta = \delta (p)$, such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $k \geq 2$ and $d \geq k^{1/(p-1)}$, there exists a $k$-nearly orthogonal set of at least $d^{\delta \cdot k^{1/(p-1)}/ \log k}$ vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$. In particular, for the binary field we obtain a set of $d^{\Omega( k /\log k)}$ vectors, and this is tight up to the $\log k$ term in the exponent. For comparison, the best known lower bound over the reals is $d^{\Omega( \log k / \log \log k)}$ (Alon and Szegedy, Graphs and Combin., 1999). The proof combines probabilistic and spectral arguments.</description>

      <title>Binomial sums and Mellin asymptotics with explicit error bounds: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making use of a newly developed package in the computer algebra system SageMath, we show how to perform a full asymptotic analysis by means of the Mellin transform with explicit error bounds. As an application of the method, we answer a question of B\'ona and DeJonge on 132-avoiding permutations with a unique longest increasing subsequence that can be translated into an inequality for a certain binomial sum.</description>
