      <title>The kSZ optical depth degeneracy and future constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reconstructions of the large-scale cosmological velocity field with kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich (kSZ) tomography have returned an amplitude that is low with respect to the halo model prediction, captured by the kSZ velocity reconstruction bias $b_v &lt;1$. This suggests that common choices for modeling the galaxy-electron cross correlation have systematically overestimated the true power, at least over scales and redshifts used in the velocity reconstruction measurements. In this paper, we study the implications of this overestimation for constraints on local-type primordial non-Gaussianity in current and near-future cosmological surveys. For concreteness, we focus on kSZ velocity reconstruction from a Vera Rubin Observatory-like survey in tandem with contemporary cosmic microwave background measurements. Assuming standard choices for the fiducial model of the small-scale galaxy-electron cross correlation, we find that upcoming kSZ tomography measurements can significantly improve constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity via measurement of scale-dependent galaxy bias, in broad concordance with previous studies of the application of kSZ tomography to primordial non-Gaussianity. However, when we instead modify the assumed galaxy-electron cross-spectrum to be consistent with recent measurements of the velocity reconstruction bias, this picture can change appreciably. Specifically, we find that if the inferred suppression of galaxy-electron power persists at higher redshifts $z\gtrsim 1$, kSZ-driven improvement in local primordial non-Gaussianity constraints may be less significant than previously estimated. We explore how these conclusions depend on various modeling and experimental assumptions and discuss implications for the emerging program of kSZ velocity reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Updated dark pixel fraction constraints on reionization's end from the Lyman-series forests of XQR-30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fraction of "dark pixels" in the Ly$\alpha$ and other Lyman-series forests at $z\sim 5-6$ provides a powerful constraint on the end of the reionization process. Any spectral region showing transmission must be highly ionized, while dark regions could be ionized or neutral, thus the dark pixel fraction provides a (nearly) model independent upper limit to the volume-filling fraction of the neutral intergalactic medium, modulo choices in binning scale and dark pixel definition. Here we provide updated measurements of the 3.3 comoving Mpc dark pixel fraction at $z=4.85-6.25$ in the Ly$\alpha$, Ly$\beta$, and Ly$\gamma$ forests of 34 deep $5.8\lesssim z\lesssim 6.6$ quasar spectra from the (enlarged) XQR-30 sample. Using the negative pixel method to measure the dark pixel fraction, we derive fiducial $1\sigma$ upper limits on the volume-average neutral hydrogen fraction of $\langle x_{\rm{HI}}\rangle \leq \{0.030 + 0.048, 0.095 + 0.037, 0.191 + 0.056, 0.199 + 0.087\}$ at $\bar{z} = \{5.481, 5.654, 5.831, 6.043\}$ from the optimally sensitive combination of the Ly$\beta$ and Ly$\gamma$ forests. We further demonstrate an alternative method that treats the forest flux as a mixture of dark and transparent regions, where the latter are modeled using a physically-motivated parametric form for the intrinsic opacity distribution. The resulting model-dependent upper limits on $\langle x_{\rm{HI}}\rangle$ are similar to those derived from our fiducial model-independent analysis. We confirm that the bulk of reionization must be finished at $z&gt;6$, while leaving room for an extended "soft landing" to the reionization history down to $z\sim 5.4$ suggested by Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Mitigating gain calibration errors from EoR observations with SKA1-Low AA*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of the redshifted 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen is a promising probe for understanding the phase transition of the early universe and its evolution during the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). One of the primary obstacles to the statistical detection of the target signal is the presence of residual foreground, which arises from gain calibration errors. Previous studies have shown that gain calibration errors as small as 0.01% can lead to a biased interpretation of the observed signal power spectrum estimation, by nearly an order of magnitude. A recent study further highlights that to retrieve astrophysical parameters accurately, the threshold gain calibration error should be lower than 0.01%. In this work, we develop a post-calibration mitigation strategy that combines foreground subtraction techniques with foreground avoidance to address residual contamination arising from gain calibration errors. We use an end-to-end pipeline 21cmE2E to simulate a realistic sky model and telescope configuration within the 138-146 MHz frequency range. To assess the impact of residual antenna-based gain calibration errors, we perform a detailed power spectrum analysis across several threshold levels. Our analysis shows that the extraction of the target signal over the wavenumber range $0.05 \leq k \leq 0.5$ Mpc$^{-1}$ is possible with a threshold gain calibration error of 1%, although with a significant SNR tradeoff on larger scales. Moreover, this work also offers a comparative assessment of foreground removal and avoidance techniques in the context of future SKA1-Low AA* observations.</description>

      <title>Weak-Lensing Detection of Intercluster Filaments in Three Nearby Cluster Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detection of intercluster filaments is challenging due to their low surface density, resulting in a weak deflection field. We present weak-lensing detections of intercluster filaments using wide-field Dark Energy Camera (DECam) observations from the Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). A matched-filter method was applied to identify filamentary structures in three nearby ($z &lt; 0.1$) systems centered on Abell 401, Abell 2029, and Abell 3558. We discover two prominent filaments ($\geq 4\sigma$) in each system, with the strongest detections ($6.4\sigma - 7.3\sigma$) around Abell 401 and Abell 2029. In particular, we report the first robust weak-lensing detections $(&gt;5 \sigma)$ of the intercluster bridges connecting the cluster pairs Abell 401/399, Abell 2029/2033, Abell 2029/SIG, and Abell 3558/3556. Adopting a filament convergence model motivated by numerical simulations, we infer the maximum convergence ($\kappa_0$) and characteristic width ($h_{\mathrm{c}}$) for all six filaments, yielding $\kappa_0 \sim 0.015 - 0.053$ and $h_{\mathrm{c}} \sim 0.11 - 0.45 \ \mathrm{Mpc}$. The performance of the matched-filter technique is validated using mock shear catalogs and further tested on a null field around Abell 2351. We also explore the potential of using the B-mode lensing signal of filaments to suppress cluster-induced shear contamination. These results demonstrate the feasibility of directly mapping dark matter filaments with current and future wide-field weak-lensing datasets.</description>

      <title>Model-independent late-universe measurements of $H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ with the PAge-improved inverse distance ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model has encountered serious challenges and the $H_0$ tension has become more significant with increasingly precise cosmological observation. Meanwhile, inconsistencies in measurements of the curvature parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ between different datasets also have emerged. In this work, we employ two global and cosmic age-based parameterizations, PAge and MAPAge, to perform model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ by utilizing the inverse distance ladder (IDL). To construct the PAge-improved IDL, we utilize the strong gravitational lensing (SGL), cosmic chronometers (CC), and gamma ray bursts (GRB) data to calibrate the latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation data and DESY5 type Ia supernova data. Our analysis indicate that DESI+DESY5+SGL+CC+GRB gives $H_0=71.59\pm 0.94\,{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in the MAPAge model, reducing the $H_0$ tension to the $1.0\sigma$ level. Extending to MAPAge$+\Omega_{\rm K}$ model, we obtain $\Omega_\mathrm{K}=0.001\pm 0.038$, which suggests that current late-time data are consistent with a flat universe. Finally, the Bayesian analysis indicates that the present late-universe data provide weak to moderate evidence in favor of PAge and MAPAge relative to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$vCF: Extending $\Lambda$CDM into a Unified Model with Particle Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel extended version of the $\Lambda$CDM model that provides analytical solution for Hubble parameter uniting all epochs of cosmic evolution starting from inflation to late-acceleration, with intermediate radiation and matter-dominated epochs. This is achieved by relaxing the perfect fluid assumption in the standard model and considering a general viscous cosmic fluid (vCF) with non-zero particle creation rate and evolving adiabatic equation of state. Transition points of the Universe and the finite boundary connecting them is exactly determined. We then propose a novel method to determine the early-time viscous coefficient and inflation energy scale using the Cosmic Mode Index value postulated by Padmanabhan. Considering the data from the Planck 2018 analysis, this yields an inflationary Hubble parameter of $H_{I}\approx10^{13}$\,GeV. An equivalent scalar-field description for the inflationary epoch is then constructed and inferences are made regarding the nature of inflation. Notably, we find that the model describes an ultra-slow-roll hilltop inflation scenario with a graceful exit to radiation-dominated epoch. Subsequently, we show that bulk viscosity in this model can be expressed as Israel-Stewart equation in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics with an appropriate underlying viscous coefficient and relaxation time that satisfy the causality constraint in its extreme limit. Finally, by comparing the evolution of this causal relation and its Navier-Stokes counterpart, we infer that the evolution from inflation to radiation era signifies a fluid transitioning from viscoelastic to pseudoplastic behavior.</description>

      <title>A test of invariance of halo surface density for FIRE-2 simulations with cold dark matter and self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous observations have shown that the dark matter halo surface density, defined as the product of core radius and halo central density of cored dark matter haloes is nearly constant and independent of galaxy mass over a whole slew of galaxy types. Here we calculate the surface density in cold dark matter(CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models including baryons, as well as SIDM without baryons, for dwarf galaxies of masses $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ using mock catalogs obtained from simulations as part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments project. We find that the dark matter surface density and column density are nearly constant for CDM and SIDM for this mass range. The halo surface density obtained from the Burkert profile fit is consistent with galactic-scale observations within $1\sigma$. We also computed the empirical scaling relations between the central surface density and maximum velocity using the best-fit dark matter profiles, and found that they agree with observations of Milky Way and M31 dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Physical-Neural Simulator for Fast Cosmological Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological field-level inference requires differentiable forward models that solve the challenging dynamics of gas and dark matter under hydrodynamics and gravity. We propose a hybrid approach where gravitational forces are computed using a differentiable particle-mesh solver, while the hydrodynamics are parametrized by a neural network that maps local quantities to an effective pressure field. We demonstrate that our method improves upon alternative approaches, such as an Enthalpy Gradient Descent baseline, both at the field and summary-statistic level. The approach is furthermore highly data efficient, with a single reference simulation of cosmological structure formation being sufficient to constrain the neural pressure model. This opens the door for future applications where the model is fit directly to observational data, rather than a training set of simulations.</description>

      <title>Flinch: A Differentiable Framework for Field-Level Inference of Cosmological parameters from curved sky data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Flinch, a fully differentiable and high-performance framework for field-level inference on angular maps, developed to improve the flexibility and scalability of current methodologies. Flinch is integrated with differentiable cosmology tools, allowing gradients to propagate from individual map pixels directly to the underlying cosmological parameters. This architecture allows cosmological inference to be carried out directly from the map itself, bypassing the need to specify a likelihood for intermediate summary statistics. Using simulated, masked CMB temperature maps, we validate our pipeline by reconstructing both maps and angular power spectra, and we perform cosmological parameter inference with competitive precision. In comparison with the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach, Flinch delivers substantially tighter constraints, with error bars reduced by up to 40%. Among the gradient-based samplers routinely employed in field-level analyses, we further show that MicroCanonical Langevin Monte Carlo provides orders-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency over currently employed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers, greatly reducing computational expense.</description>

      <title>The Weighing Halos Accurately, Locally, and Efficiently with Supernovae (WHALES) Survey Overview and Initial Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of the Weighing Halos Accurately, Locally, and Efficiently with Supernovae (WHALES) survey, the first to discover and measure Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in and around galaxy superclusters. By building a sample of SNe~Ia around these massive environments, we aim to provide new constraints on bulk-flow models while laying the groundwork for improved estimates of supercluster masses. Here, we present data from the first two seasons targeting the Shapley Supercluster (0.02&lt;z&lt;0.06), which is responsible for a large but unknown fraction of our local group's motion. Until now, no supernovae had been analyzed in the direction of Shapley. Through the WHALES survey, we have identified 12 likely SNe Ia in this region using SkyMapper, including 8 with spectroscopic confirmation. We present the first light curves of these SNe and combine our observations with data from ATLAS. We demonstrate that the low number of discovered SNe Ia per season is consistent with various rate calculations, highlighting the need for future surveys to monitor superclusters over a multi-year timespan. Finally, we present simulations of SN Ia observations in the environments of massive galaxy clusters, demonstrating how the inferred peculiar velocities can constrain cluster masses, and highlighting the added complexity within superclusters. We find that a sample of 100 SNe Ia would enable a 25% precision measurement of the total mass of the Shapley Supercluster.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Primordial Gravitational Wave Inference from the CMB with SMICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of primordial gravitational waves in Cosmic Microwave Background B-mode polarization observations requires accurate and robust subtraction of astrophysical contamination. We show, using a blind Spectral Matching Independent Component Analysis, that it is possible to infer unbiased estimates of the primordial B-mode signal from ground-based observations of a small patch of sky even for highly complex foreground contamination. This work, originally performed in the context of configuration studies for a future CMB-S4 observatory, is highly relevant for the analysis of observations by the current generation of CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Boosting the cosmic 21-cm signal with exotic Lyman-$\alpha$ from dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21-cm signal from the epoch of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-30$) offers a powerful probe of new physics. One standard mechanism for constraining decaying dark matter from 21-cm observations relies on heating of the intergalactic medium by the decay products, an effect whose observability is entangled with the uncertain Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes and X-ray heating from the first stars. In this Letter, we explore a novel mechanism, where the Lyman-$\alpha$ photons produced from dark matter decay initiate early Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the spin temperature to the gas temperature, thereby boosting the 21-cm signal. This mechanism provides constraints on dark matter that are less dependent on uncertainties associated with star formation than constraints on exotic heating. We study this effect for decaying dark matter with masses $m_{\chi}\sim20.4-27.2$ eV, where diphoton decay efficiently produces Lyman-series photons. We present forecasts for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array, showing their potential to probe an unconstrained parameter space for light decaying DM, including axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Simulations of Weakly Collisional Plasmas with Braginskii Viscosity in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of an anisotropic viscosity solver within the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) framework of the TreeSPH code OpenGadget3. The solver models anisotropic viscous transport along magnetic field lines following the Braginskii formulation and includes physically motivated limiters based on the mirror and firehose instability thresholds, which constrain the viscous stress in weakly collisional plasmas. To validate the implementation, we performed a suite of standard test problems -- including two variants of the sound-wave test, circularly and linearly polarized Alfven waves, fast magnetosonic wave, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability -- both with and without the plasma-instability limiters. The results show excellent agreement with the AREPO implementation of a similar anisotropic viscosity model (Berlok et al. 2019), confirming the accuracy and robustness of our method. Our formulation integrates seamlessly within the individual adaptive timestepping framework of OpenGadget3, avoiding the need for subcycling. This provides efficient and stable time integration while maintaining physical consistency. Finally, we applied the new solver to a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy cluster, demonstrating its capability to model anisotropic transport and plasma microphysics in realistic large-scale environments. Our implementation offers a versatile and computationally efficient tool for studying anisotropic viscosity in magnetized astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond general relativity: gravitational waves in non-minimally coupled theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-minimal couplings between matter and curvature tensors arise in many different contexts. Such couplings modify solutions of general relativity (GR) and therefore can be probed in various astrophysical systems. A particularly interesting scenario arises if dark matter experiences non-minimal couplings, as dark matter densities are expected to spike in the vicinity of binary black hole mergers. This gives a novel setting for simultaneously studying dark matter and (beyond) GR physics via observations of gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we explore effects of various non-minimal couplings on GWs by working with a model-independent parameterization for left- and right-handed GW strains. We extend the parameterization proposed in \cite{Jenks:2023pmk,Daniel:2024lev} to include early-universe effects, and we write down the generic solution assuming slowly-varying matter fields. We then systematically apply our results to three models: Kalb-Ramond dark matter with dimension-four operators, axion-dilaton-Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet dimension-five operators, and dimension-six couplings to a (dark) vector field.</description>

      <title>KM3-230213A and IceCube Neutrino Events from Metastable Dark Matter of Primordial Black Hole Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scenario in which the recently observed ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A, with a median energy of approximately 220 PeV, as well as the high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube Observatory, originate from the decay of superheavy dark matter (DM) particles produced through primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation. To establish this connection, we derive constraints on the PBH abundance parameter $\beta$ as a function of the initial PBH mass $M_{\mathrm{BH_0}}$ and DM mass $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$, by considering the bound from the observed relic DM abundance. Using these constraints, we compute the resulting neutrino flux and show that DM masses in the PeV-EeV range can yield neutrinos of comparable energies, capable of accounting for both the KM3-230213A and IceCube events while remaining consistent with the relic abundance constraint. Interestingly, the scenario remains viable over a broad region of parameter space while satisfying existing cosmological and astrophysical bounds. Overall, our results demonstrate that PBH evaporation followed by DM decay provides a consistent and natural explanation for the observed ultra-high-energy neutrino events in the absence of accompanying multimessenger signatures.</description>

      <title>Rotation Measure Analysis of Shocks and Sloshing Fronts in a Galaxy Cluster Merger Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of the Fornax cluster show depolarization signatures on megaparsec scales, which may be associated with shocks and/or sloshing motions during cluster merger and/or in-fall. To investigate the possible reasons behind the depolarization, we carry out analytical and full polarized radiative transfer (PRT) calculations of radio point sources behind a merging galaxy cluster simulated using the FLASH code. With uniform background light, we analyzed the rotation measure (RM) morphology near the shock front and the cluster center, where sloshing cold fronts appear. For the shock scenario, we find a local RM enhancement by $\sim56\%$ behind the shock front on megaparsec scales, arising from the compression of hot gas and magnetic field lines. Behind the sloshing cold front, the cluster center shows decrement in RM magnitude by $\sim23.3\%$, as a result of the cancellation effect of randomly-oriented magnetic fields induced by sloshing-driven turbulence. We find that beam depolarization increases behind shock fronts and across sloshing cold fronts, indicating enhanced magnetic field fluctuations across the plane of the sky in both scenarios. By fully accounting for all radiative transfer coefficients in the PRT calculations, the uniform background light becomes more depolarized near the cluster center, with the effect growing more pronounced as background intensity decreases. This suggests that synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation of the intracluster medium can significantly influence the polarization of background sources.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes from inflation constrained by dark matter substructure</title>

Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of high-redshift massive galaxy candidates have initiated renewed interest in the important mystery around the formation and evolution of our Universe's largest supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We consider the possibility that some of them were seeded by the direct collapse of primordial density perturbations from inflation into primordial black holes and analyze the consequences of this on current dark matter substructures assuming non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbation distributions. We derive bounds on the enhanced curvature perturbation amplitude from the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in our Galaxy, observations of stellar streams and gravitational lensing. We find this bound region significantly overlaps with that required for SMBH seed formation and enables us to probe Gaussian and non-Gaussian curvature perturbations corresponding to the SMBH seeds in the range ${\cal O}(10^5$\text{--}$10^{12}) M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Gravitational Vector Modes and their Magnetogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03612v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the presence of primordial gravitational vector modes (V-modes) and their sourcing of primordial magnetic fields (PMF), i.e. magnetogenesis. As the adiabatic vector mode generically decays with expansion, we consider exotic initial conditions which circumvent this issue and lead to observational imprints. The first initial condition is an isocurvature mode between photons and neutrinos vorticities, and the second one is a non-trivial initial condition on the neutrino octupole. Both types of conditions sustain a constant vector mode on super Hubble scales at early times. We also consider a third scenario in which the adiabatic vector modes are rapidly sourced, at a given early but finite time, by an exotic component which develops an anisotropic stress. We find the best fitting parameters in these three cases to CMB and BAO data. We compare the resulting $B$-mode spectra of the CMB to data from BICEP/Keck and SPTpol. We find that none of the proposed initial conditions can produce large enough PMFs to seed every type of magnetic fields observed. However, V-modes are still consistent with the data and ought to be constrained for a better understanding of the primordial Universe before its hot big-bang phase.</description>

      <title>Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings with next-generation detector networks: Component separation based on a multi-source astrophysical foreground noise model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe and validating non-standard cosmological models. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. By constructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical foreground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact binary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter estimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical simulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1) The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\Delta G\mu / G\mu &lt; 0.5$ for $G\mu &gt; 3.5 \times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework; (2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard cosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies CBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of such signals could further refine $G\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of third-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates the intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological parameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing scientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Probing the cosmic baryon distribution and the impact of AGN feedback with FRBs in CROCODILE simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12741v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Missing Baryon problem using Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to trace cosmic baryons. Our CROCODILE simulations, performed with the GADGET3/4-OSAKA smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, include star formation, supernova (SN) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. We generate light cones from large-scale structure simulations to compute gas density profiles and dispersion measures (DMs) measurable by FRBs. Our results show that AGN feedback reduces central gas densities in halos, reshaping the boundary between the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). Zoom-in simulations reveal that AGN feedback significantly modulates the DM contributions from foreground halos along different sightlines. Using the DM-redshift (DM-z) relation up to z=1, we constrain the diffuse baryon mass fraction at z = 1 to f_diff = 0.865 (+0.101, -0.165) (fiducial) and f_diff = 0.856 (+0.101, -0.162) (NoBH), which include contributions from both IGM (f_IGM) and halos (f_Halos), serving as upper limits. We further separate and quantify the redshift evolution of f_CGM, f_IGM, and f_diff using both phase-based and structure-based definitions. From an observational perspective, we also distinguish the line-of-sight averaged quantity &lt; f_{diff,obs} &gt; from the intrinsic redshift-evolving f_diff(z), reflecting the statistical nature of FRB-based measurements. Our study provides a framework for understanding baryon distribution across cosmic structures, FRB host galaxies, and the role of AGN in shaping foreground DM contributions.</description>

      <title>Capturing Small-Scale Reionization Physics: A Sub-Grid Model for Photon Sinks with SCRIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The epoch of reionization represents a major phase transition in cosmic history, during which the first luminous sources ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the small-scale physics governing ionizing photon sinks - particularly the interplay between recombinations, photon propagation, and self-shielded regions - remains poorly understood. Accurately modeling these processes requires a framework that self-consistently links ionizing emissivity, the clumping factor, mean free path, and photoionization rate. In this work, we extend the photon-conserving semi-numerical framework, SCRIPT, by introducing a self-consistent sub-grid model that dynamically connects these quantities to the underlying density field, enabling a more realistic treatment of inhomogeneous recombinations and photon sinks. We validate our model against a comprehensive set of observational constraints, including the UV luminosity function from HST and JWST, CMB optical depth from Planck, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements of the IGM temperature, photoionization rate, and mean free path. Our fiducial model also successfully reproduces Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations, reinforcing its ability to capture large-scale inhomogeneities in the reionization process. Notably, we demonstrate that traditionally independent parameters, such as the clumping factor and mean free path, are strongly correlated, with implications for the timing, morphology, and thermal evolution of reionization. Looking ahead, we will extend this framework to include machine learning-based parameter inference. With upcoming 21cm experiments poised to provide unprecedented insights, SCRIPT offers a powerful computational tool for interpreting high-redshift observations and refining our understanding of the last major phase transition in the universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Preference for a Positive Neutrino Mass at 2.7$\sigma$: A Joint Analysis of DESI DR2, DESY5, and DESY1 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. {In this work, we obtain a high-confidence measurement of the neutrino mass within a dynamical DE framework. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a measurement for a non-zero, positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This high-confidence measurement is driven mainly by these factors: (i) the DESI's preference for a dynamical DE with its equation of state evolving from $w&lt; -1$ at early times to $w&gt; -1$ at late times, thus leading to a larger neutrino mass; (ii) treating $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a free parameter together with the inclusion of weak lensing data, which likewise allows for an increased neutrino mass.} In future, even higher-confidence measurements of neutrino mass are expected with stronger preferences for dynamical DE in light of more complete DESI data releases.</description>

Abstract: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Timescales of Quasar Accretion Discs from Low to High Black Hole Masses and a Turnover at the High Mass End</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characteristic time scales in the stochastic UV-optical variability of quasars may depend on the mass of their black holes, $M_{\rm BH}$, as much as physical timescales in their accretion discs do. We calculate emission-weighted mean radii, $R_{\rm mean}$, and orbital timescales, $t_{\rm mean}$, of standard thin disc models for emission wavelengths $\lambda$ from 1000 to 10000 AA, $M_{\rm BH}$ from $10^6$ to $10^{11}$ solar masses, and Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1. At low $M_{\rm BH}$, we find the textbook behaviour of $t_{\rm mean}\propto M_{\rm BH}^{-1/2}$ alongside $R_{\rm mean} \approx \mathrm{const}$, but toward higher masses the growing event horizon imposes $R_{\rm mean} \propto M_{\rm BH}$ and thus a turnover into $t_{\rm mean}\propto M_{\rm BH}$. For quasars of $\log L_{\rm bol}=47$, the turnover mass, where $t_{\rm mean}$ starts rising is $M_{\rm BH}\approx 9.5$, which means that the turnover in $t_{\rm mean}$ is well within the range of high-luminosity quasar samples, whose variability time scales might thus show little mass dependence. We fit smoothly broken power laws to the results and provide analytic convenience functions for $R_{\rm mean}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$ and $t_{\rm mean}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$.</description>

      <title>Hubble constant measurement from QPEs as electromagnetic counterparts to extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts provide a novel methodology to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens. However, the rarity of such multi-messenger events limits the precision of the $H_0$ constraint. Recently, the newly-discovered nuclear transient, quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme/intermediate mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as LISA. Here, we study the secular orbital evolution of QPE systems under different theoretical frameworks based on timing observation,including the stripping scenario and the orbiter-disk scenario, and assess their GW detectability by LISA. Here, we model the secular orbital evolution of known QPE systems using two frameworks: a stripping scenario in which periodic mass transfer at periapsis drives the evolution; and an orbiter-disk collision scenario in which the companion interacts with a misaligned accretion disk, modulated by coupled orbiter-disk precession. For each framework, we assess detectability by LISA, together with the resulting constraints on $H_0$. Our principal findings are: (i) in the stripping scenario, no currently known QPE reaches detectability within a four-year LISA mission. (ii) in the orbiter-disk scenario, two sources-eRO-QPE2 and eRO-QPE4-are detectable with signal-to-noise ratios $\simeq 8.5-28.8$ and constrain $H_0$ with frictional uncertainty of 6.7-14.9\%. QPE systems remain uncertain on the decade-long secular evolution. Therefore, they motivate continued time-domain monitoring of QPE candidates.</description>
