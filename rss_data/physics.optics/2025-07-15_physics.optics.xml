      <title>Geometric quantification of photonic 4D spin-orbit states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional photonic states have significantly advanced the fundamentals and applications of light. However, it remains huge challenges to quantify arbitrary states in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces with spin and orbital angular momentum bases. Here we introduce a geometric method to quantify arbitrary states in a 4D Hilbert space by interferometrically mapping them to unified centroid ellipses. Specifically, nine Stokes parameters can be deduced from three ellipses to quantify the 4D spin-orbit states described by SU(4) Poincar\'e hypersphere. We verify its feasibility by detecting these spin-orbit states gotten by both free-space wave plates and few-mode fibers. For the first time, we completely quantify and reconstruct higher-order modal group evolution of a weakly guiding few-mode fiber under twist perturbation. This geometric quantification, beyond the classical Stokes polarimetry, may pave the way to multi-dimensional optical metrology, sensing, and high-dimensional classical or quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of soliton molecules in a Kerr micro-ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical Kerr micro-ring provides an ideal platform for the study of dissipative optical solitons. Dissipative solitons are localized waves produced by a precise equilibrium between dispersion and nonlinearity, as well as gain and loss. Dissipative brilliant solitons are vulnerable to external noise,but dissipative dark solitons exhibit greater robustness against noise and losses. This study discusses the division of the input pump light field into transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic(TM) modes. TE mode generates bright solitons. TM mode forms dark solitons via cross-phase modulation (XPM), which induces a self-focusing effect. The bright and dark solitons bind into a soliton molecule pair through mutual interactions. We scan the entire detuning interval; within the positive small detuning interval, two modes simultaneously generate bright-dark soliton pair Turing roll states. Within the larger detuning interval, the excited Brillouin scattering noise induces a high suppression ratio (SR) between the dark and bright soliton pumps, which is unfavorable for the formation of the bright-dark soliton pair. The system provides a new multi-soliton manipulation scheme for optical communications. The soliton molecule pairs hold major implications for high precision measurement and all-optical controlling fields.</description>

      <title>Photonic Self-Learning in Ultrafast Laser-Induced Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can one design complex systems capable of learning for a given functionality? In the context of ultrafast laser-surface interaction, we unravel the nature of learning schemes tied to the emergence of complexity in dissipative structures. The progressive development of learning mechanisms, from direct information storage to the development of smart surfaces, originates from the network of curvatures formed in the unstable fluid under thermoconvective instability, which is subsequently quenched and resolidified. Under pulsed laser irradiation, non-equilibrium dynamics generate intricate nanoscale patterns, unveiling adaptive process mechanisms. We demonstrate that the imprints left by light act as a form of structural memory, encoding not only local effects directed by laser field polarization but also a cooperative strategy of reliefs that dynamically adjust surface morphology to optimize light capture. By investigating how apparent complexity and optical response are intricately intertwined, shaping one another, we establish a framework that draws parallels between material adaptation and learning dynamics observed in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Tunable Entangled Photon Source for Multiplexed Time-Resolved Fluorescence on a Nanophotonic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact, scalable, and multiplexed fluorescence lifetime sensors are of great interest for point-of-care diagnostics. However, current solutions either lack broad-range wavelength-tuning capabilities or involve complex optical setups that hinder miniaturization. On-chip entangled photon sources offer a promising alternative for time-resolved spectroscopy with their strong temporal correlations, tunable spectral characteristics, and small footprints. Here, we develop a temperature-tunable, visible quantum light source on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) with a continuous tuning range greater than one octave, spanning 564.5~nm to 1.494~$\mu$m using only one waveguide. The tunability is enabled by utilizing type-I phase matching. We measured an on-chip efficiency of \boldmath$(3.88\pm0.20)\times10^{9}$ pairs/s/mW, comparable to the most efficient type-0 bulk lithium niobate sources. These results show that the TFLN platform is ideal for on-chip integrated photonic and multiplexed lifetime imaging and sensing.</description>

      <title>Revealing Material-Dependent Bicircular High-Order Harmonic Generation in 2D Semiconductors via Real-Space Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state high-order harmonic generation (HHG) presents unique features different from gases.Whereas the gaseous harmonics driven by counter-rotating bicircular (CRB) pulse universally peak at a "magic" field ratio approximately E_2{\omega}:E_{\omega}=1.5:1, crystals exhibit significant material-dependent responses. In monolayer MoS2, the harmonic yield experiences two maxima at the gas-like 1.5:1 ratio, and again in the single-color limit, whereas monolayer hBN shows a monotonic increase as the 2{\omega} component dominates. Combining time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) and a minimal real-space trajectory analysis, we show that these differences arise from the interplay of Bloch velocity and anomalous Hall velocity. The trajectory model quantitatively reproduces the ab-initio results, and offers an intuitive prediction of the harmonics yield without further heavy computation. These insights provide practical guidance for tailoring solid-state HHG and for selecting 2D compounds with desirable responses.</description>

      <title>Dual-circular Raman optical activity of axial multipolar order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipolar order, such as octupolar order, is one of the key concepts of condensed matter physics, particularly in light of elusive hidden orders. However, its experimental identification remains challenging due to the absence of direct coupling to conventional external stimuli. In this study, we propose that dual-circular Raman scattering serves as a detection of multipolar anisotropies. By combining symmetry analysis with microscopic tight-binding calculations, we demonstrate that both time-reversal-even ($\theta$-even) and time-reversal-odd ($\theta$-odd) axial multipolar phases exhibit the Raman optical activity as a direct consequence of mirror symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we find that the Stokes and anti-Stokes spectra encode the time-reversal parity of the multipolar order, providing an all-optical means to distinguish multipolar phases. Our findings open a pathway for identifying multipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and versatile probe.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field-Induced Second-Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental nonlinear optical process widely used in photonics; however, it is strictly forbidden in the bulk of centrosymmetric materials due to their inversion symmetry. Nevertheless, applying an external electric field breaks this inversion symmetry. It induces an effective second-order nonlinear response known as the electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation (EFISH) effect. This mechanism enables SHG even in centrosymmetric media and provides a powerful tool for dynamic and electrically tunable nonlinear nanophotonics. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the EFISH effect, covering the fundamentals, various material platforms (including bulk semiconductor crystals, ferroelectrics, van der Waals materials, and polymers), as well as diverse strategies for electric field engineering. It further distinguishs EFISH from related effects such as current-induced SHG and the quantum-confined Stark effect, and highlight emerging applications of EFISH in tunable photonic devices, carrier dynamics probing, and nonlinear optical modulation across optical, electronic, and THz regimes. Finally, key challenges and perspectives for the future development of electrically controlled nonlinear optical systems are outlined.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Uniaxial Effective Complex Permittivity of Two-phase Composites and Optimal or Near Optimal Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic materials with a uniaxial effective permittivity tensor, characterized by its transverse ($\epsilon_\perp$) and axial ($\epsilon_\parallel$) components, play a central role in the design of advanced photonic and electromagnetic materials including hyperbolic metamaterials, and biological imaging platforms. Tight bounds on the complex effective permittivity of such metamaterials are critical for predicting and optimizing their macroscopic electromagnetic response. While rigorous tight bounds exist for isotropic two-phase composites, corresponding results for uniaxial composites remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the attainable range of $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ in the quasistatic regime for two-phase metamaterials with isotropic homogeneous phases. By analyzing known microgeometries and constructing hierarchical laminates (HLs), we demonstrate that the classical bounds on $\epsilon_\perp$ are not optimal. We conjecture improved bounds based on numerically fitted circular arcs derived from convex hulls of $\epsilon_\perp$ values obtained from HLs, and we identify optimal rank-4 HL structures that achieve all points on the conjectured bounds. Additionally, we quantify the correlation between $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ for fixed volume fractions, and propose a design algorithm to construct HL microstructures achieving prescribed values of $\epsilon_\perp$. Leveraging the Cherkaev-Gibiansky transformation and the translation method, we extend recent techniques developed for isotropic composites by Kern-Miller-Milton to derive translation bounds on the uniaxial complex effective permittivity tensor. Finally, bounds on the sensitivity of the effective permittivity tensor of low-loss composites are obtained and their optimality is shown in two-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Topological Magneto-optical Kerr Effect without Spin-orbit Coupling in Spin-compensated Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the differential reflection of oppositely circularly polarized light, has traditionally been associated with relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which links a particle's spin with its orbital motion. In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination of magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets, SOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization. Theoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic materials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in systems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental verification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and magnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a Sagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and their reversal. Our findings establish experimentally a new mechanism for generating large MOKE signals and position chiral spin textures in compensated magnets as a compelling platform for ultrafast, stray-field-immune opto-spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Chiral solitons in quadratic quasi-phase-matched photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quasi-phase-matched technique in quadratic nonlinear crystals, constructing an artificial gauge field by changing the inclination angle of stripes, which is realized by the positive and negative polarization directions of nonlinear susceptibility along the crystal. Unlike the artificial gauge field constructed through linear coupling in other settings, the gauge field in this system is realized by nonlinear coupling. We demonstrate that this gauge field can generate stable chiral solitons with chiral energy flow rotating around the solitons. In contrast to conventional chiral currents generated with the same specie or frequency, the chiral currents in the present system are formed by mutual coupling between fundamental frequency and second harmonic components. We derive the semi-analytical solution for the chiral energy flow in this system. It is found that there exists an optimal inclination angle that can maximize the chiral energy flow under different parameters, and this optimal inclination shows a positive correlation with the power and detuning. The mobility and collisions of the chiral solitons are also discussed. The results show that chiral solitons move in response to kicking and undergo fully elastic collisions with each other. In addition, the possibility of experimentally generating chiral solitons and chiral currents is outlined.</description>

      <title>Curvature-adaptive gigapixel microscopy at submicron resolution and centimeter scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-area microscopy with submicron resolution is limited by tradeoffs between field of view (FOV), resolution, and imaging speed. Samples are rarely flat across centimeter-scale FOV, which often requires existing solutions to use mechanical scanning to ensure focused capture at reduced throughput. Here, we present PANORAMA, a single-shot, re-imaging microscope that achieves seamless, gigapixel imaging over a 16.3$\times$18.8 $\text{mm}^2$ FOV at 0.84 um resolution without mechanical scanning. By using a telecentric photolithography lens, a large-aperture tube lens, and a flat micro-camera array with adaptive per-camera focus control, PANORAMA maintains submicron focus across flat, curved or uneven samples that span centimeters. This approach improves imaging throughput and adaptability, enabling gigapixel multi-modal microscopy of large flat and non-flat samples in one shot, thus broadening its applications in biomedical and materials imaging.</description>

      <title>Tunable Nanophotonic Devices and Cavities based on a Two-Dimensional Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central to the field of nanophotonics is the ability to engineer the flow of light through nanoscale structures. These structures often have permanent working spectral ranges and optical properties that are fixed during fabrication. Quantum materials, with their correlated and intertwined degrees of freedom, offer a promising avenue for dynamically controlling photonic devices without altering their physical structure. Here, we fabricate photonic crystal slabs from CrSBr, a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor, and demonstrate unprecedented in situ control over their optical properties. Leveraging the combination of the exceptionally large refractive index of CrSBr near its excitonic resonances and its tunability via external fields, we achieve precise manipulation of photonic modes at near-visible and infrared wavelengths, showcasing a new paradigm for nanophotonic device design. The resulting guided resonances of the photonic crystal are tightly packed in the spectrum with very small mode volumes, are highly tunable via external magnetic fields, and exhibit high Q-factors exceeding 500. These resonances self-hybridize with the excitonic degrees of freedom, resulting in intrinsic strong light-matter coupling. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum materials for developing in situ tunable photonic elements and cavities.</description>

      <title>Distributed Fiber-Optic Sensing based Single-Lane Abnormal Event Detection in Low-Density Traffic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09927v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) based traffic flow monitoring systems are a cost-effective wide-area traffic monitoring solution that utilize existing fiber infrastructure along roads. These systems analyse vehicle vibrations and measure average traffic speeds to detect traffic events. However, these systems face difficulties in detecting early signs of non-recurring traffic congestions in low-density traffic flow caused by presence of single-lane abnormal events. This is because average traffic speeds do not decrease quickly in such events. During abnormal events, multiple vehicles perform spontaneous braking and abrupt lane-changes to avoid obstacles on travel lanes. These vehicle behaviours gradually lead to traffic congestion. Thus, frequent lane-change maneuver, performed by multiple vehicles at similar location, may suggest occurrence of congestion-inducing abnormal events. This paper discusses methods to identify and locate occurrence of these single-lane abnormal events by detecting frequent lane-change maneuver along road sections. We first propose a method to locate vehicle positions along a road section and estimate the vehicle path. We then propose a method to detect vehicle lane-change maneuver by monitoring variations in spectral centroid of vehicle vibrations. The evaluation of our proposed methods with real traffic data for two different expressways showed 81.5% accuracy for individual vehicle path tracking and 83.5% accuracy in lane-change event detection. These results suggest that the proposed method has potential for detecting occurrence of single-lane abnormal events in low-density traffic flow so that necessary mitigation measures can be initiated before onset of traffic congestions.</description>

      <title>Hopping and orbiting of Mie-resonant nanoparticles in optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers have become a powerful tool for measuring parameters of microscale and nanoscale local environments. Motion of particles within optical tweezer traps established itself as a probe for local viscosity, temperature as well as external fields. However, complex motions of trapped particles such as hopping or orbiting conventionally relies on intricate structure of the optical trap, which creates limitations to their applicability, in particular in challenging environments such as living matter. Here we demonstrate experimentally polarization-dependent hopping and orbiting of particles in an optical trap formed by a single Gaussian beam. This novel effect is observed for subwavelength particles with sizes above approximately $\lambda/3$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the trapping beam. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the hopping and orbiting arises via the excitation of {\it higher-order Mie resonances}. While smaller particles experiencing dipolar optical forces remain trapped at the beam center, larger particles experience quadrupole optical forces exhibiting more complex behavior. Under linearly polarized illumination, larger particles show {\it bistable dynamics} hopping between two stable positions. Under circularly polarized illumination, trapped particles orbit around the beam center, revealing a light-induced spin-to-orbital angular momentum transfer. Experimental trajectory analysis reveals power-tunable hopping rates and angular velocities. We discuss the effect of VO$_2$ monoclinic-to-rutile phase change on the observed effect. Our results present a robust and reliable way to achieve complex behavior of a particle in simple single-beam tweezers. This should enhance sensitivity of parameter measurements for local environments via optical forces, such as viscosity and temperature inside cells.</description>

      <title>Precision Thermometry of Flat Flames Using Spatially Resolved Multi-Color Laser Absorption Spectroscopy of Carbon Dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work developed an accurate and robust absorption-based method for spatially resolved measurements of gas temperatures in flames and reacting flows, with typical single-measurement uncertainties on the order of 1\%. This method exploits narrow-linewidth laser absorption of hot CO$_2$ molecules, which can be generated from combustion or artificially seeded into the flow. A collinear dual-laser setup allowed for periodic scans over tens of CO$_2$ absorption transitions near the $\nu_3$ bandhead every 100 $\mu s$, from which gas temperatures (as well as CO$_2$ concentrations) were determined with high sensitivity and robustness. Spatially resolved measurements were achieved using an electrically driven high-speed beam scanning system consisting of a 2-D galvo scanner and a pair of off-axis parabolic mirrors. An effective spatial resolution of 1 mm was achieved at a planar field measurement speed of 200 Hz and a volumetric field measurement speed of 2 Hz, with further improvements in speed anticipated by another order of magnitude. A physically constrained nonlinear inference framework was also developed for the quantitative analysis of the measurement data. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed on axisymmetric flames stabilized on a Mckenna burner at various equivalence ratios and flow rates, and the results agreed asymptotically with the theoretical value of the adiabatic flame temperature. An additional experiment on a flame of complex geometry demonstrated an excellent level of resolution, precision, and contrast achieved by the current thermometry method. This method promises to provide good utility in future combustion studies due to its high performance metrics and relative ease of use.</description>

      <title>Young's double-slit experiment with anisotropic GHz surface acoustic waves on gallium arsenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate Young's double-slit experiment with GHz surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on gallium arsenide (GaAs). This experiment differs from the well-known optical case due to the anisotropy of SAW propagation on GaAs. We generate SAWs using an interdigital transducer (IDT), and the double-slit is realized by focused ion beam milled grooves which block the SAWs. We measure the out-of-plane SAW displacement with an optical scanning interferometer and apply a spatial Fourier filtering technique, enabling the observation of the two-slit interference pattern, as well as higher order diffraction and near field interference effects. We find reasonable agreement between the measured far-field interference pattern and anisotropic Huygens-Fresnel simulations based on previously reported angle-dependent SAW velocities on GaAs.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Spectral Fusion Super-Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy based on Progressively Saturated Upconversion Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-beam scanning microscopy (SBSM) is one of the most robust strategies for commercial optical systems. Although structured illumination combined with Fourier-domain spatial spectrum fusion can enhance SBSM resolution beyond the diffraction limit, a sophisticated detection system is still required to optimize both effective resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.Here, we report that the diverse nonlinear responses of upconversion nanoparticles can unlock a new mode of Computational Progressively Emission Saturated Nanoscopy (CPSN), which employs a single doughnut-shaped excitation beam assisted by deep learning to simplify conventional microscopy. By modulating the excitation power, the smooth transition of the point spread function (PSF) from doughnut-shaped to Gaussian can be achieved, allowing for accessing different spatial frequency components of the sample. Then, in order to enhance time resolution, the doughnut-shaped beam at low power and the saturated Gaussian-like image were predicted by the doughnut-shaped beam at low saturation threshold based on the power dependence curve. Furthermore, a deep recursive residual network (DRRN) is employed to fusion these progressively complementary spatial frequency information into a final super-resolved image that encompasses the full frequency wwinformation. This approach can achieve high-quality super-resolution imaging with a spatial resolution of 33 nm, corresponding to 1/29th of the excitation wavelength, 55 dB of SNR ratio contracted to 7 dB in Gaussian imaging and applicable to any wavelength. The unique combination of nonlinear saturation and deep learning computational reconstruction could open a new avenue for simplifying the optical system and enhancing imaging quality in single-beam super-resolution nanoscopy.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the gas phase high harmonic generation process on the driving laser-field duration and intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since the advent of high-order harmonic generation, one of the main goals has been to maximize the high harmonic yield. This is due to the wide range of applications in multidisciplinary research fields, including nonlinear XUV optics and ultrafast science. Nowadays, intense laser-atom interactions are one of the primary sources of high-order harmonic generation, emitting radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) range. Although the scaling laws for XUV photon numbers have been extensively studied in the past, their dependence on the duration of the driving laser pulse has remained largely unexplored experimentally. This is because, in each of these studies, the XUV photon yield was optimized according to the specific characteristics of the lasers used and the corresponding XUV beamlines. In other words, there have been no systematic measurements on the dependence of XUV yield on the duration of the driving laser pulse. Here, by taking advantage of the SYLOS laser system at ELI ALPS, we are able to experimentally investigate this long-standing question. We found that for driving laser field intensities below the saturation threshold of harmonic generation, the harmonic yield depends linearly on the pulse duration. However, for laser intensities near to the harmonic yield saturation, the harmonic yield is inversely proportional to the pulse duration.</description>

      <title>Complex structured light generation using printed liquid crystal droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inkjet-printed liquid crystal (LC) droplets exhibit an intricate spatially-varying birefringence due to their complex internal director configuration. While such anisotropy is often viewed as a drawback when LC droplets are used as microlenses, here we leverage this remarkable birefringence property to generate complex structured light. Through a selection of the alignment layer, and by varying the chiral pitch, we create three distinct droplet types with tailored intrinsic director configurations, each exhibiting a unique birefringence distribution for structured light beam generation. We show that these printed LC droplets can generate beams that exhibit skyrmionic structures carrying two units of orbital angular momentum, beams that contain azimuthal/radial polarized fields, and beams with polarization singularities. Our method enables new possibilities for using LC droplet technology to engineer sophisticated optical beam patterns.</description>

      <title>Attosecond charge transfer in atomic-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons in atoms and molecules move on attosecond time scales. Deciphering their quantum dynamics in space and time calls for high-resolution microscopy at this speed. While scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) driven with terahertz pulses has visualized sub-picosecond motion of single atoms, the advent of attosecond light pulses has provided access to the much faster electron dynamics. Yet, combining direct atomic spatial and attosecond temporal resolution remained challenging. Here, we reveal atomic-scale quantum motion of single electrons in attosecond lightwave-driven STM. Near-infrared single-cycle waveforms from phase-controlled optical pulse synthesis steer and clock electron tunnelling. By keeping the thermal load of the tip-sample junction stable, thereby eliminating thermal artifacts, we detect waveform-dependent currents on sub-cycle time scales. Our joint theory-experiment campaign shows that single-cycle near-infrared pulses can drive isolated electronic wave packets shorter than 1 fs. The angstrom-scale decay of the tunnelling current earmarks a fascinating interplay of multi-photon and field-driven dynamics. By balancing these effects, we sharply image a single copper adatom on a silver surface with lightwave-driven currents. This long-awaited fusion of attosecond science with atomic-scale STM makes elementary dynamics of electrons inside atoms, molecules and solids accessible to direct spatio-temporal videography and atom-scale petahertz electronics.</description>

      <title>Quantized Orbital Angular Momentum from Discrete Chaotic Phase Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new theory for orbital angular momentum (OAM) generation by chaotic phase surfaces with discrete integer bias distributions. We derive fundamental selection rules that determine which OAM modes can be coherently generated. Our analysis shows that ensemble-averaged OAM exists only when the bias parameter takes integer values that match the discrete OAM eigenspace, creating "allowed" and "forbidden" OAM levels. We derive analytical expressions for the OAM power spectrum and demonstrate universal caling behavior within the allowed manifold. These theoretical predictions are validated by comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, which confirm the selection rules with a forbidden-level suppression factor exceeding 10^4 and demonstrate the universal scaling with exceptional accuracy.</description>

      <title>High efficiency, high quality factor active membrane metasurfaces with extended Kerker effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10260v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient, low-power, and highly integrated optoelectronic devices remain a critical yet challenging goal.Here, we introduce the extended Kerker effect paradigm that synergizes Kerker's condition with quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) to overcome these limitations. By engineering dual-mode dispersion, we achieve a high efficiency beam deflector using a membrane metasurface, simultaneously realizing robust parameter tolerance and narrow-linewidth resonances-two typically conflicting properties.Our experiment demonstrates an absolute beam deflection efficiency exceeding 92%, with exceptional spectral and spatial selectivity, including a 4 GHz linewidth, a 2.8o divergence angle, and a quality factor of 114. Additionally, it enables 94% transmission intensity modulation at a pump intensity as low as 0.5 W/cm2 in experiments. The extended Kerker effect provides a scalable platform for energy-efficient and integrable optoelectronic devices, paving the way for transformative advancements in next-generation wireless communications and LiDAR.</description>

      <title>Experimental proposal of a mode sorter for vector vortex beams of arbitrary order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme for sorting vector vortex beams using a system of three optical cavities. The method targets the separation of the four vector vortex modes of a given order m by exploiting their symmetry properties with respect to radial axes. The first cavity separates the modes into two pairs, one symmetric and one antisymmetric under horizontal flip, by transmitting one pair and reflecting the other. Each output is then directed into a second cavity, which further resolves the pairs into individual modes based on their parity. A key element between the cavities is a novel system introduced in this work, the Profile Rotator (PR), which rigidly rotates the beam profile (including its polarization structure) using an appropriately calibrated K-mirror and a Faraday rotator. The theoretical framework is based on the analysis of mode symmetries and their interaction with cavity boundary conditions. This work lays the groundwork for experimental implementations of efficient mode sorting, with potential applications in high-dimensional quantum information processing, optical communications, and structured light manipulation.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous integration of silicon nitride and amorphous silicon carbide photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) has emerged as a compelling candidate for applications in integrated photonics, known for its high refractive index, high optical quality, high thermo-optic coefficient, and strong third-order nonlinearities. Furthermore, a-SiC can be easily deposited via CMOS-compatible chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, allowing for precise thickness control and adjustable material properties on arbitrary substrates. Silicon nitride (SiN) is an industrial well-established and well-matured platform, which exhibits ultra-low propagation loss, but it is suboptimal for high-density reconfigurable photonics due to the large minimum bending radius and constrained tunability. In this work, we monolithically combine a-SiC with SiN photonics, leveraging the merits of both platforms, and achieve the a-SiC/SiN heterogeneous integration with an on-chip interconnection loss of 0.32$\pm$0.10 dB, and integration density increment exceeding 4,444-fold. By implementing active devices on a-SiC, we achieve 27 times higher thermo-optic tuning efficiency, with respect to the SiN photonic platform. In addition, the a-SiC/SiN platform gives the flexibility to choose the optimal fiber-to-chip coupling strategy depending on the interfacing platform, with efficient side-coupling on SiN and grating-coupling on a-SiC platform. The proposed a-SiC/SiN photonic platform can foster versatile applications in programmable and quantum photonics, nonlinear optics, and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct writing laser (DWL) grayscale lithography is introduced as a novel fabrication technique for multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) phase masks, enabling direct transfer of precise depth profiles onto substrates via reactive ion etching and subsequent reflective coating. An MPLC system employing these masks achieves 92% fidelity in converting a Gaussian (TEM (0,0)) input to a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG(0,0)) mode. The fabricated masks exhibit sub-10 nm vertical resolution, surface roughness below 3 nm, and an R-squared value of 0.976. This method provides a scalable alternative to conventional multi-step lithographic fabrication for advanced photonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infamous weakness of molecular chiroptical responses challenges the all-optical realization of crucial applications such as enantio-selective sorting of chiral molecules, or biasing chiral chemical reactions. Chiral optical cavities are a natural choice for confronting this challenge. Ideally, the dissymmetry between the two helicities inside such cavities is maximized. In here, we propose a chiral infrared optical cavity formed by planar mirrors made of diffracting lattices of silver helices with almost maximum electromagnetic chirality. It combines the strong helicity selectivity of the helices with the helicity-preserving reflectivity that planar systems show at large incidence angles. For the manifold of cavity modes which have a component with zero in-plane momentum, we demonstrate an unprecedented dissymmetry of 95 % inside the cavity at the target frequency, making it a compelling candidate for enantio-selective applications.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry and antisymmetry breaking in a ring with two potential barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fundamental setup for the realization of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and spontaneous antisymmetry breaking (SASB) in the framework of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation with the self-attractive and repulsive cubic term, respectively, on a one-dimensional ring split in two mutually symmetric boxes by delta-functional potential barriers, placed at opposite points. The system is relevant to optics and BEC. The spectrum of the linearized system is found in analytical and numerical forms. SSB and SASB are predicted by dint of the variational approximation, and studied in the numerical form. A particular stable solution, which demonstrates strong asymmetry, is found in an exact form. In the system with the attractive nonlinearity, the SSB of the symmetric ground state is initiated by the modulational instability. It creates stationary asymmetric states through a supercritical bifurcation. In the self-repulsive system, SASB makes the lowest antisymmetric excited state unstable, transforming it into an antisymmetry-breaking oscillatory mode.</description>

Abstract: Melanosomes are organelles found in a wide variety of tissues throughout the animal kingdom. They contain a variety of biological molecules, but the dominant constituent is the pigment melanin, and many functions ascribed to melanosomes, such as photoprotection, are uniquely enabled by the chemical properties and structures of the melanins they contain. In this report, we used, for the first time, Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to examine fluorescent properties of pigments in melanosomes and evaluate their time evolution upon extended laser irradiation. We discovered a relatively short-lived component in fluorescence emission and revealed significant changes in lifetimes upon irradiation indicating structural photoinduced changes to melanin occurring on a time scale of minutes, with observations extending up to one hour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>How to Fix Silver for Plasmonics</title>

Abstract: Silver (Ag) is considered an ideal material for plasmonic applications in the visible wavelength regime due to its superior optical properties, but its use is limited by the poor chemical stability and structural quality of thermally evaporated thin films and resulting nanostructures. In this study, we present a simple approach to enhance the structural and optical quality as well as the chemical stability of Ag thin films by alloying with gold (Au) through thermal co-evaporation. We investigate Ag$_{100-x}$Au$_x$ thin films with Au contents ranging from 5 to 20 at% analyzing their surface morphology, crystallite structure, optical properties, and chemical stability. Our results show that low Au concentrations significantly reduce the roughness of co-evaporated thin films (down to 0.4 nm RMS), and significantly enhance the resistance to oxidation, while maintaining a defined crystallite growth. Importantly, these improvements are achieved without the need for template stripping, metallic wetting layers, or epitaxial substrates, enabling direct deposition on glass. Among the compositions studied, Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ thin films exhibit the highest chemical stability, lowest optical losses in the visible spectral range, and excellent plasmonic properties even outcompeting pure Ag. As a proof-of-concept, we fabricate high-quality Ag$_{95}$Au$_5$ optical antennas that exhibit long-term durability under ambient conditions. Our approach provides a practical solution to overcome the limitations of Ag for plasmonic device applications.</description>

      <title>Surface scattering of atoms for high-sensitivity spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-sensitivity laser spectroscopy is integral to applications like atomic clocks, quantum computers, and chemical sensing. Lowering atomic temperature decreases spectral Doppler broadening and increases transit time across the excitation laser. We find that a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coated surface can cool iron atoms from ~1400 K to room temperature by surface scattering. It is also apparent that a single scattering event is enough for atoms to equilibrate with the PDMS surface temperature. Further, we show the very low adsorption of iron and ytterbium atoms on PDMS, an effect that persists to surface temperatures of 200 K. Through numerical simulation, we demonstrate the potential use of surface scattering in making a room temperature source of collimated atoms with enhanced flux and reduced velocity compared to that without surface scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing large-scale quantum resources is an important foundation for further improving the efficiency and scalability of quantum communication. Here, we present an efficient extraction and stable control scheme of 40 pairs of entangled sideband modes from the squeezed light by specially designing optical parametric oscillator. Utilizing the low-loss optical frequency comb control technology and the local cross-correlation algorithm, we model and manage the efficient separation process of the entangled sidebands modes facilitated by the optical filtering cavities, a maximum entanglement level of 6.5 dB is achieved. The feasibility of large-capacity quantum dense coding based on these entangled sideband modes is proved experimentally, which is of great significance for optimizing the utilization of quantum resources, thereby contributing to the advancement of large-capacity quantum communication networks and enabling the realization of more secure and efficient quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>High Resolution Temperature-Resolved Spectroscopy of the Nitrogen Vacancy $^{1}E$ Singlet State Ionization Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged diamond nitrogen-vacancy ($\mathrm{{NV}^-}$) center plays a central role in many cutting edge quantum sensing applications; despite this, much is still unknown about the energy levels in this system. The ionization energy of the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ singlet state in the $\mathrm{{NV}^-}$ has only recently been measured at between 2.25 eV and 2.33 eV. In this work, we further refine this energy by measuring the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ energy as a function of laser wavelength and diamond temperature via magnetically mediated spin-selective photoluminescence (PL) quenching; this PL quenching indicating at what wavelength ionization induces population transfer from the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ into the neutral $\mathrm{{NV}^0}$ charge configuration. Measurements are performed for excitation wavelengths between 450 nm and 470 nm and between 540 nm and 566 nm in increments of 2 nm, and for temperatures ranging from about 50 K to 150 K in 5 K increments. We determine the $\mathrm{^{1}E}$ ionization energy to be between 2.29 and 2.33 eV, which provides about a two-fold reduction in uncertainty of this quantity. Distribution level: A.

      <title>Dynamic off-the-grid untangling of curves by Riemannian metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an improved strategy for point sources tracking in a temporal stack through an off-the-grid fashion, inspired by the Benamou-Brenier regularisation in the literature. We define a lifting of the problem in the higher-dimensional space of the roto-translation group. This allows us to overcome the theoretical limitation of the off-the-grid method towards tangled point source trajectories, thus enabling the reconstruction and untangling even from the numerical standpoint. We define accordingly a new regularisation based on the relaxed Reeds-Shepp metric, an approximation of the sub-Riemannian Reeds-Shepp metric, further allowing control on the local curvature of the recovered trajectories. Then, we derive some properties of the discretisation and prove a $\Gamma$-convergence result, fostering interest for practical applications of polygonal, B\'ezier, and piecewise geodesic discretisation. We finally test our proposed method on a localisation problem example, and give a fair comparison with the state-of-the-art off-the-grid method.</description>

      <title>Polaritonic Machine Learning for Graph-based Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic and polaritonic systems offer a fast and efficient platform for accelerating machine learning (ML) through physics-based computing. To gain a computational advantage, however, polaritonic systems must: (1) exploit features that specifically favor nonlinear optical processing; (2) address problems that are computationally hard and depend on these features; (3) integrate photonic processing within broader ML pipelines. In this letter, we propose a polaritonic machine learning approach for solving graph-based data problems. We demonstrate how lattices of condensates can efficiently embed relational and topological information from point cloud datasets. This information is then incorporated into a pattern recognition workflow based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leading to significantly improved learning performance compared to physics-agnostic methods. Our extensive benchmarking shows that photonic machine learning achieves over 90\% accuracy for Betti number classification and clique detection tasks - a substantial improvement over the 35\% accuracy of bare CNNs. Our study introduces a distinct way of using photonic systems as fast tools for feature engineering, while building on top of high-performing digital machine learning.</description>

      <title>Application of RESNET50 Convolution Neural Network for the Extraction of Optical Parameters in Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimation of the optical properties of scattering media such as tissue is important in diagnostics as well as in the development of techniques to image deeper. As light penetrates the sample scattering events occur that alter the propagation direction of the photons in a random manner leading degradation of image quality. The distribution of the scattered light does, however, give a measure of the optical properties such as the reduced scattering coefficient and the absorption coefficient. Unfortunately, inverting scattering patterns to recover the optical properties is not simple especially in the regime where the light is partially randomized. Machine learning has been proposed by several authors as a means of recovering these properties from either the back scattered or the transmitted light. In the present paper we train a general purpose convolutional neural network RESNET 50 with simulated data based on Monte Carlo simulations. We show that compared with previous work our approach gives comparable or better reconstruction accuracy with training on a much smaller dataset. Moreover, by training on multiple parameters such as the intensity distribution at multiple planes or the exit angle and spatial distribution one achieves improved performance compared to training on a single input such as the intensity distribution captured at the sample surface. While our approach gives good parameter reconstruction, we identify factors that limit accuracy of the recovered properties, particularly the absorption coefficient. In the light of these limitations, we suggest how the present approach may be enhanced for even better performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical neural networks present distinct advantages over traditional electrical counterparts, such as accelerated data processing and reduced energy consumption. While coherent light is conventionally employed in optical neural networks, our study proposes harnessing spatially incoherent light in all-optical Fourier neural networks. Contrary to numerical predictions of declining target recognition accuracy with increased incoherence, our experimental results demonstrate a surprising outcome: improved accuracy with incoherent light. We attribute this unexpected enhancement to spatially incoherent light's ability to alleviate experimental errors like diffraction rings, laser speckle, and edge effects. Our controlled experiments introduced spatial incoherence by passing monochromatic light through a spatial light modulator featuring a dynamically changing random phase array. These findings underscore partially coherent light's potential to optimize optical neural networks, delivering dependable and efficient solutions for applications demanding consistent accuracy and robustness across diverse conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Brillouin and Raman lasers, light is amplified by an input pump light through the excited acoustic and molecular oscillations in a medium. However, can medium oscillations alone amplify light in a realistic photonic circuit? Here, we demonstrate that modulating an optical resonator by a traveling wave having the frequency and phase velocity much smaller than the frequency and phase velocity of light can result in dramatically large light amplification accompanied by conversion to multiple comb lines within a relatively small frequency band. Our calculations show that the proposed light amplifier can be realized in a lithium niobate racetrack resonator with millimeter-scale perimeter modulated by a surface acoustic wave with a surprisingly small amplitude and with the propagation constant satisfying the Brillouin phase matching condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gradient force is the conservative component of many types of forces exerted by light on particles. When it is derived from a potential, there is no heat transferred to the particle interacting with the light field. However, most theoretical descriptions of the gradient force use simplified configurations of the light field and particle interactions which overlook small amounts of heating. It is known that quantum fluctuations contribute to a very small but observable momentum diffusion of atoms and a corresponding increase in their temperature. This paper examines the contribution to momentum diffusion from a gradient force described as a quantum interaction between electron wave packets and a classical electromagnetic field. Stimulated transfers of photons between interfering light beams produce a small amount of heating that is difficult to detect in laboratory experiments. However the solar corona, with its thermal electrons irradiated by an intense electromagnetic field, provides ideal conditions for such a measurement. Heating from stimulated transfers contributes a large fraction of the observed coronal heating. Furthermore, the energy removed from the light field produces a wavelength shift of its spectrum as it travels through free electrons. Theory predicts a stimulated transfer redshift comparable to the redshift of distant objects observed in astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is widely applied in various industries, enabling detailed analysis of material properties or composition through their spectral signatures. However, for classification of construction and demolition waste (CDW) materials, HSI is impractical since real-time sorting requires rapid data acquisition and lightweight classification. Instead, fitting selected narrowband filters onto standard cameras can achieve comparable results with substantially reduced computational overhead. In this study, reflectance data of common CDW materials were recorded using a hyperspectral camera, and a multilayer perceptron classifier was employed to evaluate different feature sets. The findings indicate that adding only two wavelengths beyond the RGB channels is sufficient for high-accuracy classification, with optimal filter central wavelengths identified at approximately 650-750 nm and 850-1000 nm across the tested bandwidths (5-50 nm) highlighting the importance of near-infrared regions for material discrimination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) can achieve a $2\times$ resolution enhancement beyond the classical diffraction limit by employing illumination translations with respect to the object. This method has also been successfully implemented in a ``blind'' configuration, i.e., with unknown illumination patterns, allowing for more relaxed constraints on the control of illumination delivery. Here, we present a similar approach using a novel super-resolution algorithm that employs a generalized version of the popular Richardson-Lucy algorithm, alongside an optimized and customized optical setup. Both numerical and experimental validations demonstrate that our technique exhibits high noise resilience. Moreover, by implementing random translations instead of ``ordered'' ones, noise-related artifacts are reduced. These advancements enable wide-field super-resolved imaging with significantly reduced optical complexity.</description>

      <title>Timing-injection locking in a self-starting Mamyshev oscillator induced by the dissipative Faraday instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mamyshev oscillators (MOs), a novel class of passively mode-locked fiber lasers, serve as an excellent platform to explore complex nonlinear dynamics, ranging from localized structures to chaos. Despite their versatility, achieving self-starting mode-locking remains a significant challenge. In this study, we unveil the critical role of the dissipative Faraday instability (DFI) in facilitating the self-starting process of MOs, where the DFI triggers the symmetry breaking of the homogeneous solution to overcome the initiation barriers. A panoramic view of several distinct operational regimes with distinct DFI patterns is provided, namely the non-self-starting states, the irregular patterns, the harmonic mode locking regime, the stable single pulse and the stable multi pulse regime. For the lattest case, we uncover the origins of randomness in these pulse sequences through analyzing the causality between the timing of the random pulses and the initial seeding conditions. Building upon these findings, we propose the novel time-injection locking technique to customize the temporal locations of the pulses as well as the pattern timing in MOs, thus demonstrating its potential for applications in all-optical data storage and tunable ultrashort pulse sources.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Hieratical Twists in Polar Fluids: Chirality Regulation by Ultra-Low Electric Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently discovered helical polar fluid adopts a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) driven by polarization escape and conformational chirality. Ferroelectric nematic and smectic phases are intrinsically chiral in the ground state and can be stabilized in an extrinsic twisted configuration through surface anchoring. Herein, we introduce extrinsic CSB as a novel technique in chiral engineering. To demonstrate this concept, we constructed the extrinsic structure of a helielectric conical mesophase (HEC)-three-dimensional chiral system. Considering the challenges of controlling chirality at the macroscopic scale owing to magnetic fields, light, and fluid vortex motion, the proposed three-dimensional chiral system enables chirality (twist) modulation through an ultralow electric field, thereby controlling unique diffraction pattern and circular polarized light-switching capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Achieving quantum-limited motional control of optically trapped particles beyond the sub-micrometer scale is an outstanding problem in levitated optomechanics. A key obstacle is solving the light scattering problem and identifying particle geometries that allow stable trapping and efficient motional detection of their center of mass and rotational motion in three dimensions. Here, we present a computational framework that combines an efficient electromagnetic scattering solver with the adjoint method to inversely design printable microparticles tailored for levitated optomechanics. Our method allows identifying optimized geometries, characterized by enhanced optical trapping and detection efficiencies compared to conventional microspheres. This improves the feasibility of quantum-limited motional control of all translational and rotational degrees of freedom in a standard standing-wave optical trap.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent Emission Spectroscopy of Quantum Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06783</link>

Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in future optical quantum technologies. For most applications, scalable on-demand fabrication is a key requirement. Recent advances using localized electron irradiation have demonstrated near-identical emitters in the blue and yellow spectral regions. While the blue emitters have been demonstrated in cryogenic temperatures, the yellow emitters remain uncharacterized under such conditions. In this work, we therefore extended the study of yellow emitters to cryogenic temperatures. Initially, multiple spectral features were observed, prompting a systematic investigation that led to the identification of a defect emission centered around 547.5 nm with high brightness and excellent photostability. By tuning the excitation wavelength, we are able to distinguish Raman scattering peaks from the emitter emission. Further analysis of the vibronic emissions allowed us to identify an optical phonon mode, whose contribution becomes increasingly dominant at elevated temperatures. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (PLE) reveals excitation through this phonon mode enhances the emission by almost 5-fold in cryogenic temperature. Temperature-dependent studies further elucidate the role of phonons in the emission process. These observations deepen our understanding of the nature of the emitters, opening new avenues for precise tuning of quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Practical quantum secure direct communication with squeezed states</title>

Abstract: Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is a rapidly developing quantum communication approach, where secure information is directly transmitted, providing an alternative to key-based (de)encryption processes via Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). During the last decade, optical QSDC protocols based on discrete variable encodings have been successfully realized. Recently, continuous-variable (CV) QSDC schemes have been proposed, benefiting from less-sophisticated implementations with proven security. Here, we report the first table-top experimental demonstration of a CV-QSDC system and assess its security. For this realization, we analyze the security of different configurations, including coherent and squeezed sources, with Wyner wiretap channel theory in presence of a beam splitter attack. This practical protocol not only demonstrates the principle of QSDC systems based on CV encoding, but also showcases the advantage of squeezed states over coherent ones in attaining enhanced security and reliable communication in lossy and noisy channels. Our realization, which is founded on mature telecom components, paves the way into future threat-less quantum metropolitan networks, compatible with coexisting advanced wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems.</description>

      <title>Shaping Laser Pulses with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High Power Laser (HPL) systems operate in the attoseconds regime -- the shortest timescale ever created by humanity. HPL systems are instrumental in high-energy physics, leveraging ultra-short impulse durations to yield extremely high intensities, which are essential for both practical applications and theoretical advancements in light-matter interactions. Traditionally, the parameters regulating HPL optical performance have been manually tuned by human experts, or optimized using black-box methods that can be computationally demanding. Critically, black box methods rely on stationarity assumptions overlooking complex dynamics in high-energy physics and day-to-day changes in real-world experimental settings, and thus need to be often restarted. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by enabling sequential decision making in non-static settings. This work explores the feasibility of applying DRL to HPL systems, extending the current research by (1) learning a control policy relying solely on non-destructive image observations obtained from readily available diagnostic devices, and (2) retaining performance when the underlying dynamics vary. We evaluate our method across various test dynamics, and observe that DRL effectively enables cross-domain adaptability, coping with dynamics' fluctuations while achieving 90\% of the target intensity in test environments.</description>

      <title>Observing High-dimensional Bell Inequality Violations using Multi-Outcome Spectral Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify and violate a Bell inequality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or Bell-nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing Bell-nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</description>
