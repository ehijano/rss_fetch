      <title>Choice Modeling and Pricing for Scheduled Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel framework for discrete choice modeling and price optimization for settings where scheduled service options (often hierarchical) are offered to customers, which is applicable across many businesses including some within Amazon. In such business settings, the customers would see multiple options, often substitutable, with their features and their prices. These options typically vary in the start and/or end time of the service requested, such as the date of service or a service time window. The costs and demand can vary widely across these different options, resulting in the need for different prices. We propose a system which allows for segmenting the marketplace (as defined by the particular business) using decision trees, while using parametric discrete choice models within each market segment to accurately estimate conversion behavior. Using parametric discrete choice models allows us to capture important behavioral aspects like reference price effects which naturally occur in scheduled service applications. In addition, we provide natural and fast heuristics to do price optimization. For one such Amazon business where we conducted a live A/B experiment, this new framework outperformed the existing pricing system in every key metric, increasing our target performance metric by 19%, while providing a robust platform to support future new services of the business. The model framework has now been in full production for this business since Q4 2023.</description>

      <title>Sorting of Working Parents into Family-Friendly Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using detailed data on workplace benefits linked with administrative registers in Korea, we analyze patterns of separations and job transitions to study how parents sort into family-friendly firms after childbirth. We examine two quasi-experimental case studies: 1) staggered compliance with providing onsite childcare, and 2) mandated enrollment into paternity leave at a large conglomerate. In both cases, introducing family-friendly changes attracted more entry by parents who would gain from these benefits, and parents with young children stayed despite slower salary growth. We use richer data on a wider range of benefits to show that sorting on family-friendliness mainly occurs through labor force survival rather than job transitions. Most mothers do not actively switch into new jobs after childbirth, and they are more likely to withdraw from the labor force when their employers lack family-friendly benefits. We explain these findings with a simple model of sorting that features heterogeneity in outside options and opportunity costs for staying employed, which change after childbirth and vary by gender and family-friendliness at current jobs. Taken together, our findings indicate that mothers are concentrated at family-friendly firms not because they switch into new jobs after childbirth, but because they exit the labor force when their employers lack such benefits.</description>

      <title>Salary Matching and Pay Cut Reduction for Job Seekers with Loss Aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how loss aversion affects wages offered by employers and accepted by job seekers. I introduce a behavioral search model with monopsonistic firms making wage offers to job seekers who experience steeper disutility from pay cuts than utility from equivalent pay raises. Employers strategically reduce pay cuts to avoid offer rejections, and they exactly match offers to current salaries due to corner solutions. Loss aversion makes three predictions on the distribution of salary growth for job switchers, which I empirically test and confirm with administrative data in Korea. First, excess mass at zero wage growth is 8.5 times larger than what is expected without loss aversion. Second, the density immediately above zero is 8.8% larger than the density immediately below it. Third, the slope of the density below zero is 6.5 times steeper than the slope above it. When estimating model parameters with minimum distance on salary growth bins, incorporating loss aversion substantially improves model fit, and the marginal value of additional pay is 12% higher for pay cuts than pay raises in the primary specification. For a hypothetical hiring subsidy that raises the value of labor to employers by half of a standard deviation, incorporating loss aversion lowers its pass-through to wages by 18% (relative to a standard model) due to higher elasticity for pay cuts and salary matches that constrain subsidized wage offers. Somewhat surprisingly, salary history bans do not mitigate these effects as long as employers can imperfectly observe current salaries with noise.</description>

      <title>Assortative Mating, Inequality, and Rising Educational Mobility in Spain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of intergenerational educational mobility and related distributional statistics in Spain. Over recent decades, mobility has risen by one-third, coinciding with pronounced declines in inequality and assortative mating among the same cohorts. To explore these patterns, we examine regional correlates of mobility, using split-sample techniques. A key finding from both national and regional analyses is the close association between mobility and assortative mating: spousal sorting accounts for nearly half of the regional variation in intergenerational correlations and also appears to be a key mediator of the negative relationship between inequality and mobility documented in recent studies.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Transition from Loss-Leader Competition: How Advertising Restrictions Facilitate Price Coordination in Chilean Pharmaceutical Retail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how regulation can push an oligopoly from one pricing regime to another. It uses rich data from Chilean pharmacy chains to study a ban on comparative price advertising. Before the ban, ads created demand spillovers across products, making aggressive loss-leader pricing profitable. Once these spillovers were removed, selling below cost became unattractive for any firm, and prices quickly shifted to a coordinated, higher level. A structural demand model shows that the ban reduced both price elasticity and cross-product spillovers, and counterfactuals indicate that the loss of spillovers, rather than just lower elasticity, mainly explains the move to the new coordinated pricing regime. The results show how well intentioned regulation can unintentionally promote price coordination by weakening the mechanisms that support competitive outcomes.</description>

      <title>R&amp;D Networks under Heterogeneous Firm Productivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce heterogeneous R&amp;D productivities into an endogenous R&amp;D network formation model, generalizing the framework in Goyal and Moraga-Gonzalez (2001). Heterogeneous productivities endogenously create asymmetric gains for connecting firms: the less productive firm benefits disproportionately, while the more productive firm exerts greater R&amp;D effort and incurs higher costs. For sufficiently large productivity gaps between two firms, the more productive firm experiences reduced profits from being connected to the less productive one. This overturns the benchmark results on pairwise stable networks: for sufficiently large productivity gaps, the complete network becomes unstable, whereas the Positive Assortative (PA) network -- where firms cluster by productivity levels -- emerges as stable. Simulations show that the PA structure delivers higher welfare than the complete network; nevertheless, welfare under PA formation follows an inverted U-shape in the fraction of high-productivity firms, reflecting crowding-out effects at high fractions. Altogether, a counterintuitive finding emerges: economies with higher average R&amp;D productivity may exhibit lower welfare through (i) the formation of alternative stable R&amp;D network structures or (ii) a crowding-out effect of high-productivity firms. Our findings highlight that productivity-enhancing policies should account for their impact on endogenous R&amp;D alliances and effort, as such endogenous responses may offset or even reverse the intended welfare gains.</description>

      <title>A Political Economy Definition of the Middle Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economists often define the middle class based on income distribution, yet selecting which segment constitutes the `middle' is essentially arbitrary. This paper proposes a definition of the middle class based solely on the properties of income distribution. It argues that for a collection of unequal societies, the poor and rich extremes of the distribution unambiguously worsen or improve their respective income shares with inequality. In contrast, such an effect is moderated at the center. I define the middle class as the segment of the income distribution whose income shares are insensitive to changes in inequality. This unresponsiveness property allows one to single out, endogenously and with minimal arbitrariness, the location of the middle class. The paper first provides a theoretical argument for the existence of such a group. It then uses detailed percentile data from the World Income Database (WID) to empirically characterize the world middle class: a group skewed toward the upper part of the distribution - comprising much of the affluent population below the very rich - with stable borders over time and across countries. The definition aligns with the prevailing view in political economy of the middle class as as a moderating actor, given their null incentives to engage in distributive conflict.</description>

      <title>The Big Three in Marriage Talk: LLM-Assisted Analysis of Moral Ethics and Sentiment on Weibo and Xiaohongshu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: China's marriage registrations have declined dramatically, dropping from 13.47 million couples in 2013 to 6.1 million in 2024. Understanding public attitudes toward marriage requires examining not only emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying these evaluations. This study analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from two major Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu) using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions (Autonomy, Community, Divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts across both platforms lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral ethics were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking Autonomy ethics and Community ethics were predominantly negative, whereas Divinity-framed posts tended toward neutral or positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations drive negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China. The study demonstrates LLMs' utility for scaling qualitative analysis and offers insights for developing culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline in Chinese contexts.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Art Market Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how deep learning can improve valuation in the art market by incorporating the visual content of artworks into predictive models. Using a large repeated-sales dataset from major auction houses, we benchmark classical hedonic regressions and tree-based methods against modern deep architectures, including multi-modal models that fuse tabular and image data. We find that while artist identity and prior transaction history dominate overall predictive power, visual embeddings provide a distinct and economically meaningful contribution for fresh-to-market works where historical anchors are absent. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and embedding visualizations show that models attend to compositional and stylistic cues. Our findings demonstrate that multi-modal deep learning delivers significant value precisely when valuation is hardest, namely first-time sales, and thus offers new insights for both academic research and practice in art market valuation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17123v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence on the effectiveness of retraining U.S. unemployed workers primarily comes from evaluations of training programs, which represent one narrow avenue for skill acquisition. We use high-quality records from Ohio and a matching method to estimate the effects of retraining, broadly defined as enrollment in postsecondary institutions. Our simple method bridges two strands of the dynamic treatment effect literature that estimate the treatment-now-versus-later and treatment-versus-no-treatment effects. We find that enrollees experience earnings gains of six percent three to four years after enrolling, after depressed earnings during the first two years. The earnings effects are driven by industry-switchers, particularly to healthcare.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence, Data and Competition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how data inputs shape competition among artificial intelligences (AIs) in pricing games. The dataset assigns labels to consumers and divides them into different markets, thereby inducing multimarket contact among AIs. We document that AIs can adapt to tacit collusion via market allocation. Under symmetric segmentation, each algorithm monopolizes a subset of markets with supra-competitive prices while competing intensely in the remaining markets. Markets with higher WTP are more likely to be assigned for collusion. Under asymmetric segmentation, the algorithm with finer segmentation adopts a Bait-and-Restraint-Exploit strategy to "teach" the other algorithm to collude. However, the data advantage does not necessarily result in competitive advantage. Our analysis calls for a close monitoring of the data selection phase, as the worst-case outcome for consumers can emerge even without any coordination.</description>

      <title>Exploring Trade Openness and Logistics Efficiency in the G20 Economies: A Bootstrap ARDL Analysis of Growth Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between trade openness, logistics performance, and economic growth within G20 economies. Using a Bootstrap Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model augmented by a dynamic error correction mechanism (ECM), the analysis quantifies both short run and long run effects of trade facilitation and logistics infrastructure, measured via the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (LPI) from 2007 to 2023, on economic growth. The G20, as a consortium of the world's leading economies, exhibits significant variation in logistics efficiency and degrees of trade openness, providing a robust context for comparative analysis. The ARDL-ECM approach, reinforced by bootstrap resampling, delivers reliable estimates even in the presence of small samples and complex variable linkages. Findings are intended to inform policymakers seeking to enhance trade competitiveness and economic development through targeted investment in infrastructure and regulatory reforms supporting trade facilitation. The results underscore the critical role of efficient logistics specifically customs administration, physical infrastructure, and shipment reliability in driving international trade and fostering sustained economic growth. Improvements in these areas can substantially increase a country's trade capacity and overall economic performance.</description>
