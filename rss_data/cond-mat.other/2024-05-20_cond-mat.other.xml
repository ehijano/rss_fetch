      <title>Financial Interactions and Capital Accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10338</link>

Abstract: In a series of precedent papers, we have presented a comprehensive methodology, termed Field Economics, for translating a standard economic model into a statistical field-formalism framework. This formalism requires a large number of heterogeneous agents, possibly of different types. It reveals the emergence of collective states among these agents or type of agents while preserving the interactions and microeconomic features of the system at the individual level. In two prior papers, we applied this formalism to analyze the dynamics of capital allocation and accumulation in a simple microeconomic framework of investors and firms.Building upon our prior work, the present paper refines the initial model by expanding its scope. Instead of considering financial firms investing solely in real sectors, we now suppose that financial agents may also invest in other financial firms. We also introduce banks in the system that act as investors with a credit multiplier. Two types of interaction are now considered within the financial sector: financial agents can lend capital to, or choose to buy shares of, other financial firms. Capital now flows between financial agents and is only partly invested in real sectors, depending on their relative returns. We translate this framework into our formalism and study the diffusion of capital and possible defaults in the system, both at the macro and micro level.At the macro level, we find that several collective states may emerge, each characterized by a distinct level of average capital and investors per sector. These collective states depend on external parameters such as level of connections between investors or firms' productivity.The multiplicity of possible collective states is the consequence of the nature of the system composed of interconnected heterogeneous agents. Several equivalent patterns of returns and portfolio allocation may emerge. The multiple collective states induce the unstable nature of financial markets, and some of them include defaults may emerge. At the micro level, we study the propagation of returns and defaults within a given collective state. Our findings highlight the significant role of banks, which can either stabilize the system through lending activities or propagate instability through loans to investors.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunable, room-temperature polariton condensation in individual states of a 1D topological lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, exciton-polariton microcavity arrays have emerged as a promising semiconductor-based platform for analogue simulations of model Hamiltonians and topological effects. To realize experimentally a variety of Hamiltonians and change their parameters, it is essential to have highly tunable and easily engineerable structures. Here, we demonstrate in-situ tunable, room-temperature polariton condensation in individual states of a one-dimensional topological lattice, by utilizing an open-cavity configuration with an organic polymer layer. Angle-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal the band structure of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, comprised of S-like and P-like bands, along with the appearance of discrete topological edge states with distinct symmetries. Changing the cavity length in combination with vibron-mediated relaxation in the polymer allows us to achieve selective polariton condensation into different states of the band structure, unveiled by nonlinear emission, linewidth narrowing, energy blue-shift and extended macroscopic coherence. Furthermore, we engineer the bandgap and the edge state localization by adjusting the interaction between adjacent lattice sites. Comparison to first-principles calculations showcases the precision of the polariton simulator. These results demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of the platform for the investigation of quantum fluids in complex potential landscapes and topological effects at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Fitting to magnetic forces improves the reliability of magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for fitting machine-learning interatomic potentials with magnetic degrees of freedom, namely, magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials (mMTP). The main feature of the methodology consists in fitting mMTP to magnetic forces (negative derivatives of energies with respect to magnetic moments) derived from spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. We test our method on the bcc Fe-Al system with different composition. Specifically, we calculate formation energies, equilibrium lattice parameter, and total cell magnetization. Our findings demonstrate a precise match between values calculated with mMTP and those obtained by DFT at zero temperature. Additionally, using molecular dynamics, we estimate the finite temperature lattice parameter and capture the cell expansion as was previously revealed in experiment. We demonstrate that mMTPs fitted to magnetic forces, increase the relaxation reliability, which is the percent of successfully relaxed structures (i.e. with almost zero forces, stresses, and magnetic moments after the optimization of geometry). Eventually, we show that the proposed methodology can provide an accurate and reliable mMTP with reduced number of computationally complex spin-polarized density functional theory calculations.</description>
