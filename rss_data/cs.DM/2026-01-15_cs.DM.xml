      <title>Token positional games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Maker-Breaker positional game is played on a board which is a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, with two players, Maker and Breaker, alternately claiming vertices of $\mathcal{H}$ until all the vertices are claimed. When the game ends, Maker wins if she has claimed all the vertices of some edge of $\mathcal{H}$; otherwise, Breaker wins. Playing this game in real life can be done by placing tokens on the vertices of the board. In this paper, we study the unfortunate case in which one or both players do not have enough tokens to cover all the vertices and, as such, will have to move their tokens around at some point instead of placing new ones. There may be a bias, in that Maker and Breaker do not necessarily have the same amount of tokens. The present paper initiates the study of this generalization of positional games, called token positional games. A particularly interesting case is when Maker has a winning strategy in the classical game: what is the lowest number of tokens with which she still wins against Breaker's unlimited stock? We notably show that, for $k$-uniform hypergraphs on an arbitrarily large number $n$ of vertices, this number equals $k$ if $k \in\{2,3\}$ but can vary from $k$ to $\Omega(n)$ if $k \geq 4$. From an algorithmic point of view, PSPACE-hardness in general is inherited from classical positional games, but we get a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the case where Breaker only has one token. We also establish EXPTIME-completeness for a "token sliding" variation of the game.</description>

      <title>On Numbers of Simplicial Walks and Equivalent Canonizations for Graph Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two graphs are isomorphic exactly when they admit the same number of homomorphisms from every graph. Hence, a graph is recognized up to isomorphism by homomorphism counts over the class of all graphs. Restricting to a specific graph class yields some natural isomorphism relaxations and modulates recognition to particular graph properties. A notable restriction is to the classes of bounded treewidth, yielding the isomorphism relaxation of Weisfeiler--Leman refinement (WL), as shown by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k [JGT 2010]. The properties recognized by WL are exactly those definable in fragments of first-order logic with counting quantifiers, as shown by Cai, F\"{u}rer, and Immerman [Comb. 1992].
  We characterize the restriction to the classes of bounded pathwidth by numbers of simplicial walks, and formalize it into a refinement procedure (SW). The properties recognized by SW are exactly those definable in fragments of restricted-conjunction first-order logic with counting quantifiers, introduced by Montacute and Shah [LMCS 2024].
  Unlike WL, computing SW directly is not polynomial-time in general. We address this by representing SW in terms of multiplicity automata. We equip these automata with an involution, simplifying the canonization to standard forward reduction and omitting the backward one. The resulting canonical form is computable in time $O(kn^{3k})$ for any graph on $n$ vertices and the restriction to pathwidth at most $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that powersets over structures with a bounded counting sequence can be sampled efficiently without evaluating the generating function. An algorithm is provided, implemented, and tested. Runtimes are comparable to existing Boltzmann samplers reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds in Algebraic Complexity via Symmetry and Homomorphism Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valiant's conjecture asserts that the circuit complexity classes VP and VNP are distinct, meaning that the permanent does not admit polynomial-size algebraic circuits. As it is the case in many branches of complexity theory, the unconditional separation of these complexity classes seems elusive. In stark contrast, the symmetric analogue of Valiant's conjecture has been proven by Dawar and Wilsenach (2020): the permanent does not admit symmetric algebraic circuits of polynomial size, while the determinant does. Symmetric algebraic circuits are both a powerful computational model and amenable to proving unconditional lower bounds.
  In this paper, we develop a symmetric algebraic complexity theory by introducing symmetric analogues of the complexity classes VP, VBP, and VF called symVP, symVBP, and symVF. They comprise polynomials that admit symmetric algebraic circuits, skew circuits, and formulas, respectively, of polynomial orbit size. Having defined these classes, we show unconditionally that $\mathsf{symVF} \subsetneq \mathsf{symVBP} \subsetneq \mathsf{symVP}$. To that end, we characterise the polynomials in symVF and symVBP as those that can be written as linear combinations of homomorphism polynomials for patterns of bounded treedepth and pathwidth, respectively. This extends a previous characterisation by Dawar, Pago, and Seppelt (2026) of symVP.
  Finally, we show that symVBP and symVP contain homomorphism polynomials which are VBP- and VP-complete, respectively. We give general graph-theoretic criteria for homomorphism polynomials and their linear combinations to be VBP-, VP-, or VNP-complete. These conditional lower bounds drastically enlarge the realm of natural polynomials known to be complete for VNP, VP, or VBP. Under the assumption VFPT $\neq$ VW[1], we precisely identify the homomorphism polynomials that lie in VP as those whose patterns have bounded treewidth.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Rate Bounds and Constructions for the Inclusive Variant of Disjunct Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disjunct matrices, also known as cover-free families and superimposed codes, are combinatorial arrays widely used in group testing. Among their variants, those that satisfy an additional combinatorial property called inclusiveness form a special class suitable for computationally efficient and highly error-tolerant group testing under the general inhibitor complex model, a broad framework that subsumes practical settings such as DNA screening. Despite this relevance, the asymptotic behavior of the inclusive variant of disjunct matrices has remained largely unexplored. In particular, it was not previously known whether this variant can achieve an asymptotically positive rate, a requirement for scalable group testing designs. In this work, we establish the first nontrivial asymptotic lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of the inclusive variant, which matches the strongest known upper bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof is based on the probabilistic method and yields a simple and efficient randomized construction. Furthermore, we derandomize this construction to obtain a deterministic polynomial-time construction. These results clarify the asymptotic potential of robust and scalable group testing under the general inhibitor complex model.</description>

      <title>Exact number of flips required to sort a burnt stack of pancakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the buffet, the waiter of a restaurant gets a large stack of pancakes from the overworked cook. As usual, one side is burnt, and as the level of batter decreases, the pancakes became smaller and smaller. Hence, the waiter ends up with a stack of one-sided burnt pancakes sorted by size, with the larger at the bottom and burnt side up. However, the waiter cannot serve them this way. He needs to turn all the burnt sides down, without changing the order. Having only a spatula, he can only perform flips to the top of the stack. How can he perform this transformation in a minimum number of flips? Having n pancakes, this problem can be modeled in the burnt pancake graph, having 2^n*n! vertices, where each possible stack of pancakes corresponds to a vertex expressed by a permutation of size n, where the pancakes are ordered by size, and the pancake numbers are multiplied by -1, if the corresponding pancake has the burnt side side up. An edge exists in this graph, if the corresponding stacks can be reached from each other by one flip. Let T(n) be the minimum number of flips to sort the stack of n pancakes (-1,...,-n). General burnt pancake sorting has been introduced by Bill Gates and Papadimitriou. The instance (-1,...,-n) has strong relevance because of its easy structure and as it has been shown to be a worst-case instance for several small n. Heydari and Sudborough gave the currently best upper bound of T(n), namely (3n+3)/2 for n = 3 mod 4, which later has been shown to be exact by a work of Cibulka. Except these two works, no progress regarding lower and upper bounds has been made until now. In our work, we present that (3n+3)/2 is also an upper bound of T(n) for n = 1 mod 4, which again matches the lower bound of Cibulka and thus is exact. The case of even n keeps an open problem, where two possible values for T(n) are possible, namely (3/2)n + 1 or (3/2)n + 2.</description>

      <title>The Polymatroid Representation of a Greedoid, and Associated Galois Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A greedoid is a generalization of a matroid allowing for more flexible analyses and modeling of combinatorial optimization problems. However, these structures decimate many matroid properties contributing to their pervasive nature. A polymatroid greedoid [KL85a] presents an interesting middle ground, so we further develop this class. First we prove every local poset greedoid for which the greedy algorithm correctly solves linear optimizations over its basic words must have a polymatroid representation. For this, we use relationships between the lattices of greedoid flats and closed sets of a polymatroid to generalize concepts in [KL85a]. Then, we show our generalization induces a Galois injection between the greedoid flats and closed sets of a representation. Finally, we apply this duality to identify a subclass of polymatroid greedoids with a maximum representation, giving a partial answer to an open problem of [KL85a]. As technical tools for our analyses, we introduce optimism and the Forking Lemma for interval greedoids. Both are pervasive in our work, and are of independent interest.</description>
