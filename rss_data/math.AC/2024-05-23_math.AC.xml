      <title>Homological algebra of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups from the perspective of homological algebra. We extend to this context the type-decomposition of locally compact Polish abelian groups of Hoffmann and Spitzweck, and prove that the category $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$ of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups is a thick subcategory of the category of Polish abelian groups. We completely characterize injective and projective objects in $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$. We conclude that $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$ has enough projectives but not enough injectives and homological dimension $1$. We also completely characterize injective and projective objects in the category of non-Archimedean Polish abelian groups, concluding that it has enough injectives and projectives and homological dimension $1$. Injective objects are also characterized for the categories of topological torsion Polish abelian groups and for Polish abelian topological $p$-groups, showing that these categories have enough injectives and homological dimension $1$.</description>

      <title>On the minimal generating sets of the Eulerian ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimal homogeneous generating sets of the Eulerian ideal associated with a simple graph and its maximal generating degree. We show that the Eulerian ideal is a lattice ideal and use this to give a characterization of binomials belonging to a minimal homogeneous generating set. In this way, we obtain an explicit minimal homogeneous generating set. We find an upper bound for the maximal generating degree in terms of the graph. This invariant is half the number of edges of a largest Eulerian subgraph of even cardinality without even-chords. We show that for bipartite graphs this invariant is the maximal generating degree. In particular, we prove that if the graph is bipartite, the Eulerian ideal is generated in degree $2$ if and only if the graph is chordal. Furthermore, we show that the maximal generating degree is also $2$ when the graph is a complete graph.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility in generalized power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical tool in the study of real closed fields are the fields $K((G))$ of generalized power series (i.e., formal sums with well-ordered support) with coefficients in a field $K$ of characteristic 0 and exponents in an ordered abelian group $G$. In this paper we enlarge the family of ordinals $\alpha$ of non-additively principal Cantor degree for which $K((\mathbb{R}^{\le 0}))$ admits irreducibles of order type $\alpha$ far beyond $\alpha=\omega^2 $ and $\alpha = \omega^3$ known prior to this work.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate self-dual modules and their Hilbert functions. We generalize Iarrobino's decomposition to this setup and deduce consequences for their local Hilbert functions. We classify the local Hilbert functions for small degree modules. We prove a generalization of Kunte's criterion for self-duality in terms of Macaulay's inverse systems.</description>

      <title>Mutations of ordinary torsion theories and generalized torsion theories connected by a Serre subcategory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how torsion theories are described and constructed is crucial to the study of torsion theory. Mutations of torsion theories have been studied as a method of constructing another torsion theory from a given one. We have already obtained how to mutate ordinary torsion theories into generalized torsion theories associated with a Serre subcategory. The paper investigates when the generalized torsion theories give ordinary torsion theories and when ordinary torsion theories provide each other.</description>

      <title>On ideals of affine semigroups and affine semigroups with maximal embedding dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S\subseteq \mathbb N^p$ be a semigroup, any $P\subseteq S$ is an ideal of $S$ if $P+S\subseteq P$, and an $I(S)$-semigroup is the affine semigroup $P\cup \{0\}$, with $P$ an ideal of $S$. We characterise the $I(S)$-semigroups and the ones that also are $\mathcal C$-semigroups. Moreover, some algorithms are provided to compute all the $I(S)$-semigroups satisfying some properties. From a family of ideals of $S$, we introduce the affine semigroups with maximal embedding dimension, characterising them and describing some families.</description>

      <title>Perazzo $n$-folds and the weak Lefschetz property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the maximum $h_{max}$ and the minimum $h_{min}$ of the Hilbert vectors of Perazzo algebras $A_F$, where $F$ is a Perazzo polynomial of degree $d$ in $n+m+1$ variables. These algebras always fail the Strong Lefschetz Property. We determine the integers $n,m,d$ such that $h_{max}$ (resp. $h_{min}$) is unimodal, and we prove that $A_F$ always fails the Weak Lefschetz Property if its Hilbert vector is maximum, while it satisfies the Weak Lefschetz Property if it is minimum, unimodal, and satisfies an additional mild condition. We determine the minimal free resolution of Perazzo algebras associated to Perazzo threefolds in $\mathbb P^4$ with minimum Hilbert vectors. Finally we pose some open problems in this context.

      <title>A New Conjecture and Upper Bound on the Castelnuovo--Mumford Regularity of Binomial Edge Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous theorem of Kalai and Meshulam is that $\mathrm{reg}(I + J) \leq \mathrm{reg}(I) + \mathrm{reg}(J) -1$ for any squarefree monomial ideals $I$ and $J$. This result was subsequently extended by Herzog to the case where $I$ and $J$ are any monomial ideals. In this paper we conjecture that the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity is subadditive on binomial edge ideals. Specifically, we propose that $\mathrm{reg}(J_{G}) \leq \mathrm{reg}(J_{H_{1}}) + \mathrm{reg}(J_{H_{2}}) -1$ whenever $G$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ are graphs satisfying $E(G) = E(H_{1}) \cup E(H_{2})$ and $J_{\ast}$ is the associated binomial edge ideal. We prove a special case of this conjecture which strengthens the celebrated theorem of Malayeri--Madani--Kiani that $\mathrm{reg}(J_{G})$ is bounded above by the minimal number of maximal cliques covering the edges of the graph $G$. From this special case we obtain a new upper bound for $\mathrm{reg}(J_{G})$, namely that $\mathrm{reg}(J_{G}) \leq \mathrm{ht}(J_{G}) +1$. Our upper bound gives an analogue of the well-known result that $\mathrm{reg}(I(G)) \leq \mathrm{ht}(I(G)) +1$ where $I(G)$ is the edge ideal of the graph $G$. We additionally prove that this conjecture holds for graphs admitting a combinatorial description for its Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity, that is for closed graphs, bipartite graphs with $J_{G}$ Cohen--Macaulay, and block graphs. Finally, we give examples to show that our new upper bound is incomparable with Malayeri--Madani--Kiani's upper bound for $\mathrm{reg}(J_{G})$ given by the size of a maximal clique disjoint set of edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article, written in Spanish, provides a comprehensive review of the Fargues-Fontaine curve, a cornerstone in $p$-adic Hodge theory, and its pivotal role in classifying $p$-adic Galois representations. We synthesize key developments surrounding this curve, emphasizing its connection between advanced concepts in arithmetic geometry and the practical theory of representations. We offer a detailed analysis of the Fontaine period rings ($B_{cris}, B_{st}, B_{dR}$), exploring their crucial algebraic and arithmetic properties and their contribution to the curve's construction and definition. Furthermore, we delve into the theory of admissible $p$-adic Galois representations, discussing how the curve, once defined, integrates with Harder-Narasimhan theory.</description>

      <title>The tilting property for $F_*^e\mathcal O_X$ on Fano surfaces and threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth variety over a field of characteristic $p$. It is a natural question whether the Frobenius pushforwards $F_*^e\mathcal O_X$ of the structure sheaf are tilting bundles. We show if $X$ is a smooth del Pezzo surface of degree $\leq 3$ or a Fano threefold with $\mathrm{vol}(K_X)&lt;24$ over a field of characteristic $p$, then $\mathrm{Ext}^i(F_*^e\mathcal O_X,F^e_*\mathcal O_X)\neq 0$ and thus $F_*^e\mathcal O_X$ is not tilting.</description>

      <title>Ribbon Schur Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a generalization of the classical notion of a Schur functor associated to a ribbon diagram. These functors are defined with respect to an arbitrary algebra, and in the case that the underlying algebra is the symmetric/exterior algebra, we recover the classical definition of Schur/Weyl functors, respectively. In general, we construct a family of 3-term complexes categorifying the classical concatenation/near-concatenation identity for symmetric functions, and one of our main results is that the exactness of these 3-term complexes is equivalent to the Koszul property of the underlying algebra $A$. We further generalize these ribbon Schur functors to the notion of a multi-Schur functor and construct a canonical filtration of these objects whose associated graded pieces are described explicitly; one consequence of this filtration is a complete equivariant description of the syzygies of arbitrary Segre products of Koszul modules over the Segre product of Koszul algebras. Further applications to the equivariant structure of derived invariants, symmetric function identities, and Koszulness of certain classes of modules are explored at the end, along with a characteristic-free computation of the regularity of a Schur functor applied to the tautological subbundle on projective space.</description>

Abstract: Let $R=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $K$. We show that if $G$ is a connected graph with a basic $5$-cycle $C$, then $G$ is a sequentially Cohen-Macaulay graph if and only if there exists a shedding vertex $x$ of $C$ such that $G\setminus x$ and $G\setminus N[x]$ are sequentially Cohen-Macaulay graphs. Furthermore, we study the sequentially Cohen-Macaulay and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of square-free monomial ideals in some special cases.</description>

      <title>Telescope conjecture via homological residue fields with applications to schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a big tt-category, we give a characterization of the Telescope Conjecture (TC) in terms of definable tensor-ideals generated by homological residue fields. We formulate a stalk-locality property of (TC) and prove that it holds in the case of the derived category of a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme, strengthening a result \cite{HHZ21}. As an application, we find strong links between (TC) and separation properties of the adic topology on local rings. This allows us to recover known examples and counterexamples of when (TC) holds over a scheme, as well as to construct some new ones.</description>
