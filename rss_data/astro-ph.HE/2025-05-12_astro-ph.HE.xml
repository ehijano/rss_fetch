      <title>The Multiple Paths to Merger of Unequal-Mass Black Hole Binaries in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion disks that power active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to house populations of stars and compact objects; after forming binaries these compact objects may merge, begetting gravitational waves such as those detected by LIGO and VIRGO. We present a comprehensive study of the early evolution of binaries within AGN disks as their orbits are influenced by the surrounding gas, focusing on eccentric and unequal-mass binaries. Nearly-equal-mass binaries behave similarly to their equal-mass counterparts: prograde binaries inspiral, albeit somewhat slowly, and have their eccentricities damped; retrograde binaries inspiral $\sim2-3$ times faster than their prograde counterparts, and those with near-equal masses are driven quickly towards near-unity eccentricities. However, the primaries in retrograde binaries with mass ratios of $m_2/m_1\lesssim0.4$ experience significantly weaker headwinds and retain substantial accretion disks that help damp binary eccentricities, slowing binary inspirals. Additionally, we find that while accretion drives prograde binaries towards equal masses thanks to the exchange of material between the primary and secondary accretion disks, retrograde binaries are driven slowly towards more extreme mass ratios. Prograde binaries, and generally those with low mass ratios, likely accrete for multiple $e$-folding timescales before merger. On the other hand, high-mass-ratio retrograde binaries may merge before accreting substantially, potentially approaching merger with detectable eccentricity. Future ground-based gravitational wave observatories, with their broader frequency coverage, should be particularly useful for studying these populations.</description>

      <title>Wobbling around the clock: magnetically-driven quasi-periodic oscillations in pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are X-ray binary systems containing an accreting neutron star (NS) or black hole emitting at luminosities above the Eddington limit of a $10M_{\odot}$ black hole. Approximately 1900 (either confirmed or candidate) ULXs have been identified to date. Three systems have been confirmed to exhibit coherent signals consistent with NS spin frequencies and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the mHz range. Several interpretations for generating such QPOs have been proposed, including general relativistic frame-dragging effects. In this work, we test if an alternative model in which magnetically-driven precession of the inner accretion flow can self-consistently reproduce the observed NS spin and QPO frequencies for reasonable values for accretion rates and NS magnetic field strengths. For a range of parameters, we recover family of solutions with accretion rates $\approx10^{-7}$--$10^{-5}$\,M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$ and surface magnetic fields $\gtrsim10^{12}$\,G, in agreement with previous estimates. If validated, this interpretation could reconcile several observed properties of pulsating ULXs, including QPO frequencies and the observed high luminosities of these systems, in a self-consistent framework without requiring general relativistic effects and/or strong beaming due to specific viewing angles. Although the predictive power of the model is currently limited by parameter degeneracies and uncertainties, searching for and discovering more pulsating ULX systems will allow to further test or refute the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Pieces of evidence for multiple progenitors of Swift long gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are typically thought to result from the collapse of massive stars. Nonetheless, recent observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 211211A and 230307A, coupled with the low-redshift excess of LGRB event rates relative to star formation rates, present significant challenges to the prevailing model. We reexamine the selection criteria for higher redshift complete GRB samples and identify 280 Swift GRBs with peak flux over $2.6 ph cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. Assuming all LGRBs with $z \geq 2$ originate from collapsars, we construct the GRB luminosity functions(LFs) in three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. Our results indicate that a strong redshift evolution in luminosity $\delta = 1.87^{+0.27}_{-0.31}$ or in density $\delta = 1.10^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ is necessary. The luminosity/density evolution model predicts 72.67/57.28 collapsar GRBs at $z &lt; 2$, which can account for 67.29%/ 53.04% of the observed LGRBs. This suggests that a substantial portion of LGRBs at $z&lt; 2$ may not be collapsar GRBs, which would challenge the universality of empirical GRB relations and affect their reliability in cosmological applications.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole-star binaries via dynamical friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new channel for binary system formation involving stars and stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) embedded in dark matter (DM) minihalos. In this scenario, binaries form when a star passes through the DM minihalo surrounding a PBH and loses sufficient energy due to dynamical friction. The continued energy loss induced by this friction is expected to drive the resulting systems to merge rapidly. We estimate their merger rate and explore the implications for two observables: rapidly decaying X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and gravitational waves sourced by compact object mergers. We find that this mechanism naturally produces a population of O(1) currently observable short-lived X-ray binaries. It also leads to a non-negligible gravitational wave event rate of O(0.3) Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, potentially involving high mass ratios and black holes in the lower or upper mass gap. This dynamical friction channel thus offers a plausible explanation for several unusual observations reported in recent years across both the X-ray and gravitational wave domains.</description>

      <title>Non-purely transverse Magnus force in superconducting neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The force acting on a proton vortex in extreme type-II superconducting neutron star matter is studied in the limit of vanishing temperature. A detailed analysis is presented on how momentum is transferred from length scales on the order of the London penetration depth to the vortex core. To examine the momentum flux, expressions for proton and electron currents are derived for arbitrary distances from the vortex line. It is shown that, in the regime of a large electron mean free path, the only force acting directly on the vortex core is the Magnus force. Notably, the correction to the proton current near the vortex core generates a component of the Magnus force aligned with the incident current measured far from the vortex. This contribution, responsible for longitudinal force, is usually overlooked in the literature. The results obtained in this work for a relatively simple problem concerning the force on a vortex in cold matter of neutron stars may also be relevant to other superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement of separate electron and positron spectra from 10 GeV to 20GeV with the geomagnetic field on DAMPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and positrons in space are of great significance for studying the origin and propagation of cosmic-rays. The satellite-borne experiment DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) has been used to measure the separate electron and positron spectra, as well as the positron fraction. In this work, the Earth's magnetic field is used to distinguish CR electrons and positrons, as the DAMPE detector does not carry an onboard magnet. The energy range for the measurements is from 10 to 20 GeV, being currently limited at high energy by the zenith pointing orientation of DAMPE. The results are consistent with previous measurements based on the magnetic spectrometer by AMS-02 and PAMELA, while the results of Fermi-LAT seem then to be systematically shifted to larger values.</description>

      <title>Periodic variation of magnetoionic environment of a fast radio burst source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous, dispersed millisecond-duration radio bursts whose origin is poorly known. Recent observations suggest that some FRBs may reside in binary systems, even though conclusive evidence remains elusive. Here we report the detection of a 26.24$\pm$0.02 day periodicity in Faraday rotation measure (RM) of an actively repeating source named FRB 20201124A. The detection was made from 3,106 bursts collected with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) over ~365 days. The RM periodicity is coherently phase-connected across ~14 cycles over a 1-year duration. Our detection of RM periodicity corresponds to a natural logarithmic Bayesian factor of 1,168. The detection significances vary between 5.9-34 {\sigma} under different assumptions. Such a periodicity provides evidence for the binary nature of FRB 20201124A, where the periodic RM variations arise from the orbital motion of the FRB source within the magnetoionic environment of the system. Together with previous observations, our result suggests that being in binary systems may be a common feature for actively repeating FRB sources.</description>

      <title>A Study of the Spectral Properties of Gamma-Ray Bursts with the Main and Second Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of the main burst and second burst of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and the composition of their jets remain uncertain. To explore this complex subject more thoroughly, we conduct a spectral analysis on 18 GRBs with a main and a second burst observed by Fermi/GBM. First, we employ Bayesian time-resolved spectral analysis to compare the spectral components of the main and the second burst, finding that $83.3\%$ of the main and second bursts contain a thermal component. $67\%$ of the GRBs, the thermal component gradually decreased from the main to the second burst and the number of spectra exceeding the "Synchrotron line-of-death" is significantly higher in the main burst than in the second burst. Subsequently, we ascertain that for both the main and second bursts, $71.4\%$ of the low-energy spectral index $\alpha$ and $77.8\%$ of the peak energy $E_{p}$ evolve in a similar fashion. There are $50.0\%$ and $72.2\%$ of the GRBs exhibit comparable correlations for the $Flux-\alpha$ and $\alpha-E_{p}$, respectively. For $Flux-E_{p}$ both the main and second burst show a positive correlation. Moreover, from the perspective of the temporal evolution of characteristic radii, the transition from the main to the second burst appeared to be seamless. Finally, we find that both the main and the second burst follow the same Amati relation and Yonetoku relation. Our analysis strongly indicates that the second burst is a continuation of the main burst and is highly likely to share a common physical origin.</description>

      <title>Revealing the nature of ultra-long period objects with space-based gravitational-wave interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A few members of the recently-discovered class of ultra-long period objects have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive and isolated magnetars remain a viable candidate. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit though -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37 -- several of these elusive radio transients should be gravitational-wave bright in the mHz band. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for the known systems, assuming they are compact binaries, and show that a few should be detectable with only a few months of data folding. Astrophysical implications for (non-)detections are discussed.</description>

      <title>A sample of ionised Fe line-emitting X-ray sources in the inner Galactic disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies suggest that the Galactic diffuse X-ray emission is composed of unresolved point sources, primarily mCVs. However, nearby mCVs have a much lower 6.7 keV line equivalent width ($\rm EW_{6.7}$) compared to the diffuse X-ray emission. Therefore, the primary contributors to the unresolved X-ray emission remain unclear. We detected a total of 859 sources in the 6.5-7 keV band using XMM-Newton observations of the inner Galactic disc, of which 72 sources show significant iron line emission at 6.7 keV. The distribution of spectral index $\Gamma$ for these 72 sources is bimodal, with peaks at $\Gamma=0.5\pm0.4$ and $1.8\pm0.3$, suggesting two populations of sources. The soft X-ray sources have significantly larger $\rm EW_{6.7}$ than the hard X-ray sources. Furthermore, 18 of the 32 hard sources are associated with previously known CVs. We identify CV candidates in our sample as those with spectral index $\Gamma&lt;1.25$. The line ratio, 2-10 keV luminosity, and previous detection of spin period suggest that most of these hard sources are mCVs. The distribution of the $\rm EW_{6.7}$ line for the combined sample of previously identified and candidate CVs has a mean value of &lt;$\rm EW_{6.7}$&gt;$=415\pm39$ eV. Furthermore, we computed the stacked spectra of all sources detected in the 6.5-7 keV band for different flux groups, and we find evidence in the stacked spectra of hard sources that the $\rm EW_{6.7}$ increases with decreasing flux. The soft X-ray sources have &lt;$\rm EW_{6.7}$&gt;$=1.1\pm0.1$ keV. We identified 13 of the 30 soft sources associated with active stars, young stellar objects, and active binaries of RS CVn type. The &lt;$\rm EW_{6.7}$&gt; of our CV candidate sample is more than twice as large as the typical $\rm EW_{6.7}$ found in mCVs within 500 pc, and the &lt;$\rm EW_{6.7}$&gt; of our CV candidate sample is close to the $\rm EW_{6.7}$ value of Galactic diffuse X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>GECAM Discovery of Peculiar Oscillating Particle Precipitation Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged particle precipitation typically manifests as a gradual increase and decrease of flux observed by space detectors. Cases with rapidly flux variation are very rare. Periodic events are even more extraordinary. These oscillating particle precipitation (OPP) events are usually attributed to the bounce motion of electrons, which are induced by lightning. Owing to the observation limitations, there has been debate regarding whether these oscillations originate from temporal flux evolution or spatial structure evolution. Here we report three peculiar charged particle precipitation events detected by GECAM during a geomagnetic storm on March 21, 2024, with two exhibiting significant periodicity. These events were observed around the same region during three consecutive orbits. Through comprehensive temporal and spectral analyses, we revealed that one of the OPP events exhibited a transition in spectral lag of mini-pulses, shifting from "softer-earlier" to "softer-later" while showing no significant time evolution in overall frequency characteristics. And there is no association found between these two OPP events and lightning activity. Several possible scenarios are discussed to explain these charged particles with a life time of more than 3.5 hours, but the nature of these three events remains an enigma. We suggest that these GECAM-detected OPP events may represent a new type of particle precipitation event or a peculiar Lightning-induced Electron Precipitations (LEPs).</description>

      <title>Magnetar field dynamics shaped by chiral anomalies and helicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME), a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum chiral anomaly, induces currents along magnetic field lines, facilitating mutual conversion between chiral asymmetry and magnetic helicity. Although the finite electron mass suppresses chiral asymmetry through spin-flip processes, we demonstrate that the CME remains effective and plays a significant role in the magnetic field evolution of magnetars. The magnetic helicity acts as a persistent internal source of chiral asymmetry, which mediates the redistribution of magnetic energy across spatial scales, without requiring an external energy source. Focusing on the neutron star crust, we show that this mechanism reshapes the magnetic field configuration inherited at birth and, within a hundred years, amplifies both toroidal and poloidal large-scale dipolar components (relevant for spin-down) up to $10^{14}$ G at the expense of small-scale structures. Our results offer a microphysical mechanism, alternative to traditional hydrodynamic dynamo models, establishing a new framework for understanding magnetar field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Probing Sub-GeV Leptophilic Dark Matter with the Future VLAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposed Very Large Area Space Telescope (VLAST), with its expected unprecedented sensitivity in the MeV-GeV range, can also address the longstanding "MeV Gap" in gamma-ray observations. We explore the capability of VLAST to detect sub-GeV leptophilic dark matter (DM) annihilation, focusing on scalar and vector mediators and emphasizing the resonance region where the mediator mass is approximately twice the DM mass. While $s$-wave annihilation is tightly constrained by relic density and cosmic microwave background observations, $p$-wave and mixed $(s+p)$-wave scenarios remain viable, particularly near resonance. Additionally, direct detection experiments, especially those probing DM-electron scattering, significantly constrain nonresonance parameter space but are less effective in the resonance regime. VLAST can uniquely probe this surviving region, outperforming existing and planned instruments, and establishing itself as a crucial tool for indirect detection of thermal relic DM.</description>

      <title>The structure and evolution of a high-mass stellar merger in the Hertzsprung gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-main-sequence binary mergers are a common evolutionary pathway for massive stars, but the effects of merging on the long-term structure and evolution of the resulting star are a matter of active debate. Furthermore, the way in which merger products are modeled in 1D is not uniform. We present the evolution of an 11 M$_\odot$ and 6.6 M$_\odot$ binary on an 11 day orbit, that merges while the primary is crossing the Hertzsprung gap. We construct the merger product either by rapidly accreting the secondary onto the surface of the primary or by injecting material from the secondary deeper into the primary via entropy sorting. We then evolve them to carbon ignition, comparing their interior structures at this stage. We find that all merger products experience an extended blue supergiant phase and have undermassive helium cores and low carbon mass fractions compared to single and stripped stars. However, the evolution of central density, temperature, and composition in the entropy-sorted model is distinct from those of the rapid-accretion models.</description>

      <title>A Fresh Look at the Diffuse ALP Background from Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proto-neutron stars, highly compact objects formed in the core of exploding supernovae (SNe), are powerful sources of axion-like particles (ALPs). In the SN core, ALPs are dominantly produced via nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung and pion conversion, resulting in an energetic ALP spectrum peaked at energies $\mathcal{O}(100)\,\rm MeV$. In this work, we revisit the diffuse ALP background, produced from all past core-collapse supernovae, and update the constraints derived from Fermi-LAT observations. Assuming the maximum ALP-nucleon coupling allowed by the SN 1987A cooling, we set the upper limit $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-13}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$ for ALP mass $m_a\lesssim 10^{-10}\,\rm eV$, which is approximately a factor of two improvement with respect to the existing bounds. On the other hand, for $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-10}\,\rm eV$, we find that including pion conversion strengthens the bound on $g_{a\gamma \gamma}$, approximately by a factor of two compared to the constraint obtained from bremsstrahlung alone. Additionally, we present a sensitivity study for future experiments such as AMEGO-X, e-ASTROGAM, GRAMS-balloon, GRAMS-satellite, and MAST. We find that the expected constraint from MAST would be comparable to Fermi-LAT bound. However, SN 1987A constraint remains one order of magnitude stronger as compared to the bound derived from the current and future gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>Screening Mechanisms on White Dwarfs: Symmetron &amp; Dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides the first comparison of the symmetron and dilaton fields in white dwarfs. We show how these screening mechanisms behave inside {such stars} and their impact on stellar properties. Employing a custom-developed shooting method, we solve the scalar-tensor equilibrium equations in the Newtonian approximation. We consider a Chandrasekhar equation of state and examine a range of potential mass scales and coupling strengths for both fields. Both fields enhance the pressure drop in low-density white dwarfs, leading to smaller stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. Unlike chameleon models, their effects are suppressed in more massive stars, with symmetron fields fully decoupling and dilaton fields weakening but not vanishing. Consequently, no mass-radius curve for screened white dwarfs exceeds the Newtonian prediction in any of these three mechanisms. The mass-radius deviations are generally more pronounced at lower densities, depending on model parameters. Due to their common runaway potential, we confirm that dilaton and chameleon fields display similar field and gradient profiles. In contrast, due to their environment-dependent coupling, the dilaton and symmetron mechanisms exhibit stronger density-dependent screening effects. These findings highlight both phenomenological differences and theoretical similarities among these mechanisms, motivating asteroseismology studies to constrain the symmetron and dilaton parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Galactic double neutron stars as dual-line gravitational-wave sources: Prospects with LISA and Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double neutron star (DNS) systems could serve as intriguing dual-line gravitational-wave (GW) sources, emitting both high- and low-frequency GWs, arising respectively from the asymmetric spinning bodies of individual neutron stars (NSs) and the binary orbital inspiral. Detecting such dual-line signals could provide novel perspectives on binary orbital geometry and NS internal physics. We expand upon previously calculated spinning NS waveforms by incorporating higher-order terms of NS structural parameters. A population simulation is performed for spinning NS components in DNS systems potentially detectable by the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Based on 4-year LISA observation of 35 resolvable DNS systems, we estimate that 6 (22) spinning NS components could be detected by the next-generation ground-based GW detector, Cosmic Explorer, under log-uniform (uniform) sampling of NS structural parameters. For these dual-line sources, the median signal-to-noise ratio achievable with Cosmic Explorer is approximately 20--30. Through the dual-line GW detection strategy, the relative measurement accuracy of the NS moment of inertia is estimated to be $\sim 8\%$.</description>

      <title>Optical QPOs with dual periodicities 1103days and 243days in the blue quasar SDSS J100438.8+151056</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript investigates the possible existence of a binary supermassive black holes (BSMBH) system in the blue quasar SDSS J100438.8+151056 (=SDSS J1004+1510) at z=0.219 based on the detection of robust optical QPOs. We determine QPOs using multiple analysis methods applied to the CSS-V, ZTFg/r band light curves, and additionally, combined with the characteristics of broad emission lines and explores potential mechanisms for the QPOs, including jet and disk precession models. Two distinct periodicities, $1103\pm260$days and $243\pm29$days, are identified in the ZTF g/r-band light curves with confidence level exceeding $5\sigma$, through four different techniques. Meanwhile, the $1103\pm260$days periodicity is also clearly detected in the CSS V-band light curve. The optical periodicities suggest a BSMBH system candidate in SDSS J1004+1510, with an estimated total virial BH mass of $(1.13\pm0.14)\times10^8 M_{\odot}$ and a space separation of $0.0053\pm0.0016$pc for the periodicity of $1103\pm260$days. The second periodicity of $243\pm29$days could be attributed to harmonic oscillations, considering $(1103\pm260)/(243\pm29)\sim4.54\pm0.47$ with large scatters. However, if the periodicity of $243\pm29$days was from an independent QPO, a triple BH system candidate on sub-pc scale could be probably expected, with space separations of $0.00036\pm0.00004$pc between a close BSMBH system and of $0.0053\pm0.0016$pc between the BSMBH system and the third BH, after considering similar BH mass of the third BH as the total mass of the central BSMBH. These findings strongly demonstrate that combined light curves from the different sky survey projects can lead to more reliable QPOs candidates to be detected, and also indicate higher quality light curves could be helpful to find probably potential QPOs with multiple periodicities leading to rare detections of candidates for sub-pc triple BH systems.</description>

      <title>Constraints to Lorentz violation and ultrahigh-energy electrons in D-foamy space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We entertain the constraints that the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated, as established by some recent studies in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137034}{\emph{Phys. Lett. B} {\bf 829} (2022) 137034}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137536}{{\bf 835} (2022) 137536}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063006}{\emph{Phys. Rev. D} {\bf108} (2023) 063006}. We demonstrate in the present paper, that implementing a phenomenological approach to the Lorentz violation, the rates of this vacuum process are substantial such that one is justified in deriving bounds on the violation scales from simple threshold analysis just as these works did. Albeit such results are likely effective then, they do not apply in the same form among scenarios. Specifically, we show that these Cherenkov constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from~(supercritical) string theory, involving D-branes as space-time defects in a brane-world scenario, in which subluminous energy-dependent refractive indices of light have been suggested. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for both cases~(though, for different reasons) the potentiality that charged quanta such as electrons do \emph{not} radiate as they pass through the gravitational vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.</description>

Abstract: The next Milky Way supernova will be an epochal event in multi-messenger astronomy, critical to tests of supernovae, neutrinos, and new physics. Realizing this potential depends on having realistic simulations of core collapse. We investigate the neutrino predictions of nearly all modern models (1-, 2-, and 3-d) over the first $\simeq$1 s, making the first detailed comparisons of these models to each other and to the SN 1987A neutrino data. Even with different methods and inputs, the models generally agree with each other. However, even considering the low neutrino counts, the models generally disagree with data. What can cause this? We show that neither neutrino oscillations nor different progenitor masses appear to be a sufficient solution. We outline urgently needed work.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the significance of astrophysical events with multimessenger coincidences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coincident multimessenger observations of cosmic sources can offer numerous benefits, especially when used in the context of synergistic astrophysics. One significant advantage is enhancing the detection significance of separate detectors by correlating their data and assuming joint emission. We have formulated an approach for updating the Bayesian posterior probability of an astrophysical origin, namely $p_{\rm astro}$, relying on multimessenger coincidences assuming an emission model. The description is applicable to any combination of messengers. We demonstrated the formalism for the gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos case. Applying our method to the public data of candidate coincident high-energy neutrinos with subthreshold gravitational-wave triggers, we found that in the case of highly energetic neutrino coincidences, $p_{\rm astro}$ can increase from approximately $\sim 0.1$ to $\sim 0.9$. The amount of improvement depends on the assumed joint emission model. If models are trusted, the marked improvement makes subthreshold detections much more confident. Moreover, the model dependency can also be used to test the consistency of different models. This work is a crucial step toward the goal of uniting all detectors on equal footing into a statistically integrated, Earth-sized observatory for comprehensive multimessenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Observational and Theoretical Constraints on First-Order Phase Transitions in Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NSs) is a fundamental challenge in astrophysics and nuclear physics. A first-order phase transition (FOPT) at high densities could lead to the formation of a quark core, significantly affecting NS properties. This review explores observational and theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger astrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER and spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS modifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS mergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger oscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions. Pulsar timing offers additional constraints through measurements of mass, spin evolution, and glitches, with millisecond pulsars exceeding twice the solar mass posing challenges to purely hadronic EOSs. Theoretical models and numerical simulations predict that an FOPT could impact gravitational wave signals, twin-star configurations, and NS cooling. Future advancements, including next-generation gravitational wave detectors, high-precision X-ray telescopes, and improved theoretical modeling, will enhance our ability to probe phase transitions in NSs. A combination of these approaches will provide crucial insights into the existence and properties of deconfined quark matter in NS interiors.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Gas Accretion onto Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from Inspiral through Merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black hole binaries are powerful multimessenger sources emitting both gravitational and EM radiation. Understanding the accretion dynamics of these systems and predicting their distinctive EM signals is crucial to informing and guiding upcoming efforts aimed at detecting gravitational waves produced by these binaries. To this end, accurate numerical modeling is required to describe both the spacetime and the magnetized gas around the black holes. In this paper, we present two key advances in this field of research. First, we have developed a novel 3D GRMHD framework that combines multiple numerical codes to simulate the inspiral and merger of supermassive black hole binaries starting from realistic initial data and running all the way through merger. Throughout the evolution, we adopt a simple but functional prescription to account for gas cooling through photon emission. Next, we have applied our new computational method to follow the time evolution of a circular, equal-mass, non-spinning black hole binary for ~200 orbits, starting from a separation of 20r_g and reaching the post-merger evolutionary stage of the system. We have shown how mass continues to flow toward the binary even after the binary "decouples" from its surrounding disk, but the accretion rate onto the black holes diminishes. We have identified how the minidisks orbiting each black hole are slowly drained and eventually dissolve as the binary compresses. We confirm previous findings that the system's luminosity decreases by only a factor of a few during inspiral; however, we observe an abrupt increase by ~50% in this quantity at the time of merger, likely accompanied by an equally abrupt change in spectrum. Finally, we have demonstrated that during the inspiral, fluid ram pressure regulates the fraction of the magnetic flux transported to the binary that attaches to the black holes' horizons.</description>

      <title>Magnetar structure in non-linear electrodynamics with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetars have inferred polar field strengths in excess of the Schwinger limit, where non-linear electromagnetic effects can be significant. Their internal fields may be even stronger, suggesting that Maxwellian characterizations of hydromagnetic structure may require revision. A generalized Grad-Shafranov equation, describing static and axisymmetric fluid stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields, is introduced and subsequently solved in a perturbative scheme to calculate quadrupolar deformations. In the Born-Infeld theory, we show that the toroidal field has a maximum strength set by the scale parameter, $b$, implying an upper limit to the stellar prolateness, $|\epsilon_{\rm max}| \sim 10^{-5} \left(b/10^{16}\text{ G}\right)^2$, that is independent of field specifics. Observations of magnetar phenomena that are interpreted as evidence for ellipticity, such as precession, can thus implicitly constrain post-Maxwellian parameters in a way that complements terrestrial experiments. Toroidal ceilings also have implications for dynamo theory and gravitational waves, which we revisit together with field evolution in crusts abiding by beyond-Maxwell physics.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger hierarchical triple merger gravitational-wave event pair GW190514-GW190521 inside AGN J124942.3 + 344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16864</link>

Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within active galactic nuclei (AGN) J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of the sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational-wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an EM counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multimessenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves from slowly spinning neutron stars with DECIGO, Big Bang Observer, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stably rotating highly magnetised neutron stars and glitching pulsars. We discuss the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves from these sources below 20 Hz with next-generation ground-based facilities such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and space-based observatories such as DECIGO and Big Bang Observer. We demonstrate that these constitute interesting science targets. We use a robust sensitivity estimation method for future searches based on demonstrated performance. We show that the spin-down upper limit on the gravitational wave amplitude of all highly magnetised pulsars and magnetars suitable for a years-long fully coherent search, exceeds the smallest gravitational wave amplitude estimated detectable with DECIGO and Big Bang Observer. We find that the hidden magnetar candidate PSR J1852+0040 can be detected by Cosmic Explorer if it is emitting at least at 20% of its spin-down luminosity. Finally, post-glitch transient continuous gravitational waves from magnetars are an interesting target for deci-Hz detectors, with all but one of the recorded glitches giving rise to a spin-down limit signal above the smallest detectable level.</description>

      <title>Searching for pulsars in Globular Clusters with the Fast Fold Algorithm and a new pulsar discovered in M13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employed the Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA) on L-Band Globular Cluster (GC) observations taken with Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for new pulsars, especially those with a long rotational period. We conducted a search across 16 GCs that collectively host 93 known pulsars, as well as 14 GCs that do not contain any known pulsars. The majority of these known pulsars were successfully re-detected in our survey. The few non-detections could be attributed to the high accelerations of these pulsars. Additionally, we have discovered a new binary millisecond pulsar, namely M13I (or PSR J1641+3627I) in GC M13 (or NGC 6205), and obtained its phase-coherent timing solution using observations spanning 6 years. M13I has a spin period of 6.37 ms, and an orbital period of 18.23 days. The eccentricity of the binary orbit is 0.064, with a companion mass range of approximately 0.45 to 1.37 M$_{\odot}$. The orbital properties of M13I are remarkably different from those of the other known pulsars in M13, indicating that this pulsar has undergone a different evolutionary path compared to the rest.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Induced Low-Mass Gap Black Hole Echoing LVK Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves from a binary merger involving a potential low-mass gap black hole (LMBH) by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration motivates investigations into mechanisms beyond conventional stellar evolution theories to account for their existence. We study a mechanism in which dark matter (DM), through its capture and accumulation inside main sequence stars, induces the formation of black holes within the mass range of $[3, 5]M_\odot$. We examine the distribution of these LMBHs as a function of galaxy halo mass, particularly when paired with neutron stars. This gives a distinct signature that can be tested with future gravitational wave observations. We find that a viable portion of the DM parameter space predicts a merger rate of such binaries consistent with LVK observations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Phase Thermal Structure &amp; The Origin of the Broad-Line Region, Torus, and Corona in Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations have demonstrated the formation of 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks, qualitatively distinct from both classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks, as a natural consequence of fueling gas to supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. We previously showed that the dynamical structure of said disks can be approximated by simple analytic similarity models. Here we study the thermal properties of these models over a wide range of physical scales and accretion rates (from highly sub-critical to super-critical). We show there are several characteristic zones: a dusty torus-like region, a multi-phase neutral and then multi-phase ionized, broad line-emitting region interior to the sublimation radius, before finally a transition to a thermal accretion disk with a warm Comptonizing layer. The disks are strongly-flared with large scale heights, and reprocess and/or scatter an order-one fraction of the central disk emission. As a result, this simple accretion disk model predicts phenomena including the existence of a dusty torus and its covering factor, geometry, clumpiness, and dust temperatures; a broad-line-region (BLR) with its characteristic sizes and luminosities and ionization properties; extended scattering/reprocessing surfaces producing cooler disk continuum and apparently large observed disk sizes; and existence of warm Comptonizing layers and hard coronal gas. Remarkably, these properties emerge without our having to introduce new components or parameters: they are all part of the accretion flow if the disks are in the hyper-magnetized limit.</description>

      <title>Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of GRB data to test Lorentz-invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz-invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime serves as a critical probe for understanding quantum gravity phenomenology. Astrophysical observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising avenue for testing LV-induced spectral lag phenomena; however, interpretations are complicated by degeneracies between LV effects and intrinsic emission delays. This study systematically investigates three competing time delay models: Model A (LV delay combined with a constant intrinsic delay), Model B (energy-dependent intrinsic delay without LV), and Model C (LV delay combined with energy-dependent intrinsic delay). We utilize mock GRB datasets generated under distinct delay mechanisms and employ Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated observations of 10 GRBs. Our findings demonstrate that Model C consistently recovers input parameters across all datasets. In contrast, Models A and B struggle to reconcile data generated under alternative mechanisms, particularly when confronted with high-energy TeV photons from GRB 190114C and GRB 221009A. Our analysis confirms that the incorporation of energy-dependent intrinsic delays in Model C is essential for establishing robust LV constraints, effectively resolving prior ambiguities in the interpretation of multi-GeV and TeV photon emissions. The results validate Model C as a generalized framework for future LV searches, yielding a subluminal LV scale of \(E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3 \times 10^{17}\) GeV based on realistic datasets. These findings are consistent with earlier constraints derived from Fermi-LAT datasets. This work underscores the necessity for joint modeling of LV and astrophysical emission processes in next-generation LV studies utilizing observatories such as LHAASO and CTA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key scientific objectives for the next decade is to uncover the nature of dark matter (DM). We should continue prioritizing targets such as weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), Axions, and other low-mass dark matter candidates to improve our chances of achieving it. A varied and ongoing portfolio of experiments spanning different scales and detection methods is essential to maximize our chances of discovering its composition. This report paper provides an updated overview of the Brazilian community's activities in dark matter and dark sector physics over the past years with a view for the future. It underscores the ongoing need for financial support for Brazilian groups actively engaged in experimental research to sustain the Brazilian involvement in the global search for dark matter particles</description>
