      <title>Observing dynamics of distinct structural transitions in trapped-ion clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry considerations provide a powerful framework for predicting whether structural transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Laser-cooled ions in electromagnetic traps present a pristine and highly controllable, few-body system for examining this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trapping potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional unit-cell-sized ion clusters. We probe their distinct dynamical signatures: mode softening indicating a lattice instability at a symmetry-breaking continuous transition, stochastic switching between stable structures at a discontinuous transition, and hysteresis near a spinodal point. Notably, we observe a triple point-like feature where a discontinuous symmetry-changing transition and a continuous symmetry-breaking transition occur simultaneously. Analytical calculations based on symmetry considerations and numerical analysis of collective modes provide a comprehensive understanding of the observed dynamics. Our results demonstrate tunable Coulomb clusters as a versatile platform to investigate how symmetry, energy landscapes, and dynamical pathways govern structural transitions in confined few-body systems.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up Analysis of Ro-Vibrational Helical Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helical dichroism (HD) is a proposed method for the resolution of molecular chirality, employing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. Going beyond the conventional assumptions about HD, this work proposes a rigid theoretical framework for the analysis of the HD, based on molecular symmetries and rotational eigenstates. We derive the rotational selection rules, which clearly establish that HD only emerges from the spin-orbit coupling of light, even for beams without far-field OAM. Our findings refine the conditions for observing HD, shedding light on the outcome of prior experiments and guiding future designs for chiral sensing using structured light.</description>

      <title>Relativistic corrections of order $m\alpha^6$: singular operators and regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite operators are derived for the nonrecoil (leading order in the $(m/M)$ expansion) relativistic corrections in hydrogen-like atoms and ions at orders $m\alpha^6$ in the two- and three-body formalism beyond the adiabatic approximation. Singular operators that appear in the derivation are analysed, and various regularization methods are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen 21 cm Constraints on the Photon's Spin Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the fundamental but untested possibility that the photon is a continuous spin particle (CSP) with a small but non-zero spin Casimir $\rho$. When $\rho\neq 0$, the familiar polarization modes of the photon transform non-trivially under Lorentz boosts, leading to deviations from familiar QED. Surprisingly, these deviations are strongest at low energy, but smoothly vanish in the $\rho\rightarrow 0$ limit. In this letter, we compute corrections to the hydrogen 21cm transition rate, which is expected to be particularly sensitive given the small hyperfine energy splitting $\omega$. We find deviations from QED $\propto \rho^2 \alpha^2/\omega^2$ at leading order, suggesting experimental constraints $\rho\lesssim 1$ meV. Building on this work, we expect that a range of other atomic, molecular, or condensed matter systems could be used to provide even more stringent tests of $\rho$ in electromagnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases, Criticality, and Mixed State Order in a Hubbard Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phases of matter are conventionally distinguished from one another by local observables. Topological quantum phases lie outside this paradigm; their differences can only be learned by examining them globally. This has striking implications for the stability of these phases, their classification, and the phase transitions between them. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate these implications using interacting magnetic erbium atoms in an optical lattice. We show that a Mott insulator and a pinned charge-density wave in one dimension are in distinct crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). The quantum phase transition separating them is revealed by measuring nonlocal string order parameters using site-resolved imaging. Remarkably, stacking two copies of these states eliminates the critical point -- a signature feature of topological phases that underlies their classification. Moreover, we show that while a programmable symmetry-breaking disorder pattern can also remove this critical point, averaging over disorder restores it, supporting recent theoretical predictions of mixed-state order. Finally, we highlight a connection between one of these CSPTs and the Haldane insulator, and detect signatures of the transition between the Haldane and the Mott insulator. Our results establish a path toward probing broader symmetry-protected topology and mixed-state order in programmable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Robustness of Atom Interferometer Using Super-Gaussian Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser frequency drifts and atomic thermal motion can lead to errors in pulse duration and detuning in cold atom interferometry, thereby reducing measurement stability and fringe contrast. To address this issue, we investigate the use of super-Gaussian pulses, which are characterized by smooth temporal profiles and centralized energy distribution, in the beam-splitting and reflection stages of an atom interferometer. Through numerical simulations, we compare the performance of rectangular, Gaussian, and 2nd- to 10th-order super-Gaussian pulses subject to deviations in pulse duration and detuning. Our results show that super-Gaussian pulses significantly enhance interference fringe contrast and robustness, with 4th-order pulses achieving up to a 90% improvement in contrast over rectangular pulses under realistic conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of super-Gaussian pulse shaping to enhance the sensitivity and robustness of atom interferometric measurements.</description>

      <title>Resonant photon scattering in the presence of external fields and its applications for the Gamma Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This theoretical study explores resonant elastic photon scattering in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, motivated by potential applications in storage ring experiments, such as the Gamma Factory project at CERN. In this framework, resonant scattering involves head-on collisions of relativistic ion beams and counter-propagating laser photons, leading to a strong enhancement of the external field strength due to the Lorentz transformation between ion rest and laboratory frame. Calculations for He-like Ca ions reveal a notable impact of the external fields on the scattering rate as well as the angular distribution and polarization of emitted photons. This opens interesting avenues for diverse applications for the Gamma Factory project, such as as resonance condition tuning, beam cooling, and polarization control.</description>
