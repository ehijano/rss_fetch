      <title>Freely propagating flanks of wide coronal-mass-ejection-driven shocks: Modelling and observational insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Widespread solar energetic particle (SEP) events remain poorly understood phenomena in space weather. These events are often linked to coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their shocks, but the mechanisms governing their global particle distribution remain debated. The 13 March 2023 event is particularly notable as a widespread SEP event associated with an exceptionally fast interplanetary shock. With speeds of up to 3000 km/s, it is one of the most extreme shocks observed in recent years.
  We aim to investigate whether the flanks of a wide CME-driven shock can decouple from the CME and continue propagating as freely propagating shock waves. If shocks are the primary SEP source, such a mechanism could help explain some of the widest SEP events.
  Using EUHFORIA, a 3D magnetohydrodynamic heliospheric model, we simulated the evolution of wide CME-driven shocks. We modified the model to allow direct shock injection at the inner boundary, upstream of the CME ejecta. Applying this to the 13 March 2023 event, we modelled two simultaneous CMEs whose shocks form a single, wide shock envelope that spans 280{\deg} in longitude. We then compared our results to in situ observations.
  Our simulations show that the flanks of wide CME shocks can persist as freely propagating waves beyond 2 au. For the 13 March 2023 event, the modelled shock arrival times and amplitudes of associated plasma parameters (e.g. speed and density) show good agreement with observations from various spacecraft distributed across different radial distances and longitudes. Furthermore, the combined shock structure expands into a quasi-circumsolar wave as it propagates outwards.
  These findings indicate that the shock flanks of fast CMEs can persist for a long time, supporting the idea that such freely propagating shock flanks play a key role in the global distribution of SEPs in widespread events.</description>

      <title>The effect of turbulence on the angular momentum of the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transfer of a star's angular momentum to its atmosphere is a topic of considerable and wide-ranging interest in astrophysics. This letter considers the effect of kinetic and magnetic turbulence on the solar wind's angular momentum. The effects are quantified in a theoretical framework that employs Reynolds-averaged mean field magnetohydrodynamics, allowing for fluctuations of arbitrary amplitude. The model is restricted to the solar equatorial (\(r-\phi\)) plane with axial symmetry, which permits the effect of turbulence to be expressed in analytical form as a modification to the classic Weber &amp; Davis (1967) theory, dependent on the \(r,\phi\) shear component of the Reynolds stress tensor. A solar wind simulation with turbulence transport modeling and Parker Solar Probe observations at the Alfv\'en surface are employed to quantify this turbulent modification to the solar wind's angular momentum, which is found to be ~ 3% - 10% and tends to be negative. Implications for solar and stellar rotational evolution are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hyper Boris integrators for kinetic plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a family of numerical solvers for the nonrelativistic Newton--Lorentz equation in kinetic plasma simulations. The new solvers extend the standard 4-step Boris procedure, which has second-order accuracy in time, in three ways. First, we repeat the 4-step procedure multiple times, using an $n$-times smaller timestep ($\Delta t/n$). We derive a formula for the arbitrary subcycling number $n$, so that we obtain the result without repeating the same calculations. Second, prior to the 4-step procedure, we apply Boris-type gyrophase corrections to the electromagnetic field. In addition to a well-known correction to the magnetic field, we correct the electric field in an anisotropic manner to achieve higher-order ($N=2,4,6 \dots$th order) accuracy. Third, combining these two methods, we propose a family of high-accuracy particle solvers, the hyper Boris solvers, which have two hyperparameters of the subcycling number $n$ and the order of accuracy, $N$. The $n$-cycle $N$th-order solver gives a numerical error of $\sim (\Delta t/n)^{N}$ at affordable computational cost.</description>
