      <title>Characterizations of voting rules based on majority margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of voting with ranked ballots, an important class of voting rules is the class of margin-based rules (also called pairwise rules). A voting rule is margin-based if whenever two elections generate the same head-to-head margins of victory or loss between candidates, then the voting rule yields the same outcome in both elections. Although this is a mathematically natural invariance property to consider, whether it should be regarded as a normative axiom on voting rules is less clear. In this paper, we address this question for voting rules with any kind of output, whether a set of candidates, a ranking, a probability distribution, etc. We prove that a voting rule is margin-based if and only if it satisfies some axioms with clearer normative content. A key axiom is what we call Preferential Equality, stating that if two voters both rank a candidate $x$ immediately above a candidate $y$, then either voter switching to rank $y$ immediately above $x$ will have the same effect on the election outcome as if the other voter made the switch, so each voter's preference for $y$ over $x$ is treated equally.</description>

      <title>On the Dominance of Truth-Telling in Gradual Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent literature highlights the advantages of implementing social rules via dynamic game forms. We characterize when truth-telling remains a dominant strategy in gradual mechanisms implementing strategy-proof social rules, where agents gradually reveal their private information while acquiring information about others in the process. Our first characterization hinges on the incentive-preservation of a basic transformation on gradual mechanisms called illuminating that partitions information sets. The second relies on a single reaction-proofness condition. We demonstrate the usefulness of both characterizations through applications to second-price auctions and the top-trading cycles algorithm.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Verification in Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.05556v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a model of probabilistic verification in mechanism design. The principal elicits a message from the agent and then selects a test to give the agent. The agent's true type determines the probability with which he can pass each test. We characterize whether each type has an associated test that best screens out all other types. If this condition holds, then the testing technology can be represented in a tractable reduced form. We use this reduced form to solve for profit-maximizing mechanisms with verification. As the verification technology varies, the solution continuously interpolates between the no-verification solution and full surplus extraction.</description>
