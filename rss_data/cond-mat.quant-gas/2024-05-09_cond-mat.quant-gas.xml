      <title>Universality and two-body losses: lessons from the effective non-Hermitian dynamics of two particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the late-time dynamics of two particles confined in one spatial dimension and subject to two-body losses. The dynamics is exactly described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that can be analytically studied both in the continuum and on a lattice. The asymptotic decay rate and the universal power-law form of the decay of the number of particles are exactly computed in the whole parameter space of the problem. When in the initial state the two particles are far apart, the average number of particles in the setup decays with time $t$ as $t^{-1/2}$; a different power law, $t^{-3/2}$, is found when the two particles overlap in the initial state. These results are valid both in the continuum and on a lattice, but in the latter case a logarithmic correction appears.</description>

      <title>Boson-fermion pairing and condensation in two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a mixture of bosons and spin-polarized fermions in two dimensions at zero temperature with a tunable Bose-Fermi attraction. By adopting a diagrammatic T-matrix approach, we analyze the behavior of several thermodynamic quantities for the two species as a function of the density ratio and coupling strength, including the chemical potentials, the momentum distribution functions, the boson condensate density, and the Tan's contact parameter. By increasing the Bose-Fermi attraction, we find that the condensate is progressively depleted and Bose-Fermi pairs form, with a small fraction of condensed bosons surviving even for strong Bose-Fermi attraction. This small condensate proves sufficient to hybridize molecular and atomic states, producing quasi-particles with unusual Fermi liquid features. A nearly universal behavior of the condensate fraction, the bosonic momentum distribution, and Tan's contact parameter with respect to the density ratio is also found.</description>

      <title>Phase-induced vortex pinning in rotating supersolid dipolar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the pinning of vortices for a stationary rotating dipolar supersolid along the low-density paths between droplets as a function of the rotation frequency. We restrict ourselves to the stationary configurations of vortices with the same symmetry as that of the array of droplets. Our approach exploits the fact that the wave function of each droplet acquires a linear phase on the coordinates, and hence the relative phases between neighboring droplets allows us to predict the position of the vortices. For a confined system, the estimate accurately reproduces the Gross-Pitaevskii results in the spatial regions where the neighboring droplets are well defined.</description>

      <title>Comparison of two different integration methods for the (1+1)-Dimensional Schro\"odinger-Poisson Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare two different numerical methods to integrate in time spatially delocalized initial densities using the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation system as the evolution law. The basic equation is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an auto-gravitating potential created by the wave function density itself. The latter is determined as a solution of Poisson's equation modelling, e.g., non-relativistic gravity. For reasons of complexity, we treat a one-dimensional version of the problem whose numerical integration is still challenging because of the extreme long-range forces (being constant in the asymptotic limit). Both of our methods, a Strang splitting scheme and a basis function approach using B-splines, are compared in numerical convergence and effectivity. Overall, our Strang-splitting evolution compares favourably with the B-spline method. In particular, by using an adaptive time-stepper rather large one-dimensional boxes can be treated. These results give hope for extensions to two spatial dimensions for not too small boxes and large evolution times necessary for describing, for instance, dark matter formation over cosmologically relevant scales.</description>

      <title>Exotic Superfluid with Emergent flux in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a novel chiral superfluid (CSF) phase in a chain of Bose-Fermi mixture, which has been validated using two unbiased numerical methods, density matrix renormalization group and Grassmann multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz. The system hosts the interplay between two types of fermions: bare spinless fermions and composite fermions, the latter consisting of a fermion and a boson. In the CSF phase, bosons condensate at non-zero momentum $\pm 2\pi /L$ with chain length $L$. In essence, the local superfluid order parameter continuously rotates along the chain, indicating that the CSF phase spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry. This symmetry breaking gives rise to an emergent flux in the background, effectively optimizing the kinetic energy of the composite fermions within the system. We provide a physical understanding at the mean-field level. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the 1D CSF phase can emerge in a more widely applicable extended Hubbard model. The potential realization of this phase in cold-atom experiments has also been explored.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo and perturbative study of two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive analytically the leading beyond-mean field contributions to the zero-temperature equation of state and to the fermionic quasi-particle residue and effective mass of a dilute Bose-Fermi mixture in two dimensions. In the repulsive case, we perform quantum Monte Carlo simulations for two representative bosonic concentrations and equal masses, extending a method for correcting finite-size effects in fermionic gases to Bose-Fermi mixtures. We find good agreement between analytic expressions and numerical results for weak interactions, while significant discrepancies appear in the regime close to mechanical instability, above which we provide evidence of phase separation of the bosonic component.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal order parameter of pair superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Order parameters represent a fundamental resource to characterize quantum matter. We show that pair superfluids can be rigorously defined in terms of a nonlocal order parameter, named odd parity, which derivation is experimentally accessible by local density measurements. As a case of study, we first investigate a constrained Bose-Hubbard model at different densities, both in one and two spatial dimensions. Here, our analysis finds pair superfluidity for relatively strong attractive interactions. The odd parity operator acts as the unique order parameter for such phase irrespectively to the density of the system and its dimensionality. In order to enforce our finding, we confirm the generality of our approach also on a two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which experimental realization represents a timely topic in ultracold atomic systems. Our results shed new light on the role of correlated density fluctuations in pair superfluids. In addition, they provide a powerful tool for the experimental detection of such exotic phases and the characterization of their transition to the normal superfluid phase.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional correlation propagation dynamics with a cluster discrete phase-space method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of highly-controlled quantum systems is a challenging issue in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics, relevant to recent experimental developments of analog and digital quantum simulations. In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, makes it possible to realize scalable numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the choice of the separation into finite regions of clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on the correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We also compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those of a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in a short time region, where the energy is well conserved in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it can be potentially applied to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Ground-state properties of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling and quantum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ground-state properties of dipolar spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensates with quantum fluctuations and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The combined effects of dipole-dipole interaction (DDI), SOC, and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction induced by quantum fluctuations on the ground-state structures and spin textures of the system are analyzed and discussed. For the nonrotating case and fixed nonlinear interspecies contact interaction strengths, our results show that structural phase transitions can be achieved by adjusting the strengths of the DDI and LHY correction. In the absence of SOC, a ground-state phase diagram is given with respect to the DDI strength and the LHY correction strength. We find that the system exhibits rich quantum phases including square droplet lattice phase, annular phase, loop-island structure, stripe-droplet coexistence phase, toroidal stripe phase, and Thomas-Fermi (TF) phase. For the rotating case, the increase of DDI strength can lead to a quantum phase transition from superfluid phase to supersolid phase. In the presence of SOC, the quantum droplets display obvious stretching and hidden vortex-antivortex clusters are formed in each component. In particular, weak or moderate SOC favors the formation of droplets while for strong SOC the ground state of the system develops into a stripe phase with hidden vortex-antivortex clusters. Furthermore, the system sustains exotic spin textures and topological excitations, such as composite skyrmion-antiskyrmion-meron-antimeron cluster, meron-antimeron string cluster, antimeron-meron-antimeron chain cluster, and peculiar skyrmion-antiskyrmion-meron-antimeron necklace with a meron-antimeron necklace embedded inside and a central spin Neel domain wall.</description>

      <title>Chiral Pseudo Spin Liquids in Moire Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose multi-layer moire structures in strong external magnetic fields as a novel platform for realizing highly-tunable, frustrated Hubbard physics with topological order. Identifying the layer degree of freedom as a pseudo spin, allows us to retain SU(2) symmetry while controlling ring-exchange processes and concurrently quenching the kinetic energy by large external magnetic fields. This way, a broad class of interacting Hubbard-Hofstadter states and their transitions can be studied. Remarkably, in the limit of strong interactions the system becomes Mott insulating and we find chiral pseudo spin liquid phases which are induced by the magnetic field. We find that this topologically ordered state remains exceptionally stable towards relevant perturbations. We discuss how layer pseudo-spin can be probed in near-term experiments. As the magnetic flux can be easily tuned in moire systems, our approach provides a promising route towards the experimental realization and control of topologically ordered phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Geometric semimetals and their simulation in synthetic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals, such as the Weyl and Dirac semimetals, represent one of the most active research fields in modern condensed matter physics. The peculiar physical properties of these systems mainly originate from their underlying symmetries, emergent relativistic dispersion, and band topology. In this Letter, we present a different class of gapless systems in three dimensions, dubbed $\textit{geometric semimetals}$. These semimetals are protected by the generalized chiral and rotation symmetries, but are topologically trivial. Nevertheless, we show that their band geometry is nontrivial, as evidenced by the nonzero quantum metric trace with possible quantization. The possible realization in synthetic-matter experiments is also discussed.</description>
