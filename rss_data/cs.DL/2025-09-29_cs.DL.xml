      <title>Funding, authorship patterns and citation impact of articles funded by Ukrainian agencies before and during Russia's full-scale war (2020-2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine affected foreign co-funding, authorship patterns, and the citation impact of articles funded by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (MESU), the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU), and the National Research Foundation of Ukraine (NRFU). The analysis includes articles in Scopus-indexed journals between 2020 and 2023. The share of articles funded by these agencies increased from 8.6% in 2020-2021 to 11.9% in 2022-2023. During the war, the citation impact of MESU-funded articles rose, driven mainly by highly cited articles authored by Ukrainian scholars with foreign co-affiliations, and to a lesser extent by international collaborations. In contrast, the citation impact of NASU- and NRFU-funded articles remained stable. For NASU-funded articles, foreign co-funding was consistently associated with higher citation impact. However, MESU-funded articles published in 2022-2023 without foreign co-funding outperformed those with such funding. Notably, NASU-funded articles without foreign co-funding had citation impact statistically indistinguishable from unfunded articles, yet made up 59.6% of NASU-funded output in 2022-2023. These findings highlight the need to reform research funding allocation in Ukraine to prioritise potentially more impactful work and to strengthen international collaboration, which remains strongly linked to higher research visibility and influence.</description>

      <title>Metrics Over Merit: The Hidden Costs of Citation Impact in Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Once upon a time, scientists' worth was measured by their ideas, proofs, and perhaps how eloquently they debated Hilbert's problems at seminars. But now, citation metrics have come to center stage and handed us new masters: FWCI and CNCI. This paper critically, and with a touch of satire, examines how these seemingly objective metrics are shaping, and often distorting, the scientific landscape. Through examples and analysis, we highlight the consequences of relying too heavily on such indicators in evaluating researchers and scientific contributions.</description>

      <title>Rxiv-Maker: an automated template engine for streamlined scientific publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00836v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of preprint servers has accelerated scientific dissemination but has also shifted the technical burden of manuscript preparation to authors. This challenge is particularly acute in computational research, where manuscripts must remain synchronised with evolving data and code. We present Rxiv-Maker, a framework that resolves this by converting simple Markdown files into professionally typeset, publication-ready PDFs. Its core feature is the ability to execute embedded code, creating a self-updating manuscript where figures and statistical values are generated directly from source data during compilation. This ensures that the final document is always current and fully reproducible. By integrating with standard tools like Git and Visual Studio (VS) Code, Rxiv-Maker provides an efficient, transparent, and collaborative authoring experience, applying principles of software engineering to academic writing to foster open and verifiable science.</description>
