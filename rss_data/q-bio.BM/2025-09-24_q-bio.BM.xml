      <title>A Novel Mathematical Model of Protein Interactions from the Perspective of Electron Delocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins are the workhorse molecules of the cell and perform their biological functions by binding to other molecules through physical contact. Protein function is then regulated through coupling of bindings on the protein (allosteric regulation). Just as the genetic code provides the blueprint for protein synthesis, the coupling is thought to provide the basis for protein communication and interaction. However, it is not yet fully understood how binding of a molecule at one site affects binding of another molecule at another distal site on a protein, even more than $60$ years after its discovery in 1961. In this paper, I propose a simple mathematical model of protein interactions, using a ``quantized'' version of differential geometry, i.e., the discrete differential geometry of $n$-simplices. The model is based on the concept of electron delocalization, one of the main features of quantum chemistry, Allosteric regulation then follows tautologically from the definition of interactions. No prior knowledge of conventional discrete differential geometry, protein science, or quantum chemistry is required. I hope this paper will provide a starting point for many mathematicians to study chemistry and molecular biology.</description>

      <title>A deep reinforcement learning platform for antibiotic discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for new antibiotics. Here we present ApexAmphion, a deep-learning framework for de novo design of antibiotics that couples a 6.4-billion-parameter protein language model with reinforcement learning. The model is first fine-tuned on curated peptide data to capture antimicrobial sequence regularities, then optimised with proximal policy optimization against a composite reward that combines predictions from a learned minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classifier with differentiable physicochemical objectives. In vitro evaluation of 100 designed peptides showed low MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) for all candidates (100% hit rate). Moreover, 99 our of 100 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The lead molecules killed bacteria primarily by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane. By unifying generation, scoring and multi-objective optimization with deep reinforcement learning in a single pipeline, our approach rapidly produces diverse, potent candidates, offering a scalable route to peptide antibiotics and a platform for iterative steering toward potency and developability within hours.</description>

      <title>Biology-Instructions: A Dataset and Benchmark for Multi-Omics Sequence Understanding Capability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in general domains, but their application to multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale instruction-tuning dataset for multi-omics biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules. This dataset bridges LLMs and complex biological sequence-related tasks, enhancing their versatility and reasoning while maintaining conversational fluency. We also highlight significant limitations of current state-of-the-art LLMs on multi-omics tasks without specialized training. To overcome this, we propose ChatMultiOmics, a strong baseline with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating superior biological understanding through Biology-Instructions. Both resources are publicly available, paving the way for better integration of LLMs in multi-omics analysis. The Biology-Instructions is publicly available at: https://github.com/hhnqqq/Biology-Instructions.</description>

      <title>XDIP: A Curated X-ray Absorption Spectrum Dataset for Iron-Containing Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth-abundant iron is an essential metal in regulating the structure and function of proteins. This study presents the development of a comprehensive X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) database focused on iron-containing proteins, addressing a critical gap in available high-quality annotated spectral data for iron-containing proteins. The database integrates detailed XAS spectra with their corresponding local structural data of proteins and enables direct comparison between spectral features and structural motifs. Utilizing a combination of manual curation and semi-automated data extraction techniques, we developed a comprehensive dataset via extensive literature review, ensuring the quality and accuracy of data, which contains 437 protein structures and 1954 XAS spectrums. Our methods included careful documentation and validation processes to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. This dataset not only centralizes information on iron-containing proteins but also supports advanced data-driven discoveries, such as machine learning, to predict and analyze protein structure and functions. This work underscores the potential of integrating detailed spectroscopic data with structural biology to advance the field of biological chemistry and catalysis.</description>

      <title>FragmentGPT: A Unified GPT Model for Fragment Growing, Linking, and Merging in Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities, and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.</description>
