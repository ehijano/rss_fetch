      <title>Invertibility for non-Hermitian random band matrices with sublinear bandwidth and discrete entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known result in random matrix theory, proven by Kahn, Koml\'os and Szemer\'edi in 1995, states that a square random matrix with i.i.d. uniform $\{\pm 1\}$ entries is invertible with probability $1-\exp(-\Omega(n))$. As a natural generalization of the model and motivated by the Anderson localization-delocalization transition in mathematical physics, we consider the invertibility of a class of random band matrices with independent entries where the bandwidth $d_n$ scales like $n^\alpha$, for some $\alpha\in(0,1)$. The band matrix model we consider is sufficiently general and covers existing models such as the block band matrix and periodic band matrix, allowing great flexibility in the variance profile. As the bandwidth is sublinear in the dimension, estimating the invertibility and least singular values of these matrices is a well-known open problem. We make a progress towards the invertibility problem by showing that, when $\alpha&gt;\frac{2}{3}$ and when the random variables are i.i.d. uniformly distributed on $\{\pm 1\}$, then the band matrix is invertible with probability $1-\exp(-\Omega(n^{\alpha/2}))$. Previously, even invertibility with probability $1-o(1)$ was not known for these band matrix models except in the very special case of block band matrices.</description>

      <title>Gaussian concentration bounds for probabilistic cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study lattice spin systems and analyze the evolution of Gaussian concentration bounds (GCB) under the action of probabilistic cellular automata (PCA), which serve as discrete-time analogues of Markovian spin-flip dynamics. We establish the conservation of GCB and, in the high-noise regime, demonstrate that GCB holds for the unique stationary measure. Additionally, we prove the equivalence of GCB for the space-time measure and its spatial marginals in the case of contractive probabilistic cellular automata. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between (non)-uniqueness and GCB in the context of space-time Gibbs measures for PCA and illustrate these results with examples.</description>

      <title>Community Bail Fund Systems: Fluid Limits and Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community bail funds (CBFs) assist individuals who have been arrested and cannot afford bail, preventing unnecessary pretrial incarceration along with its harmful or sometimes fatal consequences. By posting bail, CBFs allow defendants to stay at home and maintain their livelihoods until trial. This paper introduces new stochastic models that combine queueing theory with classic insurance risk models to capture the dynamics of the remaining funds in a CBF. We first analyze a model where all bail requests are accepted. Although the remaining fund balance can go negative, this model provides insight for CBFs that are not financially constrained. We then apply the Skorokhod map to make sure the CBF balance does not go negative and show that the Skorokhod map produces a model where requests are partially fulfilled. Finally, we analyze a model where bail requests can be blocked if there is not enough money to satisfy the request upon arrival. Although the blocking model prevents the CBF from being negative, the blocking feature gives rise to new analytical challenges for a direct stochastic analysis. Thus, we prove a functional law of large numbers or a fluid limit for the blocking model and show that the fluid limit is a distributed delay equation. We assess the quality of our fluid limit via simulation and show that the fluid limit accurately describes the large-scale stochastic dynamics of the CBF. Finally, we prove stochastic ordering results for the CBF processes we analyze.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Anderson Model in Hyperbolic Spaces and Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a Parabolic Anderson model (PAM) with Gaussian noise that is white in time and colored in space, where the spatial correlation decays polynomially with order $\alpha$. In Euclidean spaces with dimension greater than $2$, it is well-understood that the critical value for $\alpha$ is $2$. Specifically, for $\alpha&lt;2$, the second moment of the solution grows exponentially over time, while for $\alpha&gt;2$, there is a phase transition, from the second moment being uniformly bounded in time to exhibiting exponential growth in time when the inverse temperature increases. This critical behavior arises from the fact that in Euclidean space, Brownian motion tends to infinity at a speed of $\sqrt{t}$.
  The present work explores the PAM on a hyperbolic space. Given that Brownian motion in a hyperbolic space travels at a speed of $t$, one expects that $\alpha=1$ would be the critical value for the above phenomena. We confirm that this intuition is indeed correct. Furthermore, we uncover a novel phase for $\alpha&lt;1$ in which the second moment explodes sub-exponentially, distinct from the behavior observed in Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Capacity of the range of random walk: Moderate deviations in dimensions 4 and 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a moderate deviation principle for the capacity of the range of random walk in $\mathbb{Z}^5$. Depending on the scale of deviation, we get two different regimes. We observe Gaussian tails when the deviation scale is smaller than $n^{1/2} (\log n)^{3/4}$. Otherwise, we get non-Gaussian tails with a constant arising from a generalized Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. This is analogous to the behavior of the volume of the random walk range in $\mathbb{Z}^3$. Our methods can also be applied to the $d = 4$ case to prove the moderate deviation principle in almost the full range of interest. This extends the work of Okada and the first author \cite{AdhikariOkada2023}, where they showed moderate deviations up to a deviation scale of $\log \log n$ times the standard deviation.</description>

      <title>New Sufficient Conditions for Moment-determinacy via the Probability Density Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the ways to characterize a probability distribution is to show that it is moment-determinate, or, uniquely determined by knowing all its moments. The uniqueness, in the absolutely continuous case, depends strongly on the behaviour of the probability density tails. A sufficient condition of this type implying the moment-determinacy was introduced in the recent paper by Wei and Zhang (2025). Analyzing in detail the condition of these authors led us to finding a more general checkable condition in terms of the `density tails' which allows to extend previous or establish new results on moment-determinacy of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Discrete Boltzmann distributions via multisets and their coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the combinatorics that gives rise to the Boltzmann probability distribution. Despite being one of the most important distributions in physics and other fields of science, the mathematics of the underlying model of particles at different energy levels is underexplored. This paper gives a reconstruction, using multisets with fixed sums as mathematical representations. Counting (the coefficients of) such multisets gives a general description of binomial, trinomial, quadrinomial etc.\ coefficients, here called N-nomials. These coefficients give rise to multiple discrete Boltzmann distributions that are linked to explanations in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>Potentials in recurrent networks: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonnegative function on the vertices of an infinite graph G which vanishes at a distinguished vertex o, has Laplacian 1 at o, and is harmonic at all other vertices is called a potential. We survey basic properties of potentials in recurrent networks. In particular, we show that potentials are Lipschitz with respect to the effective resistance metric, and if the potential is unique, then there is a determinantal formula for the harmonic measures from infinity. We also infer from the von Neumann minimax theorem that there always exists a potential tending to infinity.</description>

  Within the defaultable setup, we introduce a type of generalized Dynkin game, we characterize the common value of the game via the solution of the doubly reflected BSDEs and we show the existence of a saddle point.</description>

We show that \(\sqrt{3/8} \cdot \|X\|_{\psi_2} \le \sigma_X \le \sqrt{\log 2} \cdot \|X\|_{\psi_2}\), and that both bounds are sharp, attained by the standard Gaussian and Rademacher distributions, respectively.</description>

      <title>Rough SDEs and Robust Filtering for Jump-Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of a robust, i.e., continuous, representation of the conditional distribution in a stochastic filtering model for multidimensional correlated jump-diffusions. Even in the absence of jumps, it is known that in general such a representation can only be continuous with respect to rough path topologies, leading us naturally to express the conditional dynamics as a rough stochastic differential equation with jumps. Via the analysis of such equations, including exponential moments, Skorokhod continuity, and randomisation of the rough path, we establish several novel robustness results for stochastic filters.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Geometry and Small Time Mass of Anderson Models on Planar Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Anderson Hamiltonian (AH) and the parabolic Anderson model (PAM) with white noise and Dirichlet boundary condition on a bounded planar domain $D\subset\mathbb R^2$. We compute the small time asymptotics of the AH's exponential trace up to order $O(\log t)$, and of the PAM's mass up to order $O(t\log t)$. Our proof is probabilistic, and relies on the asymptotics of intersection local times of Brownian motions and bridges in $\mathbb R^2$. Applications of our main result include the following:
  (i) If the boundary $\partial D$ is sufficiently regular, then $D$'s area and $\partial D$'s length can both be recovered almost surely from a single observation of the AH's eigenvalues. This extends Mouzard's Weyl law in the special case of bounded domains (Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e Probab. Statist. 58(3): 1385-1425).
  (ii) If $D$ is simply connected and $\partial D$ is fractal, then $\partial D$'s Minkowski dimension (if it exists) can be recovered almost surely from the PAM's small time asymptotics.
  (iii) The variance of the white noise can be recovered almost surely from a single observation of the AH's eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a complete left-tail asymptotic series for the density of the {\it martingale limit} of a supercritical multitype Galton-Watson process in the Schr\"oder case. We show that the series converges everywhere, not only for small arguments. This is the first complete result regarding the left tails of multitype branching processes. A good, quickly computed approximation for the density will also be derived from the series.</description>

      <title>Radon Partitions of Random Gaussian Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a probabilistic framework for Radon partitions, where our points are chosen independently from the $d$-dimensional normal distribution. For every point set we define a corresponding Radon polytope, which encodes all information about Radon partitions of our set - with Radon partitions corresponding to faces of the polytope. This allows us to derive expressions for the probability that a given partition of $N$ randomly chosen points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ forms a Radon partition. These expressions involve conic kinematic formulas and intrinsic volumes, and in general require repeated integration, though we obtain closed formulas in some cases. This framework can provide new perspectives on open problems that can be formulated in terms of Radon partitions, such as Reay's relaxed Tverberg conjecture.</description>

Abstract: By effectivizing a Kakeya set construction, we prove the existence of lines in all directions that do not contain any double exponential time random points. This means each point on these lines has an algorithmically predictable location, to the extent that a gambler in an environment with fair payouts can, using double exponential time computing resources, amass unbounded capital placing bets on increasingly precise estimates of the point's location. Our result resolves an open question published by Lutz and Lutz (2015).</description>

      <title>A Malliavin calculus approach to score functions in diffusion generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we derive an exact, closed form, expression for the score function for a broad class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the development of score-based diffusion generative models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ and $G$ be two graphs. A spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ is called weakly $F$-saturated if one can add to $H$ the edges of $G \setminus H$ in some order, so that whenever a new edge is added, a new copy of $F$ is formed. Obtaining lower bounds for the minimum size $\mathrm{wsat}(G,F)$ of such an $H$ is a classical problem in extremal combinatorics. In particular, in the past 40 years, various algebraic tools have been developed to prove lower bounds on the weak saturation number $\mathrm{wsat}(G,F)$. Our paper uncovers a new connection of weak saturation to topology of clique complexes, that allows to prove tight lower bounds in some cases when the algebraic tools are not efficient.
  It is easy to see that the smallest $K_3$-saturating graphs in $K_n$ are trees, thus $\mathrm{wsat}(K_n,K_3)=n-1$. In 2017, Kor\'andi and Sudakov proved that this is also the case in dense random graphs $G\sim G_{n,p}$, $p=\mathrm{const}\in(0,1)$, and posed the question of determining the smallest $p$ for which $G_{n,p}$ contains a $K_3$-saturating tree with high probability. Using the new topological connection, we show that this critical $p$ is of order $n^{-1/3-o(1)}$.
  Inspired by Gromov's local-to-global principle for hyperbolic groups, we further develop our topological approach and determine the critical probability up to a constant factor, for trees with diameter at most $n^{c}$, for some $c&gt;0$.
  The new connection also enables us to improve the best known upper bound on the threshold probability for simple connectivity of the 2-dimensional clique complex of $G_{n,p}$, due to Kahle.</description>

      <title>Longest increasing subsequences for distributions with atoms, and an inhomogeneous Hammersley process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A famous result by Hammersley and Versik-Kerov states that the length $L_n$ of the longest increasing subsequence among $n$ iid continuous random variables grows like $2\sqrt{n}$. We investigate here the asymptotic behavior of $L_n$ for distributions with atoms. For purely discrete random variables, we characterize the asymptotic order of $L_n$ through a variational problem and provide explicit estimates for classical distributions. The proofs rely on a coupling with an inhomogeneous version of the discrete-time continuous-space Hammersley process. This reveals that, in contrast to the continuous case, the discrete setting exhibits a wide range of growth rates between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $o(\sqrt{n})$, depending on the tail behavior of the distribution. We can then easily deduce the asymptotics of $L_n$ for a completely arbitrary distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are the first to present a Bochner integral representation of the logarithmic Laplacian on weighted graphs and to derive, under the assumption of stochastic completeness, its explicit pointwise form. For weighted lattice graphs with uniformly positive vertex measures, we establish sharp upper and lower bounds for the associated log kernel, prove that the logarithmic Laplacian fails to be bounded on l2, and offer an alternative derivation of the above formula. Moreover, we compute the Fourier multipliers of both the fractional and logarithmic Laplacians, and derive the exact large time behavior and off diagonal asymptotics of their heat kernels, including all sharp asymptotic constants.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian Motion with Negative Hurst Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. Here we extend this definition to the strongly anti-persistent regime $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The extended fBm turns out to be stationary, and we derive its autocorrelation function. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also determine the variance of a closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for $-1/2&lt;H&lt;0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies two estimators for Gaussian moment tensors: the standard sample moment estimator and a plug-in estimator based on Isserlis's theorem. We establish dimension-free, non-asymptotic error bounds that demonstrate and quantify the advantage of Isserlis's estimator for tensors of even order $p&gt;2$. Our bounds hold in operator and entrywise maximum norms, and apply to symmetric and asymmetric tensors.</description>

      <title>Consistency and Inconsistency in $K$-Means Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Pollard proves asymptotic consistency for $k$-means clustering when the population distribution has finite variance. In this work, we point out that the population-level $k$-means clustering problem is, in fact, well-posed under the weaker assumption of a finite expectation, and we investigate whether some form of asymptotic consistency holds in this setting. As we illustrate in a variety of negative results, the complete story is quite subtle; for example, the empirical $k$-means cluster centers may fail to converge even if there exists a unique set of population $k$-means cluster centers. A detailed analysis of our negative results reveals that inconsistency arises because of an extreme form of cluster imbalance, whereby the presence of outlying samples leads to some empirical $k$-means clusters possessing very few points. We then give a collection of positive results which show that some forms of asymptotic consistency, under only the assumption of finite expectation, may be recovered by imposing some a priori degree of balance among the empirical $k$-means clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14790v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Parisi formula for the limiting free energy of multi-species spherical spin glasses with mixed $p$-spin interactions. The upper bound involves a Guerra-style interpolation and requires a convexity assumption on the model's covariance function. Meanwhile, the lower bound adapts the cavity method of Chen so that it can be combined with the synchronization technique of Panchenko; this part requires no convexity assumption. In order to guarantee that the resulting Parisi formula has a minimizer, we formalize the pairing of synchronization maps with overlap measures so that the constraint set is a compact metric space. This space is not related to the model's spherical structure and can be carried over to other multi-species settings.</description>

      <title>Connectivity of a Family of Bilateral Agreement Random Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilateral agreement based random undirected graphs were introduced and analyzed by La and Kabkab in 2015. The construction of the graph with $n$ vertices in this model uses a (random) preference order on other $n-1$ vertices and each vertex only prefers the top $k$ other vertices using its own preference order; in general, $k$ can be a function of $n$. An edge is constructed in the ensuing graph if and only if both vertices of a potential edge prefer each other. This random graph is a generalization of the random $k^{th}$-nearest neighbor graphs of Cooper and Frieze that only consider unilateral preferences of the vertices. Moharrami \emph{et al.} studied the emergence of a giant component and its size in this new random graph family in the limit of $n$ going to infinity when $k$ is finite. Connectivity properties of this random graph family have not yet been formally analyzed. In their original paper, La and Kabkab conjectured that for $k(t)=t \log n$, with high probability connectivity happens at $t&gt;1$ and the graph is disconnected for $t&lt;1$. We provide a proof for this conjecture. We will also introduce an asymptotic for the average degree of this graph.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Theory of Increasing Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12585v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An influential theory of increasing returns has been proposed by the economist W. B. Arthur in the '80s to explain the lock-in phenomenon between two competing commercial products. In the most simplified situation there are two competing products that gain customers according to a majority mechanism: each new customer arrives and asks which product they bought to a certain odd number of previous customers, and then buy the most shared product within this sample. It is known that one of these two companies reaches monopoly almost surely in the limit of infinite customers. Here we consider a generalization [G. Dosi, Y. Ermoliev, Y. Kaniovsky, J. Math. Econom. 23, 1-19 (1994)] where the new customer follows the indication of the sample with some probability, and buy the other product otherwise. Other than economy, this model can be reduced to the urn of Hill, Lane and Sudderth, and includes several models of physical interest as special cases, like the Elephant Random Walk, the Friedman's urn and other generalized urn models. We provide a large deviation analysis of this model at the sample-path level, and give a formula that allows to find the most likely trajectories followed by the market share variable. Interestingly, in the parameter range where the lock-in phase is expected, we observe a whole region of convergence where the entropy cost is sub-linear. We also find a non-linear differential equation for the cumulant generating function of the market share variable, that can be studied with a suitable perturbations theory.</description>

      <title>Subcritical Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos in the Wiener Space: Construction, Moments and Volume Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and study properties of an infinite dimensional analog of Kahane's theory of Gaussian multiplicative chaos \cite{K85}. Namely, if $H_T(\omega)$ is a random field defined w.r.t. space-time white noise $\dot B$ and integrated w.r.t. Brownian paths in $d\geq 3$, we consider the renormalized exponential, weighted w.r.t. the Wiener measure $\mathbb P_0$. We construct the almost sure limit $\mu_\gamma$ in the {\it entire weak disorder (subcritical)} regime and call it {\it subcritical GMC} on the Wiener space. We show that $$ \mu_\gamma\Big\{\omega: \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{H_T(\omega)}{T(\phi\star\phi)(0)} \ne \gamma\Big\}=0 \qquad \mbox{almost surely,} $$ meaning, $\mu_\gamma$ is supported only on $\gamma$-{\it thick paths}, and consequently, the normalized version is singular w.r.t. the Wiener measure. We characterize uniquely the limit $\mu_\gamma$ w.r.t. the mollification scheme $\phi$ in the sense of Shamov \cite{S14} and the random {\it rooted} measure $\mathbb Q_{\mu_\gamma}(d\dot B d\omega)= \mu_\gamma(d\omega,\dot B)P(d\dot B)$.
  We then determine the fractal properties of the measure around $\gamma$-thick paths: $-C_2 \leq \liminf_{r\to 0} r^2 \log \widehat\mu_\gamma(\|\omega\| &lt; r) \leq \limsup_{r\to 0}\sup_\eta r^2 \log \widehat\mu_\gamma(\|\omega-\eta \| &lt; r) \leq -C_1$ w.r.t a weighted norm $\|\cdot\|$. Here $C_1&gt;0$ and $C_2&lt;\infty$ are the uniform upper (resp. pointwise lower) H\"older exponents which are {\it explicit} in the entire weak disorder regime. Moreover, they converge to the scaling exponent of the Wiener measure as the disorder approaches zero. Finally, we establish negative and $L^p$ ($p&gt;1$) moments for the total mass of $\mu_\gamma$ in the weak disorder regime.</description>

Abstract: Mott's variable range hopping (v.r.h.) is the phonon-induced hopping of electrons in disordered solids (such as doped semiconductors) within the regime of strong Anderson localization. It was introduced by N.~Mott to explain the anomalous low temperature conductivity decay in dimension $d\geq 2$, corresponding now to the so called Mott's law. We provide a rigorous derivation of this Physics law for two effective models of Mott v.r.h.: the random resistor network for v.r.h. of \cite[Section~IV]{AHL} and Mott's random walk. We also determine the constant multiplying the power of the inverse temperature in the exponent in Mott's law, which was an open problem also on a heuristic level.</description>

      <title>Survival and extinction for a contact process with a density-dependent birth rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study later spatial evolutionary games based on the multitype contact process, we first focus in this paper on the conditions for survival/extinction in the presence of only one strategy, in which case our model consists of a variant of the contact process with a density-dependent birth rate. The players are located on the $d$-dimensional integer lattice, with natural birth rate $\lambda$ and natural death rate one. The process also depends on a payoff $a_{11} = a$ modeling the effects of the players on each other: while players always die at rate one, the rate at which they give birth is given by $\lambda$ times the exponential of $a$ times the fraction of occupied sites in their neighborhood. In particular, the birth rate increases with the local density when $a &gt; 0$, in which case the payoff $a$ models mutual cooperation, whereas the birth rate decreases with the local density when $a &lt; 0$, in which case the payoff $a$ models intraspecific competition. Using standard coupling arguments to compare the process with the basic contact process (the particular case $a = 0$), we prove that, for all payoffs $a$, there is a phase transition from extinction to survival in the direction of $\lambda$. Using various block constructions, we also prove that, for all birth rates $\lambda$, there is a phase transition in the direction of $a$. This last result is in sharp contrast with the behavior of the nonspatial deterministic mean-field model in which the stability of the extinction state only depends on $\lambda$. This underlines the importance of space (local interactions) and stochasticity in our model.</description>

      <title>Bounding adapted Wasserstein metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{W}_p$ is an important instance of an optimal transport cost. Its numerous mathematical properties as well as applications to various fields such as mathematical finance and statistics have been well studied in recent years. The adapted Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p$ extends this theory to laws of discrete time stochastic processes in their natural filtrations, making it particularly well suited for analyzing time-dependent stochastic optimization problems.
  While the topological differences between $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p$ and $\mathcal{W}_p$ are well understood, their differences as metrics remain largely unexplored beyond the trivial bound $\mathcal{W}_p\lesssim \mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p$. This paper closes this gap by providing upper bounds of $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_p$ in terms of $\mathcal{W}_p$ through investigation of the smooth adapted Wasserstein distance. Our upper bounds are explicit and are given by a sum of $\mathcal{W}_p$, Eder's modulus of continuity and a term characterizing the tail behavior of measures. As a consequence, upper bounds on $\mathcal{W}_p$ automatically hold for $\mathcal{AW}_p$ under mild regularity assumptions on the measures considered. A particular instance of our findings is the inequality $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{W}_1\le C\sqrt{\mathcal{W}_1}$ on the set of measures that have Lipschitz kernels.
  Our work also reveals how smoothing of measures affects the adapted weak topology. In fact, we find that the topology induced by the smooth adapted Wasserstein distance exhibits a non-trivial interpolation property, which we characterize explicitly: it lies in between the adapted weak topology and the weak topology, and the inclusion is governed by the decay of the smoothing parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stochastic differential equations on $\mathbb R^d$ with coefficients depending on the path and distribution for the whole history. Under a local integrability condition on the time-spatial singular drift, the well-posedness and Lipschitz continuity in initial values are proved, which is new even in the distribution independent case. Moreover, under a monotone condition, the asymptotic log-Harnack inequality is established, which extends the corresponding result of [5] derived in the distribution independent case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the harmonic descent chain and applications to critical beta-splitting trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the connection to a probabilistic model of phylogenetic trees introduced by Aldous, we study the recursive sequence governed by the rule $x_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{h_{n-1}(n-i)} x_i$ where $h_{n-1} = \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1/j$, known as the harmonic descent chain. While it is known that this sequence converges to an explicit limit $x$, not much is known about the rate of convergence. We first show that a class of recursive sequences including the above are decreasing and use this to bound the rate of convergence. Moreover, for the harmonic descent chain we prove the asymptotic $x_n - x = n^{-\gamma_* + o(1)}$ for an implicit exponent $\gamma_*$. As a consequence, we deduce central limit theorems for various statistics of the critical beta-splitting random tree. This answers a number of questions of Aldous, Janson, and Pittel.</description>

      <title>Random Flights and Anomalous Diffusion: A Non-Markovian Take on Lorentz Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Lorentz processes in two different settings. Both cases are characterized by infinite expectation of the free-flight times, contrary to what happens in the classical Gallavotti-Spohn models. Under a suitable Boltzmann-Grad type scaling limit, they converge to non-Markovian random-flight processes with superdiffusive behavior. A further scaling limit yields another non Markovian process, i.e., a superdiffusion obtained by a suitable time-change of Brownian motion. Furthermore, we obtain the governing equations for our random flights and anomalous diffusion, which represent a non-local counterpart for the linear-Boltzmann and diffusion equations arising in the classical theory. It turns out that these equations have the form of fractional kinetic equations in both time and space. To prove these results, we develop a technique based on mixtures of Feller semigroups.</description>

      <title>Crisanti-Sommers formula and simultaneous symmetry breaking in multi-species spherical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14791v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a rich history of expressing the limiting free energy of mean-field spin glasses as a variational formula over probability measures on $[0,1]$, where the measure represents the similarity (or "overlap") of two independently sampled spin configurations. At high temperatures, the formula's minimum is achieved at a measure which is a point mass, meaning sample configurations are asymptotically orthogonal up to a magnetic field correction. At low temperatures, though, a very different behavior emerges known as replica symmetry breaking (RSB). The deep wells in the energy landscape create more rigid structure, and the optimal overlap measure is no longer a point mass. The exact size of its support remains in many cases an open problem.
  Here we consider these themes for multi-species spherical spin glasses. Following a companion work in which we establish the Parisi variational formula, here we present this formula's Crisanti-Sommers representation. In the process, we gain new access to a problem unique to the multi-species setting. Namely, if RSB occurs for one species, does it necessarily occur for other species as well? We provide sufficient conditions for the answer to be yes. For instance, we show that if two species share any quadratic interaction, then RSB for one implies RSB for the other. Moreover, the level of symmetry breaking must be identical, even in cases of full RSB. In the presence of an external field, any type of interaction suffices.</description>

      <title>Effective Mass of the Fr\"ohlich Polaron and the Landau-Pekar-Spohn Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is a constant $\overline C\in (0,\infty)$ such that the effective mass $m(\alpha)$ of the Fr\"ohlich Polaron satisfies $m(\alpha) \geq \overline C \alpha^4$, which is sharp according to a long-standing prediction of Landau-Pekar [19] from 1948 and of Spohn [36] from 1987.
  The method of proof, which demonstrates how the sharp quartic divergence rate of $m(\alpha)$ appears in a natural way, is based on analyzing the Gaussian representation of the Polaron measure and that of the associated tilted Poisson point process developed in [26]. Additionally, our technique here leads to accompanying results including, 1) an explicit identification of local interval process from [26] in the strong coupling limit in terms of functionals of the Pekar process [27], 2) strict monotonicity of the effective mass $m(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha&gt;0$ and 3) the quartic divergence of $m(\alpha)$ for a generalized class of Polaron type interactions.</description>

      <title>Exact phylodynamic likelihood via structured Markov genealogy processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that each member of a broad class of Markovian population models induces a unique stochastic process on the space of genealogies. We construct this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of a filter equation, the structure of which is completely determined by the population model. We show that existing phylodynamic methods based on either the coalescent or the linear birth-death processes are special cases. We derive some properties of filter equations and describe a class of algorithms that can be used to numerically solve them. Our results open the door to statistically efficient likelihood-based phylodynamic inference for a much wider class of models than is currently possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are an important tool for generative modelling, serving as effective priors in applications such as imaging and protein design. A key challenge in applying diffusion models for downstream tasks is efficiently sampling from resulting posterior distributions, which can be addressed using the $h$-transform. This work introduces a self-supervised algorithm for fine-tuning diffusion models by estimating the $h$-transform, enabling amortised conditional sampling. Our method iteratively refines the $h$-transform using a synthetic dataset resampled with path-based importance weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on class-conditional sampling, inverse problems and reward fine-tuning for text-to-image diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Risk-sensitive Planning via Entropic Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Risk-sensitive planning aims to identify policies maximizing some tail-focused metrics in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Such an optimization task can be very costly for the most widely used and interpretable metrics such as threshold probabilities or (Conditional) Values at Risk. Indeed, previous work showed that only Entropic Risk Measures (EntRM) can be efficiently optimized through dynamic programming, leaving a hard-to-interpret parameter to choose. We show that the computation of the full set of optimal policies for EntRM across parameter values leads to tight approximations for the metrics of interest. We prove that this optimality front can be computed effectively thanks to a novel structural analysis and smoothness properties of entropic risks. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance in a variety of decision-making scenarios.</description>

      <title>Subleading-order theory for condensation transitions in large deviations of sums of independent and identically distributed random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the full distribution $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ of sums $A = \sum_{i=1}^N$ where $x_1, \dots, x_N$ are $N \gg 1$ independent and identically distributed random variables each sampled from a given distribution $p(x)$ with a subexponential $x \to \infty$ tail. We consider two particular cases: (I) the one-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-x^\alpha}$ where $0 &lt; x &lt; \infty$, (II) the two-sided stretched exponential distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-|x|^\alpha}$ where $-\infty &lt; x &lt; \infty$. We assume $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ (in both cases). As follows immediately from known theorems, for both cases (i) typical fluctuations of $\Delta A = A - \left\langle A\right\rangle $ are described by the central-limit theorem, (ii) the tail $A \to \infty$ is described by the big-jump principle $P_{N}\left(A\right) \simeq N p\left(A\right)$, and (iii) in between these two regimes there is a nontrivial intermediate regime which displays anomalous scaling $P_{N}\left(A\right) \sim e^{-N^\beta f(\Delta A/N^\gamma)}$ with anomalous exponents $\beta,\gamma \in (0,1)$ and large-deviation function $f(y)$ that are all exactly known. In practice, although these theoretical predictions of $P_{N}\left(A\right)$ work very well in regimes (i) and (ii), they often perform quite poorly in the intermediate regime (ii), with errors of several orders of magnitude for $N$ as large as $10^4$. We calculate subleading order corrections to the theoretical predictions in the intermediate regime. We find that for $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \alpha_c$, these corrections scale as power laws in $N$, while for $\alpha_c &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ they scale as stretched exponentials, where the threshold value is $\alpha_c = 1/2$ in case (I) and $\alpha_c = 2/3$ in case (II). This difference between the two cases is a result of the mirror symmetry $p(x) = p(-x)$ which holds only in the latter case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Zeta Tail(a) probability distribution as a new model for random damage-event counts in risk analysis. Although readily motivated as an analogue of the Geometric(p) distribution, Zeta Tail(a) has received little attention in the scholarly literature. In the present work, we begin by deriving various fundamental properties of this novel distribution. We then assess its usefulness as an alternative to Geometric(p), both theoretically and through application to a set of meteorological data. Lastly, we discuss conceptual differences between employing the Zeta Tail(a) model conditionally (i.e., given observed data with certain known characteristics) and unconditionally (i.e., for arbitrary, as yet unobserved data).</description>

      <title>Improved geometric and recollision estimates for the invariance principle of the random Lorentz gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By improving geometric recollision estimates for a random Lorentz gas, we extend the timescale $T(r)$ of the invariance principle for a Lorentz gas with particle size $r$ obtained by Lutsko and Toth (2020) from $\lim_{r \rightarrow 0} T(r) r^{2} |\log(r)|^2 =0$ to $\lim_{r \rightarrow 0} T(r) r^{2} |\log(r)| =0$. We show that this is the maximal reachable timescale with the coupling of stochastic processes introduced in the original result. In our improved geometric estimates we make use of the convexity of scatterers to obtain better dispersive estimates for the associated billiard map. We provide additional estimates which potentially open the possibility to reach, with a more elaborate coupling argument, up to timescales just below of $T(r)\sim r^{-2}$ when recollision patterns of arbitrary length occur.</description>

      <title>Random walks in a field of soft traps and criticality for the dissipative Abelian Sandpile Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the dissipative abelian sandpile model, we analyze the trajectories of a one-dimensional random walk in a landscape of soft traps. These traps, placed at increasing distances from each other, correspond to dissipative sites in the associated dissipative abelian sandpile model. We identify a critical growth rate of the sizes of intervals between successive traps where there is a transition between finiteness and non-finiteness of the expected survival time of the random walk. This corresponds to a transition between non-criticality and criticality of the associated dissipative abelian sandpile model. Therefore, in this setting, we thus identify precisely how much dissipation can be added to the original abelian sandpile model in order to disrupt its criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a priori bounds for solutions of singular stochastic porous media equations with multiplicative noise in their natural $L^1$-based regularity class. We consider the first singular regime, i.e.~noise of space-time regularity $\alpha-2$ for $\alpha\in(2/3,1)$, and prove modelledness of the solution in the sense of regularity structures with respect to the solution of the corresponding linear stochastic heat equation. The proof relies on the kinetic formulation of the equation and a novel renormalized energy inequality. A careful analysis allows to balance the degeneracy of the diffusion coefficient against sufficiently strong damping of the multiplicative noise for small values of the solution.</description>
