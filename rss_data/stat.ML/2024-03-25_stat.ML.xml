      <title>Conformal online model aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction equips machine learning models with a reasonable notion of uncertainty quantification without making strong distributional assumptions. It wraps around any black-box prediction model and converts point predictions into set predictions that have a predefined marginal coverage guarantee. However, conformal prediction only works if we fix the underlying machine learning model in advance. A relatively unaddressed issue in conformal prediction is that of model selection and/or aggregation: for a given problem, which of the plethora of prediction methods (random forests, neural nets, regularized linear models, etc.) should we conformalize? This paper proposes a new approach towards conformal model aggregation in online settings that is based on combining the prediction sets from several algorithms by voting, where weights on the models are adapted over time based on past performance.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal differentially private low-rank trace regression with guaranteed private initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study differentially private (DP) estimation of a rank-$r$ matrix $M \in \RR^{d_1\times d_2}$ under the trace regression model with Gaussian measurement matrices. Theoretically, the sensitivity of non-private spectral initialization is precisely characterized, and the differential-privacy-constrained minimax lower bound for estimating $M$ under the Schatten-$q$ norm is established. Methodologically, the paper introduces a computationally efficient algorithm for DP-initialization with a sample size of $n \geq \wt O (r^2 (d_1\vee d_2))$. Under certain regularity conditions, the DP-initialization falls within a local ball surrounding $M$. We also propose a differentially private algorithm for estimating $M$ based on Riemannian optimization (DP-RGrad), which achieves a near-optimal convergence rate with the DP-initialization and sample size of $n \geq \wt O(r (d_1 + d_2))$. Finally, the paper discusses the non-trivial gap between the minimax lower bound and the upper bound of low-rank matrix estimation under the trace regression model. It is shown that the estimator given by DP-RGrad attains the optimal convergence rate in a weaker notion of differential privacy. Our powerful technique for analyzing the sensitivity of initialization requires no eigengap condition between $r$ non-zero singular values.</description>

      <title>Learning Directed Acyclic Graphs from Partial Orderings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are commonly used to model causal relationships among random variables. In general, learning the DAG structure is both computationally and statistically challenging. Moreover, without additional information, the direction of edges may not be estimable from observational data. In contrast, given a complete causal ordering of the variables, the problem can be solved efficiently, even in high dimensions. In this paper, we consider the intermediate problem of learning DAGs when a partial causal ordering of variables is available. We propose a general estimation framework for leveraging the partial ordering and present efficient estimation algorithms for low- and high-dimensional problems. The advantages of the proposed framework are illustrated via numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Manifold Regularization Classification Model Based On Improved Diffusion Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manifold regularization model is a semi-supervised learning model that leverages the geometric structure of a dataset, comprising a small number of labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples, to generate classifiers. However, the original manifold norm limits the performance of models to local regions. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an approach to improve manifold regularization based on a label propagation model. We initially enhance the probability transition matrix of the diffusion map algorithm, which can be used to estimate the Neumann heat kernel, enabling it to accurately depict the label propagation process on the manifold. Using this matrix, we establish a label propagation function on the dataset to describe the distribution of labels at different time steps. Subsequently, we extend the label propagation function to the entire data manifold. We prove that the extended label propagation function converges to a stable distribution after a sufficiently long time and can be considered as a classifier. Building upon this concept, we propose a viable improvement to the manifold regularization model and validate its superiority through experiments.</description>

      <title>Predictive Inference in Multi-environment Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of constructing valid confidence intervals and sets in problems of prediction across multiple environments. We investigate two types of coverage suitable for these problems, extending the jackknife and split-conformal methods to show how to obtain distribution-free coverage in such non-traditional, hierarchical data-generating scenarios. Our contributions also include extensions for settings with non-real-valued responses and a theory of consistency for predictive inference in these general problems. We demonstrate a novel resizing method to adapt to problem difficulty, which applies both to existing approaches for predictive inference with hierarchical data and the methods we develop; this reduces prediction set sizes using limited information from the test environment, a key to the methods' practical performance, which we evaluate through neurochemical sensing and species classification datasets.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery from Poisson Branching Structural Causal Model Using High-Order Cumulant with Path Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Count data naturally arise in many fields, such as finance, neuroscience, and epidemiology, and discovering causal structure among count data is a crucial task in various scientific and industrial scenarios. One of the most common characteristics of count data is the inherent branching structure described by a binomial thinning operator and an independent Poisson distribution that captures both branching and noise. For instance, in a population count scenario, mortality and immigration contribute to the count, where survival follows a Bernoulli distribution, and immigration follows a Poisson distribution. However, causal discovery from such data is challenging due to the non-identifiability issue: a single causal pair is Markov equivalent, i.e., $X\rightarrow Y$ and $Y\rightarrow X$ are distributed equivalent. Fortunately, in this work, we found that the causal order from $X$ to its child $Y$ is identifiable if $X$ is a root vertex and has at least two directed paths to $Y$, or the ancestor of $X$ with the most directed path to $X$ has a directed path to $Y$ without passing $X$. Specifically, we propose a Poisson Branching Structure Causal Model (PB-SCM) and perform a path analysis on PB-SCM using high-order cumulants. Theoretical results establish the connection between the path and cumulant and demonstrate that the path information can be obtained from the cumulant. With the path information, causal order is identifiable under some graphical conditions. A practical algorithm for learning causal structure under PB-SCM is proposed and the experiments demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A note on generalization bounds for losses with finite moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the truncation method from Alquier [1] to derive high-probability PAC-Bayes bounds for unbounded losses with heavy tails. Assuming that the $p$-th moment is bounded, the resulting bounds interpolate between a slow rate $1 / \sqrt{n}$ when $p=2$, and a fast rate $1 / n$ when $p \to \infty$ and the loss is essentially bounded. Moreover, the paper derives a high-probability PAC-Bayes bound for losses with a bounded variance. This bound has an exponentially better dependence on the confidence parameter and the dependency measure than previous bounds in the literature. Finally, the paper extends all results to guarantees in expectation and single-draw PAC-Bayes. In order to so, it obtains analogues of the PAC-Bayes fast rate bound for bounded losses from [2] in these settings.</description>

      <title>Approximation and Estimation Ability of Transformers for Sequence-to-Sequence Functions with Infinite Dimensional Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the great success of Transformer networks in various applications such as natural language processing and computer vision, their theoretical aspects are not well understood. In this paper, we study the approximation and estimation ability of Transformers as sequence-to-sequence functions with infinite dimensional inputs. Although inputs and outputs are both infinite dimensional, we show that when the target function has anisotropic smoothness, Transformers can avoid the curse of dimensionality due to their feature extraction ability and parameter sharing property. In addition, we show that even if the smoothness changes depending on each input, Transformers can estimate the importance of features for each input and extract important features dynamically. Then, we proved that Transformers achieve similar convergence rate as in the case of the fixed smoothness. Our theoretical results support the practical success of Transformers for high dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Mean-field Analysis on Two-layer Neural Networks from a Kernel Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the feature learning ability of two-layer neural networks in the mean-field regime through the lens of kernel methods. To focus on the dynamics of the kernel induced by the first layer, we utilize a two-timescale limit, where the second layer moves much faster than the first layer. In this limit, the learning problem is reduced to the minimization problem over the intrinsic kernel. Then, we show the global convergence of the mean-field Langevin dynamics and derive time and particle discretization error. We also demonstrate that two-layer neural networks can learn a union of multiple reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces more efficiently than any kernel methods, and neural networks acquire data-dependent kernel which aligns with the target function. In addition, we develop a label noise procedure, which converges to the global optimum and show that the degrees of freedom appears as an implicit regularization.</description>

      <title>Role of Locality and Weight Sharing in Image-Based Tasks: A Sample Complexity Separation between CNNs, LCNs, and FCNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision tasks are characterized by the properties of locality and translation invariance. The superior performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on these tasks is widely attributed to the inductive bias of locality and weight sharing baked into their architecture. Existing attempts to quantify the statistical benefits of these biases in CNNs over locally connected convolutional neural networks (LCNs) and fully connected neural networks (FCNs) fall into one of the following categories: either they disregard the optimizer and only provide uniform convergence upper bounds with no separating lower bounds, or they consider simplistic tasks that do not truly mirror the locality and translation invariance as found in real-world vision tasks. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Dynamic Signal Distribution (DSD) classification task that models an image as consisting of $k$ patches, each of dimension $d$, and the label is determined by a $d$-sparse signal vector that can freely appear in any one of the $k$ patches. On this task, for any orthogonally equivariant algorithm like gradient descent, we prove that CNNs require $\tilde{O}(k+d)$ samples, whereas LCNs require $\Omega(kd)$ samples, establishing the statistical advantages of weight sharing in translation invariant tasks. Furthermore, LCNs need $\tilde{O}(k(k+d))$ samples, compared to $\Omega(k^2d)$ samples for FCNs, showcasing the benefits of locality in local tasks. Additionally, we develop information theoretic tools for analyzing randomized algorithms, which may be of interest for statistical research.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Latent Neural Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal representation learning seeks to uncover latent, high-level causal representations from low-level observed data. It is particularly good at predictions under unseen distribution shifts, because these shifts can generally be interpreted as consequences of interventions. Hence leveraging {seen} distribution shifts becomes a natural strategy to help identifying causal representations, which in turn benefits predictions where distributions are previously {unseen}. Determining the types (or conditions) of such distribution shifts that do contribute to the identifiability of causal representations is critical. This work establishes a {sufficient} and {necessary} condition characterizing the types of distribution shifts for identifiability in the context of latent additive noise models. Furthermore, we present partial identifiability results when only a portion of distribution shifts meets the condition. In addition, we extend our findings to latent post-nonlinear causal models. We translate our findings into a practical algorithm, allowing for the acquisition of reliable latent causal representations. Our algorithm, guided by our underlying theory, has demonstrated outstanding performance across a diverse range of synthetic and real-world datasets. The empirical observations align closely with the theoretical findings, affirming the robustness and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Supervised Learning via Ensembles of Diverse Functional Representations: the Functional Voting Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many conventional statistical and machine learning methods face challenges when applied directly to high dimensional temporal observations. In recent decades, Functional Data Analysis (FDA) has gained widespread popularity as a framework for modeling and analyzing data that are, by their nature, functions in the domain of time. Although supervised classification has been extensively explored in recent decades within the FDA literature, ensemble learning of functional classifiers has only recently emerged as a topic of significant interest. Thus, the latter subject presents unexplored facets and challenges from various statistical perspectives. The focal point of this paper lies in the realm of ensemble learning for functional data and aims to show how different functional data representations can be used to train ensemble members and how base model predictions can be combined through majority voting. The so-called Functional Voting Classifier (FVC) is proposed to demonstrate how different functional representations leading to augmented diversity can increase predictive accuracy. Many real-world datasets from several domains are used to display that the FVC can significantly enhance performance compared to individual models. The framework presented provides a foundation for voting ensembles with functional data and can stimulate a highly encouraging line of research in the FDA context.</description>

      <title>Boarding for ISS: Imbalanced Self-Supervised: Discovery of a Scaled Autoencoder for Mixed Tabular Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of imbalanced self-supervised learning, especially in the context of tabular data, has not been extensively studied. Existing research has predominantly focused on image datasets. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining the specific challenges posed by data imbalance in self-supervised learning in the domain of tabular data, with a primary focus on autoencoders. Autoencoders are widely employed for learning and constructing a new representation of a dataset, particularly for dimensionality reduction. They are also often used for generative model learning, as seen in variational autoencoders. When dealing with mixed tabular data, qualitative variables are often encoded using a one-hot encoder with a standard loss function (MSE or Cross Entropy). In this paper, we analyze the drawbacks of this approach, especially when categorical variables are imbalanced. We propose a novel metric to balance learning: a Multi-Supervised Balanced MSE. This approach reduces the reconstruction error by balancing the influence of variables. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that this new metric, compared to the standard MSE: i) outperforms when the dataset is imbalanced, especially when the learning process is insufficient, and ii) provides similar results in the opposite case.</description>

      <title>Computational Sentence-level Metrics Predicting Human Sentence Comprehension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of research in computational psycholinguistics has concentrated on the processing of words. This study introduces innovative methods for computing sentence-level metrics using multilingual large language models. The metrics developed sentence surprisal and sentence relevance and then are tested and compared to validate whether they can predict how humans comprehend sentences as a whole across languages. These metrics offer significant interpretability and achieve high accuracy in predicting human sentence reading speeds. Our results indicate that these computational sentence-level metrics are exceptionally effective at predicting and elucidating the processing difficulties encountered by readers in comprehending sentences as a whole across a variety of languages. Their impressive performance and generalization capabilities provide a promising avenue for future research in integrating LLMs and cognitive science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability selection is a widely used method for improving the performance of feature selection algorithms. However, stability selection has been found to be highly conservative, resulting in low sensitivity. Further, the theoretical bound on the expected number of false positives, E(FP), is relatively loose, making it difficult to know how many false positives to expect in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for stability selection based on integrating the stability paths rather than maximizing over them. This yields a tighter bound on E(FP), resulting in a feature selection criterion that has higher sensitivity in practice and is better calibrated in terms of matching the target E(FP). Our proposed method requires the same amount of computation as the original stability selection algorithm, and only requires the user to specify one input parameter, a target value for E(FP). We provide theoretical bounds on performance, and demonstrate the method on simulations and real data from cancer gene expression studies.</description>

      <title>Fast and Unified Path Gradient Estimators for Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work shows that path gradient estimators for normalizing flows have lower variance compared to standard estimators for variational inference, resulting in improved training. However, they are often prohibitively more expensive from a computational point of view and cannot be applied to maximum likelihood training in a scalable manner, which severely hinders their widespread adoption. In this work, we overcome these crucial limitations. Specifically, we propose a fast path gradient estimator which improves computational efficiency significantly and works for all normalizing flow architectures of practical relevance. We then show that this estimator can also be applied to maximum likelihood training for which it has a regularizing effect as it can take the form of a given target energy function into account. We empirically establish its superior performance and reduced variance for several natural sciences applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Gaussian Covariance Network with Trajectory Sampling for Data-Efficient Policy Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic world models increase data efficiency of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) by guiding the policy with their epistemic uncertainty to improve exploration and acquire new samples. Moreover, the uncertainty-aware learning procedures in probabilistic approaches lead to robust policies that are less sensitive to noisy observations compared to uncertainty unaware solutions. We propose to combine trajectory sampling and deep Gaussian covariance network (DGCN) for a data-efficient solution to MBRL problems in an optimal control setting. We compare trajectory sampling with density-based approximation for uncertainty propagation using three different probabilistic world models; Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, and DGCNs. We provide empirical evidence using four different well-known test environments, that our method improves the sample-efficiency over other combinations of uncertainty propagation methods and probabilistic models. During our tests, we place particular emphasis on the robustness of the learned policies with respect to noisy initial states.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Solution to Covariance Propagation in Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of neural networks is critical to measuring the reliability and robustness of deep learning systems. However, this often involves costly or inaccurate sampling methods and approximations. This paper presents a sample-free moment propagation technique that propagates mean vectors and covariance matrices across a network to accurately characterize the input-output distributions of neural networks. A key enabler of our technique is an analytic solution for the covariance of random variables passed through nonlinear activation functions, such as Heaviside, ReLU, and GELU. The wide applicability and merits of the proposed technique are shown in experiments analyzing the input-output distributions of trained neural networks and training Bayesian neural networks.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection via Deep Multi-Comprehension Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research underscores the pivotal role of the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) feature representation field scale in determining the efficacy of models in OOD detection. Consequently, the adoption of model ensembles has emerged as a prominent strategy to augment this feature representation field, capitalizing on anticipated model diversity.
  However, our introduction of novel qualitative and quantitative model ensemble evaluation methods, specifically Loss Basin/Barrier Visualization and the Self-Coupling Index, reveals a critical drawback in existing ensemble methods. We find that these methods incorporate weights that are affine-transformable, exhibiting limited variability and thus failing to achieve the desired diversity in feature representation.
  To address this limitation, we elevate the dimensions of traditional model ensembles, incorporating various factors such as different weight initializations, data holdout, etc., into distinct supervision tasks. This innovative approach, termed Multi-Comprehension (MC) Ensemble, leverages diverse training tasks to generate distinct comprehensions of the data and labels, thereby extending the feature representation field.
  Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the MC Ensemble strategy in OOD detection compared to both the naive Deep Ensemble method and a standalone model of comparable size. This underscores the effectiveness of our proposed approach in enhancing the model's capability to detect instances outside its training distribution.</description>

      <title>Learning Action-based Representations Using Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning agents using high-dimensional observations must be able to identify relevant state features amidst many exogeneous distractors. A representation that captures controllability identifies these state elements by determining what affects agent control. While methods such as inverse dynamics and mutual information capture controllability for a limited number of timesteps, capturing long-horizon elements remains a challenging problem. Myopic controllability can capture the moment right before an agent crashes into a wall, but not the control-relevance of the wall while the agent is still some distance away. To address this we introduce action-bisimulation encoding, a method inspired by the bisimulation invariance pseudometric, that extends single-step controllability with a recursive invariance constraint. By doing this, action-bisimulation learns a multi-step controllability metric that smoothly discounts distant state features that are relevant for control. We demonstrate that action-bisimulation pretraining on reward-free, uniformly random data improves sample efficiency in several environments, including a photorealistic 3D simulation domain, Habitat. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis and qualitative results demonstrating the information captured by action-bisimulation.</description>

      <title>Real-time Adaptation for Condition Monitoring Signal Prediction using Label-aware Neural Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a predictive model that rapidly adapts to real-time condition monitoring (CM) signals is critical for engineering systems/units. Unfortunately, many current methods suffer from a trade-off between representation power and agility in online settings. For instance, parametric methods that assume an underlying functional form for CM signals facilitate efficient online prediction updates. However, this simplification leads to vulnerability to model specifications and an inability to capture complex signals. On the other hand, approaches based on over-parameterized or non-parametric models can excel at explaining complex nonlinear signals, but real-time updates for such models pose a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a neural process-based approach that addresses this trade-off. It encodes available observations within a CM signal into a representation space and then reconstructs the signal's history and evolution for prediction. Once trained, the model can encode an arbitrary number of observations without requiring retraining, enabling on-the-spot real-time predictions along with quantified uncertainty and can be readily updated as more online data is gathered. Furthermore, our model is designed to incorporate qualitative information (i.e., labels) from individual units. This integration not only enhances individualized predictions for each unit but also enables joint inference for both signals and their associated labels. Numerical studies on both synthetic and real-world data in reliability engineering highlight the advantageous features of our model in real-time adaptation, enhanced signal prediction with uncertainty quantification, and joint prediction for labels and signals.</description>

      <title>On the rates of convergence for learning with convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the approximation and learning capacities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our first result proves a new approximation bound for CNNs with certain constraint on the weights. Our second result gives a new analysis on the covering number of feed-forward neural networks, which include CNNs as special cases. The analysis carefully takes into account the size of the weights and hence gives better bounds than existing literature in some situations. Using these two results, we are able to derive rates of convergence for estimators based on CNNs in many learning problems. In particular, we establish minimax optimal convergence rates of the least squares based on CNNs for learning smooth functions in the nonparametric regression setting. For binary classification, we derive convergence rates for CNN classifiers with hinge loss and logistic loss. It is also shown that the obtained rates are minimax optimal in several settings.</description>

      <title>Optimal convex $M$-estimation via score matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of linear regression, we construct a data-driven convex loss function with respect to which empirical risk minimisation yields optimal asymptotic variance in the downstream estimation of the regression coefficients. Our semiparametric approach targets the best decreasing approximation of the derivative of the log-density of the noise distribution. At the population level, this fitting process is a nonparametric extension of score matching, corresponding to a log-concave projection of the noise distribution with respect to the Fisher divergence. The procedure is computationally efficient, and we prove that our procedure attains the minimal asymptotic covariance among all convex $M$-estimators. As an example of a non-log-concave setting, for Cauchy errors, the optimal convex loss function is Huber-like, and our procedure yields an asymptotic efficiency greater than 0.87 relative to the oracle maximum likelihood estimator of the regression coefficients that uses knowledge of this error distribution; in this sense, we obtain robustness without sacrificing much efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the practical merits of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Weak Convergence Analysis of Online Neural Actor-Critic Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a single-layer neural network trained with the online actor critic algorithm converges in distribution to a random ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number of hidden units and the number of training steps $\rightarrow \infty$. In the online actor-critic algorithm, the distribution of the data samples dynamically changes as the model is updated, which is a key challenge for any convergence analysis. We establish the geometric ergodicity of the data samples under a fixed actor policy. Then, using a Poisson equation, we prove that the fluctuations of the model updates around the limit distribution due to the randomly-arriving data samples vanish as the number of parameter updates $\rightarrow \infty$. Using the Poisson equation and weak convergence techniques, we prove that the actor neural network and critic neural network converge to the solutions of a system of ODEs with random initial conditions. Analysis of the limit ODE shows that the limit critic network will converge to the true value function, which will provide the actor an asymptotically unbiased estimate of the policy gradient. We then prove that the limit actor network will converge to a stationary point.</description>

      <title>Conformal Off-Policy Prediction for Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-Policy Prediction (OPP), i.e., predicting the outcomes of a target policy using only data collected under a nominal (behavioural) policy, is a paramount problem in data-driven analysis of safety-critical systems where the deployment of a new policy may be unsafe. To achieve dependable off-policy predictions, recent work on Conformal Off-Policy Prediction (COPP) leverage the conformal prediction framework to derive prediction regions with probabilistic guarantees under the target process. Existing COPP methods can account for the distribution shifts induced by policy switching, but are limited to single-agent systems and scalar outcomes (e.g., rewards). In this work, we introduce MA-COPP, the first conformal prediction method to solve OPP problems involving multi-agent systems, deriving joint prediction regions for all agents' trajectories when one or more "ego" agents change their policies. Unlike the single-agent scenario, this setting introduces higher complexity as the distribution shifts affect predictions for all agents, not just the ego agents, and the prediction task involves full multi-dimensional trajectories, not just reward values. A key contribution of MA-COPP is to avoid enumeration or exhaustive search of the output space of agent trajectories, which is instead required by existing COPP methods to construct the prediction region. We achieve this by showing that an over-approximation of the true JPR can be constructed, without enumeration, from the maximum density ratio of the JPR trajectories. We evaluate the effectiveness of MA-COPP in multi-agent systems from the PettingZoo library and the F1TENTH autonomous racing environment, achieving nominal coverage in higher dimensions and various shift settings.</description>

      <title>Discrete Latent Graph Generative Modeling with Diffusion Bridges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning graph generative models over latent spaces has received less attention compared to models that operate on the original data space and has so far demonstrated lacklustre performance. We present GLAD a latent space graph generative model. Unlike most previous latent space graph generative models, GLAD operates on a discrete latent space that preserves to a significant extent the discrete nature of the graph structures making no unnatural assumptions such as latent space continuity. We learn the prior of our discrete latent space by adapting diffusion bridges to its structure. By operating over an appropriately constructed latent space we avoid relying on decompositions that are often used in models that operate in the original data space. We present experiments on a series of graph benchmark datasets which clearly show the superiority of the discrete latent space and obtain state of the art graph generative performance, making GLAD the first latent space graph generative model with competitive performance.

      <title>SCOD: From Heuristics to Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of designing reliable prediction models that abstain from predictions when faced with uncertain or out-of-distribution samples - a recently proposed problem known as Selective Classification in the presence of Out-of-Distribution data (SCOD). We make three key contributions to SCOD. Firstly, we demonstrate that the optimal SCOD strategy involves a Bayes classifier for in-distribution (ID) data and a selector represented as a stochastic linear classifier in a 2D space, using i) the conditional risk of the ID classifier, and ii) the likelihood ratio of ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) data as input. This contrasts with suboptimal strategies from current OOD detection methods and the Softmax Information Retaining Combination (SIRC), specifically developed for SCOD. Secondly, we establish that in a distribution-free setting, the SCOD problem is not Probably Approximately Correct learnable when relying solely on an ID data sample. Third, we introduce POSCOD, a simple method for learning a plugin estimate of the optimal SCOD strategy from both an ID data sample and an unlabeled mixture of ID and OOD data. Our empirical results confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our proposed method, POSCOD, out performs existing OOD methods in effectively addressing the SCOD problem.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Simple Binary Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sample complexity of simple binary hypothesis testing is the smallest number of i.i.d. samples required to distinguish between two distributions $p$ and $q$ in either: (i) the prior-free setting, with type-I error at most $\alpha$ and type-II error at most $\beta$; or (ii) the Bayesian setting, with Bayes error at most $\delta$ and prior distribution $(\alpha, 1-\alpha)$. This problem has only been studied when $\alpha = \beta$ (prior-free) or $\alpha = 1/2$ (Bayesian), and the sample complexity is known to be characterized by the Hellinger divergence between $p$ and $q$, up to multiplicative constants. In this paper, we derive a formula that characterizes the sample complexity (up to multiplicative constants that are independent of $p$, $q$, and all error parameters) for: (i) all $0 \le \alpha, \beta \le 1/8$ in the prior-free setting; and (ii) all $\delta \le \alpha/4$ in the Bayesian setting. In particular, the formula admits equivalent expressions in terms of certain divergences from the Jensen--Shannon and Hellinger families. The main technical result concerns an $f$-divergence inequality between members of the Jensen--Shannon and Hellinger families, which is proved by a combination of information-theoretic tools and case-by-case analyses. We explore applications of our results to robust and distributed (locally-private and communication-constrained) hypothesis testing.</description>

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated success in controlling sentence attributes ($e.g.$, sentiment) and structure ($e.g.$, syntactic structure) based on the diffusion language model. A key component that drives theimpressive performance for generating high-quality samples from noise is iteratively denoise for thousands of steps. While beneficial, the complexity of starting from the noise and the learning steps has limited its implementation to many NLP real-world applications. This paper proposes Language Rectified Flow ({\ours}). Our method is based on the reformulation of the standard probabilistic flow models. Language rectified flow learns (neural) ordinary differential equation models to transport between the source distribution and the target distribution, hence providing a unified and effective solution to generative modeling and domain transfer. From the source distribution, our language rectified flow yields fast simulation and effectively decreases the inference time. Experiments on three challenging fine-grained control tasks and multiple high-quality text editing show that our method consistently outperforms its baselines. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method can be general, effective, and beneficial for many NLP tasks.</description>

Abstract: Sequential learning problems are common in several fields of research and practical applications. Examples include dynamic pricing and assortment, design of auctions and incentives and permeate a large number of sequential treatment experiments. In this paper, we extend one of the most popular learning solutions, the $\epsilon_t$-greedy heuristics, to high-dimensional contexts considering a conservative directive. We do this by allocating part of the time the original rule uses to adopt completely new actions to a more focused search in a restrictive set of promising actions. The resulting rule might be useful for practical applications that still values surprises, although at a decreasing rate, while also has restrictions on the adoption of unusual actions. With high probability, we find reasonable bounds for the cumulative regret of a conservative high-dimensional decaying $\epsilon_t$-greedy rule. Also, we provide a lower bound for the cardinality of the set of viable actions that implies in an improved regret bound for the conservative version when compared to its non-conservative counterpart. Additionally, we show that end-users have sufficient flexibility when establishing how much safety they want, since it can be tuned without impacting theoretical properties. We illustrate our proposal both in a simulation exercise and using a real dataset.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the behavior of stochastic approximation algorithms where iterates, in expectation, progress towards an objective at each step. When progress is proportional to the step size of the algorithm, we prove exponential concentration bounds. These tail-bounds contrast asymptotic normality results, which are more frequently associated with stochastic approximation. The methods that we develop rely on a geometric ergodicity proof. This extends a result on Markov chains due to Hajek (1982) to the area of stochastic approximation algorithms. We apply our results to several different Stochastic Approximation algorithms, specifically Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent, Kiefer-Wolfowitz and Stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithms. When applicable, our results prove faster $O(1/t)$ and linear convergence rates for Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent with a non-vanishing gradient.</description>

Abstract: Understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants is essential for machine learning. However, most of the preceding analyses are conducted under amenable conditions such as unbiased gradient estimator and bounded objective functions, which does not encompass many sophisticated applications, such as variational Monte Carlo, entropy-regularized reinforcement learning and variational inference. In this paper, we consider the SGD algorithm that employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimator to compute the gradient, called MCMC-SGD. Since MCMC reduces the sampling complexity significantly, it is an asymptotically convergent biased estimator in practice. Moreover, by incorporating a general class of unbounded functions, it is much more difficult to analyze the MCMC sampling error. Therefore, we assume that the function is sub-exponential and use the Bernstein inequality for non-stationary Markov chains to derive error bounds of the MCMC estimator. Consequently, MCMC-SGD is proven to have a first order convergence rate $O(\log K/\sqrt{n K})$ with $K$ iterations and a sample size $n$. It partially explains how MCMC influences the behavior of SGD. Furthermore, we verify the correlated negative curvature condition under reasonable assumptions. It is shown that MCMC-SGD escapes from saddle points and reaches $(\epsilon,\epsilon^{1/4})$ approximate second order stationary points or $\epsilon^{1/2}$-variance points at least $O(\epsilon^{-11/2}\log^{2}(1/\epsilon) )$ steps with high probability. Our analysis unveils the convergence pattern of MCMC-SGD across a broad class of stochastic optimization problems, and interprets the convergence phenomena observed in practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Sparse joint shift (SJS) was recently proposed as a tractable model for general dataset shift which may cause changes to the marginal distributions of features and labels as well as the posterior probabilities and the class-conditional feature distributions. Fitting SJS for a target dataset without label observations may produce valid predictions of labels and estimates of class prior probabilities. We present new results on the transmission of SJS from sets of features to larger sets of features, a conditional correction formula for the class posterior probabilities under the target distribution, identifiability of SJS, and the relationship between SJS and covariate shift. In addition, we point out inconsistencies in the algorithms which were proposed for estimating the characteristics of SJS, as they could hamper the search for optimal solutions, and suggest potential improvements.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering in the Gaussian mixture block model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian mixture block models are distributions over graphs that strive to model modern networks: to generate a graph from such a model, we associate each vertex $i$ with a latent feature vector $u_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ sampled from a mixture of Gaussians, and we add edge $(i,j)$ if and only if the feature vectors are sufficiently similar, in that $\langle u_i,u_j \rangle \ge \tau$ for a pre-specified threshold $\tau$. The different components of the Gaussian mixture represent the fact that there may be different types of nodes with different distributions over features -- for example, in a social network each component represents the different attributes of a distinct community. Natural algorithmic tasks associated with these networks are embedding (recovering the latent feature vectors) and clustering (grouping nodes by their mixture component).
  In this paper we initiate the study of clustering and embedding graphs sampled from high-dimensional Gaussian mixture block models, where the dimension of the latent feature vectors $d\to \infty$ as the size of the network $n \to \infty$. This high-dimensional setting is most appropriate in the context of modern networks, in which we think of the latent feature space as being high-dimensional. We analyze the performance of canonical spectral clustering and embedding algorithms for such graphs in the case of 2-component spherical Gaussian mixtures, and begin to sketch out the information-computation landscape for clustering and embedding in these models.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Conditional Independence Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional independence (CI) tests are widely used in statistical data analysis, e.g., they are the building block of many algorithms for causal graph discovery. The goal of a CI test is to accept or reject the null hypothesis that $X \perp \!\!\! \perp Y \mid Z$, where $X \in \mathbb{R}, Y \in \mathbb{R}, Z \in \mathbb{R}^d$. In this work, we investigate conditional independence testing under the constraint of differential privacy. We design two private CI testing procedures: one based on the generalized covariance measure of Shah and Peters (2020) and another based on the conditional randomization test of Cand\`es et al. (2016) (under the model-X assumption). We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of our tests and validate them empirically. These are the first private CI tests with rigorous theoretical guarantees that work for the general case when $Z$ is continuous.</description>

      <title>Samplet basis pursuit: Multiresolution scattered data approximation with sparsity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider scattered data approximation in samplet coordinates with $\ell_1$-regularization. The application of an $\ell_1$-regularization term enforces sparsity of the coefficients with respect to the samplet basis. Samplets are wavelet-type signed measures, which are tailored to scattered data. They provide similar properties as wavelets in terms of localization, multiresolution analysis, and data compression. By using the Riesz isometry, we embed samplets into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and discuss the properties of the resulting functions. We argue that the class of signals that are sparse with respect to the embedded samplet basis is considerably larger than the class of signals that are sparse with respect to the basis of kernel translates. Vice versa, every signal that is a linear combination of only a few kernel translates is sparse in samplet coordinates. Therefore, samplets enable the use of well-established multiresolution techniques on general scattered data sets.
  We propose the rapid solution of the problem under consideration by combining soft-shrinkage with the semi-smooth Newton method. Leveraging on the sparse representation of kernel matrices in samplet coordinates, this approach converges faster than the fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm and is feasible for large-scale data. Numerical benchmarks are presented and demonstrate the superiority of the multiresolution approach over the single-scale approach. As large-scale applications, the surface reconstruction from scattered data and the reconstruction of scattered temperature data using a dictionary of multiple kernels are considered.</description>

      <title>Learning Energy-Based Models by Cooperative Diffusion Recovery Likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training energy-based models (EBMs) on high-dimensional data can be both challenging and time-consuming, and there exists a noticeable gap in sample quality between EBMs and other generative frameworks like GANs and diffusion models. To close this gap, inspired by the recent efforts of learning EBMs by maximizing diffusion recovery likelihood (DRL), we propose cooperative diffusion recovery likelihood (CDRL), an effective approach to tractably learn and sample from a series of EBMs defined on increasingly noisy versions of a dataset, paired with an initializer model for each EBM. At each noise level, the two models are jointly estimated within a cooperative training framework: samples from the initializer serve as starting points that are refined by a few MCMC sampling steps from the EBM. The EBM is then optimized by maximizing recovery likelihood, while the initializer model is optimized by learning from the difference between the refined samples and the initial samples. In addition, we made several practical designs for EBM training to further improve the sample quality. Combining these advances, our approach significantly boost the generation performance compared to existing EBM methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our models for several downstream tasks, including classifier-free guided generation, compositional generation, image inpainting and out-of-distribution detection.</description>

      <title>Identifying Linearly-Mixed Causal Representations from Multi-Node Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of inferring high-level causal variables from low-level observations, commonly referred to as causal representation learning, is fundamentally underconstrained. As such, recent works to address this problem focus on various assumptions that lead to identifiability of the underlying latent causal variables. A large corpus of these preceding approaches consider multi-environment data collected under different interventions on the causal model. What is common to virtually all of these works is the restrictive assumption that in each environment, only a single variable is intervened on. In this work, we relax this assumption and provide the first identifiability result for causal representation learning that allows for multiple variables to be targeted by an intervention within one environment. Our approach hinges on a general assumption on the coverage and diversity of interventions across environments, which also includes the shared assumption of single-node interventions of previous works. The main idea behind our approach is to exploit the trace that interventions leave on the variance of the ground truth causal variables and regularizing for a specific notion of sparsity with respect to this trace. In addition to and inspired by our theoretical contributions, we present a practical algorithm to learn causal representations from multi-node interventional data and provide empirical evidence that validates our identifiability results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Hessian Fittings on Lie Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the fitting of Hessian or its inverse for stochastic optimizations using a Hessian fitting criterion from the preconditioned stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) method, which is intimately related to many commonly used second order and adaptive gradient optimizers, e.g., BFGS, Gaussian-Newton and natural gradient descent, AdaGrad, etc. Our analyses reveal the efficiency and reliability differences among a wide range of preconditioner fitting methods, from closed-form to iterative solutions, using Hessian-vector products or stochastic gradients only, with Hessian fittings in the Euclidean space, the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPL) matrices, or a variety of Lie groups. The most intriguing discovery is that the Hessian fitting itself as an optimization problem is strongly convex under mild conditions on a specific yet general enough Lie group. This discovery turns Hessian fitting into a well behaved optimization problem, and facilitates the designs of highly efficient and elegant Lie group sparse preconditioner fitting methods for large scale stochastic optimizations.</description>

      <title>CrossQ: Batch Normalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Greater Sample Efficiency and Simplicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:1902.05605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sample efficiency is a crucial problem in deep reinforcement learning. Recent algorithms, such as REDQ and DroQ, found a way to improve the sample efficiency by increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ratio to 20 gradient update steps on the critic per environment sample. However, this comes at the expense of a greatly increased computational cost. To reduce this computational burden, we introduce CrossQ: A lightweight algorithm for continuous control tasks that makes careful use of Batch Normalization and removes target networks to surpass the current state-of-the-art in sample efficiency while maintaining a low UTD ratio of 1. Notably, CrossQ does not rely on advanced bias-reduction schemes used in current methods. CrossQ's contributions are threefold: (1) it matches or surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample efficiency, (2) it substantially reduces the computational cost compared to REDQ and DroQ, (3) it is easy to implement, requiring just a few lines of code on top of SAC.</description>

      <title>Dual Accuracy-Quality-Driven Neural Network for Prediction Interval Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is necessary to enhance the reliability of deep learning models in real-world applications. In the case of regression tasks, prediction intervals (PIs) should be provided along with the deterministic predictions of deep learning models. Such PIs are useful or "high-quality" as long as they are sufficiently narrow and capture most of the probability density. In this paper, we present a method to learn prediction intervals for regression-based neural networks automatically in addition to the conventional target predictions. In particular, we train two companion neural networks: one that uses one output, the target estimate, and another that uses two outputs, the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding PI. Our main contribution is the design of a novel loss function for the PI-generation network that takes into account the output of the target-estimation network and has two optimization objectives: minimizing the mean prediction interval width and ensuring the PI integrity using constraints that maximize the prediction interval probability coverage implicitly. Furthermore, we introduce a self-adaptive coefficient that balances both objectives within the loss function, which alleviates the task of fine-tuning. Experiments using a synthetic dataset, eight benchmark datasets, and a real-world crop yield prediction dataset showed that our method was able to maintain a nominal probability coverage and produce significantly narrower PIs without detriment to its target estimation accuracy when compared to those PIs generated by three state-of-the-art neural-network-based methods. In other words, our method was shown to produce higher-quality PIs.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of MLE for Entity Ranking with Covariates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns with statistical estimation and inference for the ranking problems based on pairwise comparisons with additional covariate information such as the attributes of the compared items. Despite extensive studies, few prior literatures investigate this problem under the more realistic setting where covariate information exists. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel model, Covariate-Assisted Ranking Estimation (CARE) model, that extends the well-known Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, by incorporating the covariate information. Specifically, instead of assuming every compared item has a fixed latent score $\{\theta_i^*\}_{i=1}^n$, we assume the underlying scores are given by $\{\alpha_i^*+{x}_i^\top\beta^*\}_{i=1}^n$, where $\alpha_i^*$ and ${x}_i^\top\beta^*$ represent latent baseline and covariate score of the $i$-th item, respectively. We impose natural identifiability conditions and derive the $\ell_{\infty}$- and $\ell_2$-optimal rates for the maximum likelihood estimator of $\{\alpha_i^*\}_{i=1}^{n}$ and $\beta^*$ under a sparse comparison graph, using a novel `leave-one-out' technique (Chen et al., 2019) . To conduct statistical inferences, we further derive asymptotic distributions for the MLE of $\{\alpha_i^*\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\beta^*$ with minimal sample complexity. This allows us to answer the question whether some covariates have any explanation power for latent scores and to threshold some sparse parameters to improve the ranking performance. We improve the approximation method used in (Gao et al., 2021) for the BLT model and generalize it to the CARE model. Moreover, we validate our theoretical results through large-scale numerical studies and an application to the mutual fund stock holding dataset.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian methods, distributionally robust optimization methods, and regularization methods are three pillars of trustworthy machine learning combating distributional uncertainty, e.g., the uncertainty of an empirical distribution compared to the true underlying distribution. This paper investigates the connections among the three frameworks and, in particular, explores why these frameworks tend to have smaller generalization errors. Specifically, first, we suggest a quantitative definition for "distributional robustness", propose the concept of "robustness measure", and formalize several philosophical concepts in distributionally robust optimization. Second, we show that Bayesian methods are distributionally robust in the probably approximately correct (PAC) sense; in addition, by constructing a Dirichlet-process-like prior in Bayesian nonparametrics, it can be proven that any regularized empirical risk minimization method is equivalent to a Bayesian method. Third, we show that generalization errors of machine learning models can be characterized using the distributional uncertainty of the nominal distribution and the robustness measures of these machine learning models, which is a new perspective to bound generalization errors, and therefore, explain the reason why distributionally robust machine learning models, Bayesian models, and regularization models tend to have smaller generalization errors in a unified manner.</description>

      <title>The autoregressive neural network architecture of the Boltzmann distribution of pairwise interacting spins systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Autoregressive Neural Networks (ARNNs) have recently demonstrated exceptional results in image and language generation tasks, contributing to the growing popularity of generative models in both scientific and commercial applications. This work presents an exact mapping of the Boltzmann distribution of binary pairwise interacting systems into autoregressive form. The resulting ARNN architecture has weights and biases of its first layer corresponding to the Hamiltonian's couplings and external fields, featuring widely used structures such as the residual connections and a recurrent architecture with clear physical meanings. Moreover, its architecture's explicit formulation enables the use of statistical physics techniques to derive new ARNNs for specific systems. As examples, new effective ARNN architectures are derived from two well-known mean-field systems, the Curie-Weiss and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick models, showing superior performance in approximating the Boltzmann distributions of the corresponding physics model compared to other commonly used architectures. The connection established between the physics of the system and the neural network architecture provides a means to derive new architectures for different interacting systems and interpret existing ones from a physical perspective.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapped Training of Score-Conditioned Generator for Offline Design of Biological Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing biological sequences, e.g., proteins, DNA, and RNA, to maximize a black-box score function that is only evaluated in an offline dataset. We propose a novel solution, bootstrapped training of score-conditioned generator (BootGen) algorithm. Our algorithm repeats a two-stage process. In the first stage, our algorithm trains the biological sequence generator with rank-based weights to enhance the accuracy of sequence generation based on high scores. The subsequent stage involves bootstrapping, which augments the training dataset with self-generated data labeled by a proxy score function. Our key idea is to align the score-based generation with a proxy score function, which distills the knowledge of the proxy score function to the generator. After training, we aggregate samples from multiple bootstrapped generators and proxies to produce a diverse design. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms competitive baselines on biological sequential design tasks. We provide reproducible source code: \href{https://github.com/kaist-silab/bootgen}{https://github.com/kaist-silab/bootgen}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most link prediction methods return estimates of the connection probability of missing edges in a graph. Such output can be used to rank the missing edges from most to least likely to be a true edge, but does not directly provide a classification into true and non-existent. In this work, we consider the problem of identifying a set of true edges with a control of the false discovery rate (FDR). We propose a novel method based on high-level ideas from the literature on conformal inference. The graph structure induces intricate dependence in the data, which we carefully take into account, as this makes the setup different from the usual setup in conformal inference, where data exchangeability is assumed. The FDR control is empirically demonstrated for both simulated and real data.</description>

Building on copula theory, we propose a simplified objective for the recently-introduced transformer-based attentional copulas (TACTiS), wherein the number of distributional parameters now scales linearly with the number of variables instead of factorially. The new objective requires the introduction of a training curriculum, which goes hand-in-hand with necessary changes to the original architecture. We show that the resulting model has significantly better training dynamics and achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse real-world forecasting tasks, while maintaining the flexibility of prior work, such as seamless handling of unaligned and unevenly-sampled time series.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized sampling methods that learn a distribution over discrete objects proportional to their rewards. GFlowNets exhibit a remarkable ability to generate diverse samples, yet occasionally struggle to consistently produce samples with high rewards due to over-exploration on wide sample space. This paper proposes to train GFlowNets with local search, which focuses on exploiting high-rewarded sample space to resolve this issue. Our main idea is to explore the local neighborhood via backtracking and reconstruction guided by backward and forward policies, respectively. This allows biasing the samples toward high-reward solutions, which is not possible for a typical GFlowNet solution generation scheme, which uses the forward policy to generate the solution from scratch. Extensive experiments demonstrate a remarkable performance improvement in several biochemical tasks. Source code is available: \url{https://github.com/dbsxodud-11/ls_gfn}.</description>

      <title>PhyloGFN: Phylogenetic inference with generative flow networks</title>

Abstract: Phylogenetics is a branch of computational biology that studies the evolutionary relationships among biological entities. Its long history and numerous applications notwithstanding, inference of phylogenetic trees from sequence data remains challenging: the high complexity of tree space poses a significant obstacle for the current combinatorial and probabilistic techniques. In this paper, we adopt the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to tackle two core problems in phylogenetics: parsimony-based and Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Because GFlowNets are well-suited for sampling complex combinatorial structures, they are a natural choice for exploring and sampling from the multimodal posterior distribution over tree topologies and evolutionary distances. We demonstrate that our amortized posterior sampler, PhyloGFN, produces diverse and high-quality evolutionary hypotheses on real benchmark datasets. PhyloGFN is competitive with prior works in marginal likelihood estimation and achieves a closer fit to the target distribution than state-of-the-art variational inference methods.

      <title>A Poincar\'e Inequality and Consistency Results for Signal Sampling on Large Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale graph machine learning is challenging as the complexity of learning models scales with the graph size. Subsampling the graph is a viable alternative, but sampling on graphs is nontrivial as graphs are non-Euclidean. Existing graph sampling techniques require not only computing the spectra of large matrices but also repeating these computations when the graph changes, e.g., grows. In this paper, we introduce a signal sampling theory for a type of graph limit -- the graphon. We prove a Poincar\'e inequality for graphon signals and show that complements of node subsets satisfying this inequality are unique sampling sets for Paley-Wiener spaces of graphon signals. Exploiting connections with spectral clustering and Gaussian elimination, we prove that such sampling sets are consistent in the sense that unique sampling sets on a convergent graph sequence converge to unique sampling sets on the graphon. We then propose a related graphon signal sampling algorithm for large graphs, and demonstrate its good empirical performance on graph machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayes image restoration with compressive autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.</description>

      <title>Featurizing Koopman Mode Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces an advanced Koopman mode decomposition (KMD) technique -- coined Featurized Koopman Mode Decomposition (FKMD) -- that uses time embedding and Mahalanobis scaling to enhance analysis and prediction of high dimensional dynamical systems. The time embedding expands the observation space to better capture underlying manifold structure, while the Mahalanobis scaling, applied to kernel or random Fourier features, adjusts observations based on the system's dynamics. This aids in featurizing KMD in cases where good features are not a priori known. We find that the Mahalanobis scaling from FKMD can be used for effective dimensionality reduction of alanine dipeptide data. We also show that FKMD improves predictions for a high-dimensional Lorenz attractor and a cell signaling problem from cancer research.</description>

      <title>Thompson Sampling for Stochastic Bandits with Noisy Contexts: An Information-Theoretic Regret Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a stochastic contextual linear bandit problem where the agent observes a noisy, corrupted version of the true context through a noise channel with an unknown noise parameter. Our objective is to design an action policy that can approximate" that of an oracle, which has access to the reward model, the channel parameter, and the predictive distribution of the true context from the observed noisy context. In a Bayesian framework, we introduce a Thompson sampling algorithm for Gaussian bandits with Gaussian context noise. Adopting an information-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate the Bayesian regret of our algorithm concerning the oracle's action policy. We also extend this problem to a scenario where the agent observes the true context with some delay after receiving the reward and show that delayed true contexts lead to lower Bayesian regret. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms against baselines.</description>

      <title>Inference for Regression with Variables Generated from Unstructured Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The leading strategy for analyzing unstructured data uses two steps. First, latent variables of economic interest are estimated with an upstream information retrieval model. Second, the estimates are treated as "data" in a downstream econometric model. We establish theoretical arguments for why this two-step strategy leads to biased inference in empirically plausible settings. More constructively, we propose a one-step strategy for valid inference that uses the upstream and downstream models jointly. The one-step strategy (i) substantially reduces bias in simulations; (ii) has quantitatively important effects in a leading application using CEO time-use data; and (iii) can be readily adapted by applied researchers.</description>

      <title>Confidence on the Focal: Conformal Prediction with Selection-Conditional Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction builds marginally valid prediction intervals that cover the unknown outcome of a randomly drawn new test point with a prescribed probability. However, a common scenario in practice is that, after seeing the data, practitioners decide which test unit(s) to focus on in a data-driven manner and seek for uncertainty quantification of the focal unit(s). In such cases, marginally valid conformal prediction intervals may not provide valid coverage for the focal unit(s) due to selection bias. This paper presents a general framework for constructing a prediction set with finite-sample exact coverage conditional on the unit being selected by a given procedure. The general form of our method works for arbitrary selection rules that are invariant to the permutation of the calibration units, and generalizes Mondrian Conformal Prediction to multiple test units and non-equivariant classifiers. We then work out the computationally efficient implementation of our framework for a number of realistic selection rules, including top-K selection, optimization-based selection, selection based on conformal p-values, and selection based on properties of preliminary conformal prediction sets. The performance of our methods is demonstrated via applications in drug discovery and health risk prediction.</description>

      <title>Effect of Ambient-Intrinsic Dimension Gap on Adversarial Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of adversarial attacks on machine learning models imperceptible to a human is still quite a mystery from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we introduce two notions of adversarial attacks: natural or on-manifold attacks, which are perceptible by a human/oracle, and unnatural or off-manifold attacks, which are not. We argue that the existence of the off-manifold attacks is a natural consequence of the dimension gap between the intrinsic and ambient dimensions of the data. For 2-layer ReLU networks, we prove that even though the dimension gap does not affect generalization performance on samples drawn from the observed data space, it makes the clean-trained model more vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in the off-manifold direction of the data space. Our main results provide an explicit relationship between the $\ell_2,\ell_{\infty}$ attack strength of the on/off-manifold attack and the dimension gap.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Gaussian Approximation for Random Forest via Region-based Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive Gaussian approximation bounds for random forest predictions based on a set of training points given by a Poisson process, under fairly mild regularity assumptions on the data generating process. Our approach is based on the key observation that the random forest predictions satisfy a certain geometric property called region-based stabilization. In the process of developing our results for the random forest, we also establish a probabilistic result, which might be of independent interest, on multivariate Gaussian approximation bounds for general functionals of Poisson process that are region-based stabilizing. This general result makes use of the Malliavin-Stein method, and is potentially applicable to various related statistical problems.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on learning from preferences and choices with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference modelling lies at the intersection of economics, decision theory, machine learning and statistics. By understanding individuals' preferences and how they make choices, we can build products that closely match their expectations, paving the way for more efficient and personalised applications across a wide range of domains. The objective of this tutorial is to present a cohesive and comprehensive framework for preference learning with Gaussian Processes (GPs), demonstrating how to seamlessly incorporate rationality principles (from economics and decision theory) into the learning process. By suitably tailoring the likelihood function, this framework enables the construction of preference learning models that encompass random utility models, limits of discernment, and scenarios with multiple conflicting utilities for both object- and label-preference. This tutorial builds upon established research while simultaneously introducing some novel GP-based models to address specific gaps in the existing literature.</description>
