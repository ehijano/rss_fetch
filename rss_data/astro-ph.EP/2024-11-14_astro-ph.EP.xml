      <title>Preparing for the Early eVolution Explorer: Characterizing the photochemical inputs and transit detection efficiencies of young planets using multiwavelength flare observations by TESS and Swift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraviolet flare emission can drive photochemistry in exoplanet atmospheres and even serve as the primary source of uncertainty in atmospheric retrievals. Additionally, flare energy budgets are not well-understood due to a paucity of simultaneous observations. We present new near-UV (NUV) and optical observations of flares from three M dwarfs obtained at 20 s cadence with Swift and TESS, along with a re-analysis of flares from two M dwarfs in order to explore the energy budget and timing of flares at NUV--optical wavelengths. We find a 9000 K blackbody underestimates the NUV flux by $\geq$2$\times$ for 54$\pm$14% of flares and 14.8$\times$ for one flare. We report time lags between the bands of 0.5--6.6 min and develop a method to predict the qualitative flare shape and time lag to 36$\pm$30% accuracy. The scatter present in optical-NUV relations is reduced by a factor of 2.0$\pm$0.6 when comparing the total NUV energy with the TESS energy during the FWHM duration due to the exclusion of the $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx$5000 K tail. We show the NUV light curve can be used to remove flares from the optical light curve and consistently detect planets with 20% smaller transits than is possible without flare detrending. Finally, we demonstrate a 10$\times$ increase in the literature number of multi-wavelength flares with the Early eVolution Explorer (EVE), an astrophysics Small Explorer concept to observe young clusters with simultaneous NUV and optical bands in order to detect young planets, assess their photochemical radiation environments, and observe accretion.</description>

      <title>Stellar Obliquity Excitation via Disk Dispersal-Driven Resonances in Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar obliquity of a planetary system is often used to help constrain the system's formation and evolution. One of the mechanisms to reorient the stellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant ($\sim 300\;\mathrm{AU}$) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate broadly due to the $\sim 50\%$ binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an important role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any dynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for idealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting stellar obliquities are broadly distributed between $60^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ for most warm and cold planets. We further show that non-homologus disk dissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively-opened gap at $\sim 2\;\mathrm{AU}$, can help maintain orbital alignment of warm planets, in agreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial obliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also represent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if these companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of evolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven obliquity excitation.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: Two Super-Jupiters around M-dwarfs -- Signatures of Instability or Accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of TOI-6303b and TOI-6330b, two massive transiting super-Jupiters orbiting a M0 and a M2 star respectively, as part of the Searching for GEMS survey. These were detected by TESS and then confirmed via ground-based photometry and radial velocity observations with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF). TOI-6303b has a mass of 7.84 +/- 0.31 MJ, a radius of 1.03 +/- 0.06 RJ , and an orbital period of 9.485 days. TOI-6330b has a mass of 10.00 +/- 0.31 MJ , a radius of 0.97 +/- 0.03 RJ , and an orbital period of 6.850 days. We put these planets in context of super-Jupiters around M-dwarfs discovered from radial-velocity surveys, as well as recent discoveries from astrometry. These planets have masses that can be attributed to two dominant planet formation mechanisms - gravitational instability and core-accretion. Their masses necessitate massive protoplanetary disks that should either be gravitationally unstable, i.e. forming through gravitational instability, or be amongst some of the most massive protoplanetary disks to form objects through core-accretion. We also discuss the eccentricity distribution of these objects, as a potential indicator of their formation and evolutionary mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Realistic outcomes of moon-moon collisions in Lunar formation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiple impact hypothesis proposes that the Moon formed through a series of smaller collisions, rather than a single giant impact. This study advances our understanding of this hypothesis, as well as moon collisions in other contexts, by exploring the implications of these smaller impacts, employing a novel methodological approach that combines self-consistent initial conditions, hybrid hydrodynamic/N-body simulations, and the incorporation of material strength. Our findings challenge the conventional assumption of perfect mergers in previous models, revealing a spectrum of collision outcomes including partial accretion and mass loss. These outcomes are sensitive to collision parameters and Earth's tidal influence, underscoring the complex dynamics of lunar accretion. Importantly, we demonstrate that incorporating material strength is important for accurately simulating moonlet-sized impacts. This inclusion significantly affects fragmentation, tidal disruption, and the amount of material ejected or accreted onto Earth, ultimately impacting the Moon's growth trajectory. By accurately modeling diverse collision outcomes, our hybrid approach provides a powerful new framework for understanding the Moon's formation. We show that most collisions (~90%) do not significantly erode the largest moonlet, supporting the feasibility of lunar growth through accretion. Moreover, we revise previous estimates of satellite disruption, suggesting a higher survival rate and further bolstering the multiple-impact scenario.</description>

      <title>Basaltic mini-moon: Characterizing 2024 PT5 with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Small bodies in Earth-like orbits, the Arjunas, are good targets for scientific exploration and mining studies as they enable low-cost missions. The subset of such objects that experience recurrent temporarily captured flyby or orbiter events, also called mini-moon episodes, are among the best ranked in terms of accessibility. Only a handful of objects are known to have engaged in such a dynamical behavior. Finding and characterizing more of them may help to expand scientific and commercial research activities in space over the next few decades. Asteroid 2024 PT5 was found recently and belongs to this group of interesting objects.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the orbital context of 2024 PT5, and its spectral and rotational properties.
  Methods. We studied the short-term orbital evolution of 2024 PT5 using direct N-body simulations. We identified its spectral class from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope.
  Results. Asteroid 2024 PT5 experiences recurrent co-orbital engagements and mini-moon events of the temporarily captured flyby type. Its visible spectrum is consistent with that of an Sv-type asteroid or perhaps lunar ejecta. Its rotational period could be less than or close to 1 h.
  Conclusions. The discovery of 2024 PT5 confirms that temporarily captured flybys are relatively frequent and involve objects larger than a few meters, suitable as accessible targets for scientific research activities and commercial mining ventures in space.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric Earth models yield no net electron spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial experiments that use electrons in Earth as a spin-polarized source have been demonstrated to provide strong bounds on exotic long-range spin-spin and spin-velocity interactions. These bounds constrain the coupling strength of many proposed ultralight bosonic dark-matter candidates. Recently, it was pointed out that a monopole-dipole coupling between the Sun and the spin-polarized electrons of Earth would result in a modification of the precession of the perihelion of Earth. Using an estimate for the net spin-polarization of Earth and experimental bounds on Earth's perihelion precession, interesting constraints were placed on the magnitude of this monopole-dipole coupling. Here we investigate the spin associated with Earth's electrons. We find that there are about $6 \times 10^{41}$ spin-polarized electrons in the mantle and crust of Earth oriented anti-parallel to their local magnetic field. However, when integrated over any spherically-symmetric Earth model, we find that the vector sum of these spins is zero. In order to establish a lower bound on the magnitude of the net spin along Earth's rotation axis we have investigated three of the largest breakdowns of Earth's spherical symmetry: the large low shear-velocity provinces of the mantle, the crustal composition, and the oblate spheroid of Earth. From these investigations we conclude that there are at least $5 \times 10^{38}$ spin-polarized electrons aligned anti-parallel to Earth's rotation axis. This analysis suggests that the bounds on the monopole-dipole coupling that were extracted from Earth's perihelion precession need to be relaxed by a factor of about 2000.</description>

      <title>High-Time-Cadence Spectroscopy and Photometry of Stellar Flares on M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with Seimei Telescope and TESS. I. Discovery of Rapid and Short-Duration Prominence Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M-dwarfs show frequent flares and associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may significantly impact close-in habitable planets. M-dwarf flares sometimes show red/blue asymmetries in the H$\alpha$ line profile, suggesting prominence eruptions as an early stage of CMEs. However, their high-time-cadence observations are limited. We conducted spectroscopic monitoring observations of the active M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with $\sim$1 minute time cadence using the Seimei telescope, simultaneously with the optical photometric observations by Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We detected 27 H$\alpha$ flares with H$\alpha$ energies ranging from 1.7 $\times$ 10$^{29}$ to 3.8 $\times$ 10$^{32}$ erg and durations from 8 to 319 minutes. Among them, we identified 3 blue asymmetry and 5 red asymmetry events based on criteria using the Bayesian Information Criterion. The maximum velocity of the blue- and red-shifted components ranges from 250 to 450 km s$^{-1}$ and 190 to 400 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The duration and time evolution show variety, and in particular, we discovered rapid, short-duration blue/red asymmetry events with the duration of 6--8 minutes. Among the 8 blue/red asymmetry events, two blue and one red asymmetry events are interpreted as prominence eruptions because of their fast velocity and time evolution. Based on this interpretation, the lower limit of occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions can be estimated to be $\sim$1.1 events per day. Our discovery of short-duration events suggests that previous studies with low time cadence may have missed these events, potentially leading to an underestimation of the occurrence frequency of prominence eruptions/CMEs.</description>

      <title>High-temperature $^{205}$Tl decay clarifies $^{205}$Pb dating in early Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radioactive nuclei with lifetimes on the order of millions of years can reveal the formation history of the Sun and active nucleosynthesis occurring at the time and place of its birth. Among such nuclei whose decay signatures are found in the oldest meteorites, $^{205}$Pb is a powerful example, as it is produced exclusively by slow neutron captures (the s process), with most being synthesized in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. However, making accurate abundance predictions for $^{205}$Pb has so far been impossible because the weak decay rates of $^{205}$Pb and $^{205}$Tl are very uncertain at stellar temperatures. To constrain these decay rates, we measured for the first time the bound-state $\beta^-$ decay of fully ionized $^{205}$Tl$^{81+}$, an exotic decay mode that only occurs in highly charged ions. The measured half-life is 4.7 times longer than the previous theoretical estimate and our 10% experimental uncertainty has eliminated the main nuclear-physics limitation. With new, experimentally backed decay rates, we used AGB stellar models to calculate $^{205}$Pb yields. Propagating those yields with basic galactic chemical evolution (GCE) and comparing with the $^{205}$Pb/$^{204}$Pb ratio from meteorites, we determined the isolation time of solar material inside its parent molecular cloud. We find positive isolation times that are consistent with the other s-process short-lived radioactive nuclei found in the early Solar System. Our results reaffirm the site of the Sun's birth as a long-lived, giant molecular cloud and support the use of the $^{205}$Pb--$^{205}$Tl decay system as a chronometer in the early Solar System.</description>

      <title>Deep Search for a scattered light dust halo around Vega with the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a provisory scattered light detection of the Vega debris disk using deep Hubble Space Telescope coronagraphy (PID 16666). At only 7.7 parsecs, Vega is immensely important in debris disk studies both for its prominence and also because it allows the highest physical resolution among all debris systems relative to temperature zones around the star. We employ the STIS coronagraph's widest wedge position and classical Reference Differential Imaging to achieve among the lowest surface brightness sensitivities to date ($\sim 4\,\mu Jy/arcsec^{2}$) at wide separations using 32 orbits in Cycle 29. We detect a halo extending from the inner edge of our effective inner working angle at $10^{\prime\prime}.5$ out to the photon noise floor at $30^{\prime\prime}$ (80 - 230 au). The face-on orientation of the system and the lack of a perfectly color-matched PSF star have provided significant challenges to the reductions, particularly regarding artifacts from the imperfect color matching. However, we find that a halo of small dust grains provides the best explanation for the observed signal. Unlike Fomalhaut (a close twin to Vega in luminosity, distance, and age), there is no clear distinction in scattered light between the parent planetesimal belt observed with ALMA and the extended dust halo. These HST observations complement JWST GTO Cycle 1 observations of the system with NIRCam and MIRI.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1%-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here, we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from 2022 October through 2024 May as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>
