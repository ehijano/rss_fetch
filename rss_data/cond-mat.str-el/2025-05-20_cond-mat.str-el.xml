      <title>Pseudogap in electron-doped cuprates: thermal precursor to magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study pseudogap behavior in a metal near an antiferromagnetic instability and apply the results to electron-doped cuprates. We associate pseudogap behavior with thermal magnetic fluctuations and compute the fermionic self-energy along the Fermi surface beyond Eliashberg approximation. We analyze the spectral function as a function of frequency (energy distribution curves, EDC) and momentum (momentum distribution curves, MDC). We show that the EDC display pseudogap behavior with peaks at a finite frequency at all momenta. On the other hand, MDC peaks disperse within the pseudogap, ending at a gossamer Fermi surface. We analyze magnetically-mediated superconductivity and show that thermal fluctuations almost cancel out in the gap equation, even when the self-energy is obtained beyond the Eliashberg approximation. We favorably compare our results with recent ARPES study [K-J Xu et al, Nat. Phys. 19, 1834-1840 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Robust superzone gap opening in incommensurate antiferromagnetic semimetal EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ under in-plane magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and charge transport in semimetals has emerged as a fertile ground for discovering novel electronic phenomena. A notable example is the recent discovery of electronic commensuration arising from a spin moir\'e superlattice (SMS), realized as double-q spin modulation in the antiferromagnetic semimetal EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Here, we investigate the in-plane magnetic-field tunability of the SMS using neutron scattering, magnetic and transport measurements. We reveal an incommensurate noncollinear cycloidal magnetic ground state. Temperature-field phase diagrams constructed with field tilting uncover multiple spin-reoriented phases, suggesting the critical role of in-plane field components in driving magnetic transitions. Despite substantial spin reorientation of the double-q phase, we observe a persistent gap opening, evidenced by strong suppression in both Hall and longitudinal conductivities. Model calculations attribute this robustness to the stability of SMS under tilting fields. Our results establish EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ as a tunable platform for exploring spin-texture-driven superzone gap opening in electronic states.</description>

      <title>Can experimentally-accessible measures of entanglement distinguish quantum spin liquids from disorder-driven "random singlet" phases ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the theoretical level, quantum spin liquids are distinguished from other phases of matter by their entanglement properties. However, since the usual measure of entanglement, entanglement entropy, cannot accessed in experiment, indentifying quantum spin liquids in candidate materials remains an acute problem. Here we show other, experimentally-accessible, measures of entanglement can be used to distinguish a quantum spin liquid from a competing disorder-driven "random singlet" phase, in a model of a disordered antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice. The application of these results to the triangular-lattice systems YbZnGaO$_4$, YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and KYbSe$_2$ is discussed.</description>

      <title>Strange metallicity encompasses high magnetic field-induced superconductivity in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy fermion material UTe$_2$ hosts a suite of exotic superconducting phases, the most extreme of which resides in a narrow angular window of intense magnetic fields $&gt;$ 40 T. Here we report that in the angular and field regime in which field-induced superconductivity is most robust, the normal-state resistivity exhibits a linear temperature dependence characteristic of strange metallicity, sharply contrasting with the Fermi-liquid behavior observed at low fields and away from this angular window. Through angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements in high magnetic fields, we find that the strange metal state is confined to a narrow angular range where field-induced superconductivity is also maximized, suggesting a shared underlying mechanism. These findings reveal a novel setting for strange metallicity - proximate to spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity - and point to the presence of quantum critical fluctuations, likely of a magnetic origin. The coexistence of strange metallicity and putatively spin-triplet pairing challenges prevailing paradigms of non-Fermi-liquid phenomenology, and highlights UTe$_2$ as a unique platform for exploring the interplay between unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Antipolar and short and long-range magnetic ordering in quasi-two-dimensional AgCrP2S6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Landau theoretical framework, the decreased entropy with decreasing the temperature is accompanied by the symmetry breaking and hence a corresponding phase transition. The broken symmetries leave its imprint on the underlying excitations and the same may be gauged using renormalization of these excitations. AgCrP2S6 provides a versatile playground to probe dynamics of the quasiparticle excitations as well as multiple phase transitions with lowering temperature linked with the polar, lattice and spin degrees of freedom. Here, we report an in-depth temperature- and polarization-dependent Raman scattering measurements on single crystals of quasi 2D zigzag antiferromagnet AgCrP2S6 along with the first principle based phonon calculations. We observed multiple phase transitions triggered by the short and long-range ordering of spins at ~ 90 K and 20 K, respectively; within the Cr sublattice where spins are arranged in a 1D chain, evident by the distinct anomalies in the phonon modes self-energy parameters as well as intensity. Contrary to the conventional belief, we uncovered potential quasi-antipolar ordering at ~ 200 K and with further lowering in temperature an antipolar ordering at ~ 140 K attributed to the Ag ions, which is conjectured to be forbidden owing to the heaviness of Ag ions. The quasi-antipolar and antipolar ordering is gauged via the distinct renormalization of the phonon parameters, which survives at all the temperatures. Additionally, large number of modes appears with decreasing the temperature, in the window of ~ 200-140 K, where antipolar ordering starts settling in. The emergence of large number of phonon modes below ~ 200 K, nearly double of those at room temperature, suggests the lowering of symmetry from high temperature C2h to the low temperature C2 or Cs and as a result doubling of the unit cell.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of d-wave Pairing in Strongly Correlated Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, featuring momentum-dependent spin splitting without net magnetization, has attracted a growing interest for spintronics. We study a Fermi Hubbard model with altermagnetic order arising from the spin-anisotropic hopping near half-filling using constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo. Spin-dependent hopping breaks SU(2) symmetry and disrupts Fermi surface nesting, giving rise to an altermagnetic state with momentum-space spin splitting but no net magnetization. We find that increasing anisotropy suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and significantly enhances effective $d$-wave pairing correlations. Our results demonstrate a doping-free route to unconventional superconductivity mediated by short-range spin fluctuations in an altermagnetic background.</description>

      <title>Unconventional band splitting of CeSb in the devil's staircase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and electronic band structure is a central theme in condensed matter physics. CeSb, with its complex devil's staircase antiferromagnetic transition, offers a unique opportunity to explore this interplay. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we investigate the electronic structure evolution across the devil's staircase transition. Upon entering the antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an intriguing band splitting of the electron pocket around the X point. The energy separation between the split bands changes abruptly with temperature, consistent with the characteristics of the first-order phase transition. However, their respective spectral weights behave gradually with temperature. Combined with our density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we suggest that this atypical behavior deviates from conventional magnetically induced band splitting and potentially arises from the intricate modulation of paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic layers within the devil's staircase transition. Our results provide insights into the complex relationship between electronic structure and magnetism in correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the electronic states by quantum charge fluctuations in electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12639v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of electron-boson interactions is a key to understanding the mechanism of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates. While interactions with phonons and magnetic fluctuations are widely considered to mediate electron pairing in cuprates, the role of charge fluctuations, which is one of the fundamental degrees of freedom, remains unclear. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and angle-resolved inverse photoemission spectroscopy (AR-IPES) to investigate the electronic structure of the occupied and unoccupied states, respectively, in the electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. We found emergent spectral features in both the occupied (ARPES) and unoccupied states (AR-IPES), which are likely induced by charge fluctuations. The present study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the relationship between quantum charge fluctuations and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Correlated Dirac semimetal states in nonsymmorphic MIrO$_3$ (M=Sr, Ba and Ca)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonsymmorphic symmetries can give rise to Dirac semimetal (DSM) states. However, few studies have been conducted on DSMs in interacting systems. Here, we induce interacting DSM states in nonsymmorphic iridium oxides SrIrO$_3$, BaIrO$_3$ and CaIrO$_3$, and contend that the interaction of electron-electron correlations, strong spin-orbital coupling, and symmetry protection can drive robust and exotic DSM states. Based on the density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory (DFT + DMFT), with the Coulomb interaction parameters computed through doubly screened Coulomb correction approach, we discover that the Dirac fermions are constituted by the strongly spin-orbital coupled $J_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1/2$ states resulting from $t_{2g}$ orbits of Ir, with significant mass enhancement. Moreover, the nonsymmorphic symmetries induce topological surface bands and Fermi arcs on the (001) surface, which are well separated from bulk states. Our findings establish nonsymmorphic iridium oxides as correlated DSMs under strong electron-electron and spin-orbital interactions.</description>

      <title>Itinerant ferromagnetism in an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model at finite temperature: A DMFT study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model on a hypercubic lattice at finite temperatures, combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Taking strong correlations into account carefully, we find a ferromagnetically ordered state, in which one of the three components becomes dominant, when holes are doped away from one-third filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this ferromagnetically ordered phase undergoes a first-order transition to a paramagnetic state. We clarify the stability of the ferromagnetically ordered state against interaction strength, hole doping, and temperatures. The relevance of generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism is also addressed, by comparing the results on the Bethe lattice.</description>

      <title>Resolving self-cavity effects in two-dimensional quantum materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials and van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures host many strongly correlated and topological quantum phases on the $\sim$ meV energy scale. Direct electrodynamical signatures of such states are thus expected to appear in the terahertz (THz) frequency range (1 THz $\sim$ 4 meV). Because the typical size of vdW heterostructures ($\sim$10 $\mu m$) is much smaller than the diffraction limit of THz light, probing THz optical conductivities necessitates the use of near-field optical probes. However, interpreting the response of such near-field probes is complicated by finite-size effects, the presence of electrostatic gates, and the influence of the probe itself on material dynamics -- all of which conspire to form polaritonic self-cavities, in which interactions between THz electromagnetic fields and material excitations form discretized standing waves. In this paper, we demonstrate the relevance of self-cavity effects in 2D materials and derive an analytical framework to resolve these effects using the emerging experimental technique of time-domain on-chip THz spectroscopy. We show that by pairing experiments with the analytical theory, it is possible to extract the THz conductivity and resolve collective mode dynamics far outside the light cone, with $\sim \mu m$ in-plane and $\sim nm$ out-of-plane resolution. This study lays the groundwork for studying quantum phases and cavity effects in vdW heterostructures and 2D quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Emergent High-Entropy Phases in Geometrically Frustrated Pyrochlore Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated magnets provide a platform for exploring exotic phases beyond conventional ordering, with potential relevance to functional materials and information technologies. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to map the thermodynamic phase diagram of pyrochlore iridates R2Ir2O7 (R = Dy, Ho) with three stable magnetic ground-state stable phases: frustrated spin-ice 2 in 2 out (2I2O) phase, frustrated fragmented 3 in 1 out/1 in 3 out (3I1O/1I3O) phase, and antiferromagnetic all in all out (AIAO) phase without frustration. We discovered two additional emergent metastable phases at finite temperatures, located between the boundaries separating those stable phases. These metastable phases exhibit high magnetic susceptibility and high entropy without long-range order. Their stabilization arises from entropic minimization of the free energy, where the entropy dominates energetic competition near phase boundaries at finite temperatures. Our results demonstrate a platform to engineer highly susceptible and degenerated states through frustration and thermal activation, offering a foundation for entropy-based design of metastable phases in correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting vestigial order in nematic superconductors: gauge-field mechanisms and model constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility that nematicity induced by electron pairing could persist above the superconducting transition temperature represents a form of composite order, sometimes referred to as a vestigial nematic phase. However, it remains debated whether--and under what conditions--such a phase can emerge in realistic models of nematic superconductors. Recent analytical work [1] concluded that vestigial nematic phases and related mechanisms do not arise in commonly used models proposed, for example, for Bi2Se3-based candidates. To address this question, we perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model of a nematic superconductor. Consistent with the findings of Ref.[1], our numerical results confirm that the commonly considered models do not exhibit vestigial nematic phases or nematic-fluctuation-induced charge-4e superconductivity. In the second part of the study, we investigate a different class of models and show that, under restrictive conditions, vestigial nematic order can be stabilized by an alternative mechanism: intercomponent coupling mediated by a gauge field or the effects of strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Role of Nematic Fluctuations on Superconductivity in FeSe$_{0.47}$Te$_{0.53}$ Revealed by NMR under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations (SF), nematic fluctuations, and superconductivity (SC) has been central to understanding the pairing mechanism in iron-based superconductors (IBSCs). Iron chalcogenides, which hold the simplest crystal structure in IBSCs, provide a good platform to investigate the relationship. Here, we report $^{77}$Se and $^{125}$Te nuclear magnetic resonance studies of FeSe$_{0.47}$Te$_{0.53}$, which is located close to a nematic quantum critical point (QCP), under pressures up to 1.35 GPa. Both the superconducting critical temperature and AFMSF were found to be enhanced under pressure, which suggests a correlation between SC and AFMSF in FeSe$_{0.47}$Te$_{0.53}$. However, the contribution of AFMSF to SC in FeSe$_{0.47}$Te$_{0.53}$ was found to be much less compared to that in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$, suggesting that nematic fluctuations play a dominant role in the SC in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ around the nematic QCP.</description>

      <title>Driven Critical Dynamics in Tricitical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism, describing driven dynamics across critical points based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario (AIS), have attracted broad attentions. However, the driven dynamics in tricritical point with two independent relevant directions has not been adequately studied. Here, we employ time dependent variational principle to study the driven critical dynamics at a one-dimensional supersymmetric Ising tricritical point. For the relevant direction along the Ising critical line, the AIS apparently breaks down. Nevertheless, we find that the critical dynamics can still be described by the KZ scaling in which the driving rate has the dimension of $r=z+1/\nu_\mu$ with $z$ and $\nu_\mu$ being the dynamic exponent and correlation length exponent in this direction, respectively. For driven dynamics along other direction, the driving rate has the dimension $r=z+1/\nu_p$ with $\nu_p$ being the other correlation length exponent. Our work brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics near the tricritical point, which could be realized in programmable quantum processors in Rydberg atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and phase diagram in Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated ambient pressure superconductivity in compressively strained La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films, yet the phase diagram of heterovalent doping$-$critical for advancing the field$-$remains unexplored. Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} &gt; 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</description>

      <title>Anomalous persistent current in a 1D dimerized ring with aperiodic site potential: Non-interacting and interacting cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the magnetic response by examining flux-driven circular currents in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) tight-binding (TB) ring threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux, $\phi$. We consider both non-interacting and interacting electrons, where site energies are modulated by a slowly varying cosine form. Repulsive electron-electron interaction is incorporated through an on-site Hubbard term, and we analyze the system using the Hartree-Fock (HF) mean-field (MF) approximation. We discuss the characteristics of flux-driven circular currents to aperiodic potentials, dimerized hopping integrals, and Hubbard interactions. For the chosen aperiodic potential, both the strength and configuration play a crucial role, and we explore these aspects in depth. Interestingly, we observe a counterintuitive delocalizing effect as the aperiodic potential increases, unlike in conventional disordered rings. The effects of system size, filling factor, the presence of circular spin current, and the accuracy of MF results are also discussed. Finally, we provide a brief description of possible experimental realizations of our chosen quantum system. This investigation can be extended to explore additional properties in various loop substructures, promising further insights.</description>

      <title>Tricritical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism is being actively explored on quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we study the KZ scaling around tricritical phase transition points, with Rydberg atom ladders as a concrete incarnation. The criticality is of Ising and Potts type for two- and three-leg ladders, respectively. When slowly ramping across or near the tricritical point from the disordered phase to the ordered phase, we obtain universal power-law scaling in agreement with conventional KZ predictions. We study a "tangential" KZ ramping that both begins and ends in the disordered phase, a novel protocol enabled by the two-dimensional phase diagram. The tangential KZ directly reveals subleading critical exponents of the critical point. Finally, we explore the regime of intermediate-speed ramping and find a dynamical analog of the celebrated Zamolodchikov's c-theorem. Practically, our work provides an immediately relevant protocol for current experiments to pinpoint the elusive tricritical points. More broadly, tangential and intermediate-speed rampings go beyond the conventional KZ paradigm and introduce new insights into critical quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mixed Quantum-Classical Methods for Polaron Spectral Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, using two distinct semiclassical approaches, namely the mean-field Ehrenfest (MFE) method and the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH), we investigate the spectral function of a single charge interacting with phonons on a lattice. This quantity is relevant for the description of angle-resolved photoemission experiments. Focusing on the one-dimensional Holstein model, we compare the performance of these approaches across a range of coupling strengths and lattice sizes, exposing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. We demonstrate that these approaches can be efficiently applied with reasonable accuracy to ab initio polaron models. Our work provides a route to the calculation of spectral properties in realistic electron-phonon-coupled systems in a computationally inexpensive manner with encouraging accuracy.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cross-layer composite spins in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure and possible routes to enhance its superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13442v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ has been recently found to exhibit superconductivity in its high-pressure phase, similar to the previously discovered bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but with a notably lower transition temperature. To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that nonlinear transport responses in strange metals are strong, larger by a factor of $E_F/T$ than in Fermi liquids. Within the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of a Fermi surface with a spatially random coupling to a critical scalar, the third order conductivity is found to diverge as $1/T$ at low $T$, indicating the existence of a voltage-temperature scaling regime in the conductance. Its frequency and orientation dependence contains information on relaxation times of heat and electron distribution deformations, providing a new set of tools to characterize strange metals.</description>

      <title>Large Thermopower with Sign-Alternating Quantum Oscillations in Insulating Monolayer WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of Landau-level-like energy structures near the chemical potential of an insulator is essential to the search for a class of correlated electronic matter hosting charge-neutral fermions and Fermi surfaces, a long-proposed concept that remains elusive experimentally. Here we introduce and demonstrate that the magneto-thermoelectric response of a quantum insulator can reveal critical information not available via other approaches. We report the observation of large Seebeck response together with quantum oscillations (QOs) in the hole-doped insulating state of monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) in magnetic fields. The measured low temperature magneto-thermopower exceeds k_B/e by more than an order of magnitude, where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and e the elementary charge. This large thermopower is a characteristic of an insulating state, consistent with high resistivity. However, as the magnetic field is swept, QOs develop in the thermopower, which remarkably undergoes sign-changes that mimic the quantum characteristic of metals due to Landau quantization. The sign-change in the thermoelectric response directly implies the presence of a field-induced Landau-level-like structure at the chemical potential of the insulator. Neither the large thermopower nor the sign-changes can be induced by the metallic gate nearby. Our results demonstrate a new dilemma for investigating low energy excitations in correlated materials featuring mixed quantum characteristics of metals and insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a three-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model relevant for iron-based superconductors using variational wave functions explicitly including spatial correlations and electron pairing. We span the nonmagnetic sector from filling $n=4$, which is representative of undoped iron-based superconductors, to $n=3$, where a Mott insulating state with each orbital at half filling is found. In the strong-coupling regime, when the electron density is increased, we find a spontaneous differentiation between the occupation of $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, leading to an orbital-selective state with a nematic character that becomes stronger at increasing density. One of these orbitals stays half-filled for all densities while the other one hosts (together with the $d_{xy}$ orbital) the excess of electron density. Most importantly, in this regime long-range pairing correlations appear in the orbital with the largest occupation. Our results highlight a strong link between orbital-selective correlations, nematicity, and superconductivity, which requires the presence of a significant Hund's coupling.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface and pseudogap in highly doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fate of the Fermi surface in bulk electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ remains elusive, as does the origin and extension of its pseudogap phase. Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. We find that the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, and thus beyond the sharp increase in Hall carrier density to $\simeq 1+x$ recently observed above $x^{*}=0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1593 (2024)]. This suggests that doped iridates host a unique phase of matter in which a large Hall density coexists with an anisotropic pseudogap, breaking up the Fermi surface into disconnected arcs. The temperature boundary of the pseudogap is $T^{*}\simeq 200$ K for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates and to the energy scale of short range antiferromagnetic correlations in cuprates and iridates.</description>

The order parameters of the supersolid are analyzed and an understanding of its lack of ferromagnetic moment is suggested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the topological response theory to detect the boundary anomalies of linear subsystem symmetries. This approach allows us to distinguish different subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases and uncover new ones. We focus on the cases where the mixed anomaly exists within the adjacent subsystems. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the power of this method by identifying strong and weak $Z_2^\tau\times Z_2^\sigma$ SSPT phases in a tunable tensor network state. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic $Z_2$ SSPT phase characterized by its degenerate entanglement spectrum. Furthermore, we extend the anomaly indicator to mixed-state density matrices and show that quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetry can persist under both uniform and alternating disorders. This finding establishes a connection between boundary quantum anomalies in pure and mixed states. Our work provides a numerical method to detect quantum anomalies of subsystem symmetries, offering new insights into the study of topological quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum typicality: Simple method for investigating transport properties applied to the Holstein model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of the Holstein model using the numerically exact quantum typicality (QT) approach. Roughly speaking, QT exploits the fact that even a single, randomly chosen pure state can effectively represent the full statistical ensemble in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. This allows us to compute frequency-dependent mobilities, representative of the thermodynamic limit, that are well-converged with respect to all numerical parameters. Our results are compared against other numerically exact methods, and used to analyze the contribution of vertex corrections to frequency-dependent mobility. The promising accuracy and efficiency of the QT approach suggest its applicability to a broader class of Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the pullback trivialization technique to systematically construct gapped interfaces and anomalous boundaries for fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) states by extending their symmetry group $G_f = \mathbb{Z}_2^f \times_{\omega_2} G$ to larger groups. These FSPT states may involve decoration layers of both Majorana chains and complex fermions. We derive general consistency formulas explicitly for (2+1)D and (3+1)D systems, where nontrivial twists arise from fermionic symmetric local unitaries or "gauge transformations" that ensure coboundaries vanish at the cochain level. Additionally, we present explicit example for a (3+1)D FSPT of symmetry group $G_f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$ with Majorana chain decorations.</description>

      <title>High-pressure floating zone crystal growth of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate the floating zone crystal growth of the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Historically, the growth of iridates from a ternary melt has been precluded by the extreme vapor pressure of the metal oxide species and the difficulty of maintaining the correct oxidation state of Ir at high temperatures. Here, we show that the application of a high-pressure oxygen growth environment stabilizes the Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ phase, leading to the first demonstration of cm$^{3}$-scale crystals. In contrast to the conventional SrCl$_2$ flux growth method, where poor control over disorder leads to strong sample dependence, the high-pressure floating zone growth enables active control over the homogeneity of the melt. Crystals grown via this technique possess qualitatively similar properties to those grown via flux, with a relatively sharp onset of antiferromagnetic order observed in temperature-dependent magnetization. Further, we demonstrate that by tuning the mixing rate of the melt, we are able to grow natively hole-doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-y}$O$_4$, which exhibits a strongly modified magnetic and electronic response.</description>

      <title>Ancilla theory of twisted bilayer graphene I: topological Mott localization and pseudogap metal in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent experimental studies of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) raise a fundamental question: how do we understand Mott localization in a topological band? In this work, we offer a new perspective of Mott physics, which can be generalized to TBG directly in momentum space. In our theory, the Mott gap is understood as from an exciton-like hybridization $\Phi(\mathbf k) c^\dagger(\mathbf k)\psi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical electron $c$ and an ancilla fermion $\psi$. In the conventional Mott insulator of trivial band, the hybridization is $s$-wave with $\Phi(\mathbf k)=\frac{U}{2}$, where $U$ is the on-site Hubbard interaction. On the other hand, the band topology in TBG enforces a topological Mott hybridization with $\Phi(\mathbf k)\sim k_x \pm i k_y$ in a small region around $\mathbf{k}=0$. We dub this new Mott state as topological Mott localization because of the $p\pm ip$ order parameter analogous to the topological superconductor. At $\nu=0$, we find a topological Mott semimetal with a low energy effective theory resembling that of the untwisted bilayer graphene. For $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we show transitions from correlated insulators to Mott semimetals at smaller $U$. In the most intriguing density region $\nu=-2-x$, we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Interestingly, the quasiparticle is primarily formed by ancilla fermion, which we interpret as a composite fermion formed by a hole bound to a particle-hole pair. Our theory offers a unified language to describe the Mott localization in both trivial and topological bands in momentum space, and we anticipate applications in other moir\'e systems with topological Wannier obstruction, such as the twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayer.</description>

      <title>Magnon damping and mode softening in quantum double-exchange ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic excitations and electronic properties of fully quantum double-exchange ferromagnets, i.e., systems where ferromagnetic ordering emerges from the competition between spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom, but without the canonical approximation of using classical localized spins. Specifically, we investigate spin excitations within the Kondo lattice-like model, as well as a two-orbital Hubbard Hamiltonian in proximity to the orbital-selective Mott phase. Computational analysis of the magnon dispersion, damping, and spectral weight within these models reveals unexpected phenomena, such as magnon mode softening and the anomalous decoherence of magnetic excitations as observed in earlier experimental efforts, but explained here without the use of the phononic degrees of freedom. We show that these effects are intrinsically linked to incoherent spectral features near the Fermi level, which arise due to the quantum nature of the local (on-site) triplets. This incoherent spectrum leads to a Stoner-like continuum on which spin excitations scatter, governing magnon lifetime and strongly influencing the dynamical spin structure factor. Our study explores the transition from coherent to incoherent magnon spectra by varying the electron density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the localized spin mitigates decoherence by suppressing the incoherent spectral contributions near the Fermi level. We also discuss the effective $J_1$-$J_2$ spin Hamiltonian, which can accurately describe the large doping region characterized by the magnon-mode softening. Finally, we show that this behavior is also present in multiorbital models with partially filled orbitals, namely, in systems without localized spin moments, provided that the model is in a strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Identifying Instabilities with Quantum Geometry in Flat Band Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absence of a well-defined Fermi surface in flat-band systems challenges the conventional understanding of instabilities toward Landau order based on nesting. We investigate the existence of an intrinsic nesting structure encoded in the band geometry (i.e. the wavefunctions of the flat band(s)), which leads to a maximal susceptibility at the mean-field level and thus determines the instability towards ordered phases. More generally, we show that for a given band structure and observable, we can define two vector fields: one which corresponds to the Bloch vector of the projection operator onto the manifold of flat bands, and another which is "dressed" by the observable. The overlap between the two vector fields, possibly shifted by a momentum vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$, fully determines the mean field susceptibility of the corresponding order parameter. When the overlap is maximized, so is the susceptibility, and this geometrically corresponds to "perfect nesting" of the band structure. In that case, we show that the correlation length of this order parameter, even for $\boldsymbol{Q}\neq \boldsymbol{0}$, is entirely characterized by a generalized quantum metric in an intuitive manner, and is therefore lower-bounded in topologically non-trivial bands. As an example, we demonstrate hidden nesting for staggered antiferromagnetic spin order in an exactly flat-band model, which is notably different from the general intuition that flat bands are closely associated with ferromagnetism. We check the actual emergence of this long-range order using the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like state (pairing with non-zero center of mass momentum) can arise in flat bands upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, even if Zeeman splitting is absent.</description>

      <title>Finite-$q$ antiferrotoroidal and ferritoroidal order in a distorted kagome structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A highly geometrically frustrated lattice structure such as a distorted kagome (or quasikagome) structure enriches physical phenomena through coupling with the electronic structure, topology, and magnetism. Recently, it has been reported that an intermetallic HoAgGe exhibits two distinct magnetic structures with the finite magnetic vector $q=(1/3,1/3,0)$: One is the partially ordered state in the intermediate-temperature region, and the other is the kagome spin ice state in the lowest-temperature region. We theoretically elucidate that the former is characterized by antiferrotoroidal ordering, while the latter is characterized by ferritoroidal ordering based on the multipole representation theory, which provides an opposite interpretation to previous studies. We also show how antiferrotoroidal and ferritoroidal orderings are microscopically formed by quantifying the magnetic toroidal moment activated in a multiorbital system. As a result, we find that the degree of distortion for the kagome structure plays a significant role in determining the nature of antiferrotoroidal and ferritoroidal orderings, which brings about the crossover between the antiferro-type and the ferri-type distributions of the magnetic toroidal dipole. We confirm such a tendency by evaluating the linear magnetoelectric effect. Our analysis can be applied irrespective of lattice structures and magnetic vectors without annoying the cluster origin.</description>

Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. They reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires with strong wire-wire coupling away from the gapless regions.</description>

      <title>Intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of \textit{Fermi surface nesting}, we show that superconductivity can emerge near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the $p+ip$, $h+ih$, and the nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in {a narrow stripe shape of superconducting region}, consistent with experimental findings. We point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation with a dominant $p+ip$ pairing. The possibility of realizing intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in other rhombohedral graphene systems is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Evaluating many-body stabilizer R\'enyi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling \emph{reduced Pauli strings} within a \emph{reduced configuration space}, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. We first isolate the free energy part in $2$-SRE, which is a trivial term. Notably, at quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the \emph{characteristic function} contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, analyzing the volume-law correction to SRE reveals a discontinuity tied to criticalities, suggesting that it is more informative than the full-state magic. For conformal critical points, we claim it could reflect nonlocal magic residing in correlations. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gr\"obner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, \leq 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360, 12, \leq 24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>Exponential quantum speedups in quantum chemistry with linear depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and generalized unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations, for which computing the off-diagonal matrix elements is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete for any polynomial depth. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.</description>

Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the generalized Hubbard model. We analyze models of armchair hexagonal geometries nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling. This form of itinerant magnetism predicted rigorously for Hubbard model remained unascertained in large scale realistic systems. We demonstrate that Coulomb scattering terms play a crucial role in stabilizing Nagaoka ferromagnetism, enabling the observation of the phase transition for system parameters near $U/t \approx 60$.</description>

      <title>Planar quantum low-density parity-check codes with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct high-performance planar quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes with open boundaries, demonstrating substantially improved resource efficiency compared to the surface code. We present planar code families with logical dimensions ranging from $k=6$ to $k=13$ (e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[173, 8, 9]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$), all using local stabilizers of weight 6 or lower. These codes achieve an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) that is an order of magnitude greater than that of the surface code. They can be interpreted as planar bivariate bicycle codes, adapted from the original design based on a torus that is challenging to implement physically. Our construction method, which combines boundary anyon condensation with a novel ``lattice grafting'' optimization, circumvents this difficulty and produces codes featuring only local low-weight stabilizers suitable for 2D planar hardware architectures. Furthermore, we observe fractal logical operators in the form of Sierpinski triangles, with the code distances scaling proportionally to the area of the truncated fractal in finite systems. We anticipate that our codes and construction methods offer a promising pathway toward realizing near-term fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>
