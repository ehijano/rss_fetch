      <title>Two Stochastic Control Methods for Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection of Jump Diffusions and Their Relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the maximum principle and dynamic programming principle for mean-variance portfolio selection of jump diffusions and their relationship. First, the optimal portfolio and efficient frontier of the problem are obtained using both methods. Furthermore, the relationship between these two methods is investigated. Specially, the connections between the adjoint processes and value function are given.</description>

      <title>Your AI, Not Your View: The Bias of LLMs in Investment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent preferences of models and measure their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models. These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence.</description>

      <title>Is Causality Necessary for Efficient Portfolios? A Computational Perspective on Predictive Validity and Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent claims in financial modeling argue that causal identifiability is necessary for valid portfolio optimization, asserting that misspecified models lead to signal inversion and degraded performance. This paper challenges that assertion by showing that structurally misspecified predictive models, those omitting confounders or misrepresenting functional relationships, can still support robust and efficient portfolio construction. We develop a theoretical framework linking optimization performance to the directional alignment between predictive signals and true expected returns, independent of structural correctness. We derive sufficient conditions under which even non-causal signals yield valid, convex efficient frontiers, and we show that the Sharpe ratio scales linearly with alignment. Analytical results are supported by simulation studies demonstrating robustness to confounding and miscalibration, including cases of approximate bias cancellation. Empirical experiments using stock returns confirm that associational signals can produce viable frontiers under classical mean-variance optimization. These findings reframe the role of causal modeling in quantitative finance: while causality may offer interpretability and robustness in specific contexts, it is directional informativeness, not structural fidelity, that is essential for effective signal-based portfolio design.</description>

      <title>Forecasting stock return distributions around the globe with quantile neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning approach for forecasting the distribution of stock returns using a rich set of firm-level and market predictors. Our method combines a two-stage quantile neural network with spline interpolation to construct smooth, flexible cumulative distribution functions without relying on restrictive parametric assumptions. This allows accurate modelling of non-Gaussian features such as fat tails and asymmetries. Furthermore, we show how to derive other statistics from the forecasted return distribution such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. The derived mean and variance forecasts offer significantly improved out-of-sample performance compared to standard models. We demonstrate the robustness of the method in US and international markets.</description>
