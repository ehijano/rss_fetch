      <title>The spatially variable effects of mangroves on flood depths and losses from storm surges in Florida</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mangroves modify storm surges with impacts to property damages from tropical cyclones (TC), but the magnitude of these effects and their spatial variability are not well understood especially at sub-county scales. We use high-resolution storm surge flood and loss models to examine variation in the effects of mangroves on these losses spatially and by storm intensity in Florida. We estimate that mangroves reduce storm surge losses to properties by $67.5 million annually in Collier County in western Florida with over half the cumulative benefits from storm surges with return periods under 30 years. We estimate the benefits of mangroves during hurricanes Irma (2017) and Ian (2022) as US$ 725 Million and $4.1 Billion. We show that flood depths and losses are always lower for properties landward of mangroves but can increase for properties seaward or between mangroves, underlining the importance of nuanced descriptions of variability in mangrove effects during storms.</description>

      <title>Neutral theory of cooperators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutualistic interactions are widespread in nature, from plant communities and microbiomes to human organizations. Along with competition for resources, cooperative interactions shape biodiversity and contribute to the robustness of complex ecosystems. We present a stochastic neutral theory of cooperator species. Our model shares with the classic neutral theory of biodiversity the assumption that all species are equivalent, but crucially differs in requiring cooperation between species for replication. With low migration, our model displays a bimodal species-abundance distribution, with a high-abundance mode associated with a core of cooperating species. This core is responsible for maintaining a diverse pool of long-lived species, which are present even at very small migration rates. We derive analytical expressions of the steady-state species abundance distribution, as well as scaling laws for diversity, number of species, and residence times. With high migration, our model recovers the results of classic neutral theory. We briefly discuss implications of our analysis for research on the microbiome, synthetic biology, and the origin of life.</description>

      <title>A strengthened bound on the number of states required to characterize maximum parsimony distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove that the distance $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ between two unrooted binary phylogenetic trees $T_1, T_2$ on the same set of taxa can be defined by a character that is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$ and which has at most $2k$ states. This significantly improves upon the previous bound of $7k-5$ states. We also show that for every $k \geq 1$ there exist two trees $T_1, T_2$ with $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ such that at least $k+1$ states are necessary in any character that achieves this distance and which is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Framework for Imputing Genetic Distances in Spatiotemporal Pathogen Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathogen genome data offers valuable structure for spatial models, but its utility is limited by incomplete sequencing coverage. We propose a probabilistic framework for inferring genetic distances between unsequenced cases and known sequences within defined transmission chains, using time-aware evolutionary distance modeling. The method estimates pairwise divergence from collection dates and observed genetic distances, enabling biologically plausible imputation grounded in observed divergence patterns, without requiring sequence alignment or known transmission chains. Applied to highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5 cases in wild birds in the United States, this approach supports scalable, uncertainty-aware augmentation of genomic datasets and enhances the integration of evolutionary information into spatiotemporal modeling workflows.</description>

      <title>Integrated population model reveals human and environment driven changes in Baltic ringed seal (Pusa hispida botnica) demography and behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated population models (IPMs) are a promising approach to test ecological theories and assess wildlife populations in dynamic and uncertain conditions. By combining multiple data sources into a unified model, they enable the parametrization of versatile, mechanistic models that can predict population dynamics in novel circumstances. Here, we present a Bayesian IPM for the ringed seal (Pusa hispida botnica) population inhabiting the Bothnian Bay in the Baltic Sea. Despite the availability of long-term monitoring data, traditional assessment methods have faltered due to dynamic environmental conditions, varying reproductive rates, and the recently re-introduced hunting, thus limiting the quality of information available to managers. We fit our model to census and various demographic, reproductive, and harvest data from 1988 to 2023 to provide a comprehensive assessment of past population trends, and predict population response to alternative hunting scenarios. We estimated that 20,000 to 36,000 ringed seals inhabited the Bothnian Bay in 2024, increasing at a rate of 3% to 6% per year. Reproductive rates have increased since 1988, leading to a substantial increase in the growth rate up until 2015. However, the re-introduction of hunting has since reduced the growth rate, and even minor quota increases are likely to reduce it further. Our results also support the hypothesis that a greater proportion of the population hauls out under lower ice cover circumstances, leading to higher aerial survey results in such years. In general, our study demonstrates the value of IPMs for monitoring wildlife populations under changing environments, and supporting science-based management decisions.</description>
