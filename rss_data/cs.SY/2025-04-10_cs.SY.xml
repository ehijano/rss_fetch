      <title>Restoring Feasibility in Power Grid Optimization: A Counterfactual ML Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric power grids are essential components of modern life, delivering reliable power to end-users while adhering to a multitude of engineering constraints and requirements. In grid operations, the Optimal Power Flow problem plays a key role in determining cost-effective generator dispatch that satisfies load demands and operational limits. However, due to stressed operating conditions, volatile demand profiles, and increased generation from intermittent energy sources, this optimization problem may become infeasible, posing risks such as voltage instability and line overloads. This study proposes a learning framework that combines machine learning with counterfactual explanations to automatically diagnose and restore feasibility in the OPF problem. Our method provides transparent and actionable insights by methodically identifying infeasible conditions and suggesting minimal demand response actions. We evaluate the proposed approach on IEEE 30-bus and 300-bus systems, demonstrating its capability to recover feasibility with high success rates and generating diverse corrective options, appropriate for real-time decision-making. These preliminary findings illustrate the potential of combining classical optimization with explainable AI techniques to enhance grid reliability and resilience.</description>

      <title>A Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm for Sampling Jeffreys Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference and estimation are fundamental aspects of statistics, system identification and machine learning. For most inference problems, prior knowledge is available on the system to be modeled, and Bayesian analysis is a natural framework to impose such prior information in the form of a prior distribution. However, in many situations, coming out with a fully specified prior distribution is not easy, as prior knowledge might be too vague, so practitioners prefer to use a prior distribution that is as `ignorant' or `uninformative' as possible, in the sense of not imposing subjective beliefs, while still supporting reliable statistical analysis. Jeffreys prior is an appealing uninformative prior because it offers two important benefits: (i) it is invariant under any re-parameterization of the model, (ii) it encodes the intrinsic geometric structure of the parameter space through the Fisher information matrix, which in turn enhances the diversity of parameter samples. Despite these benefits, drawing samples from Jeffreys prior is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a general sampling scheme using the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm that enables sampling of parameter values from Jeffreys prior, and provide numerical illustrations of our approach through several examples.</description>

      <title>Review, Definition and Challenges of Electrical Energy Hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To transition towards a carbon-neutral power system, considerable amounts of renewable energy generation capacity are being installed in the North Sea area. Consequently, projects aggregating many gigawatts of power generation capacity and transmitting renewable energy to the main load centers are being developed. Given the electrical challenges arising from having bulk power capacity in a compact geographical area with several connections to the main grid, and a lack of a robust definition identifying the type of system under study, this paper proposes a general technical definition of such projects introducing the term Electrical Energy Hub (EEH). The concept, purpose, and functionalities of EEHs are introduced in the text, emphasizing the importance of a clear technical definition for future planning procedures, grid codes, regulations, and support schemes for EEHs and multiterminal HVDC (MTDC) grids in general. Furthermore, the unique electrical challenges associated with integrating EEHs into the power system are discussed. Three research areas of concern are identified, namely control, planning, and protection. Through this analysis, insights are provided into the effective implementation of multi-GW scale EEH projects and their integration into the power grid through multiple interconnections. Finally, a list of ongoing and planned grid development projects is evaluated to assess whether they fall within the EEH category</description>

      <title>A Scalable Automatic Model Generation Tool for Cyber-Physical Network Topologies and Data Flows for Large-Scale Synthetic Power Grid Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power grids and their cyber infrastructure are classified as Critical Energy Infrastructure/Information (CEII) and are not publicly accessible. While realistic synthetic test cases for power systems have been developed in recent years, they often lack corresponding cyber network models. This work extends synthetic grid models by incorporating cyber-physical representations. To address the growing need for realistic and scalable models that integrate both cyber and physical layers in electric power systems, this paper presents the Scalable Automatic Model Generation Tool (SAM-GT). This tool enables the creation of large-scale cyber-physical topologies for power system models. The resulting cyber-physical network models include power system switches, routers, and firewalls while accounting for data flows and industrial communication protocols. Case studies demonstrate the tool's application to synthetic grid models of 500, 2,000, and 10,000 buses, considering three distinct network topologies. Results from these case studies include network metrics on critical nodes, hops, and generation times, showcasing effectiveness, adaptability, and scalability of SAM-GT.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Non-Steady-State Frequency-Domain Data in Willems' Fundamental Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Willems' fundamental lemma enables data-driven analysis and control by characterizing an unknown system's behavior directly in terms of measured data. In this work, we extend a recent frequency-domain variant of this result--previously limited to steady-state data--to incorporate non-steady-state data including transient phenomena. This approach eliminates the need to wait for transients to decay during data collection, significantly reducing the experiment duration. Unlike existing frequency-domain system identification methods, our approach integrates transient data without preprocessing, making it well-suited for direct data-driven analysis and control. We demonstrate its effectiveness by isolating transients in the collected data and performing FRF evaluation at arbitrary frequencies in a numerical case study including noise.</description>

      <title>Physical spline for denoising object trajectory data by combining splines, ML feature regression and model knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a method for estimating the dynamic driving states (position, velocity, acceleration and heading) from noisy measurement data. The proposed approach is effective with both complete and partial observations, producing refined trajectory signals with kinematic consistency, ensuring that velocity is the integral of acceleration and position is the integral of velocity. Additionally, the method accounts for the constraint that vehicles can only move in the direction of their orientation. The method is implemented as a configurable python library that also enables trajectory estimation solely based on position data. Regularization is applied to prevent extreme state variations. A key application is enhancing recorded trajectory data for use as reference inputs in machine learning models. At the end, the article presents the results of the method along with a comparison to ground truth data.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Distributed Optimal Control for Linear Networked Systems: An Online Distributed Training Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the distributed optimal control problem for linear networked systems. In particular, we are interested in learning distributed optimal controllers using graph recurrent neural networks (GRNNs). Most of the existing approaches result in centralized optimal controllers with offline training processes. However, as the increasing demand of network resilience, the optimal controllers are further expected to be distributed, and are desirable to be trained in an online distributed fashion, which are also the main contributions of our work. To solve this problem, we first propose a GRNN-based distributed optimal control method, and we cast the problem as a self-supervised learning problem. Then, the distributed online training is achieved via distributed gradient computation, and inspired by the (consensus-based) distributed optimization idea, a distributed online training optimizer is designed. Furthermore, the local closed-loop stability of the linear networked system under our proposed GRNN-based controller is provided by assuming that the nonlinear activation function of the GRNN-based controller is both local sector-bounded and slope-restricted. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations using a specifically developed simulator.</description>

      <title>ZETA: a library for Zonotope-based EsTimation and fAult diagnosis of discrete-time systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ZETA, a new MATLAB library for Zonotope-based EsTimation and fAult diagnosis of discrete-time systems. It features user-friendly implementations of set representations based on zonotopes, namely zonotopes, constrained zonotopes, and line zonotopes, in addition to a basic implementation of interval arithmetic. This library has capabilities starting from the basic set operations with these sets, including propagations through nonlinear functions using various approximation methods. The features of ZETA allow for reachability analysis and state estimation of discrete-time linear, nonlinear, and descriptor systems, in addition to active fault diagnosis of linear systems. Efficient order reduction methods are also implemented for the respective set representations. Some examples are presented in order to illustrate the functionalities of the new library.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Fuzzy Control for Time-Optimal Aggressive Trajectory Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal trajectories that minimize a user-defined cost function in dynamic systems require the solution of a two-point boundary value problem. The optimization process yields an optimal control sequence that depends on the initial conditions and system parameters. However, the optimal sequence may result in undesirable behavior if the system's initial conditions and parameters are erroneous. This work presents a data-driven fuzzy controller synthesis framework that is guided by a time-optimal trajectory for multicopter tracking problems. In particular, we consider an aggressive maneuver consisting of a mid-air flip and generate a time-optimal trajectory by numerically solving the two-point boundary value problem. A fuzzy controller consisting of a stabilizing controller near hover conditions and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controller, trained to mimic the time-optimal aggressive trajectory, is constructed using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy framework.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reachability with Scenario Optimization and the Holdout Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reachability analysis is an important method in providing safety guarantees for systems with unknown or uncertain dynamics. Due to the computational intractability of exact reachability analysis for general nonlinear, high-dimensional systems, recent work has focused on the use of probabilistic methods for computing approximate reachable sets. In this work, we advocate for the use of a general purpose, practical, and sharp method for data-driven reachability: the holdout method. Despite the simplicity of the holdout method, we show -- on several numerical examples including scenario-based reach tubes -- that the resulting probabilistic bounds are substantially sharper and require fewer samples than existing methods for data-driven reachability. Furthermore, we complement our work with a discussion on the necessity of probabilistic reachability bounds. We argue that any method that attempts to de-randomize the bounds, by converting the guarantees to hold deterministically, requires (a) an exponential in state-dimension amount of samples to achieve non-vacuous guarantees, and (b) extra assumptions on the dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin of an Electrical Distribution Grid: SoCal 28-Bus Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an open-access dataset of phasor &amp; waveform measurement units (PMUs/WMUs) of a real-world electrical distribution network. The network consists of diverse sets of generation resources (including solar panels, fuel cells, natural gas generators, and utility interconnections), loads (including large-scale electric vehicle charging, data centers, central cooling, offices), topology changes (such as line outages and load transfers), as well as a mixture of single- and three-phase networks. We describe a densely deployed PMU sensor network in a distribution grid, in which all buses with non-zero power injections are measured. This approach enables a range of applications such as state estimation, system identification, power flow optimization, and feedback control, several of which are discussed in this paper. Additionally, we provide a synchronized waveform dataset which allows the analysis of harmonics, transient events, dynamic grid impedance, and stability. Data collection started in 2023 while new data is generated continuously and made available online. A characterization of measurement error is provided. Finally, we provide circuit topology and parameters as a part of the dataset. Together, the circuit and timeseries data offer an opportunity for researchers to develop and test algorithms on a real-world system.</description>

      <title>Reliability Assessment of Low-Cost PM Sensors under High Humidity and High PM Level Outdoor Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors have become increasingly popular due to their compact size, low power consumption, and cost-effective installation and maintenance. While several studies have explored the effects of meteorological conditions and pollution exposure on low-cost sensor (LCS) performance, few have addressed the combined impact of high PM concentration and high humidity levels. In contrast to most evaluation studies, which generally report $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ levels below $150~\mu\text{g/m}^3$, our study observed hourly average $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentrations ranging from $6-611~\mu\text{g/m}^3$ (mean value of $137~\mu\text{g/m}^3$), with relative humidity between $25-95\%$ (mean value of $72\%$), and temperature varying from $6-29^\circ$C (mean value of $16^\circ$C). We evaluate three LCS models (SPS30, PMS7003, HPMA115C0-004) in outdoor conditions during the winter season in New Delhi, India, deployed alongside a reference-grade beta attenuation monitor (BAM). The results indicate a strong correlation between LCS and BAM measurements (${R^2} &gt; 90\%$). The RMSE increases with increasing PM concentration and humidity levels but the narrow $95\%$ confidence interval range of LCS as a function of the reference BAM suggests the importance of LCS in air pollution monitoring. Among the evaluated LCS models, SPS30 showed the highest overall accuracy. Overall, the study demonstrates that LCS can effectively monitor air quality in regions with high PM and high humidity levels, provided appropriate correction models are applied.</description>

      <title>Learning-Inspired Fuzzy Logic Algorithms for Enhanced Control of Oscillatory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transportation of sensitive equipment often suffers from vibrations caused by terrain, weather, and motion speed, leading to inefficiencies and potential damage. To address this challenge, this paper explores an intelligent control framework leveraging fuzzy logic, a foundational AI technique, to suppress oscillations in suspension systems. Inspired by learning based methodologies, the proposed approach utilizes fuzzy inference and Gaussian membership functions to emulate adaptive, human like decision making. By minimizing the need for explicit mathematical models, the method demonstrates robustness in both linear and nonlinear systems. Experimental validation highlights the controllers ability to adapt to varying suspension lengths, reducing oscillation amplitudes and improving stability under dynamic conditions. This research bridges the gap between traditional control systems and learning inspired techniques, offering a scalable, data efficient solution for modern transportation challenges</description>

      <title>Optimal Duration of Reserve Capacity Ancillary Services for Distributed Energy Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into power systems presents opportunities and challenges for ancillary services (AS) provision. Technical requirements of existing AS (i.e., duration, reliability, ramp rate, and lead time) have been designed for traditional generating units, making their provision by DER aggregates particularly challenging. This paper proposes a method to design the duration of reserve capacity AS products considering the operational constraints of DERs and the temporal dynamics of system imbalances. The optimal product duration is determined by maximizing product availability and aligning the supply profile with the system's balancing needs. We apply the methodology to a realistic Swiss low-voltage network with a diverse DER portfolio. The results reveal that (i) shorter product durations maximize average availability and (ii) long product durations improve the alignment with system balancing needs. This paper offers valuable insights for system operators to design AS products tailored for DER participation.</description>

Abstract: The Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model has been extensively explored and validated, spanning applications in social science, systems and control, game theory, and algorithmic research. In this paper, we introduce an advanced generalization of the FJ model, termed FJ-MM which incorporates both memory effects and multi-hop (higher-order neighbor) influence. This formulation allows agents to naturally incorporate both current and previous opinions at each iteration stage. Our numerical results demonstrate that incorporating memory and multi-hop influence significantly reshapes the opinion landscape; for example, the final opinion profile can exhibit reduced polarization. We analyze the stability and equilibrium properties of the FJ-MM model, showing that these properties can be reduced to those of a comparison model--namely, the standard FJ model with a modified influence matrix. This reduction enables us to leverage established stability results from FJ dynamics. Additionally, we examine the convergence rate of the FJ-MM model and demonstrate that, as can be expected, the time lags introduced by memory and higher-order neighbor influences result in slower convergence.</description>

      <title>Variable Metric Splitting Methods for Neuromorphic Circuits Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a variable metric splitting algorithm to solve the electrical behavior of neuromorphic circuits made of capacitors, memristive elements, and batteries. The gradient property of the memristive elements is exploited to split the current to voltage operator as the sum of the derivative operator, a Riemannian gradient operator, and a nonlinear residual operator that is linearized at each step of the algorithm. The diagonal structure of the three operators makes the variable metric forward-backward splitting algorithm scalable and amenable to the simulation of large-scale neuromorphic circuits.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Koopman Operator-based Economic Model Predictive Control of Shipboard Carbon Capture System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shipboard carbon capture is a promising solution to help reduce carbon emissions in international shipping. In this work, we propose a data-driven dynamic modeling and economic predictive control approach within the Koopman framework. This integrated modeling and control approach is used to achieve safe and energy-efficient process operation of shipboard post-combustion carbon capture plants. Specifically, we propose a deep neural Koopman operator modeling approach, based on which a Koopman model with time-varying model parameters is established. This Koopman model predicts the overall economic operational cost and key system outputs, based on accessible partial state measurements. By leveraging this learned model, a constrained economic predictive control scheme is developed. Despite time-varying parameters involved in the formulated model, the formulated optimization problem associated with the economic predictive control design is convex, and it can be solved efficiently during online control implementations. Extensive tests are conducted on a high-fidelity simulation environment for shipboard post-combustion carbon capture processes. Four ship operational conditions are taken into account. The results show that the proposed method significantly improves the overall economic operational performance and carbon capture rate. Additionally, the proposed method guarantees safe operation by ensuring that hard constraints on the system outputs are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Controlling a Social Network of Individuals with Coevolving Actions and Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a population of individuals who have actions and opinions, which coevolve, mutually influencing one another on a complex network structure. In particular, we formulate a control problem for this social network, in which we assume that we can inject into the network a committed minority -- a set of stubborn nodes -- with the objective of steering the population, initially at a consensus, to a different consensus state. Our study focuses on two main objectives: i) determining the conditions under which the committed minority succeeds in its goal, and ii) identifying the optimal placement for such a committed minority. After deriving general monotone convergence result for the controlled dynamics, we leverage these results to build a computationally-efficient algorithm to solve the first problem and an effective heuristics for the second problem, which we prove to be NP-complete. The proposed methodology is illustrated though academic examples, and demonstrated on a real-world case study.</description>

      <title>LCL Resonance Analysis and Damping in Single-Loop Grid-Forming Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamic phenomenon known as LCL resonance is often neglected when stability analysis is carried out for grid-forming (GFM) control schemes by wind turbine systems, due to its high frequency. This paper shows that this simplification is not always valid for single-loop (SL) control schemes. A detailed small-signal analysis reveals that reactive power (RAP) control significantly influences the resonant modes, which may be dominant in determining overall system stability, even if the resonant frequency is high. The underlying mechanism via which the LCL resonance may dominate the overall system stability is systematically analyzed. Furthermore, various RAP control strategies are compared to assess their different effects on resonant modes. An active damping (AD) strategy favorable for SL-GFM control is then designed. We also provide a comparison between SL-GFM and well-studied grid-following control schemes, highlighting quite different resonance features between them. Finally, case studies associated with a 14-bus, 5-machine IEEE test system are presented. These show that instability originates from the LCL resonance rather than low-frequency interactions among multiple machines, validating the theoretical analysis and the proposed AD strategy.</description>

      <title>BIA Transmission in Rate Splitting-based Optical Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) has recently received massive interest as a new technology that can support the enormous data traffic increasing on daily basis. In particular, laser-based OWC networks can provide terabits per second (Tbps) aggregate data rates. However, the emerging OWC networks require a high number of optical access points (APs), each AP corresponding to an optical cell, to provide uniform coverage for multiple users. Therefore, inter-cell interference (ICI) and multi-user interference (MUI) are crucial issues that must be managed efficiently to provide high spectral efficiency. In radio frequency (RF) networks, rate splitting (RS) is proposed as a transmission scheme to serve multiple users simultaneously following a certain strategy. It was shown that RS provides high data rates compared to orthogonal and non-orthogonal interference management schemes. Considering the high density of OWC networks, the application of RS within each optical cell might not be practical due to severe ICI. In this paper, a new strategy is derived referred to as blind interference alignment-rate splitting (BIA-RS) to fully coordinate the transmission among the optical APs, while determining the precoding matrices of multiple groups of users formed beforehand. Therefore, RS can be implemented within each group to manage MUI. The proposed BIA-RS scheme requires two layers of power allocation to achieve high performance. Given that, a max-min fractional optimization problem is formulated to optimally distribute the power budget among the groups and the messages intended to the users of each group. Finally, a power allocation algorithm is designed with multiple Lagrangian multipliers to provide practical and sub-optimal solutions. The results show the high performance of the proposed scheme compared to other counterpart schemes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of Singularly Perturbed Systems Using a Stabilized Multirate Explicit Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singularly perturbed systems (SPSs) are prevalent in engineering applications, where numerically solving their initial value problems (IVPs) is challenging due to stiffness arising from multiple time scales. Classical explicit methods require impractically small time steps for stability, while implicit methods developed for SPSs are computationally intensive and less efficient for strongly nonlinear systems. This paper introduces a Stabilized Multirate Explicit Scheme (SMES) that stabilizes classical explicit methods without the need for small time steps or implicit formulations. By employing a multirate approach with variable time steps, SMES allows the fast dynamics to rapidly converge to their equilibrium manifold while slow dynamics evolve with larger steps. Analysis shows that SMES achieves numerical stability with significantly reduced computational effort and controlled error. Its effectiveness is illustrated with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>User-Centered Insights into Assistive Navigation Technologies for Individuals with Visual Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigational challenges significantly impact the independence and mobility of Individuals with Visual Impairment (IVI). While numerous assistive technologies exist, their adoption remains limited due to usability challenges, financial constraints, and a lack of alignment with user needs. This study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining structured surveys and virtual workshops with 19 IVI to investigate their experiences, needs, and preferences regarding assistive technologies for navigation and daily living. The survey results provide insights into participants technological competence, preferences for assistive devices, and willingness to adopt new solutions. In parallel, workshop discussions offer qualitative perspectives on key navigation challenges, including difficulties in detecting overhead obstacles, navigating environments with complex layout, and the limitations of existing technologies. Findings highlight the need for assistive devices that integrate both navigational guidance and high-level spatial awareness, allowing users to build mental maps of their surroundings. Additionally, multimodal feedback, combining audio, haptic, and tactile cues, emerges as a crucial feature to accommodate diverse user preferences and environmental conditions. The study also underscores financial and training barriers that limit access to advanced assistive technologies. Based on these insights, we recommend the development of customizable, user-friendly, and most importantly affordable navigation aids that align with the daily needs of IVI. The findings from this study provide guidance for technology developers, researchers, and policymakers working toward more inclusive and effective assistive solutions.</description>

      <title>DBaS-Log-MPPI: Efficient and Safe Trajectory Optimization via Barrier States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing trajectory costs for nonlinear control systems remains a significant challenge. Model Predictive Control (MPC), particularly sampling-based approaches such as the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) method, has recently demonstrated considerable success by leveraging parallel computing to efficiently evaluate numerous trajectories. However, MPPI often struggles to balance safe navigation in constrained environments with effective exploration in open spaces, leading to infeasibility in cluttered conditions. To address these limitations, we propose DBaS-Log-MPPI, a novel algorithm that integrates Discrete Barrier States (DBaS) to ensure safety while enabling adaptive exploration with enhanced feasibility. Our method is efficiently validated through three simulation missions and one real-world experiment, involving a 2D quadrotor and a ground vehicle navigating through cluttered obstacles. We demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses both Vanilla MPPI and Log-MPPI, achieving higher success rates, lower tracking errors, and a conservative average speed.</description>

      <title>Solving Power System Problems using Adiabatic Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework that reformulates existing power system problems into a format executable on quantum annealers. The proposed framework accommodates both normal and complex numbers and enables efficient handling of large-scale problems, thus ensuring broad applicability across power system problems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its applicability in two classical problems: (i) power system parameter identification, where we estimate the admittance matrix given voltage and current measurements, and (ii) power flow analysis, where we reformulate the nonlinear equations governing active and reactive power balance. The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently solves both linear and nonlinear power system problems, and thus offers significant advantages in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges, such as ill-conditioned systems and fault conditions.</description>

      <title>Holistic Fusion: Task- and Setup-Agnostic Robot Localization and State Estimation with Factor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seamless operation of mobile robots in challenging environments requires low-latency local motion estimation (e.g., dynamic maneuvers) and accurate global localization (e.g., wayfinding). While most existing sensor-fusion approaches are designed for specific scenarios, this work introduces a flexible open-source solution for task- and setup-agnostic multimodal sensor fusion that is distinguished by its generality and usability. Holistic Fusion formulates sensor fusion as a combined estimation problem of i) the local and global robot state and ii) a (theoretically unlimited) number of dynamic context variables, including automatic alignment of reference frames; this formulation fits countless real-world applications without any conceptual modifications. The proposed factor-graph solution enables the direct fusion of an arbitrary number of absolute, local, and landmark measurements expressed with respect to different reference frames by explicitly including them as states in the optimization and modeling their evolution as random walks. Moreover, local smoothness and consistency receive particular attention to prevent jumps in the robot state belief. HF enables low-latency and smooth online state estimation on typical robot hardware while simultaneously providing low-drift global localization at the IMU measurement rate. The efficacy of this released framework is demonstrated in five real-world scenarios on three robotic platforms, each with distinct task requirements.</description>

      <title>NAPER: Fault Protection for Real-Time Resource-Constrained Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault tolerance in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deployed on resource-constrained systems presents unique challenges for high-accuracy applications with strict timing requirements. Memory bit-flips can severely degrade DNN accuracy, while traditional protection approaches like Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) often sacrifice accuracy to maintain reliability, creating a three-way dilemma between reliability, accuracy, and timeliness. We introduce NAPER, a novel protection approach that addresses this challenge through ensemble learning. Unlike conventional redundancy methods, NAPER employs heterogeneous model redundancy, where diverse models collectively achieve higher accuracy than any individual model. This is complemented by an efficient fault detection mechanism and a real-time scheduler that prioritizes meeting deadlines by intelligently scheduling recovery operations without interrupting inference. Our evaluations demonstrate NAPER's superiority: 40% faster inference in both normal and fault conditions, maintained accuracy 4.2% higher than TMR-based strategies, and guaranteed uninterrupted operation even during fault recovery. NAPER effectively balances the competing demands of accuracy, reliability, and timeliness in real-time DNN applications</description>

      <title>Setup-Invariant Augmented Reality for Teaching by Demonstration with Surgical Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) is an effective tool in robotic surgery education as it combines exploratory learning with three-dimensional guidance. However, existing AR systems require expert supervision and do not account for differences in the mentor and mentee robot configurations. To enable novices to train outside the operating room while receiving expert-informed guidance, we present dV-STEAR: an open-source system that plays back task-aligned expert demonstrations without assuming identical setup joint positions between expert and novice. Pose estimation was rigorously quantified, showing a registration error of 3.86 (SD=2.01)mm. In a user study (N=24), dV-STEAR significantly improved novice performance on tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. In a single-handed ring-over-wire task, dV-STEAR increased completion speed (p=0.03) and reduced collision time (p=0.01) compared to dry-lab training alone. During a pick-and-place task, it improved success rates (p=0.004). Across both tasks, participants using dV-STEAR exhibited significantly more balanced hand use and reported lower frustration levels. This work presents a novel educational tool implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, demonstrates its effectiveness in teaching novices, and builds the foundation for further AR integration into robot-assisted surgery.</description>

      <title>Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems under Weather and Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by variable renewable energy technologies. However, renewable electricity generation from wind and solar technologies, as well as electricity demand, varies with the weather. This work addresses the problem of determining optimal capacities for renewable technologies in energy systems that ensure sufficient electricity supply when dealing with multi-year time-series data. An iterative algorithm is proposed that starts by optimising an arbitrary starting time-series, followed by adding additional constraints and reoptimising the modified optimisation problem until sufficient energy supply is provided for all time--series, i.e. the solution is robust to weather and demand variations. This is evaluated in a computational study on a German energy system model.The results show that the iterative algorithm finds robust solutions for an increase of 2-2.5% in total annual cost for a simplified model in gurobipy and 2.9% for a model built in the model framework ETHOS.FINE. Testing the feasibility for non robust solutions showed that supply gaps occurred in at least some of the remaining years. Based on the results of this work, ensuring feasibility within an energy system model for multiple time-series boils down to two factors: ensuring sufficient back-up capacity to overcome periods of high demand combined with low electricity generation from wind and photovoltaic, and enforcing sufficient total annual electricity generation. Our proposed open source iterative algorithm is able to ensure this. For general modelling, it is recommended to check for systematic effects of different years' time--series on energy system models especially for wind, but also for photovoltaics, include dark lull and cold period effects on generation and demand in time--series, and assess the feasibility of energy system models using different time-series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.</description>

      <title>Parametric Reachable Sets Via Controlled Dynamical Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new framework for reachable set computation through continuous evolution of a set of parameters and offsets which define a parametope, through the intersection of constraints. This results in a dynamical approach towards nonlinear reachability analysis: a single trajectory of an embedding system provides a parametope reachable set for the original system, and uncertainties are accounted for through continuous parameter evolution. This is dual to most existing computational strategies, which define sets through some combination of generator vectors, and usually discretize the system dynamics. We show how, under some regularity assumptions of the dynamics and the set considered, any desired parameter evolution can be accommodated as long as the offset dynamics are set accordingly, providing a virtual "control input" for reachable set computation. In a special case of the theory, we demonstrate how closing the loop for the parameter dynamics using the adjoint of the linearization results in a desirable first-order cancellation of the original system dynamics. Using interval arithmetic in JAX, we demonstrate the efficiency and utility of reachable parametope computation through two numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: Fuzzy logic is an accepted and well-developed approach for constructing verbal models. Fuzzy based methods are getting more popular, while the engineers deal with more daily life tasks. This paper presents a new Python toolkit for Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (IT2FLS). Developing software tools is an important issue for facilitating the practical use of theoretical results. There are limited tools for implementing IT2FLSs in Python. The developed PyIT2FLS is providing a set of tools for fast and easy modeling of fuzzy systems. This paper includes a brief description of how developed toolkit can be used. Also, three examples are given showing the usage of the developed toolkit for simulating IT2FLSs. First, a simple rule-based system is developed and it's codes are presented in the paper. The second example is the prediction of the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series using IT2FLS. In this example, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for determining system parameters while minimizing the mean square error. In the last example, an IT2FPID is designed and used for controlling a linear time-delay system. The code for the examples are available on toolkit's GitHub page: https://github.com/Haghrah/PyIT2FLS. The simulations and their results confirm the ability of the developed toolkit to be used in a wide range of the applications.</description>

      <title>A Crosstalk-Aware Timing Prediction Method in Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With shrinking interconnect spacing in advanced technology nodes, existing timing predictions become less precise due to the challenging quantification of crosstalk-induced delay. During the routing, the crosstalk effect is typically modeled by predicting coupling capacitance with congestion information. However, the timing estimation tends to be overly pessimistic, as the crosstalk-induced delay depends not only on the coupling capacitance but also on the signal arrival time. This work presents a crosstalk-aware timing estimation method using a two-step machine learning approach. Interconnects that are physically adjacent and overlap in signal timing windows are filtered first. Crosstalk delay is predicted by integrating physical topology and timing features without relying on post-routing results and the parasitic extraction. Experimental results show a match rate of over 99% for identifying crosstalk nets compared to the commercial tool on the OpenCores benchmarks, with prediction results being more accurate than those of other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Deep Generative Learning Approach for Two-stage Adaptive Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-stage adaptive robust optimization (ARO) is a powerful approach for planning under uncertainty, balancing first-stage decisions with recourse decisions made after uncertainty is realized. To account for uncertainty, modelers typically define a simple uncertainty set over which potential outcomes are considered. However, classical methods for defining these sets unintentionally capture a wide range of unrealistic outcomes, resulting in overly-conservative and costly planning in anticipation of unlikely contingencies. In this work, we introduce AGRO, a solution algorithm that performs adversarial generation for two-stage adaptive robust optimization using a variational autoencoder. AGRO generates high-dimensional contingencies that are simultaneously adversarial and realistic, improving the robustness of first-stage decisions at a lower planning cost than standard methods. To ensure generated contingencies lie in high-density regions of the uncertainty distribution, AGRO defines a tight uncertainty set as the image of "latent" uncertainty sets under the VAE decoding transformation. Projected gradient ascent is then used to maximize recourse costs over the latent uncertainty sets by leveraging differentiable optimization methods. We demonstrate the cost-efficiency of AGRO by applying it to both a synthetic production-distribution problem and a real-world power system expansion setting. We show that AGRO outperforms the standard column-and-constraint algorithm by up to 1.8% in production-distribution planning and up to 11.6% in power system expansion.</description>

      <title>Distribution Grids May Be a Barrier To Residential Electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replacing fossil-fueled appliances and vehicles with electric alternatives can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in many settings. However, residential electrification can also raise electricity demand beyond the safe limits of electrical infrastructure. This can increase the risk of blackouts or require grid reinforcement that is often slow and expensive. Here, we estimate the physical and economic impacts on distribution grids of electrifying all housing and personal vehicles in each county of the lower 48 United States. We find that space heating is the main driver of grid impacts, with the coldest regions seeing demand peaks up to five times higher than today's peaks. Accommodating electrification of all housing and personal vehicles is estimated to require 600 GW of distribution grid reinforcement nationally, at a cost of \$350 to \$790 billion, or \$2,800 to \$6,400 per household (95% confidence intervals). However, demand-side management could eliminate three-quarters of grid reinforcement costs.</description>

      <title>Inverter Output Impedance Estimation in Power Networks: A Variable Direction Forgetting Recursive-Least-Square Algorithm Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As inverter-based loads and energy sources become increasingly prevalent, accurate estimation of line impedance between inverters and the grid is essential for optimizing performance and enhancing control strategies. This paper presents a non-invasive method for estimating output-line impedance using measurements local to the inverter. It provides a specific method for signal conditioning of signals measured at the inverter, which makes the measured data better suited to estimation algorithms. An algorithm based on the Variable Direction Forgetting Recursive Least Squares (VDF-RLS) method is introduced, which leverages these conditioned signals for precise impedance estimation. The signal conditioning process transforms measurements into the direct-quadrature (dq) coordinate frame, where the rotating frame frequency is determined to facilitate a simpler and more accurate estimation. This frequency is implemented using a secondary Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to attenuate grid voltage measurement variations. By isolating the variation-sensitive q-axis and relying solely on the less sensitive d-axis, the method further minimizes the impact of variations. The VDF-RLS estimation method achieves rapid adaptation while ensuring stability in the absence of persistent excitation by selectively discarding outdated data during updates. Proposed conditioning and estimation methods are non-invasive; estimations are solely done using measured outputs, and no signal is injected into the power network. Simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement in impedance estimation stability, particularly in low-excitation conditions, where the VDF-RLS method achieves more than three time lower error compared to existing approaches such as constant forgetting RLS and the Kalman filter.</description>

      <title>Control Node Placement and Structural Controllability of Water Quality Dynamics in Drinking Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chlorine, the most widely used disinfectant, needs to be adequately distributed in water distribution networks (WDNs) to maintain consistent residual levels and ensure water safety. This is performed through control node injections at the treatment plant via booster stations scattered in WDNs. While previous studies have applied various optimization metrics for booster station placement, many have failed to consider the coverage of the station injections and the dynamic nature of WDNs. In particular, variations in hydraulics and demand significantly impact the reachability and efficacy of chlorine injections which then impact optimal placement of booster stations. This study introduces a novel formulation that combines control- and graph-theoretic approaches to solve the booster station placement problem. Unlike traditional methods, our approach emphasizes maximizing the system's ability to control disinfectant levels with minimal energy, taking into account the time-varying hydraulic profiles that lead to different optimal station placements. We propose a simple weighting technique to determine the placements by assessing the structural controllability of each configuration, based on the network's topology and independent of specific parameters like decay rates or pipe roughness. This method ensures effective chlorine coverage across the network. Our approach is validated on different networks, demonstrating its operational effectiveness, scalability, and practicality.</description>

      <title>Zero-Order Control Barrier Functions for Sampled-Data Systems with State and Input Dependent Safety Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel zero-order control barrier function (ZOCBF) for sampled-data systems to ensure system safety. Our formulation generalizes conventional control barrier functions and straightforwardly handles safety constraints with high-relative degrees or those that explicitly depend on both system states and inputs. The proposed ZOCBF condition does not require any differentiation operation. Instead, it involves computing the difference of the ZOCBF values at two consecutive sampling instants. We propose three numerical approaches to enforce the ZOCBF condition, tailored to different problem settings and available computational resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a collision avoidance example and a rollover prevention example on uneven terrains.</description>

Abstract: We tackle the problem of providing closed-loop stability guarantees with a scalable data-driven design. We combine virtual reference feedback tuning with dissipativity constraints on the controller for closed-loop stability. The constraints are formulated as a set of linear inequalities in the frequency domain. This leads to a convex problem that is scalable with respect to the length of the data and the complexity of the controller. An extension of virtual reference feedback tuning to include disturbance dynamics is also discussed. The proposed data-driven control design is illustrated by a soft gripper impedance control example.</description>

Abstract: Frequency-domain representations are crucial for the design and performance evaluation of controllers in multirate systems, specifically to address intersample performance. The aim of this paper is to develop an effective frequency-domain system identification technique for closed-loop multirate systems using solely slow-rate output measurements. By indirect identification of multivariable time-invariant representations through lifting, in combination with local modeling techniques, the multirate system is effectively identified. The developed method is capable of accurate identification of closed-loop multirate systems within a single identification experiment, using fast-rate excitation and inputs, and slow-rate outputs. Finally, the developed framework is validated using a benchmark problem consisting of a multivariable dual-stage actuator from a hard disk drive, demonstrating its applicability and accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a low power, low cost transceiver architecture to implement radar-on-a-chip. The transceiver comprises of a full ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter and a full UWB band receiver. A design methodology to maximize the tuning range of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is presented. At the transmitter side, a sub-harmonic mixer is used for signal up-conversion. The receiver low noise amplifier (LNA) has a 2 to 6 GHz input matching bandwidth with a power gain of 9 dB and a noise figure of 2.5 dB. The transceiver is implemented in Cadence EDA tools using 65nm CMOS technology. The system achieves a total dc power consumption of 50 mW. Good noise figure performance; good wide-band matching; gain; high level of integration; low power; low cost of the proposed UWB radar transceiver front-end make it a highly competitive SoC solution for low power UWB transceivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes an anti-disturbance control scheme for rotor drones to counteract voltage drop (VD) disturbance caused by voltage drop of the battery, which is a common case for long-time flight or aggressive maneuvers. Firstly, the refined dynamics of rotor drones considering VD disturbance are presented. Based on the dynamics, a voltage drop observer (VDO) is developed to accurately estimate the VD disturbance by decoupling the disturbance and state information of the drone, reducing the conservativeness of conventional disturbance observers. Subsequently, the control scheme integrates the VDO within the translational loop and a fixed-time sliding mode observer (SMO) within the rotational loop, enabling it to address force and torque disturbances caused by voltage drop of the battery. Sufficient real flight experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under VD disturbance.</description>

      <title>Learning Flatness-Preserving Residuals for Pure-Feedback Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study residual dynamics learning for differentially flat systems, where a nominal model is augmented with a learned correction term from data. A key challenge is that generic residual parameterizations may destroy flatness, limiting the applicability of flatness-based planning and control methods. To address this, we propose a framework for learning flatness-preserving residual dynamics in systems whose nominal model admits a pure-feedback form. We show that residuals with a lower-triangular structure preserve both the flatness of the system and the original flat outputs. Moreover, we provide a constructive procedure to recover the flatness diffeomorphism of the augmented system from that of the nominal model. We then introduce a learning algorithm that fits such residuals from trajectory data using smooth function approximators. Our approach is validated in simulation on a 2D quadrotor subject to unmodeled aerodynamic effects. We demonstrate that the resulting learned flat model enables tracking performance comparable to nonlinear model predictive control ($5\times$ lower tracking error than the nominal flat model) while also achieving over a $20\times$ speedup in computation.</description>

      <title>A Control-Oriented Simplified Single Particle Model with Grouped Parameter and Sensitivity Analysis for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in transportation, energy storage, and consumer electronics, driving the need for reliable battery management systems (BMS) for state estimation and control. The Single Particle Model (SPM) balances computational efficiency and accuracy but faces challenges in parameter estimation due to numerous parameters. Current SPM models using parabolic approximation introduce intermediate variables and hard to do parameter grouping. This study presents a control-oriented SPM reformulation that employs parameter grouping and parabolic approximation to simplify model parameters while using average and surface lithium-ion concentrations as model output. By parameter grouping, the original 17 parameters were reduced to 9 grouped parameters. The reformulated model achieves a reduced-order ordinary differential equation form while maintaining mathematical accuracy equivalent to the pre-grouped discretized SPM. Through Sobol sensitivity analysis under various current profiles, the grouped parameters were reduced from 9 to 6 highly sensitive parameters. Results demonstrate that estimating these 6 parameters achieves comparable practical accuracy to estimating all 9 parameters, with faster convergence. This control-oriented SPM enhances BMS applications by facilitating state estimation and control while reducing parameter estimation requirements.</description>

      <title>On the Loewner framework, the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, and the curse of dimensionality</title>

Abstract: The Loewner framework is an interpolatory approach for the approximation of linear and nonlinear systems. The purpose here is to extend this framework to linear parametric systems with an arbitrary number n of parameters. To achieve this, a new generalized multivariate rational function realization is proposed. Then, we introduce the n-dimensional multivariate Loewner matrices and show that they can be computed by solving a set of coupled Sylvester equations. The null space of these Loewner matrices allows the construction of the multivariate barycentric rational function. The principal result of this work is to show how the null space of the n-dimensional Loewner matrix can be computed using a sequence of 1-dimensional Loewner matrices, leading to a drastic reduction of the computational burden. Equally importantly, this burden is alleviated by avoiding the explicit construction of large-scale n-dimensional Loewner matrices of size $N \times N$. Instead, the proposed methodology achieves decoupling of variables, leading to (i) a complexity reduction from $O(N^3)$ to below $O(N^{1.5})$ when $n &gt; 5$ and (ii) to memory storage bounded by the largest variable dimension rather than their product, thus taming the curse of dimensionality and making the solution scalable to very large data sets. This decoupling of the variables leads to a result similar to the Kolmogorov superposition theorem for rational functions. Thus, making use of barycentric representations, every multivariate rational function can be computed using the composition and superposition of single-variable functions. Finally, we suggest two algorithms (one direct and one iterative) to construct, directly from data, multivariate (or parametric) realizations ensuring (approximate) interpolation. Numerical examples highlight the effectiveness and scalability of the method.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Regret for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear-Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17226v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions, where states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent but volatilities of the state processes depend on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</description>

      <title>A Novel Massive Random Access in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems for High-Speed Mobility with OTFS Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the research of next-generation wireless communication technologies, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is emerging as a promising technique for high-speed mobile environments due to its superior efficiency and robustness in doubly selective channels. Additionally, the cell-free architecture, which eliminates the issues associated with cell boundaries, offers broader coverage for radio access networks. By combining cell-free network architecture with OTFS modulation, the system may meet the demands of massive random access required by machine-type communication devices in high-speed scenarios. This paper explores a massive random access scheme based on OTFS modulation within a cell-free architecture. A transceiver model for uplink OTFS signals involving multiple access points (APs) is developed, where channel estimation with fractional channel parameters is approximated as a block sparse matrix recovery problem. Building on existing superimposed and embedded preamble schemes, a hybrid preamble scheme is proposed. This scheme leverages superimposed and embedded preambles to respectively achieve rough and accurate active user equipment (UEs) detection (AUD), as well as precise channel estimation, under the condition of supporting a large number of access UEs. Moreover, this study introduces a generalized approximate message passing and pattern coupling sparse Bayesian learning with Laplacian prior (GAMP-PCSBL-La) algorithm, which effectively captures block sparse features after discrete cosine transform (DCT), delivering precise estimation results with reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and provides superior performance compared to other existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Approximate Feedback Nash Equilibria with Sparse Inter-Agent Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feedback Nash equilibrium strategies in multi-agent dynamic games require availability of all players' state information to compute control actions. However, in real-world scenarios, sensing and communication limitations between agents make full state feedback expensive or impractical, and such strategies can become fragile when state information from other agents is inaccurate. To this end, we propose a regularized dynamic programming approach for finding sparse feedback policies that selectively depend on the states of a subset of agents in dynamic games. The proposed approach solves convex adaptive group Lasso problems to compute sparse policies approximating Nash equilibrium solutions. We prove the regularized solutions' asymptotic convergence to a neighborhood of Nash equilibrium policies in linear-quadratic (LQ) games. Further, we extend the proposed approach to general non-LQ games via an iterative algorithm. Simulation results in multi-robot interaction scenarios show that the proposed approach effectively computes feedback policies with varying sparsity levels. When agents have noisy observations of other agents' states, simulation results indicate that the proposed regularized policies consistently achieve lower costs than standard Nash equilibrium policies by up to 77% for all interacting agents whose costs are coupled with other agents' states.</description>

      <title>Symmetrizable systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transforming an asymmetric system into a symmetric system makes it possible to exploit the simplifying properties of symmetry in control problems. We define and characterize the family of symmetrizable systems, which can be transformed into symmetric systems by a linear transformation of their inputs and outputs. In the special case of complete symmetry, the set of symmetrizable systems is convex and verifiable by a semidefinite program. We show that a Khatri-Rao rank needs to be satisfied for a system to be symmetrizable and conclude that linear systems are generically neither symmetric nor symmetrizable.</description>

      <title>Task-Parameter Nexus: Task-Specific Parameter Learning for Model-Based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Task-Parameter Nexus (TPN), a learning-based approach for online determination of the (near-)optimal control parameters of model-based controllers (MBCs) for tracking tasks. In TPN, a deep neural network is introduced to predict the control parameters for any given tracking task at runtime, especially when optimal parameters for new tasks are not immediately available. To train this network, we constructed a trajectory bank with various speeds and curvatures that represent different motion characteristics. Then, for each trajectory in the bank, we auto-tune the optimal control parameters offline and use them as the corresponding ground truth. With this dataset, the TPN is trained by supervised learning. We evaluated the TPN on the quadrotor platform. In simulation experiments, it is shown that the TPN can predict near-optimal control parameters for a spectrum of tracking tasks, demonstrating its robust generalization capabilities to unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>A Centralized Planning and Distributed Execution Method for Shape Filling with Homogeneous Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nature has inspired humans in different ways. The formation behavior of animals can perform tasks that exceed individual capability. For example, army ants could transverse gaps by forming bridges, and fishes could group up to protect themselves from predators. The pattern formation task is essential in a multiagent robotic system because it usually serves as the initial configuration of downstream tasks, such as collective manipulation and adaptation to various environments. The formation of complex shapes, especially hollow shapes, remains an open question. Traditional approaches either require global coordinates for each robot or are prone to failure when attempting to close the hole due to accumulated localization errors. Inspired by the ribbon idea introduced in the additive self-assembly algorithm by the Kilobot team, we develop a two-stage algorithm that does not require global coordinates information and effectively forms shapes with holes. In this paper, we investigate the partitioning of the shape using ribbons in a hexagonal lattice setting and propose the add-subtract algorithm based on the movement sequence induced by the ribbon structure. This advancement opens the door to tasks requiring complex pattern formations, such as the assembly of nanobots for medical applications involving intricate structures and the deployment of robots along the boundaries of areas of interest. We also provide simulation results on complex shapes, an analysis of the robustness as well as a proof of correctness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Robo-taxi Fleet Coordination at Scale via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fleets of robo-taxis offering on-demand transportation services, commonly known as Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, hold significant promise for societal benefits, such as reducing pollution, energy consumption, and urban congestion. However, orchestrating these systems at scale remains a critical challenge, with existing coordination algorithms often failing to exploit the systems' full potential. This work introduces a novel decision-making framework that unites mathematical modeling with data-driven techniques. In particular, we present the AMoD coordination problem through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework that exploits the main strengths of graph representation learning, reinforcement learning, and classical operations research tools. Extensive evaluations across diverse simulation fidelities and scenarios demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, achieving superior system performance, computational efficiency, and generalizability compared to prior methods. Finally, motivated by the need to democratize research efforts in this area, we release publicly available benchmarks, datasets, and simulators for network-level coordination alongside an open-source codebase designed to provide accessible simulation platforms and establish a standardized validation process for comparing methodologies.
