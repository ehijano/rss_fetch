      <title>Weighted sums of Lucas numbers of the first and second kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the \textit{Fibonacci Quarterly} in 1964, C.~R.~Wall gave the following weighted sum of generalized Fibonacci numbers: $\sum_{i=1}^n i G_i = n G_{n+2} - G_{n+3} + G_3$, where $\left(G_n\right)_{n \geq 0}$ is defined by the recurrence $G_n = G_{n-1} + G_{n-2}$ with fixed $G_0, G_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we generalize Wall's result to the Lucas sequences of the first and second kind, $\left(U_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$ and $\left(V_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$, and give closed forms for $\sum_{i=1}^n i U_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i V_i$ by using Abel's summation by parts method. Moreover, we provide concrete applications, not only recovering the known weighted sums $\sum_{i=1}^n i F_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n i L_i$ of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, respectively, but also add new identities to the literature for eight well-known sequences. In particular, we give closed forms for weighted sums of Lucas sequences of the first kind such as the Pell, balancing, Jacobstahl, and Mersenne numbers, and also Lucas sequences of the second kind such as the companion Pell, double Lucas-balancing, Jacobstahl-Lucas, and Mersenne-Lucas numbers.</description>

      <title>Cubic points on dynamical modular curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the family of dynamical modular curves associated to quadratic polynomial maps and determine precisely which of these curves have infinitely many cubic points. We use this to prove a classification statement on preperiodic points for quadratic polynomials over cubic fields, extending previous work of Poonen, Faber, and the first author and Krumm.</description>

      <title>Trito-non-ordinary Iwasawa theory of diagonal cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to introduce and study the Euler system of signed diagonal cycles associated with a trito-non-ordinary triple product of the form $f^B \times g^B \times \mathbf{h}^B$, where $f^B$ (resp. $g^B$) is a $p$-ordinary (resp. non-ordinary) eigenform on an indefinite quaternion algebra $B_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ of weight $2$, and $\mathbf{h}^B$ is a primitive Hida ($p$-ordinary) family. When $B=\mathrm{M}_2(\mathbb{Q})$ is split and $\mathbf{h}=\mathbf{h}^B$ has CM by an imaginary quadratic field, this allows us to develop the signed anticyclotomic Iwasawa theory for the base change $\mathrm{BC}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\pi_f)\times \mathrm{BC}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\pi_g)\times \psi$, where $\psi$ is a Hecke character of $K$. We formulate a signed Perrin-Riou-style Iwasawa main conjecture in this setting, and obtain a result on one inclusion in this conjecture. Our methods also allow us to extend Hsieh's construction of the balanced triple-product $p$-adic $L$-function to the trito-non-ordinary scenario, and to define its signed counterparts.</description>

      <title>A number-theoretic conjecture implying faster algorithms for polynomial factorization and integer factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fastest known algorithm for factoring a degree $n$ univariate polynomial over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ runs in time $O(n^{3/2 + o(1)}\text{polylog } q)$, and there is a reason to believe that the $3/2$ exponent represents a ''barrier'' inherent in algorithms that employ a so-called baby-steps-giant-steps strategy. In this paper, we propose a new strategy with the potential to overcome the $3/2$ barrier. In doing so we are led to a number-theoretic conjecture, one form of which is that there are sets $S, T$ of cardinality $n^\beta$, consisting of positive integers of magnitude at most $\exp(n^\alpha)$, such that every integer $i \in [n]$ divides $s-t$ for some $s \in S, t \in T$. Achieving $\alpha + \beta \le 1 + o(1)$ is trivial; we show that achieving $\alpha, \beta &lt; 1/2$ (together with an assumption that $S, T$ are structured) implies an improvement to the exponent 3/2 for univariate polynomial factorization. Achieving $\alpha = \beta = 1/3$ is best-possible and would imply an exponent 4/3 algorithm for univariate polynomial factorization. Interestingly, a second consequence would be a reduction of the current-best exponent for deterministic (exponential) algorithms for factoring integers, from $1/5$ to $1/6$.</description>

      <title>Uniform bounds and uncertainty for asymptotics of representations of $p$-adic ${\rm GL}_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two results on the growth of dimensions of fixed vectors of representations $\pi$ of $p$-adic ${\rm GL}_N$ under principal congruence subgroups: First, a uniform bound on the growth of fixed vectors in terms of the GK-dimension $\pi$, which we extend to a uniform bound on the Harish-Chandra--Howe coefficients. Second, for $\pi$ unitary, a quantitative relationship between the GK-dimension of $\pi$ and the rate of decay of its matrix coefficients. These results are independent of one another and proved in the framework of the Langlands and Zelevinsky classifications.</description>

      <title>$q$-analogs of rational numbers: from Ostrowski numeration systems to perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the $q$-deformation of rational numbers introduced recently by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko. We propose three enumerative interpretations of these $q$-rationals: in terms of a new version of Ostrowski's numeration system for integers, in terms of order ideals of fence posets and in terms of perfect matchings of snake graphs. Contrary to previous results which are restricted to rational numbers greater than one, our interpretations work for all positive rational numbers and are based on a single combinatorial object for defining both the numerator and denominator. The proofs rest on order-preserving bijections between posets over these objects. We recover a formula for a $q$-analog of Markoff numbers. We also deduce a fourth interpretation given in terms of the integer points inside a polytope in $\mathbb{R}^k$ on both sides of a hyperplane where $k$ is the length of the continued fraction expansion.</description>

      <title>Gluing sheaves along Harder-Narasimhan strata of $\mathrm{Bun}_G$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe how to glue prime-to-$p$ torsion sheaves along Harder-Narasimhan strata of Fargues-Scholze's $\mathrm{Bun}_G$ in terms of the cohomology of locally closed strata inside the smooth charts $\mathcal{M}_b \to \mathrm{Bun}_G$ constructed in [FS21], which are moduli of certain split parabolic bundles. Our computations for $G=\operatorname{GL}_2$ explicitly describe images of geometric constant term functors when restricted to a distinguished point inside $\mathrm{Bun}_{T_{\{b\}}}$, where $T_{\{b\}}$ is the split inner form of the Levi quotient of the corresponding parabolic subgroup $P_b$.</description>

      <title>Injectivity failure in crystalline comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For smooth affine varieties in positive characteristic, we identify a slope obstruction to the injectivity of the comparison morphism from rigid cohomology to rationalised crystalline cohomology. This yields a negative answer to a question of Esnault--Kisin--Petrov concerning the injectivity of the de Rham-to-crystalline comparison map for smooth affine schemes over the Witt vectors that admit good compactifications. In contrast, we establish injectivity for certain subspaces defined by slope conditions as well as in cohomological degree one. For the latter case, we also prove the result with coefficients in $F$-able overholonomic $D$-modules leveraging a generalisation of Kedlaya's full faithfulness theorem. Beyond injectivity, we obtain various separation results for the affinoid topology on rigid and convergent cohomology. These results allow us to determine integral algebraic de Rham cohomology modulo torsion and to provide a more conceptual explanation for Ertl and Shiho's construction of varieties for which integral Monsky--Washnitzer cohomology modulo torsion is not finitely generated. Along the way, we prove a new integral comparison theorem between Monsky--Washnitzer cohomology and algebraic de Rham cohomology and we define fractional $p$-adic Tate twists, computing non-integral slopes of crystalline cohomology.</description>

      <title>Bloch-Beilinson conjectures for Hecke characters and Eisenstein cohomology of Picard surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider certain families of Hecke characters $\phi$ over a quadratic imaginary field $F$. According to the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures, the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(\phi,s)$ at the central point $s=-1$ should be equal to the dimension of the space of extensions of the Tate motive $\mathbb{Q}(1)$ by the motive associated with $\phi$. In this article, we construct candidates for the corresponding extensions of Hodge structures, assuming that the sign of the functional equation of $L(\phi,s)$ is $-1$. This is accomplished through the cohomology of variations of Hodge structures over Picard modular surfaces associated with $F$ and Harder's theory of Eisenstein cohomology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these extensions are naturally realized within certain biextensions. We outline a program to compute the biextension height and utilize it to establish the non-triviality of these extensions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we completely solve a simple quartic family of Thue equations over $\mathbb{C}(T)$. Specifically, we apply the ABC-Theorem to find all solutions $(x,y) \in \mathbb{C}[T] \times \mathbb{C}[T]$ to the set of Thue equations $F_{\lambda}(X,Y) = \xi$, where $\xi \in \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ and \begin{equation*} F_{\lambda}(X,Y):=X^4 -\lambda X^3Y -6 X^2Y^2 + \lambda XY^3 +Y^4, \quad \quad \lambda \in \mathbb{C}[T]/\{\mathbb{C}\} \end{equation*} denotes a family of quartic simple forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the circle of radius $R$ centred at the origin, consider a ``thin'' sector about the fixed line $y = \alpha x$ with edges given by the lines $y = (\alpha \pm \epsilon) x$, where $\epsilon = \epsilon_R \rightarrow 0$ as $ R \to \infty $. We establish an asymptotic count for $S_{\alpha}(\epsilon,R)$, the number of integer lattice points lying in such a sector. Our results depend both on the decay rate of $\epsilon$ and on the rationality/irrationality type of $\alpha$. In particular, we demonstrate that if $\alpha$ is Diophantine, then $S_{\alpha}(\epsilon,R)$ is asymptotic to the area of the sector, so long as $\epsilon R^{t} \rightarrow \infty$ for some $ t&lt;2 $.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Construction of Orthogonal Basis in $p$-adic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, the $p$-adic signature scheme and public-key encryption cryptosystem were introduced. These schemes have good efficiency but are shown to be not secure. The attack succeeds because the extension fields used in these schemes are totally ramified. In order to avoid this attack, the extension field should have a large residue degree. In this paper, we propose a method of constructing a kind of specific orthogonal basis in $p$-adic fields with a large residue degree, which would be helpful to modify the $p$-adic signature scheme and public-key encryption cryptosystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing a novel integration kernel for Mellin transform, we uncover many previously unknown and intriguing properties of the Witten zeta functions of rank two and three. Detailed results concerning their pole locations, residues, and special values are obtained. We propose a non-trivial conjecture regarding their derivatives at the origin, which seems to encode deep information about the root system. We also discuss their behavior at negative integers, highlighting a connection with Eisenstein series and a $p$-adic observation.</description>
