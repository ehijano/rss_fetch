      <title>Blocks in Finite Hyperfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the structure of finite hyperfields $H$, and finds a subtle pattern in their addition operation. Consider the class $\mathcal{H}$ of all hyperfields with a given multiplicative group on $H^\times = H - \{0\}$ and given value of $-1$. Then the addition of hyperfields in this class is determined by the set of pairs $(x,y)$ with $y \in x+1$ for $x,y \in H^\times$. There are blocks of such pairs, where $(x_0,y_0)$ and $(x_1,y_1)$ are in the same block iff every hyperfield with $y_0 \in x_0 + 1$ also has $y_1 \in x_1 + 1$. The theory of these blocks is developed, they can easily be computed without using hyperfields. Exploiting this theory of blocks would greatly speed up future computer searches for small hyperfields. The theory of blocks is then used to show that the number of nonquotient hyperfields of size $n$ grows exponentially with $n$, and that for even $n$ most hyperfields are nonquotient. A final application shows that a large class of finite hyperfields has the FETVINS property, meaning that systems of linear homogeneous equations with fewer equations than variables always have nontrivial solutions.</description>

      <title>Maps preserving the sum-to-difference ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$, what are all functions $f \colon \mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ that satisfy the functional equation $f \left( (x+y)/(x-y) \right) = (f(x) + f(y))/(f(x) - f(y))$ for all $ x \neq y$ in $\mathbb{F}$? We solve this problem for the fields $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$, and a class of its subfields that includes the real constructible numbers, the real algebraic numbers, and all quadratic number fields. We also solve it over the complex numbers and on any subfield of $\mathbb{R}$, if $f$ is continuous over the reals. The proofs involve a mix of algebra in all fields, analysis over the real line, and some topology in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Fano schemes of sub-maximal elementary symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denote by $E_r$ the $r^{th}$ elementary symmetric polynomial in $\dim V$ variables for a vector space $V$ over an infinite field $\Bbbk$. We describe the rational points on the Fano scheme $F_{d-1}(Z(E_{\dim V-1}))$ of projective $(d-1)$-spaces contained in the zero locus of $E_{\dim V-1}$. Isolated points exist precisely for $\dim V=2d$, in which case they are in bijection with the $1\cdot 3\cdots (2d-1)$ pairings on a $2d$-element set. This, in particular, confirming a conjecture of Ambartsoumian, Auel and Jebelli to the effect that (over $\mathbb{R}$) all isolated points are recoverable via integral star transforms with appropriate symbols.</description>

      <title>Raising and lowering maps for tridiagonal pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ denote a nonzero finite-dimensional vector space. A tridiagonal pair on $V$ is an ordered pair $A, A^*$ of maps in ${\rm End}(V)$ such that (i) each of $A, A^*$ is diagonalizable; (ii) there exists an ordering $\lbrace V_i \rbrace_{i=0}^d$ of the eigenspaces of $A$ such that $A^* V_i \subseteq V_{i-1} + V_i + V_{i+1}$ $(0 \leq i \leq d)$, where $V_{-1} =0$ and $V_{d+1}=0$; (iii) there exists an ordering $\lbrace V^*_i \rbrace_{i=0}^\delta$ of the eigenspaces of $A^*$ such that $A V^*_i \subseteq V^*_{i-1} + V^*_i + V^*_{i+1}$ $(0 \leq i \leq \delta)$, where $V^*_{-1} =0$ and $V^*_{\delta+1}=0$; (iv) there does not exist a subspace $W \subseteq V$ such that $W \not=0$, $W\not=V$, $A W \subseteq W$, $A^*W \subseteq W$. Assume that $A, A^*$ is a tridiagonal pair on $V$. It is known that $d=\delta$. For $0 \leq i \leq d$ let $\theta_i$ (resp. $\theta^*_i$) denote the eigenvalue of $A$ (resp. $A^*$) for $V_i$ (resp. $V^*_i$). By construction, there exist $R,F,L \in {\rm End}(V)$ such that $A=R+F+L$ and $R V^*_i \subseteq V^*_{i+1}$, $F V^*_i \subseteq V^*_i$, $LV^*_i \subseteq V^*_{i-1}$ $(0 \leq i \leq d)$. For $0 \leq i \leq d$ define $U_i = (V^*_0 + V^*_1 + \cdots + V^*_i ) \cap (V_i + V_{i+1} + \cdots + V_d)$. It is known that the sum $V=\sum_{i=0}^d U_i$ is direct. By construction, there exists $\mathcal R, \mathcal L \in {\rm End}(V)$ such that $\mathcal R=A - \theta_i I$ and $\mathcal L= A^*-\theta^*_i I$ on $U_i$ $(0 \leq i \leq d)$. It is known that $\mathcal R U_i \subseteq U_{i+1}$ and $\mathcal L U_i \subseteq U_{i-1}$ $(0 \leq i \leq d)$, where $U_{-1}=0$ and $U_{d+1}=0$. In this paper, our main goal is to describe how $R,F,L,\mathcal R, \mathcal L$ are related. We also give some results concerning injectivity/surjectivity and $R, L$.</description>

      <title>Finitary conditions for graph products of monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph products of monoids provide a common framework for free products and direct products. Trace monoids are graph products of finitely generated free monoids. We investigate the interaction of certain finitary conditions with graph products. Specifically, we examine the conditions of being weakly left noetherian (that is, every left ideal is finitely generated) and weakly left coherent (that is, every finitely generated left ideal has a finite presentation) and the related conditions of the ascending chain condition on principal left ideals, being left ideal Howson, and being finitely left equated. All of these conditions, and others, are preserved under retract; as a consequence, if a graph product has such a property, then so do all the constituent monoids. We show that the converse is also true for all the conditions listed except that of being weakly left noetherian. In the latter case we precisely determine the graph products of monoids which are weakly left noetherian.</description>

      <title>Forbidden configurations for coherency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Right (and left) coherency and right (and left) weak coherency are natural finitary conditions for monoids. Determining whether or not a given monoid has any of these properties is historically a difficult problem.
  This paper has several aims, centering around the well-studied class of right (and dually left) $E$-Ehresmann monoids, being one of the broadest classes of monoids containing a semilattice of idempotents. First, we exhibit a particular configuration of elements in a monoid subsemigroup of a right (respectively, left) $E$-Ehresmann monoid, relative to the Ehresmann structure of the overmonoid, that prohibits left (respectively, right) coherence. Second, we apply this technique in a number of different situations. We show that the free Ehresmann monoid of rank at least $2$ is neither left nor right coherent, and that the free left Ehresmann monoid is not left coherent. We demonstrate the utility of our technique in the case where the overmonoid is an $E$-unitary inverse monoid, and apply this to both new situations and to recover the existing results. Namely, free inverse monoids and free ample monoids of rank at least 2 are neither left nor right coherent, and free left ample monoids of rank at least $2$ is are not left coherent. Next, in a positive direction, we demonstrate that every free left Ehresmann monoid is weakly coherent.
  Our final result is of a different nature. Ehresmann monoids form a variety of monoids with an enriched signature. Viewed as a bi-unary monoid (respectively, unary monoid), a free Ehresmann monoid (respectively, free left Ehresmann monoid) does not embed into an inverse monoid. We show that viewed as a monoid (the standpoint of this paper) every free Ehresmann monoid (and hence also every free left Ehresmann monoid) embeds into an $E$-unitary inverse monoid.</description>

      <title>Magma-valued metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the second section, we introduce dense unital magmas and show that a near-ring is dense if and only if it has a positive element smaller that unity. In the third section, we discuss magma-valued metric spaces. The density property of the ordered unital magmas and monoids helps us to generalize a couple of classical results related to the convergence and Cauchy property of sequences. The last section is devoted to magma-valued normed groups and some subgroups of the additive group of Cauchy sequences.</description>

      <title>Matsumoto-Yor processes on Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process $(\int_0^t e^{2b_s-b_t}\, ds\ ;\ t\ge 0)$, where $b$ is a real Brownian motion, is known as the geometric 2M-X Matsumoto--Yor process. Remarkably, it enjoys the Markov property. We provide a generalization of this process in the context of Jordan algebras, and we prove the Markov property for this generalization.
  Our Markov process occurs as a limit of discrete-time AX+B Markov chains on the cone of squares whose invariant probability measures classically yield a Dufresne-type identity for a perpetuity. In particular, the paper provides a generalization to any symmetric cone of the matrix--valued generalization of the Matsumoto--Yor process and Dufresne identity initially developed by Rider--Valk\'o.</description>

      <title>On the Hopf envelope of finite-dimensional bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the given bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being left Artinian as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced. Remarkably, the machinery we develop also allows us to give a new description of the Hopf envelope of a commutative bialgebra and of the cofree cocommutative Hopf algebra of a cocommutative bialgebra.</description>

      <title>Linear maps preserving product of involutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An element of the algebra $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ of $n \times n$ matrices over a field $\mathbb{F}$ is called an involution if its square equals the identity matrix. Gustafson, Halmos, and Radjavi proved that any product of involutions in $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ can be expressed as a product of at most four involutions. In this article, we investigate the bijective linear preservers of the sets of products of two, three, or four involutions in $M_n(\mathbb{F})$.</description>

      <title>The Flat Cover Conjecture for Monoid Acts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Flat Cover Conjecture holds for the category of (right) acts over any right-reversible monoid $S$, provided that the flat $S$-acts are closed under stable Rees extensions. The argument shows that the class $\mathcal{F}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with flat Rees quotient) is cofibrantly generated in such categories, answering a question of Bailey and Renshaw. But cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{SF}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with \emph{strongly} flat Rees quotient) appears much stronger, since we show it implies that there is a bound on the size of the indecomposable strongly flat acts. Similarly, cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{F}}$ (unitary monomorphisms with flat complement) implies a bound on the size of indecomposable flat acts. The key tool is a new characterization of cofibrant generation of a class of monomorphisms in terms of ``almost everywhere" effectiveness of the class.</description>
