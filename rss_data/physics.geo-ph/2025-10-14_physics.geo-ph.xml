      <title>Quantifying the form-flow-saltation dynamics of aeolian sand ripples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ripples are the most fundamental and ubiquitous aeolian bedforms formed on sandy surfaces, but their small size and fast response times make them inherently difficult to measure. However, these attributes also make ripples excellent flow indicators, and they have been used extensively in planetary locations for this purpose. Here, we use terrestrial laser scanning to measure ripple morphometry and celerity coincidently, as well as saltation height above rippled surfaces. We find that although ripple height and wavelength respond linearly to increased shear velocity, under strong winds ripple celerity exhibits a non-linear increase. This relationship at high wind speeds is also reflected in the response of aerodynamic roughness and saltation dynamics, with a greater maximum saltation height present over ripple lee slopes. Importantly, when using ripple patterns as indicators of flow conditions, celerity or height should be used in preference to wavelength as their dynamics respond faster to changing wind speed. In planetary and stratigraphic settings where measuring celerity is not possible, wavelength should be considered as indicative of consistent wind conditions rather than the full range of sand transporting wind speeds.</description>

      <title>Chaotic variability in a model of coupled ice streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regions of fast-flowing ice in ice sheets, known as ice streams, have been theorized to be able to exhibit build-up/surge oscillatory variability due to thermomechanical coupling at the base of the ice. A simple model of three coupled ice streams is constructed to replicate the spatial configuration of a single ice stream being bisected into two termini. The model is constructed to mimic existing branching ice streams in northern Greenland. This model is shown to exhibit both steady-flow and build-up/surge oscillations. Further, the variability can be chaotic due to the nonlinear coupling of three incommensurate frequencies. This provides a mode of chaotic internal variability for ice sheets that contain these types of ice streams.</description>

      <title>Satellite observations reveal shorter periodic inner core oscillation</title>

Abstract: Detecting the Earth's inner core motions relative to the mantle presents a considerable challenge due to their indirect accessibility. Seismological observations initially provided evidence for differential/super-rotation of the inner core, but recently demonstrated a possibly about 70-year periodic oscillation. The contrasting results underscore the ongoing enigma surrounding inner core motion, leaving debates unresolved, including the precise oscillate period. In parallel to seismic observations, satellite geodesy has accumulated decades of global high-precision records, providing a novel avenue to probe inner core motions. Here, we detect an about 6-year oscillation from the gravitational field degree-2 order-2 Stokes coefficients derived from satellite observations, and find it has a unique phase correlation with the about 6-year signal in the Earth's length-of-day variations. This correlation is attributed to an inner core oscillation which is controlled by the gravitational coupling between the inner core and lower mantle (mainly due to the density heterogeneity of the two large low-velocity provinces; LLVPs). That is, we independently corroborate the inner core periodic oscillation, albeit with a significantly shorter period than previously suggested. Our findings demonstrate the dense layer of the LLVPs (mean density anomalies of about +0.9 percent at the bottom), consistent with inversions from tidal tomography and Stoneley modes. Furthermore, our research reveals equatorial topographic undulations of about 187 m at the inner core boundary.</description>

      <title>Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Davemaoite, as the third most abundant mineral in the lower mantle, constitutes significant amounts in pyrolite and mid-ocean ridge basalts. Due to its unquenchable nature, measurements by static compression techniques on physical properties of davemaoite at lower mantle conditions are rare and technically challenging, and those are essential to constrain compositions and properties of mineralogical models in the lower mantle. Here, we present Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression. The CaSiO3 glass transforms into the crystalline phase above 34 GPa and completely transforms into davemaoite above 120 GPa. Thermal equation of state and Hugoniot temperature of davemaoite have been derived from the shock wave data. The CaSiO3 glass under shcok compression has very high shock temperature. Shock wave experiments for sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass indicate that no melting is observed at Hugoniot pressure up to 117.6 GPa. We propose that the melting temperature of davemaoite should be higher than those reported theoretically by now.</description>
