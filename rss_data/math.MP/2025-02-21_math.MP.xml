      <title>Noise-driven Synchronization of Vicsek Model in Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vicsek model has long stood as a pivotal framework in exploring collective behavior and self-organization, captivating the scientific community with its compelling dynamics. However, understanding how noise influences synchronization within this model and its associated phase transition characteristics has presented significant challenges. While numerous studies have focused on simulations due to the model's mathematical complexity, comprehensive theoretical analyses remain sparse. In this paper, we deliver a rigorous mathematical proof demonstrating that for any initial configuration of the Vicsek model, there exists a bound on noise amplitude such that if the noise amplitude is maintained within this bound, the system will achieve synchronization in mean. This finding not only lays a solid mathematical groundwork for the Vicsek model's phase transition theory but also underscores the critical role of noise in collective dynamics, enhancing our understanding of self-organizing systems in stochastic environments.</description>

      <title>Regularized interacting scalar quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider self interacting scalar quantum field theories over a $d$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime with various interaction Lagrangians which are suitable functions of the field. The interacting field observables are represented as power series over the free theory by means of perturbation theory. The object which is employed to obtain this power series is the time ordered exponential of the interaction Lagrangian which is the $S$-matrix of the theory and thus itself a power series in the coupling constant of the theory. We analyze a regularization procedure which makes the $S$-matrix convergent to well defined unitary operators. This regularization depends on two parameters. One describes how much the high frequency contributions in the propagators are tamed and a second one which describes how much the large field contributions are suppressed in the interaction Lagrangian. We finally discuss how to remove the parameters in lower dimensional theories and for specific interaction Lagrangians. In particular, we show that in three spacetime dimensions for a $\phi^4_3$ theory one obtains sequences of unitary operators which are weakly-$*$ convergent to suitable unitary operators in the limit of vanishing parameters. The coefficients of the asymptotic expansion in powers of the coupling constant of all the possible limit points coincide and furthermore agree with the predictions of perturbation theory. Finally we discuss how to extend these results to the case of a $\phi^4_4$ theory were the final results turns out to be very similar to the three dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Random walks with homotopic spatial inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study a generalization of the standard random walk, an homotopic random walk (HRW), using a deformed translation unitary step that arises from a homotopy of the position-dependent masses associated to the Tsallis and Kaniadakis nonexensive statistics. The HRW implies an associated homotopic Fokker-Planck equation (HFPE) provided with a bi-parameterized inhomogeneous diffusion. The trajectories of the HRW exhibit convergence to a position, randomness as well as divergence, according to deformation and homotopic parameters. The HFPE obtained from associated master equation to the HRW presents the features: a) it results an special case of the van Kampen diffusion equation (5) of Ref. [N. G. van Kampen, \emph{Z. Phys. B Condensed Matter} \textbf{68}, 135 (1987)]; b) it exhibits a superdiffusion in function of deformation and homotopic parameters; c) Tsallis and Kaniadakis deformed FPE are recovered as special cases; d) a homotopic mixtured diffusion is observed; and e) it has a stationary entropic density, characterizing a inhomogeneous screening of the medium, obtained from a homotopic version of the H-Theorem.</description>

      <title>Uncomputability and complexity of quantum control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.10082v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In laboratory and numerical experiments, physical quantities are known with a finite precision and described by rational numbers. Based on this, we deduce that quantum control problems both for open and closed systems are in general not algorithmically solvable, i.e., there is no algorithm that can decide whether dynamics of an arbitrary quantum system can be manipulated by accessible external interactions (coherent or dissipative) such that a chosen target reaches a desired value. This conclusion holds even for the relaxed requirement of the target only approximately attaining the desired value. These findings do not preclude an algorithmic solvability for a particular class of quantum control problems. Moreover, any quantum control problem can be made algorithmically solvable if the set of accessible interactions (i.e., controls) is rich enough. To arrive at these results, we develop a technique based on establishing the equivalence between quantum control problems and Diophantine equations, which are polynomial equations with integer coefficients and integer unknowns. In addition to proving uncomputability, this technique allows to construct quantum control problems belonging to different complexity classes. In particular, an example of the control problem involving a two-mode coherent field is shown to be NP-hard, contradicting a widely held believe that two-body problems are easy.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative graphs based on finite-infinite system couplings: quantum error correction for a qubit coupled to a coherent field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.11937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a key role for quantum information transmission and quantum computing. In this work, we develop and apply the theory of non-commutative operator graphs to study error correction in the case of a finite-dimensional quantum system coupled to an infinite dimensional system. We consider as an explicit example a qubit coupled via the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian with a bosonic coherent field. We extend the theory of non-commutative graphs to this situation and construct, using the Gazeau-Klauder coherent states, the corresponding non-commutative graph. As the result, we find the quantum anticlique, which is the projector on the error correcting subspace, and analyze it as a function of the frequencies of the qubit and the bosonic field. The general treatment is also applied to the analysis of the error correcting subspace for certain experimental values of the parameters of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. The proposed scheme can be applied to any system that possess the same decomposition of spectrum of the Hamiltonian into a direct sum as in JC model, where eigenenergies in the two direct summands form strictly increasing sequences.</description>

      <title>Reachable sets for two-level open quantum systems driven by coherent and incoherent controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study controllability in the set of all density matrices for a two-level open quantum system driven by coherent and incoherent controls. In [A. Pechen, Phys. Rev. A 84, 042106 (2011)] an approximate controllability, i.e., controllability with some precision, was shown for generic $N$-level open quantum systems driven by coherent and incoherent controls. However, the explicit formulation of this property, including the behavior of this precision as a function of transition frequencies and decoherence rates of the system, was not known. The present work provides a rigorous analytical study of reachable sets for two-level open quantum systems. First, it is shown that for $N=2$ the presence of incoherent control does not affect the reachable set (while incoherent control may affect the time necessary to reach particular state). Second, the reachable set in the Bloch ball is described and it is shown that already just for one coherent control any point in the Bloch ball can be achieved with precision $\delta\sim \gamma/\omega$, where $\gamma$ is the decoherence rate and $\omega$ is the transition frequency. Typical values are $\delta\lesssim10^{-3}$ that implies high accuracy of achieving any density matrix. Moreover, we show that most points in the Bloch ball can be exactly reached, except of two lacunae of size $\sim\delta$. For two coherent controls, the system is shown to be completely controllable in the set of all density matrices. Third, the reachable set as a function of the final time is found and shown to exhibit a non-trivial structure.</description>

      <title>On the detailed structure of quantum control landscape for fast single qubit phase-shift gate generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13671v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the detailed structure of quantum control landscape for the problem of single-qubit phase shift gate generation on the fast time scale. In previous works, the absence of traps for this problem was proven on various time scales. A special critical point which was known to exist in quantum control landscapes was shown to be either a saddle or a global extremum, depending on the parameters of the control system. However, in the case of saddle the numbers of negative and positive eigenvalues of Hessian at this point and their magnitudes have not been studied. At the same time, these numbers and magnitudes determine the relative ease or difficulty for practical optimization in a vicinity of the critical point. In this work, we compute the numbers of negative and positive eigenvalues of Hessian at this saddle point and moreover, give estimates on magnitude of these eigenvalues. We also significantly simplify our previous proof of the theorem about this saddle point of the Hessian [Theorem~3 in B.O.~Volkov, O.V.~Morzhin, A.N.~Pechen, J.~Phys.~A: Math. Theor. {\bf 54}, 215303 (2021)].</description>

      <title>Higher order traps for some strongly degenerate quantum control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03355v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum control is necessary for a variety of modern quantum technologies as it allows to optimally manipulate quantum systems. An important problem in quantum control is to establish whether the control objective functional has trapping behaviour or no, namely if it has or no traps -- controls from which it is difficult to escape by local search optimization methods. Higher order traps were previously introduced in [A. N. Pechen, D. J. Tannor, "Are there traps in quantum control landscapes?", Phys. Rev. Lett., 106 (2011), 120402], where 3-rd order traps were found. In this note we show that traps of arbitrarily high order exist for controllable quantum systems with special symmetry in the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Time-optimal state transfer for an open qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding minimal time and establishing the structure of the corresponding optimal controls which can transfer a given initial state of a quantum system into a given target state is a key problem of quantum control. In this work, this problem is solved for a basic component of various quantum technology processes -- a qubit interacting with the environment and experiencing an arbitrary time-dependent coherent driving. We rigorously derive both upper and lower estimates for the minimal steering time. Surprisingly, we discover that the optimal controls have a very special form -- they consist of two impulses, at the beginning and at the end of the control period, which can be assisted by a smooth time-dependent control in between. Moreover, an important for practical applications explicit almost optimal state transfer protocol is provided which only consists of four impulses and gives an almost optimal time of motion. The results can be directly applied to a variety of experimental situations for estimation of the ultimate limits of state control for quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider error correction, based on the theory of non-commutative graphs, for a model of a qubit interacting with quantum oscillator. The dynamics of the composite system is governed by the Schr\"odinger equation which generates positive operator-valued measure (POVM) for the system dynamics. We construct a quantum channel generating the non-commutative graph as a linear envelope of the POVM. The idea is based on applying a generalized version of a quantum channel using the apparatus of von Neumann algebras. The results are analyzes for a non-commutative graph generated by a qubit interacting with quantum oscillator. For this model the quantum anticlique which determines the error correcting subspace has an explicit expression.</description>

      <title>Exploring Triality Explicitly: Convenient bases for $\mathrm{SO}(8)$, $\mathrm{Spin}(1, 7)$, and $\mathrm{G}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The property of triality only appears in one linear simple Lie algebra: $D_4$, a.k.a. $\mathfrak{so}(8, \mathbb{C})$. Though often explored in abstract, it is desirable to have an explicit realization of the concept since there are no other linear examples to gain intuition from. In this paper several convenient representations and bases are constructed in order to facilitate the exploration of the three fold symmetry known as the triality of representations. In particular the three $8$ dimensional representations for the Euclidean and Lorentzian real forms of $\mathfrak{so}(8,\mathbb{C})$ are constructed, and the maps between representations are given in each case, respectively. It is also seen explicitly how $\mathfrak{g}_2 \subset \mathfrak{so}(8, \mathbb{R})$ arises as the intersection of non-conjugate $\mathfrak{spin}(7,\mathbb{R})$ sub-algebras, and also as the stabilizer of the outer automorphism group $\mathrm{Out}(\mathfrak{so}(8,\mathbb{R}))$. It is argued that $\mathfrak{spin}(1,7)$ is in some sense the more natural stage for triality to play out upon, and it is shown that triality can be seen to be simply the multiplication of bases by third roots of unity, just as dualities are often the application of second roots of unity upon Lie algebra bases. Once these are understood a short discussion is had about obstacles to a theory of triality which attempt to explain the three generations of matter via some form of triality.</description>

      <title>Fusion rules and structure constants of E-series minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the ADE classification of Virasoro minimal models, the E-series is the sparsest: their central charges $c=1-6\frac{(p-q)^2}{pq}$ are not dense in the half-line $c\in (-\infty,1)$, due to $q=12,18,30$ taking only 3 values -- the Coxeter numbers of $E_6, E_7, E_8$. The E-series is also the least well understood, with few known results beyond the spectrum.
  Here, we use a semi-analytic bootstrap approach for numerically computing 4-point correlation functions. We deduce non-chiral fusion rules, i.e. which 3-point structure constants vanish. These vanishings can be explained by constraints from null vectors, interchiral symmetry, simple currents, extended symmetries, permutations, and parity, except in one case for $q=30$. We conjecture that structure constants are given by a universal expression built from the double Gamma function, times polynomial functions of $\cos(\pi\frac{p}{q})$ with values in $\mathbb{Q}\big(\cos(\frac{\pi}{q})\big)$, which we work out explicitly for $q=12$.
  We speculate on generalizing E-series minimal models to generic integer values of $q$, and recovering loop CFTs as $p,q\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Modelling Capillary Rise with a Slip Boundary Condition: Well-posedness and Long-time Dynamics of Solutions to Washburn's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend Washburn's capillary rise equation by incorporating a slip condition at the pipe wall. The governing equation is derived using fundamental principles from continuum mechanics. A new scaling is introduced, allowing for a systematic analysis of different flow regimes. We prove the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of a bounded positive solution to Washburn's equation that includes the slip parameter, as well as the continuous dependence of the solution in the maximum norm on the initial data. Thus, the initial-value problem for Washburn's equation is shown to be well-posed in the sense of Hadamard. Additionally, we show that the unique equilibrium solution may be reached either monotonically or in an oscillatory fashion, similarly to the no-slip case. Finally, we determine the basin of attraction for the system, ensuring that the equilibrium state will be reached from the initial data we impose. These results hold for any positive value of the nondimensional slip parameter in the model, and for all values of the ratio $h_0/h_e$ in the range $[0,3/2]$, where $h_0$ is the initial height of the fluid column and $h_e$ is its equilibrium height.</description>

      <title>Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home When Doubled and Scaled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of numerous physical systems can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions of SO(n).</description>

      <title>Langevin model for soliton molecules in ultrafast fiber ring laser cavity: investigating experimentally the interplay between noise and inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of soliton molecules in ultrafast fiber ring laser cavity is strongly influenced by noise. We show how a parsimonious Langevin model can be constructed from experimental data, resulting in a mathematical description that encompasses both the deterministic and stochastic properties of the evolution of the soliton molecules. In particular, we were able to probe the response dynamics of the soliton molecule to an external kick in a sub-critical approach, namely without the need to actually disturb the systems under investigation. Moreover, the noise experienced by the dissipative solitonic system, including its distribution and correlation, can now be also analyzed in details. Our strategy can be applied to any systems where the individual motion of its constitutive particles can be traced; the case of optical solitonic-system laser presented here serving as a proof-of-principle demonstration.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping SU(3) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the positivity bootstrap approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills (YM) theory, extending previous studies of large N and SU(2) theories by incorporating multiple-trace Wilson loop operators. Utilizing Hermitian and reflection positivity conditions, along with Schwinger-Dyson (SD) loop equations, we compute rigorous bounds for the expectation values of plaquette Wilson loop in 2D, 3D, and 4D YM theories. Our results exhibit clear convergence and are consistent with known analytic or numerical results. To enhance the approach, we introduce a novel twist-reflection positivity condition, which we prove to be exact in the 2D YM theory. Additionally, we propose a dimensional-reduction truncation, where Wilson loop operators are effectively restricted to a lower-dimensional subplane, significantly simplifying the computations. SD equations for double-trace Wilson loops are also derived in detail. Our findings suggest that the positivity bootstrap method is broadly applicable to higher-rank gauge theories beyond the single-trace cases, providing a solid foundation for further non-perturbative investigations of gauge theories using positivity-based methods.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Regularization via Curved Momentum Space: A Geometric Solution to Divergences in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of UV divergences in QFT has long been a fundamental challenge. Standard regularization techniques modify high-energy behavior to ensure well-defined integrals. However, these approaches often introduce unphysical parameters, rely on arbitrary prescriptions, or break fundamental symmetries, making them mathematically effective but conceptually unsatisfactory.
  We propose a novel and self-consistent approach in which UV regularization emerges naturally from the curved geometry of momentum space. Through curved momentum space, imposed by a geodesic metric, we construct an integral measure that inherently suppresses high-energy divergences while preserving fundamental symmetries, including full Lorentz invariance. This framework is self-sufficient, i.e. requires no external regulators. It retains equations of motion and is fully compatibility with standard field theory
  Our approach guarantees the weakest possible suppression necessary for convergence, avoiding excessive modifications to quantum behavior, still achieving convergence. While formulated in Riemannian Geometry, we show seamless extension to Minkowski space, maintainining regularization properties in relativistic QFT. This offers an alternative to ad hoc renormalization, providing an intrinsic and mathematically well-motivated suppression mechanism, purely rooted in curved geometry of momentum space.
  We rigorously construct the measure-theoretic framework and demonstrate its effectiveness by proof of finiteness for key QFT integrals. Beyond resolving divergences, this work suggests broader applications in spectral geometry, effective field theory, and potential extensions to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Bohmian Mechanics fails to compute multi-time correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of Bell type inequalities in quantum systems manifests that quantum states cannot be described by classical probability distributions. Yet, Bohmian mechanics is a realistic, non-local theory of classical particle trajectories that is claimed to be indistinguishable by observations from more traditional approaches to quantum mechanics. We set up a spatial version of the GHZ system with qubits realised as positional observables that demonstrates that the Bohmian theory fails to match predictions of textbook quantum mechanics (and most likely experients) unless enlarged by a microscopic theory of collapse of the wave function after observation. For this discrepancy to occur it is essential that positions at different times do not commute.</description>

      <title>The formation of a soliton gas condensate for the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a rigorous analysis of a multi-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation as the number, $N$, of solitons grows to infinity. We discover configurations of $N$-soliton solutions which exhibit the formation (as $N \to \infty$) of a soliton gas condensate. Specifically, we show that when the eigenvalues of the Zakharov - Shabat operator for the NLS equation accumulate on two bounded horizontal segments in the complex plane with norming constants bounded away from $0$, then, asymptotically, the solution is described by a rapidly oscillatory elliptic-wave with constant velocity, on compact subsets of $(x,t)$. This is to be distinguished from previous analyses of soliton gasses where the norming constants were tending to zero with $N$, and the asymptotic description only included elliptic waves in the long-time asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Geometric analysis for the Pontryagin action and boundary terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze the Pontryagin model adopting different geometric-covariant approaches. In particular, we focus on the manner in which boundary conditions must be imposed on the background manifold in order to reproduce an unambiguous theory on the boundary. At a Lagrangian level, we describe the symmetries of the theory and construct the Lagrangian covariant momentum map which allows for an extension of Noether's theorems. Through the multisymplectic analysis we obtain the covariant momentum map associated with the action of the gauge group on the covariant multimomenta phase-space. By performing a space plus time decomposition by means of a foliation of the appropriate bundles, we are able to recover not only the $t$-instantaneous Lagrangian and Hamiltonian of the theory, but also the generator of the gauge transformations. In the polysymplectic framework we perform a Poisson-Hamilton analysis with the help of the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian and the Poisson-Gerstenhaber bracket. Remarkably, as long as we consider a background manifold with boundary, in all of these geometric formulations, we are able to recover the so-called differentiability conditions as a straightforward consequence of Noether's theorem.</description>

      <title>On the role of symmetry and geometry in global quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary parameter ranges with a finite number of shots. While various formulations exist, the Bayesian paradigm offers a flexible approach to optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. However, there are several sets of assumptions capturing the notions of prior ignorance and uninformed estimation, leading to two main approaches: invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, and adherence to the geometry of a state space. While the first approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive settings, the second can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. We examine the practical consequences of both approaches and show how to apply them in examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy scenarios. More importantly, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we unify the two approaches into a practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed - a blueprint for the design of quantum sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics are systems of equations describing the evolution of macroscopic states in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. From generalized Onsager reciprocal relationships, one can formulate a class of hydrodynamics as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, Onsager gradient flows have been widely investigated in optimal transport-type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, namely hydrodynamical density manifolds. This paper studies geometric calculations in these hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate Levi-Civita connections, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport and then derive Riemannian and sectional curvatures on density manifolds. We last present closed formulas for sectional curvatures of density manifolds in one dimensional spaces, in which the sign of curvatures is characterized by the convexities of mobilities. For example, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures in zero-range models, such as independent particles, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti models.</description>

      <title>On the circle, Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos and Beta Ensembles match exactly</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.00578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify an equality between two objects arising from different contexts of mathematical physics: Kahane's Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos ($GMC^\gamma$) on the circle, and the Circular Beta Ensemble $(C\beta E)$ from Random Matrix Theory. This is obtained via an analysis of related random orthogonal polynomials, making the approach spectral in nature. In order for the equality to hold, the simple relationship between coupling constants is $\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\beta}}$, which we establish only when $\gamma \leq 1$ or equivalently $\beta \geq 2$. This corresponds to the sub-critical and critical phases of the $GMC$.
  As a side product, we answer positively a question raised by Virag. We also give an alternative proof of the Fyodorov-Bouchaud formula concerning the total mass of the $GMC^\gamma$ on the circle. This conjecture was recently settled by R\'emy using Liouville conformal field theory. We can go even further and describe the law of all moments.
  Furthermore, we notice that the ``spectral construction'' has a few advantages. For example, the Hausdorff dimension of the support is efficiently described for all $\beta&gt;0$, thanks to existing spectral theory. Remarkably, the critical parameter for $GMC^\gamma$ corresponds to $\beta=2$, where the geometry and representation theory of unitary groups lie.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion Limited Aggregation and its generalization, Dielectric Breakdown model play an important role in physics, approximating a range of natural phenomena. Yet little is known about them, with the famous Kesten's estimate on the DLAs growth being perhaps the most important result. Using a different approach we prove a generalisation of this result for the DBM in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\mathbb{Z}^3$. The obtained estimate depends on the DBM parameter, and matches with the best known results for DLA. In particular, since our methods are different from Kesten's, our argument provides a new proof for Kesten's result both in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\mathbb{Z}^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Bianchi I spacetimes within the Jordan frame of Brans-Dicke theory, incorporating the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. After developing general formulas, we analyze the robustness of classical singularity resolution due to quantum geometric effects using two common quantization schemes. We then compare the resulting physical properties. We find that both schemes replace classical singularities with regular quantum bounces. Notably, in contrast to similar studies based on general relativity, we find that all three directional scale factors of the Bianchi I spacetimes increase and after the quantum bounce they reach values similar to their initial values, leading to a merging with classical spacetimes in both schemes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum non-Markovianity in tripartite quantum states $\rho_{ABC}$ represents a correlation between systems $A$ and $C$ when conditioned on the system $B$ and is known to have both classical and quantum contributions. However, a systematic characterization of the latter is missing. To address this, we propose a faithful measure for non-Markovianity of genuine quantum origin called squashed quantum non-Markovianity (sQNM). It is based on the quantum conditional mutual information and is defined by the left-over non-Markovianity after squashing out all non-quantum contributions. It is lower bounded by the squashed entanglement between non-conditioning systems in the reduced state and is delimited by the extendibility of either of the non-conditioning systems. We show that the sQNM is monogamous, asymptotically continuous, convex, additive on tensor-product states, and generally super-additive. We characterize genuine quantum non-Markovianity as a resource via a convex resource theory after identifying free states with vanishing sQNM and free operations that do not increase sQNM in states. We use our resource-theoretic framework to bound the rate of state transformations under free operations and to study state transformation under non-free operations; in particular, we find the quantum communication cost from Bob ($B$) to Alice ($A$) or Charlie ($C$) is lower bounded by the change in sQNM in the states. The sQNM finds operational meaning; in particular, the optimal rate of private communication in a variant of conditional one-time pad protocol is twice the sQNM. Also, the minimum deconstruction cost for a variant of quantum deconstruction protocol is given twice the sQNM of the state.</description>

      <title>Potts and random cluster measures on locally regular-tree-like graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fixing $\beta \ge 0$ and an integer $q \ge 2$, consider the ferromagnetic $q$-Potts measures $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ on finite graphs ${\sf G}_n$ on $n$ vertices, with external field strength $B \ge 0$ and the corresponding random cluster measures $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_{n}$. Suppose that as $n \to \infty$ the uniformly sparse graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to an infinite $d$-regular tree ${\sf T}_{d}$, $d \ge 3$. We show that the convergence of the Potts free energy density to its Bethe replica symmetric prediction (which has been proved in case $d$ is even, or when $B=0$), yields the local weak convergence of $\varphi^{q,\beta,B}_n$ and $\mu_n^{\beta,B}$ to the corresponding free or wired random cluster measure, Potts measure, respectively, on ${\sf T}_{d}$. The choice of free versus wired limit is according to which has the larger Potts Bethe functional value, with mixtures of these two appearing {as limit points on} the critical line $\beta_c(q,B)$ where these two values of the Bethe functional coincide. For $B=0$ and $\beta&gt;\beta_c$, we further establish a pure-state decomposition by showing that conditionally on the same dominant color $1 \le k \le q$, the $q$-Potts measures on such edge-expander graphs ${\sf G}_n$ converge locally to the $q$-Potts measure on ${\sf T}_{d}$ with a boundary wired at color $k$.</description>

      <title>Quantum reversal: a general theory of coherent quantum absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fascinating concept of coherent quantum absorber - which can absorb any photon emitted by another system while maintaining entanglement with that system - has found diverse implications in open quantum system theory and quantum metrology. This work generalizes the concept by proposing the so-called reversal conditions for the two systems, in which a "reverser" coherently reverses any effect of the other system on a field. The reversal conditions are rigorously boiled down to concise formulas involving the Petz recovery map and Kraus operators, thereby generalizing as well as streamlining the existing treatments of coherent absorbers.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product unitaries: Beyond quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPU) are 1D tensor networks describing time evolution and unitary symmetries of quantum systems, while their action on states by construction preserves the entanglement area law. MPU which are formed by a single repeated tensor are known to coincide with 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA), i.e., unitaries with an exact light cone. However, this correspondence breaks down for MPU with open boundary conditions, even if the resulting operator is translation-invariant. Such unitaries can turn short- to long-range correlations and thus alter the underlying phase of matter. Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.</description>

      <title>Normal forms for ordinary differential operators, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the generalised Schur theory offered in the recent paper by the second author in dimension one case, and apply it to obtain two applications in different directions of algebra/algebraic geometry.
  The first application is a new explicit parametrisation of torsion free rank one sheaves on projective irreducible curves with vanishing cohomology groups.
  The second application is a commutativity criterion for operators in the Weyl algebra or, more generally, in the ring of ordinary differential operators, which we prove in the case when operators have a normal form with the restriction top line (for details see Introduction).
  Both applications are obtained with the help of normal forms. Namely, considering the ring of ordinary differential operators $D_1=K[[x]][\partial ]$ as a subring of a certain complete non-commutative ring $\hat{D}_1^{sym}$, the normal forms of differential operators mentioned here are obtained after conjugation by some invertible operator ("Schur operator"), calculated using one of the operators in a ring. Normal forms of commuting operators are polynomials with constant coefficients in the differentiation, integration and shift operators, which have a restricted finite order in each variable, and can be effectively calculated for any given commuting operators.</description>

      <title>Some properties of a non-hydrostatic stochastic oceanic primitive equations model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02289v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how relaxing the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis affects theoretical aspects of the LU primitive equations well-posedness. We focus on models that sit between incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and standard LU primitive equations, aiming for numerical manageability while capturing non-hydrostatic phenomena. Our main result concerns the well-posedness of a specific stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations. This holds with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, and when the horizontal component of noise is independent of z. In fact these conditions can be related to the dynamical regime in which the primitive equations remain valid. Moreover, under these conditions, we show that the LU primitive equations solution tends toward the one of the deterministic primitive equations for a vanishing noise, thus providing a physical coherence to the LU stochastic model.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and generalized area law in fully connected models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The area law for entanglement entropy fundamentally reflects the complexity of quantum many-body systems, demonstrating ground states of local Hamiltonians to be represented with low computational complexity. While this principle is well-established in one-dimensional systems, little is known beyond 1D cases, and attempts to generalize the area law on infinite-dimensional graphs have largely been disproven. In this work, for non-critical ground states of Hamiltonians on fully connected graphs, we establish a generalized area law up to a polylogarithmic factor in system size, by effectively reducing the boundary area to a constant scale for interactions between subsystems. This result implies an efficient approximation of the ground state by the matrix product state up to an approximation error of $1/\text{poly}(n)$. As the core technique, we develop the mean-field renormalization group approach, which rigorously guarantees efficiency by systematically grouping regions of the system and iteratively approximating each as a product state. This approach provides a rigorous pathway to efficiently simulate ground states of complex systems, advancing our understanding of infinite-dimensional quantum many-body systems and their entanglement structures.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the scattering of linear internal waves in a two dimensional channel with subcritical bottom topography. We construct the scattering matrix for the internal wave problem in a channel with straight ends, mapping incoming data to outgoing data; this operator turns out to differ by a smoothing operator from the pullback by the ``bounce map'' for boundary data obtained by ray-tracing. As a consequence we obtain unique solvability of the inhomogeneous stationary scattering problem subject to an appropriate outgoing radiation condition.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a paper by T. Chakradhar, K. Gittins, G. Habib and N. Peyerimhoff, we analyze their conjecture that the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator on the disk tends to $+\infty$ as the magnetic field tends to $+\infty$. This is an important step towards the analysis of the curvature effect in the case of general domains in $\mathbb R^2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that the mass-shell constraints in the gauged twistor formulation of a massive particle given in [Deguchi and Okano, Phys. Rev. D 93, 045016 (2016) [Erratum 93, 089906(E) (2016)]] are incorporated in an action automatically by extending the local $U(2)$ transformation to its inhomogeneous extension denoted by $IU(2)$. Therefore, it turns out that all the necessary constraints are incorporated into an action by virtue of the local $IU(2)$ symmetry of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel transport theory, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features (FDIF) hypothesis, is presented for scenarios when velocity space exhibits axisymmetry. In this theory, the transport equations are derived from the 1D-2V Vlasov equation, employing the Spherical harmonics expansions (SHE) together with the King function expansion (KFE) in velocity space. The characteristic parameter equations (CPEs) are provided based on the general King mixture model (GKMM), serving as the constraint equations of the transport equations. It is a nature process to present the closure relations of transport equations based on SHE and KFE, successfully providing a kinetic moment-closed model (KMCM). This model is typically a nonlinear system, effective for moderately anisotropic non-equilibrium plasmas.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic symplectic geometry of integrable systems and Weierstrass-Williamson theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the foundations of the local linear symplectic geometry of $p$-adic integrable systems on $p$-adic analytic symplectic $4$\--dimensional manifolds, by classifiying all their possible local linear models. In order to do this we develop a new approach, of independent interest, to the theory of Weierstrass and Williamson concerning the diagonalization of real matrices by real symplectic matrices. We show that this approach can be generalized to $p$\--adic matrices, leading to a classification of real $(2n)$-by-$(2n)$ matrices and of $p$-adic $2$-by-$2$ and $4$-by-$4$ matrix normal forms, including, up to dimension $4$, the classification in the degenerate case, for which the literature is limited even in the real case. A combination of these results and the Hardy-Ramanujan formula shows that both the number of $p$-adic matrix normal forms and the number of local linear models of $p$-adic integrable systems grow almost exponentially with their dimensions, in strong contrast with the real case. The paper also includes a number of results concerning symplectic linear algebra over arbitrary fields in arbitrary dimensions as well as applications to $p$-adic mechanical systems and singularity theory for $p$-adic analytic maps on $4$-manifolds. These results fit in a program, proposed a decade ago by Voevodsky, Warren and the second author, to develop a $p$-adic theory of integrable systems with the goal of later implementing it using proof assistants.</description>

      <title>Courant Algebroid Relations, T-Dualities and Generalised Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of Courant algebroid relation is used to introduce a definition of relation between divergence operators on Courant algebroids. By introducing invariant divergence operators, a notion of generalised T-duality between divergences is presented through an existence and uniqueness result for related divergence operators on T-dual pairs of exact Courant algebroids, which naturally incorporates the dilaton shift. When combined with the notion of generalised isometry, this establishes circumstances under which generalised Ricci tensors are related, proving that T-duality is compatible with generalised string background equations. This enables an analysis of the compatibility between T-duality and generalised Ricci flow, showing that the T-dual of a solution of generalised Ricci flow is also a solution of generalised Ricci flow. Our constructions are illustrated through many explicit examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a "switching identity" that can be stated for critical Brownian loop-soups or for the Gaussian free field on a cable graph: It basically says that at the level of cluster configurations and at the more general level of the occupation time fields, conditioning two points on the cable-graph to belong to the same cluster of Brownian loops (or equivalently to the same sign-cluster of the GFF) amounts to adding a random odd number of independent Brownian excursions between these points to an otherwise unconditioned configuration. This explicit simple description of the conditional law of the clusters when a connection occurs has various direct consequences, in particular about the large scale behaviour of these sign-clusters on infinite graphs.</description>

Abstract: Making use of the simple fact that all separable complex Hilbert spaces of given dimension are isomorphic, we show that there are just six basic ways to define generalized coordinate operators in Quantum Mechanics. In each case a canonically conjugate generalized momentum operator can be defined, but it may not be self-adjoint. Even in those cases we show there is always either a self-adjoint extension of the operator or a Neumark extension of the Hilbert space that produces a self-adjoint momentum operator. In one of the six cases both extensions work, thus leading to seven basic pairs of coordinate and momentum operators. We also show why there are more ways of defining basic coordinate and momentum measurements. A special role is reserved for measurements that simultaneously measure both.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08816</link>

Abstract: Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics? This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints imposed by information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model using a worldine Lagrangian formalism, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and following an arbitrary statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this framework, the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ is recovered, and the worldline Lagrangian yields the black hole's thermal energy, $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon's surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.</description>
