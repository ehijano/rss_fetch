      <title>A Lindblad-Pauli Framework for Coarse-Grained Chaotic Binary-State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17200v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-graining a chaotic bistable oscillator into a binary symbol sequence is a standard reduction, but it often obscures the geometry of the reduced state space and structural constraints of physically meaningful stochastic evolution. We develop a two-state framework that embeds coarse-grained left/right statistics of the driven Duffing oscillator into a $2\times2$ density-matrix representation and models inter-well switching by a two-rate Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) generator. For diagonal states the GKSL dynamics reduces to the classical two-state master equation.The density-matrix language permits an operational ``Bloch half-disk'' embedding with overlap parameter $c(\varepsilon)$ quantifying partition fuzziness; the GKSL model is fitted to diagonal marginals treating $c(\varepsilon)$ as diagnostic. We derive closed-form solutions, an explicit Kraus representation (generalized amplitude damping with dephasing and rotation), and practical diagnostics for the time-homogeneous first-order Markov assumption (order tests, Chapman--Kolmogorov consistency, run-length statistics, stationarity checks). When higher-order memory appears, we extend the framework via augmented Markov models, constructing CPTP maps through discrete-time Kraus representations; continuous-time GKSL generators may not exist for all empirical transition matrices. We provide a numerical pipeline with templates for validating the framework on Duffing simulations. The density-matrix formalism is an organizational convenience rather than claiming quantum-classical equivalence.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Sixth Order Runge-Kutta Method for Simple Lawson Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes become impractical when a stiff linear operator is present in the dynamics. This failure mode is quite common in numerical simulations of fluids and plasmas. Lawson proposed Generalized Runge-Kutta Processes for stiff problems in 1967, in which the stiff linear operator is treated fully implicitly via matrix exponentiation. Any Runge-Kutta scheme induces valid Lawson integration, but a scheme is exceptionally simple to implement if the abscissa $c_i$ are ordered and equally spaced. Classical RK4 satisfies this requirement, but it is difficult to derive efficient higher order schemes with this constraint. Here I present an explicit sixth order method identified with Newton-Raphson iteration that provides simple Lawson integration.</description>

      <title>Empirical Discovery of Multi-Scale Transfer of Information in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the time scales and information flow associated with multiscale energy transfer in a weakly turbulent system. This is done through a greedy optimization algorithm which finds the maximum conditional-mutual information across lagged embeddings of time series localized by wavenumber. For our chosen weakly turbulent system, the algorithm finds asymmetries in the information flow across wavenumbers, reflecting what are typically described as forward and inverse cascades. However, our approach goes beyond typical heuristic arguments and provides quantitative insight into the intricate multi-wave mixing dynamics necessary to maintain the steady statistical state characterizing weak turbulence. Our work then provides a novel, detailed, and fully nonlinear statistical analysis of a weakly turbulent system. The flexibility of our approach points to broader applicability in real-world data coming from chaotic or turbulent dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Joint Recurrence Quantification Analysis: detecting coupling between time series of different dimensionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One challenge with the analysis of complex systems and the interaction between such systems is that they are composed of different numbers of components, or simply the fact that a different number of observables is available for each system. The challenge is how to analyze the interaction of two systems which are not described by the same number of variables. Here, we present multivariate joint recurrence quantification analysis (MvJRQA), a recurrence-based technique that allows to analyze coupling properties between multivariate datasets that differ in dimensionality (i.e., number of observables) and type of data (such as nominal or interval-scaled, for example). First, we introduce the methods, and test it on simulated data from linear and nonlinear systems. Then we apply it to an empirical dataset of EEG and eye tracking data. We introduce the joint recurrence coupling indicator (JRCI) as a measure to assess and compare coupling between systems. Finally, we discuss practical issues regarding the application of the method.</description>
