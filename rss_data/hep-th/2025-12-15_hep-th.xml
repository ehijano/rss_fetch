      <title>Pole skipping from universal hydrodynamics of (1+1)d QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (1+1)d QFTs provide a tractable arena for understanding the emergence of hydrodynamics in thermal states. At high temperatures this process is governed by the weak breaking of conformal symmetry, and so in this limit many features of the hydrodynamic theory that emerges have been argued to be universal. In this paper we study aspects of the stress tensor thermal two-point function in holographic QFTs of this kind and show that they are consistent with the universal hydrodynamic theory proposed to apply at late times. Specifically, we identify the locations of the `pole skipping' points in momentum space at which there is an intersection of poles and zeroes of this two-point function in holographic QFTs. Although these points lie outside the regime where the hydrodynamic theory is controlled, we show that their locations are consistent with those found by resumming the hydrodynamic derivative expansion near the lightcone. For example, this resummation of the universal hydrodynamics correctly predicts the butterfly velocity of holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Wet Hair: Global Symmetries in Entanglement Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central conjecture in quantum gravity is the non-existence of global symmetries. As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair"); $\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shagoulian.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Effective Theories -- Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the idea that consistent quantum field theories should admit a finite description, we investigate the complexity of effective field theories using the framework of effective o-minimality. Our focus is on quantifying the geometric and logical information required to describe moduli spaces and quantum-corrected couplings. As a concrete setting, we study pure $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Yang-Mills theory along its quantum moduli space using Seiberg-Witten elliptic curves. We argue that the complexity computation should be organized in terms of local cells that cover the near-boundary regions where additional states become light, each associated with an appropriate duality frame. These duality frames are crucial for keeping the global complexity finite: insisting on a single frame extending across all such limits would yield a divergent complexity measure. This case study illustrates how tame geometry uses dualities to yield finite-complexity descriptions of effective theories and points towards a general framework for quantifying the complexity of the space of effective field theories.</description>

      <title>A Holographic Constraint on Scale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new consistency condition for the compatibility of a gravitational effective field theory in AdS with a dual holographic description in terms of a family of large-$N$ CFTs. Using large-$N$ factorization of correlation functions combined with a properly defined notion of single- and multi-particle operators, we argue that the cubic scalar bulk couplings for fields dual to operators with extremal arrangements of the conformal dimensions, i.e. $\Delta_i=\Delta_j+\Delta_k$, should vanish. We apply this criterion to the 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ effective supergravity theory describing the simplest DGKT AdS$_4$ vacua in type IIA string theory and show that it is non-trivially satisfied. In addition, we calculate explicitly all non-vanishing three-point correlation functions of low-lying scalar operators in the putative 3d CFTs dual to these AdS$_4$ string theory backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Singularities in Cosmological Loop Correlators II : Non Local Interactions and Flat Space limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-local interactions naturally arise in the ADM formalism after solving the constraint equations and substituting their solutions back into the action. However, the effects of these non-local operators on loop corrections to cosmological correlators remain largely unexplored. Extending the analysis of arXiv:2503.21880 , in this work we compute the $1$-loop bispectrum during slow-roll inflation, including the inverse-Laplacian operators present at cubic and quartic order in the ADM action (in the spatially flat gauge). These non-local vertices introduce non-trivial angular dependencies that significantly complicate the evaluation of loop integrals. We find that the diagrammatic rules of arXiv:2503.21880 for identifying poles and branch cuts in correlators without explicit integration remain valid even in the presence of such non-local interactions. Finally, we derive the flat-space limit of the $1$-loop inflationary correlator and verify it with explicit examples, thereby establishing a direct correspondence between its leading total-energy singularities ($\omega_T\rightarrow0$) and the flat-space scattering amplitude.</description>

      <title>Continuous Family of Conformal Field Theories and Exactly Marginal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does a conformal manifold imply the existence of exactly marginal operators? We answer this question affirmatively under the assumption that there exists a conformal interface with certain properties connecting nearby CFTs. We show that the exactly marginal operator that connects the CFTs can be reconstructed from the interface displacement operator. Our construction is model-independent and based on the general principles of conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Uniformly transcendental bases for protected two-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perturbative expansion of two-point functions of lowest dimension supersymmetric operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and ABJM theory exhibits uniform transcendental weight. Inspired by this, we construct an explicit basis of uniformly transcendental master integrals for these correlators, through four loops in four and three loops in three dimensions. In terms of these bases, the two-point functions simplify to rational linear combinations. Conversely, such explicit bases of uniformly transcendental integrals can be useful for other applications.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Spectral Form Factor of ABJM Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large-N index analog of the spectrum form factor for ABJM theory in the microcanonical ensemble. In the Cardy-like limit, the most dominant saddle describing the dual black hole decays rapidly at early times. However, the late-time behavior of the spectral form factor is determined by multi-cut saddles, which prevent it from decaying.</description>

      <title>A Master Superspace Action for 3D S-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a `master' partition function in three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superspace that realises, upon integrating out complementary superfields, both the electric Maxwell--Chern--Simons (MCS) theory and its magnetic $S$-dual: a non-gauge Deser--Jackiw self-dual massive vector times a decoupled level-$k$ Chern--Simons term. The two descriptions share the topological mass $M=\frac{g^{2}k}{2\pi}$ and obey an exact partition-function identity $\mathcal Z_{\rm mag}(g_m^2,k)=\mathcal Z_{\rm ele}(g_e^2,k)$ with $g_e g_m=2\pi$, mapping a weakly coupled MCS theory to a strongly coupled Deser--Jackiw CS theory. Special limits reproduce pure Chern--Simons/Gaiotto--Witten ($g^{2}=0$) and Maxwell/compact-scalar duality ($k=0$). We extend the construction to a non-Abelian U$(N)$ gauge group obtaining $\mathcal N=2$ Yang--Mills--Chern--Simons on the electric side and a massive non-gauge vector coupled to level-$k$ Chern--Simons on the magnetic side; the interaction terms between the massive vector and the Chern-Simons term vanish in the Abelian case. Decomposing the $\mathcal N=2$ vector into an $\mathcal N=1$ vector and a real-linear multiplet factorises the master action and yields the $\mathcal N=1$ counterparts. This uplifts the bosonic duality formulated recently to $\mathcal N=2$ and clarifies its non-Abelian and $\mathcal N=1$ reductions.</description>

      <title>A note on half-integer irregular representations of Virasoro algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study irregular representations of Virasoro algebra associated with half-integer order singularities, which arise naturally in the 2d CFT description of Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1, A_{\text{even}})$ and $(A_1, D_{\text{odd}})$. While integer-rank irregular states admit a well-established free-field construction, the half-integer case is more subtle due to the presence of branch cuts. In this note, we present two equivalent constructions of half-integer irregular representations. The first one is based on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-twisted free boson, which is motivated from the monodromy structure of Hitchin system. The second one employs a recursion relation of the Virasoro eigenvalues recently proposed in the literature. We explicitly demonstrate the equivalence of these two parameterization schemes at rank $3/2$ and $5/2$. Our analysis clarifies the structure of half-integer irregular modules and provides tools for computing the corresponding irregular states relevant for Argyres-Douglas theories.</description>

      <title>Approximating $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Chern-Simons theory by finite group gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by some previously known facts from mathematical and physics literature, we explore certain relations between 3-dimensional topological gauge theories with continuous and finite gauge groups, commonly known as Chern-Simons (CS) and Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories, respectively. Specifically, we consider the continuous and finite gauge groups to be the same algebraic group over the complex numbers and a finite field, respectively. In this paper, we focus on the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ example and consider the relationship on the level of the corresponding partition functions on closed 3-manifolds. Mathematically, these are Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev and DW invariants. We find that the asymptotics of the DW theory when the number of elements of the finite field is large recovers the leading asymptotics of the CS theory at large level when the 3-manifold contains no hyperbolic components. As a byproduct, we develop efficient techniques to count the number of points over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ of $\mathrm{SL}(2)$ representation varieties of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds, possibly with weights pulled back from a chosen class in $H^3(\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{F}_q),\mathrm{U}(1))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis primarily dives into investigating the details of four-dimensional vacua within String Theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the first and second part of the thesis, we study the fibred Calabi-Yau and M-theory moduli stabilization scenario. We consider both flux-stabilized models and non-perturbative stabilization methods. We perform a holographic analysis to determine the spectrum of the assumed dual $CFT_3$ to understand its AdS/CFT implications. For the flux stabilization, which relies on a large complex Chern-Simons invariant, moduli have integer dimensions similar to the DGKT flux-stabilized model in type IIA. For the non-perturbative stabilization, the results are similar to race-track models in type IIB.
  In the last part of the thesis, we solve the Wheeler DeWitt equation for the planar Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole in a minisuperspace approximation. We construct semiclassical Wheeler-DeWitt states from Gaussian wavepackets that are peaked on classical black hole interior solutions. By using the metric component $g_{xx}$ as a clock, these states are evolved through both the exterior and interior horizons. Close to the singularity, we show that quantum fluctuations in the wavepacket become important, and therefore the classicality of the minisuperspace approximation breaks down. Towards the AdS boundary, the Wheeler-DeWitt states are used to recover the Lorentzian partition function of the dual theory living on this boundary. This partition function is specified by an energy and a charge. Finally, we show that the Wheeler-DeWitt states know about the black hole thermodynamics, recovering the grand canonical thermodynamic potential after an appropriate averaging at the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>On the physical running of the electric charge in a dimensionless theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the renormalization of the gauge coupling in massless QED coupled to a scaleless quadratic theory of gravity. We compare two alternative prescriptions for the running of the electric charge: (i) the conventional $\mu$-running in minimal subtraction, and (ii) a ''physical'' running extracted from the logarithmic dependence of amplitudes on a hard scale $Q^{2}$ (e.g., $p^{2}$ or a Mandelstam invariant) after removing IR effects. At one loop, using dimensional regularization with an IR mass regulator $m$, we compute the photon vacuum polarization. We find a clean separation between UV and soft logarithms: the former is gauge and process independent and fixes the beta function, whereas the latter encodes nonlocal, IR-dominated contributions that may depend on gauge parameters and must not be interpreted as UV running. In the quadratic-gravity sector, the photon self-energy is UV finite--the $\ln\mu^{2}$ pieces cancel--leaving only $\ln(Q^{2}/m^{2})$ soft logs. Consequently, quadratic gravity does not modify the one-loop UV coefficient and thus does not alter $\beta(e)$. Therefore, the physical running coincides with the $\mu$-running in QED at one loop. Our analysis clarifies how to extract a gauge and process independent running in the presence of gravitational interactions and why soft logs from quadratic gravity should not contribute to $\beta(e)$.</description>

      <title>Modular Witten Diagrams and Quantum Extremality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study entanglement entropy for ball-shaped regions in excited states of holographic conformal field theories. The excited states are prepared by the Euclidean path integral in the CFT with a source turned on for some double-trace operator, with a small, $O(1)$ amplitude $\lambda$. On the gravity side, the double-trace operator deforms the bulk geometry as well as the entanglement structure of the state of bulk matter fields. By the quantum extremal surface formula, this leads to a deformation of the shape of the entanglement wedge, an effect which becomes manifest in the entanglement entropy at $O(\lambda^2 G_N)$. On the CFT side, we explicitly calculate the entanglement entropy perturbatively in the source amplitude to $O(\lambda^2)$, in terms of modular-flowed correlation functions of double-trace operators. We then evaluate these modular-flowed correlation functions using Witten diagrams. This calculation involves a Schwinger-Keldysh contour ordering prescription in the bulk, which we motivate using analytic continuation from Euclidean replica correlators. Focusing on a particular graviton-exchange diagram, we rewrite it in a form where it manifestly reproduces the canonical energy term present in the quantum Ryu-Takayanagi formula, including the shape deformation of the entanglement wedge due to backreaction and quantum effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a Wick rotation and analytic continuation from global AdS$_{d+1}$ to static dS$_{d+1}$, yielding CFT$_d$ generators with a nonstandard adjoint action tied to dS bulk coordinates. To reproduce the real-scalar two-point function, we introduce a global defect operator that twists the inner product. We further show that $PT$ symmetry is spontaneously broken in CFT$_2$ vacua with a central charge having an imaginary part. Finally, we derive integral identities for bulk and defect correlators, providing a unified framework for computing CFT$_d$ observables in the presence of global and local defects.</description>

      <title>Tree-Level Gravity Amplitudes at Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we study on-shell tree-level gravity amplitudes in the infinite momentum limit. In the case of the two-line BCFW shift, we have a famous improved behavior at infinity that allows for the amplitude to be reconstructed from the pole factorization. For other shifts, the poles at infinity are present and need to be considered, however general principles do not fix the residues of the amplitude on these poles. The web of all possible shifts is large, we focus primarily on a case of $(n{-}2)$-line anti-holomorphic shift, which also appears in the context of unitarity cuts of gravity loop integrands. We will find that for one class of shifts the gravity amplitudes at infinity exhibit a peculiar factorization property, quite different from the usual factorization on poles, while for other shifts, they evaluate to the same amplitude on shifted kinematics. We also discuss generalizations of our results to other anti-holomorphic shifts.</description>

      <title>Ultra-relativistic journeys through compact astrophysical objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that, for constant density stars, there is a critical value $\Lambda^{*}=1$ for the dimensionless density parameter $\Lambda\equiv 4\pi R^2\rho_{\text{max}}$ of the star above which the asymptotically measured travel time $T_{\text{s}}$ along a semi-circular trajectory that connects two antipodal points on the surface of the star is {\it shorter} than the travel time $T_{\text{c}}$ along the (shorter) straight-line trajectory that connects the two antipodal points through the center of the compact star [here $\{R,\rho_{\text{max}}\}$ are respectively the radius and the maximum density of the compact astrophysical object]. This intriguing observation provides a nice illustration of the general relativistic time dilation (redshift) effect in highly curved spacetimes. One expects that generic compact astrophysical objects whose dimensionless density parameters are smaller than some critical value $\Lambda^*$ would be characterized by the `normal' relation $T_{\text{c}}\leq T_{\text{s}}$ for the travel times between the two antipodal points. Motivated by this expectation, in the present paper we prove, using analytical techniques, that spherically symmetric compact astrophysical objects whose dimensionless density parameters are bounded from above by the model-independent relation $\Lambda\leq\Lambda^*={3\over2}[1-({{2}\over{\pi}})^{2/5}]$ are always (regardless of their inner density profiles) characterized by the normal dimensionless ratio $T_{\text{c}}/T_{\text{s}}\leq1$.</description>

Abstract: We numerically investigate particle production by a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) in spontaneous baryogenesis, focusing on large initial misalignment angles. Our analysis confirms the established cubic dependence of the baryon asymmetry on the initial phase for small angles. However, this scaling breaks down for larger angles, with particle production saturating as the initial phase approaches ${\pi}$ in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Geometry of non-Gaussianity in transient non-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models predicting abundant primordial black holes (PBHs) and large amplitude of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) often rely on amplified fluctuations over limited scales, typically driven by phase transitions, particle production, or departures from slow-roll evolution. While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra. In particular, and in contrast with the usual assumption, our results hint that the second-highest peak of the power spectrum may produce more PBHs than the highest peak.</description>

      <title>Weak Scale Triggers in the SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are no weak scale triggers in the SMEFT up to dimension six that can solve the hierarchy problem far above the weak scale. Our arguments can be used to show that the same is true at dimension eight. Weak scale triggers are local operators sensitive to the Higgs mass squared and they are needed in a large number of qualitatively different cosmological solutions to the hierarchy problem. These solutions have little in common besides the use of a trigger operator. We argue that focusing on the signatures of the three already-known trigger operators can lead to discover or exclude this class of solutions to the hierarchy problem.</description>

      <title>Correlation and Entanglement partners in Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify where the total correlations and entanglement with a chosen degree of freedom reside within the rest of a system, in the context of bosonic many-body Gaussian quantum systems. Our results are organized into two main propositions. First, for pure Gaussian states, we show that every correlated mode possesses a unique single-degree-of-freedom partner that fully captures its correlations (consisting of entanglement), and we provide an explicit construction of this partner from the complex structure of the system's state. Second, for mixed Gaussian states, we constructively demonstrate that the notion of a partner subsystem splits into two: a correlation partner, which contains all classical and quantum correlations and need not correspond to a single degree of freedom, and an entanglement partner, which is always at most single-mode. Finally, we extend the construction of partners to multi-mode subsystems. Together, these results provide conceptual practical tools to study how bipartite correlations and entanglement are structured and where they can be found in complex Gaussian many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Poisson brackets for the Camassa--Holm peakons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish quadratic Poisson brackets for the generalized Camassa--Holm peakon structure introduced in \cite{AFR23}. The calculation is based on the halving of the spectral parameter dependent $r$-matrix used to define the linear Poisson structure of this model. This quadratic structure, together with the linear one, establish the bi-Hamiltonian structure of the generalized Camassa--Holm peakon model. \\ When the deformation parameter tends to $\pm2$, the spectral parameter dependence drops out, and we recover the linear and quadratic Poisson structure of the Camassa--Holm peakon model. \\ When the spectral parameter tends to the fixed points of the involution defining the halving, we recover the Ragnisco--Bruschi deformation of the Camassa--Holm peakon model, thereby establishing its quadratic Poisson structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.1763(5)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</description>

      <title>TeV Scale Quark-Lepton Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quark-lepton symmetric Pati-Salam (PS) model based on the gauge group $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times SU(4)_C$ with an $E_6$-inspired particle spectrum which naturally accommodates a multi-TeV leptoquark gauge boson $X_\mu(3,1,\frac{2}{3})$. A softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry plays a crucial role in realizing this scenario, under which the Standard Model (SM) fermions are even, while new vector-like fermions present in the model are odd. A notable feature of this model is that the PS gauge boson $X_\mu$ itself is $Z_2$-odd, causing it to couple exclusively between SM fermions and the vector-like fermions, except in the right-handed down-quark sector, where mixing is induced by the soft breaking of $Z_2$. This structure leads to helicity suppression of tree-level meson decays mediated by $X_\mu$, with helicity-unsuppressed contributions arising only via one-loop diagrams. We show that $X_\mu$ can be as light as 1.1 TeV while being compatible with all flavor-violating constraints. However, mass relations among the $(W'^\pm_\mu, Z'_\mu, X_\mu)$ gauge bosons push the $X_\mu$ mass limit up to 4.3 TeV from the stringent LHC bounds on the $Z^\prime$ mass. This comparatively low PS-breaking scale opens up promising collider opportunities for probing the leptoquark gauge boson, as well as the distinctive signature of vector-like down-type quarks carrying an unusual baryon number of $2/3$. The model can be further tested via lepton flavor-violating processes induced by the leptoquark gauge boson, such as $\mu \to e \gamma$, $\mu \to e e e$, and $\mu$-$e$ conversion in nuclei. Neutrino masses arise in the model through dimension-seven operators at tree-level, as well as from dimension-five operators via one-loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>Network-Irreducible Multiparty Entanglement in Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the standard approach to characterize collective entanglement via genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) leads to an area law in ground and thermal Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians. To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an effective field theory (EFT) that captures the universal behavior of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) at late times in generic quantum many-body systems with conservation laws. The EFT hinges on a generalization of the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern adapted to out-of-time-order observables, and reduces to conventional fluctuating hydrodynamics when time-ordered observables are probed. We use the EFT to explain different power-law behavior observed in OTOCs at late times, and show that many OTOCs are entirely fixed by conventional transport data. Nevertheless, we show that a specific combination of OTOCs is sensitive to novel transport parameters, not visible in regular time-ordered correlators. We test our predictions in Hamiltonian and Floquet spin chains in one dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the feasibility of detecting gravitomagnetic effects generated by gravitational waves, by monitoring the relative orientation of the angular momentum vectors of test particles. We analyze the response of the relative angular momentum direction to all six polarization modes of gravitational waves and estimate the magnitude of its variation during gravitational wave events. Our findings indicate that when test particles possess magnetic moments, applying an external magnetic field of appropriate strength can induce resonant precession of the angular momentum direction under the influence of gravitational waves. This resonance may significantly amplify the gravitational wave signal, potentially enabling its detection with future gyroscope-based detectors. Such detectors would complement existing gravitational wave observatories that rely on gravitoelectric effects.</description>

      <title>The Arf-Brown-Kervaire invariant on a lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a lattice formulation of the Arf-Brown-Kervaire (ABK) invariant which takes values in $\mathbb{Z}_8$. Compared to the standard $\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of M\"obius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As in thermodynamics, the celebrated first law of black hole mechanics relates infinitesimal changes in the properties of nearby equilibrium states of black holes (without reference to any physical process that causes the transition). The second law is a qualitative statement that the area of an event horizon cannot decrease under appropriate physical assumptions. These laws are generalized. The new first law applies to black holes in general relativity that can be arbitrarily far from equilibrium and refers to \emph{finite} changes that occur due to \emph{physical processes}. The new second law is a \emph{quantitative} statement that relates the change in the dynamical horizon area with the flux of energy falling into the black hole in a physical process.6</description>

Abstract: In theories with extended scalar sectors the lightest new scalar degree of freedom might be accessible at colliders. Going beyond simplified models, such a theory can be described in a gauge-invariant and agnostic way via an EFT with a non-linearly realized electroweak symmetry. In this extended HEFT, depending on the $SU(2)$ nature of the new scalar in the UV, operators will be suppressed by different powers of a heavy mass scale. We use dimensional analysis to systematically evaluate expected hierarchies between Wilson coefficients, leading to structural relations between potential LHC observables, such as di-boson resonances, tau pair production or the di-photon channel. Once future collider data reveals a hint of a new scalar field, it can be fitted to this extended HEFT and such a structural analysis will help interpret it with respect to possible UV models, circumventing the need to individually test each possible model on the data or to fix the $SU(2)$ representation of the new scalar beforehand. For illustration, the framework is applied to the tentative 95 GeV resonance. In addition to its usefulness for collider physics, the extended HEFT can also be beneficial for low-energy observables, allowing to describe new scalars in an agnostic way.</description>

Abstract: Topological defects and operators give a far-reaching generalization of symmetries of quantum fields. An auxiliary topological field theory in one dimension higher than the QFT of interest, known as the SymTFT, provides a natural way for capturing such operators. This gives a new perspective on several applications of symmetries, but fails to capture continuous non-Abelian symmetries. The main aim of this work is to fill this gap. Guided by geometric engineering and holography, we recover various known features of representation theory of the non-Abelian symmetry from a SymTFT viewpoint. Central to our approach is a duality between (flat) free Yang-Mills and non-Abelian BF theories. Our results extend naturally to models without supersymmetry.</description>

Abstract: The Wakimoto-type free-field approach is applied to the boundary integer-level simple $\widehat{g}(k)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models, with a renewed motivation. With the introduction of the Lauricella hypergeometric functions $F_{D}^{(n)}$ and their analytical extensions, we could obtain all genus-zero bulk $n$-point functions explicitly, for rational conformal field theories (RCFTs) that admit a free-field approach. I present free-field expressions for $\widehat{g}(k)$ Ishibashi states, and provide simple example calculations in the simplest models. An extreme short discussion on potential generalizations of free-field approach to the logarithmic WZW models at the admissible levels is also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the photon self-energy to three loops in Quantum Electrodynamics. The method of differential equations for Feynman integrals and a complete $\epsilon$-factorization of the former allow us to obtain fully analytical results in terms of iterated integrals involving integration kernels related to a K3 geometry. We argue that our basis has the right properties to be a natural generalization of a canonical basis beyond the polylogarithmic case and we show that many of the kernels appearing in the differential equations, cancel out in the final result to finite order in $\epsilon$. We further provide generalized series expansions that cover the whole kinematic space so that our results for the self-energy may be easily evaluated numerically for all values of the momentum squared. From the local solution at $p^2=0$, we extract the photon wave function renormalization constant in the on-shell scheme to three loops and confirm its agreement with previously obtained results.</description>

Abstract: Holographic dualities that relate type II strings on near-horizon Dp brane geometries to super Yang-Mills theories with sixteen supercharges in p+1 dimensions provide non-conformal generalizations of the famous AdS/CFT correspondence. For the extremal case p=-1, this suggests a holographic duality for the IKKT matrix model - super Yang-Mills theory reduced to zero dimensions. Despite intriguing and highly non-trivial results in the IKKT model, this duality has remained largely unexplored so far. In this letter, we consider the lowest supermultiplet of gauge invariant operators of the model and identify its states with the lowest Kaluza-Klein fluctuations of (Euclidean) IIB supergravity on the D(-1) instanton background. We construct its holographic bulk realization as a one-dimensional maximal supergravity with 32 supercharges and local SO(10) invariance, capturing the full non-linear dynamics. Analyzing the bulk Killing spinor equations, we construct a general class of half-supersymmetric solutions, which typically break SO(10). We present their uplifts to IIB supergravity, and furthermore to pp-waves in twelve dimensions. These results provide the minimal setup for conducting precision tests of holography involving Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Bounds on complex structure moduli values for perturbative control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String compactification in the framework of the low energy effective supergravity requires the perturbative control in both the large volume and the weak coupling expansions. However, when the complex structure moduli couple to some lattice structure, the Sp$(2(h^{2,1}+1))$ symmetry of the tree level K\"ahler potential allows the correction to the K\"ahler potential to diverge in the large field limit of the complex structure moduli, resulting in the breakdown of the perturbative control. Here the lattice structure naturally appears in the presence of a tower of states like the Kaluza-Klein or the string modes, an essential ingredient of the distance conjecture. The similar situation can be found from the axio-dilaton contribution to the corrected K\"ahler potential, where the SL$(2, \mathbb{Z})$ symmetry as well as the coupling between the axio-dilaton and the lattice structure allow the correction to diverge in the weak coupling limit. In order to keep the perturbative control, the values of the complex structure moduli as well as the dilaton must have the upper bound, which is determined by the volume of the internal manifold and the string coupling constant, hence the Kaluza-Klein and the string mass scales. The form of the bounds are quite similar to that given by the distance conjecture, both prevents the descent of a tower of states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically construct asymptotically global $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ black holes in type IIB supergravity, with $\mathbb{R}_t \times SO(2) \times SO(3) \times U(1)^4$ symmetry, localised on the $\mathrm{S}^3$ and translationally invariant along the torus. These solutions, with horizons whose spatial cross sections have $\mathrm{S}^4 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ topology, dominate the microcanonical ensemble at low energies. At higher energies, a first-order phase transition occurs to $\mathrm{BTZ} \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ black holes $-$ possessing $\mathbb{R}_t \times SO(2) \times SO(4) \times U(1)^4$ symmetry and $\mathrm{S}^1 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ horizon topology. By the AdS/CFT correspondence, this transition reflects the spontaneous breaking of the $SO(4)$ R-symmetry of the D1-D5 CFT$_2$ to $SO(3)$. We also compute the expectation value of the scalar operator with lowest conformal dimension in the low-energy phase. Our $SO(3)$-localised black holes $-$ together with the $U(1)^2$-localised solutions of [1] $-$ point to a rich landscape of novel black holes that may approach the $\mathrm{CFT}_2$ sparseness bootstrap condition, and shed light on how macroscopic entanglement in thermal phases encodes microscopic structure via internal directions.</description>

Abstract: We refine and generalize the results of e-Print: 2307.10428 [hep-th], where evidence in favor of applying the non-Abelian localization method to handle the 4d Chern-Simons theory path integral formulation was presented. We show, via duality manipulations and invoking some symplectic geometry results, both inspired by the Beasley-Witten work e-Print: 0503126 [hep-th], that the path integral of a regularized version of the 4d Chern-Simons theory, formally takes the canonical symplectic form required by the method of non-Abelian localization. The new theory is defined on a deformed quotient space and interpolates between the conventional 3d Chern-Simons theory on a Seifert manifold M e-Print: 0503126 [hep-th], trivially embedded into $\mathbb{R}\times \text{M}$, and the Costello-Yamazaki e-Print: 1908.02289 [hep-th] 4d Chern-Simons theory defined on the same 4d manifold. It is also shown that the regularized theory is consistent, following an idea of Beasley e-Print: 0911.2687 [hep-th], with the insertion of coadjoint orbit defects of the 1d Chern-Simons theory type. This approach opens the possibility for using exact path integral methods to explore the quantum integrable structure of certain 2d integrable sigma models of the non-ultralocal type, which are widely known to be somehow immune to the use of more traditional quantization methods, like the algebraic Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>$F$-term Multi-Field Inflation in Supergravity without Stabiliser Superfields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realising $F$-term slow-roll inflation in supergravity is non-trivial due to the well-known $\eta$-problem. The common strategy to solve the problem is to impose a shift symmetry on the K\"ahler potential, but this often leads to a negative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an additional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired interaction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a stabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a single chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field components. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to multi-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for embedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into supergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of multi-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic instabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens the theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity.</description>

Abstract: The IKKT matrix model, from the holographic perspective, arises at the p=-1 endpoint of the family of dualities relating type II supergravities on near-horizon Dp-brane geometries to (p+1)-dimensional super Yang-Mills theories with sixteen supercharges. In this work, we detail and expand results reported in a recent letter by establishing the holographic dictionary between gauge-invariant operators in the lowest BPS multiplet of the matrix model and the corresponding Kaluza-Klein fluctuations of Euclidean IIB supergravity compactified on the D(-1) instanton background. The full non-linear dynamics of these fluctuations can be encoded in a one-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity, which we construct explicitly. We provide its complete Lagrangian, up to second order in fermions, together with the corresponding supersymmetry transformations. We further discuss real forms of the theory for non-compact gauge groups and their embeddings into ten-dimensional supergravities with Lorentzian signature. From the analysis of the one-dimensional Killing spinor equations, we derive different classes of half-supersymmetric solutions, and discuss their uplifts as well as their relations to known solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we describe how the study of backgrounds for general quantum systems can be formulated in terms of the representation theory of abstract $C^*$ algebras. We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions. To this end, we close with some remarks about how the operator algebra of a closed universe may arise from a generalized symmetry associated with an algebraic extension of the causal wedge by appealing to subregion-subalgebra duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an analogue information paradox in acoustic black holes which are emerged from the superfluid surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole. The resulting acoustic black hole contains both acoustic horizons and optical horizon, with analogue Hawking radiation, i.e. phonons, emitted from the outer acoustic horizon. By using the island formula, we calculate the entanglement entropy of analogue Hawking radiation of the acoustic black hole in both non-extremal and extremal cases. In the non-extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons follow the Page curve due to the emergence of islands, and it is approximately proportional to the area of the acoustic horizon at late time. While in the extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons diverges, leading to an ill-defined Page time. Our study verifies the unitarity of the analogue gravity system, and provides further insight into the connection between the entanglement entropy and the causal structure of spacetime.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study Dirac and Majorana neutrino oscillations in a magnetic field in the three-flavour case. A theoretical framework developed in \cite{Popov:2019} is extended to the case of three neutrino species, as well as to the Majorana neutrinos case. The closed expression for the Dirac neutrinos flavour and spin oscillations are given. Majorana neutrino oscillations are studied numerically. We show that the probabilities exhibit a complicated interplay of oscillation on magnetic $\mu_\nu B$ and vacuum $\Delta m^2_{ij}/2p$ frequencies. It is also shown that neutrino oscillations in an interstellar magnetic field can modify neutrino fluxes observed in neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Spaces of states of the two-dimensional O(n) and Potts models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the spaces of states of the two-dimensional $O(n)$ and $Q$-state Potts models with generic parameters $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ as representations of their known symmetry algebras. While the relevant representations of the conformal algebra were recently worked out, it remained to determine the action of the global symmetry groups: the orthogonal group for the $O(n)$ model, and the symmetric group $S_Q$ for the $Q$-state Potts model.
  We do this by two independent methods. First we compute the twisted torus partition functions of the models at criticality. The twist in question is the insertion of a group element along one cycle of the torus: this breaks modular invariance, but allows the partition function to have a unique decomposition into characters of irreducible representations of the global symmetry group.
  Our second method reduces the problem to determining branching rules of certain diagram algebras. For the $O(n)$ model, we decompose representations of the Brauer algebra into representations of its unoriented Jones--Temperley--Lieb subalgebra. For the $Q$-state Potts model, we decompose representations of the partition algebra into representations of the appropriate subalgebra. We find explicit expressions for these decompositions as sums over certain sets of diagrams, and over standard Young tableaux.
  We check that both methods agree in many cases. Moreover, our spaces of states are consistent with recent bootstrap results on four-point functions of the corresponding CFTs.</description>

      <title>Critical Probability Distributions of the order parameter at two loops I: Ising universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exists an entire family of universal PDFs of the magnetization mode of the three dimensional Ising model parameterized by $\zeta = \lim_{L,\xi_{\infty}}L/\xi_{\infty}$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously at fixed $\zeta$. Recently, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the magnetization mode of the three-dimensional Ising model has been computed at one-loop in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion [arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.12603 (2024)]. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed at second order of the perturbative expansion. We compute the whole family of universal rate-functions and show that their agreement with the Monte Carlo data improves significantly at this order when compared to their one-loop counterpart.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <title>CoMBolt-ITA, a Collective Model based on relativistic Boltzmann equation in the Isotropization Time Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new (2+1)-model is developed to investigate the collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. This framework couples pre-equilibrium dynamics with hydrodynamic evolution by solving the Boltzmann equation within the isotropization time approximation to simulate the dynamics of quasiparticle evolution. A numerical scheme based on the method of characteristics enables the evolution to begin from a specified initial Boltzmann distribution. In this work, the spatial structure of the initial distribution is modeled using the TrENTo framework. Our results show that a medium initialized at $\tau_0$ on the order of 1\,[fm/$c$] with a small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s = 0.008$) evolves consistently with hydrodynamic simulations, such as those performed using the VISH2+1 code, while discrepancies arise for a medium with $\eta/s = 0.8$. Furthermore, when initialized with a highly anisotropic momentum distribution in the longitudinal direction at early times, the system exhibits spatially non-uniform thermalization in the transverse plane, leading to the emergence of a nontrivial hypersurface that marks the onset of hydrodynamic applicability. Finally, we compute the $p_T$-spectra for a non-fluctuating initial condition using the hybrid version of CoMBolt-ITA. In this hybrid setup, the description is switched from quasiparticles to hadrons, and UrQMD is used to model the hadron gas dynamics. We compare these results with those obtained from the hybrid VISH2+1 initialized within the same setup. For a small shear viscosity, $\eta/s = 0.08$, the two results show a good level of consistency, whereas for a larger value, $\eta/s = 0.8$, a noticeable discrepancy emerges.</description>

      <title>Canonical Structure and Hidden Symmetries in Scalar Field Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate hidden symmetries in minimally coupled scalar field cosmology within the FLRW universe, and a perfect fluid with and without interaction to the scalar field. We show that for an exponential potential there exists a set of canonical transformations through which the cosmological field equations can be recast in the form of a free particle in flat space. Based on this equivalence, we construct a mapping that generates cosmological solutions with interaction terms, corresponding to a chameleon mechanism. Finally, we discuss how this class of canonical transformations can relate the solution spaces of different cosmological models, such as of the scalar field and of the $\Lambda$-Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing effects of black holes with quantum hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the no-hair theorem, stationary black holes are uniquely characterized by their mass, charge, and angular momentum. In this paper, we explore quantum hair by deriving the quantum-corrected black hole metric within the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky formalism. The quantum-corrected metric is obtained perturbatively around flat spacetime without assuming either the commutativity between the nonlocal operator and covariant derivatives or the nonlocal Gauss-Bonnet theorem, both of which are adopted in previous studies. Using this metric, we evaluate the deflection angle in the strong-field limit and compute the associated strong gravitational lensing observables, such as the angular separation and the relative magnification. Our results show that as the quantum hair, determined by the number of virtual massless quantum fields in the nonlocal effective action, increases, the photon sphere radius, the strong deflection angle, and the relative magnification all increase, whereas the angular separation decreases. As a result, we demonstrate that the quantum hair affects not only the black hole geometry but also its strong gravitational lensing effects.</description>

      <title>Zero modes and index theorems for non-Hermitian Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dirac fermions, subject to external magnetic fields and in the presence of mass orders that assume topologically nontrivial spatial textures such as domain wall and vortices, for example, bind robust midgap states at zero energy, the number of which is governed by the Aharonov-Casher and Jackiw-Rebbi or Jackiw-Rossi index theorems, respectively. Here I extend the jurisdiction of these prominent index theorems to Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac operators, constructed by augmenting the celebrated Dirac Hamiltonian by a masslike anti-Hermitian operator that also scales linearly with momentum. The resulting NH Dirac operator manifests all-real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, characterized by a real effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions ($v_{_{\rm F}}$). From the explicit solutions of the zero-energy bound states, I show that in the presence of external magnetic fields of arbitrary shape such modes always exist when the system encloses a finite number of magnetic flux quanta, while in the presence of spatially nontrivial textures of the mass orders localized zero-energy modes can only be found in the spectrum when $v_{_{\rm F}}$ is real. These findings pave a concrete route to realize nucleation of competing orders from the topologically robust zero-energy manifold in NH or open Dirac systems. Possible extensions of these outcomes to other index theorems and tabletop experimental setups to test these predictions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Frequency-domain self-force calculations using Gegenbauer reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of the Gegenbauer procedure for time-domain reconstruction in frequency-domain calculations of the self-force on a particle orbiting a black hole. The conventional technique relies on the so-called method of extended homogeneous solutions (EHSs), which circumvents the Gibbs phenomenon that would otherwise hamper the reconstruction of the particle's field from frequency modes. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of EHS reconstruction deteriorates rapidly with increasing orbital eccentricity, due to large numerical cancellations between frequency-mode contributions. Furthermore, the method is only suitable for bound orbits and cannot be fully applied in scattering scenarios. The Gegenbauer reconstruction procedure involves a reprojection of the partial Fourier representation onto a complementary basis of polynomials. The resulting series converges exponentially while averting the cancellation problem. We demonstrate the procedure with numerical results for the spherical harmonic modes of the scalar field sourced by a scalar charge in orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We illustrate the merits of this approach, and discuss the challenges that remain for a full Gegenbauer-based self-force calculation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional models of critical non-intersecting loops, there are $\ell$-leg fields that insert $\ell\in\mathbb{N}^*$ open loop segments, and diagonal fields that change the weights of closed loops. We conjecture an exact formula for 3-point functions of such fields on the sphere. In the cases of diagonal or spinless 2-leg fields, the conjecture agrees with known results from Conformal Loop Ensembles.
  We numerically compute 3-point functions in loop models on cylindrical lattices, using transfer matrix techniques. The results agree with the conjecture in almost all cases. We attribute the few discrepancies to difficulties that can arise in our lattice computation when the relevant modules of the unoriented Jones-Temperley--Lieb algebra have degenerate ground states.</description>

      <title>Phase structure analysis of 2d lattice CP(1) model with $\theta$ term using tensor renormalization group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of a two-dimensional lattice CP(1) model with a $\theta$ term. In particular, we aim to identify a critical region expected to exist along a $\theta=\pi$ line. To explore the phase structure non-perturbatively and avoid the sign problem, we employ the tensor renormalization group method. We make two improvements compared to previous tensor network studies. The first improvement involves refining the initial tensor. Specifically, we construct it using a quadrature method, which achieves higher accuracy compared to the conventional approach. The second improvement consists of analyzing the phase structure using the information of the conformal field theory, namely the central charge and the scaling dimensions, which can be accessed relatively easily via the tensor renormalization group method. Thanks to these improvements, we identify both the onset of the critical region, $\beta_{\rm c}=0.5952(8)$ and its universality class as the SU(2)${}_{k=1}$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.</description>

      <title>Ergoregion instability in bosonic stars: scalar mode structure, universality, and weakly nonlinear effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracompact spinning horizonless spacetimes with ergoregions are subject to the ergoregion instability. We systematically investigate the instability of a massless scalar field in a variety of rapidly spinning Proca stars and boson stars using WKB-, frequency-, and time-domain methods. We find universal features in the mode structure: the onset of the instability is signaled by a zero-mode, the mode frequencies and growth rates are related by a simple scaling relation in the small-frequency limit (as found for Kerr-like objects), the mode frequencies approach the orbital frequency of counter-rotating stably trapped null geodesics in the eikonal limit, and for each unstable azimuthal mode only a finite number of overtones and polar modes are exponentially growing. The e-folding times are as short as $\tau\sim 10^4 M$ (in terms of the spacetime's ADM mass $M$). Interestingly, we find a near universal relationship between the frequencies and growth rates across all bosonic stars and also compared with Kerr-like objects. Furthermore, we show that weakly nonlinear backreaction of the instability induces a shift in growth rates as well as emission of gravitational waves; we find evidence that these effects lead to an amplification of the unstable process. This suggests that strongly nonlinear interactions are important during the gravitational saturation of the instability.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity of a binary mixture for a relativistic fluid at high temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of the shear viscosity is a central topic in various areas of modern physics. In particular, it is often necessary to evaluate the shear viscosity $\eta$ of fluids made up of more than one species, all interacting with different cross sections. Since it may be difficult to extract information on the interaction among different species, various combinations of the viscosities of the individual components are often used. We work in the Chapman-Enskog framework and investigate on binary mixtures, by comparing such single component combinations with a full 2-component formalism: we find that, in most cases, the full viscosity is well approximated by a weighted linear average of the single component viscosities, although this result is far from being general. Moreover, we validate our 2-component Chapman-Enskog results for $\eta$ by comparing them with an independent numerical simulation of the Boltzmann equation, which estimates the shear viscosity via a Green-Kubo formula, in the case of a quasi-particle system that reproduces lattice QCD thermodynamics. We see that the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ of such system of quarks and gluons is not well described by combinations of the individual components, highlighting the importance of inter-species scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit black hole perturbations through Heun differential equations, focusing on Frobenius power-series solutions near regular singularities and their connection formulas. Central to our approach is the notion of a cline in the complex plane, which organizes singular points of the differential equations and remain invariant under M\"obius transformations. Building on the cline structure we identified in black hole horizons, we carry out a systematic reduction and relocation of poles in the differential equation to obtain explicit representations of the solutions. We illustrate our approach by extracting the scalar perturbation solutions for the 7-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole and deriving the static scalar tidal Love numbers. These results suggest that clines expose a M\"obius-invariant order within black hole perturbations, rendering black hole perturbation problems remarkably tractable.</description>

      <title>Statistical Field Theory of Interacting Nambu Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a statistical field theory for classical Nambu dynamics by employing partially the method of quantum field theory. One of unsolved problems in Nambu dynamics has been to extend it to interacting systems without violating a generalized canonical structure associated with the presence of multiple Hamiltonians, which together govern the dynamics of time evolution on an equal footing. In the present paper, we propose to include interactions from the standpoint of classical statistical dynamics by formulating it as a field theory on Nambu's generalized phase space in an operator formalism. We first construct a general framework for such a field theory and its probabilistic interpretation. Then, on the basis of this new framework, we give a simple model of self-interaction in a many-body Nambu system treated as a closed dynamical system satisfying the H-theorem. It is shown that a generalized micro-canonical ensemble and a generalized canonical ensemble characterized by many temperatures are reached dynamically as equilibrium states, starting with certain classes of initial non-equilibrium states via continuous Markov processes. Compared with the usual classical statistical mechanics on the basis of standard Hamiltonian dynamics, some important new features associated with Nambu dynamics will emerge, with respect to the symmetries underlying dynamics of the non-equilibrium as well as the equilibrium states and also to some conceptual properties, such as a formulation of a generalized KMS-like condition characterizing the generalized canonical equilibrium states and a `relative' nature of the temperatures.</description>
