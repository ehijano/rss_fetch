      <title>Stochastic Calculus Approach to Thermodynamics of Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic thermodynamics is the field of study relating fluctuations in stochastic systems to thermodynamic quantities. The total entropy production (EP), is central to the thermodynamic classification of systems. Non-equilibrium systems manifestly all have non-zero EP and therefore impose an "arrow of time". Thermodynamic inequalities are lower bounds on the total EP and are especially useful when only parts of systems are operationally accessible. We use a stochastic calculus approach to directly derive and generalise three classes of inequalities for Markov jump processes using correlations of path observables, e.g., currents and densities. Our theoretical predictions are compared with simulations, where a good agreement is observed. The thermodynamic bounds we investigate include the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), thermodynamic transport bound (TB), and thermodynamic correlation bound (CB). We provide insight into the saturation conditions for these bounds and to what degree saturation can be achieved. Additionally, for the TUR and TB, we show how the bounds are related, which includes identifying a diffusion coefficient for jump dynamics. %An example using a toy model shows how the CB may yield a negative lower bound on the total entropy production, contrary to the non-negative bound that the TUR and TB yield. Comparisons are drawn between the TUR and TB for relaxation and stationary processes in biologically relevant settings. Specifically, calmodulin folding dynamics and secondary active transport, where differences in long-time relaxation and convergence are observed. For a systematic way to construct models, we formulate two methods to drive systems out of equilibrium without changing the stationary probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization and the route to ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a minimal model for quantum thermalization of coupled chaotic subsystems. The route towards ergodicity is explored as a function of the coupling strength. The results are contrasted with the predictions of standard Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and the Eigenstates Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We highlight a coupling regime of disparity between the spectral statistics that indicates chaos, and ergodicity measures that indicate lack of ETH thermalization. The analysis involves a revision of the energy shell concept, in a way that is consistent but independent of the semiclassical perspective.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Large Events in Directed Sandpiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of predictability of large avalanche events in the directed sandpile model is studied. A waiting time based prediction strategy which exploits the local anticorrelation of large events is discussed. With this strategy we show analytically and numerically that large events are predictable to some extent, and that this predictability persists in the thermodynamic limit. We introduce another strategy which predicts large avalanches in the future based on the present excess density in the sandpile. We obtain the exact conditional probabilities for large events given an excess density, and use this to determine the exact form of the ROC predictability curves. We show that for this strategy, the model is predictable only for finite lattice sizes, and unpredictable in the thermodynamic limit. This behaviour is to be contrasted with previously established numerical studies carried out for Manna sandpiles.</description>

      <title>Percolation of random compact diamond-shaped systems on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study site percolation on a square lattice with random compact diamond-shaped neighborhoods. Each site $s$ is connected to others within a neighborhood in the shape of a diamond of radius $r_s$, where $r_s$ is uniformly chosen from the set $\{i, i+1, \ldots, m\}$ with $i \leq m$. The model is analyzed for all values of $i = 0, \ldots, 7$ and $m = i, \ldots, 10$, where $\overline{z}(i,m)$ denotes the average number of neighbors per site and $p_c(i,m)$ is the critical percolation threshold. For each fixed $i$, the product $\overline{z}(i,m)\,p_c(i,m)$ is found to converge to a constant as $m \to \infty$. Such behavior is expected when $i=m$ (single diamond sizes), for which the product $\overline{z}(i)\,p_c(i)$ tends toward $2^d\eta_c$, where $\eta_c$ is the continuum percolation threshold for diamond-shaped regions or aligned squares in two dimensions ($d=2$). This case is further examined for $i = 1, \ldots, 10$, and the expected convergence is confirmed. The particular case $i = m$ was first studied numerically by Gouker and Family in 1983. We also study the relation to systems of deposited diamond-shaped objects on a square lattice. For monodisperse diamonds of radius $r$, there is a direct mapping to percolation with a diamond-shaped neighborhood of radius $2r+1$, but when there is a distribution of object sizes, there is no such mapping. We study the case of mixtures of diamonds of radius $r=0$ and $r=1$, and compare it to the continuum percolation of disks of two sizes.</description>

      <title>$1/f$ noise in extremal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bak-Sneppen (BS) evolution model remains a well-studied example of self-organized criticality (SOC). We propose a simple variant of the BS model, where the global fitness fluctuations show $1/f^{\alpha}$ noise with a spectral exponent nearly equal to 1 (pink noise). To further corroborate, we compute the two-time autocorrelation function that decays logarithmically. The $1/f$ noise in the global fitness is robust and hyper-universal. We identify the dominance of non-trivial local fitness cross-power spectra.</description>

      <title>Momentum distribution and correlation of free particles in the Tsallis statistics using conventional expectation value and equilibrium temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We applied the Tsallis statistics with the conventional expectation value to a system of free particles, adopting the equilibrium temperature which is often called the physical temperature. The entropic parameter $q$ in the Tsallis statistics is less than one for power-law-like distribution. The well-known relation between the energy and the temperature in the Boltzmann--Gibbs statistics holds in the Tsallis statistics, when the equilibrium temperature is adopted. We derived the momentum distribution and the correlation in the Tsallis statistics. The momentum distribution and the correlation in the Tsallis statistics are different from those in the Boltzmann--Gibbs statistics, even when the equilibrium temperature is adopted. These quantities depend on $q$ and $N$, where $N$ is the number of particles. The correlation exists even for free particles. The parameter $q$ satisfies the inequality $1-1/(3N/2+1) &lt; q &lt; 1$.</description>

      <title>The planar parafermion algebra: The $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ clock model and the coupled Temperley-Lieb algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian of the $N$-state clock model is written in terms of a coupled Temperley-Lieb (TL) algebra defined by $N-1$ types of TL generators. This generalizes a previous result for $N=3$ obtained by J. F. Fjelstad and T. M\r{a}nsson [J. Phys. A {\bf 45} (2012) 155208]. The $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric clock chain Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the coupled TL algebra generalizes the well known correspondence between the $N$-state Potts model and the TL algebra. The algebra admits a pictorial description in terms of a planar algebra involving parafermionic operators attached to $n$ strands. A key ingredient in the resolution of diagrams is the string Fourier transform. The pictorial presentation also allows a description of the Hilbert space. We also give a pictorial description of the representation related to the staggered XX spin chain. Just as the pictorial representation of the TL algebra has proven to be particularly useful in providing a visual and intuitive way to understand and manipulate algebraic expressions, it is anticipated that the pictorial representation of the coupled TL algebra may lead to further progress in understanding various aspects of the $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ clock model, including the superintegrable chiral Potts model.</description>

      <title>Self-organisation -- the underlying principle and a general model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of coordinated self-organisation (SO) of stress and structure in granular systems provide insight into the fundamental principle underlying this phenomenon. It is first argued here that SO emerges when a minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization in a dimerized J1-J2 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the J1-J2 frustrated Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with dimerization ({\delta}) or modulation in the nearest-neighbor couplings to investigate its thermalization behavior. While the dimerization tends to induce localization, the next-nearest-neighbor interaction J2 generally favors thermalization, making the assessment of the model's compliance with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) particularly subtle. The challenge is further compounded by the model's SU(2) symmetry; the study of ETH compliance is necessarily done for each symmetry sector but separating different sectors of this symmetry is known to be a computationally demanding task. The current study is driven by two main motivations: first, to explore whether the well-known ground-state phases of the model have any bearing on its thermalization properties; and second, to understand how the interplay between two competing factors, namely, the non-uniformity (via {\delta}) and the beyond-nearest-neighbor interactions (via J2) governs the system's approach to thermal equilibrium. A systematic analysis shows that the ETH is most strongly satisfied for intermediate values of {\delta} (~ 0.5) with J2 ranging from intermediate (~ 0.5) to large (~ 1)- a parameter regime falls within the spiral ground-state phase. It is also found that when the system is in the gapless ground-state phase (which falls within the N'eel phase), the ETH is more prone to violation. In the regime of large {\delta} and small J2, the system is seen to enter a localized phase (characterized here by modulation in density-of-states; assessing ETH compliance is less meaningful for this phase.</description>

      <title>On thermalization of a system with discrete phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermalization of a stochastic system with discrete phase space, initially at equilibrium at temperature $T_i$ and then termalizing in an environment at temperature $T_f$ , considering both cases $T_i &gt; T_f$ and $T_i &lt; T_f$. For the simple case of a system with constant energy gaps, we show that the relation between the time scales of the cooling and heating processes is not univocal, and depends on the magnitude of the energy gap itself. Specifically the eigenvalues of the corresponding stochastic matrix set the time scales of the relaxation process and for large energy gaps the cooling process is found to exhibit the shortest relaxation times to equilibrium while the heating process is found to be faster at all scales for small gaps. We consider both the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Fisher information and its related quantities to quantify the degree of thermalization of the system. In the intermediate to long time regime both quantities are found to bear the same type of information concerning the rate of thermalization, and follow the ordering predicted by the dynamic eigenvalues. We then consider a more complex system with a more intricate stochastic matrix, namely a 1D Ising model, and confirm the findings on the existence of two regimes, one in which cooling becomes faster than heating. We make contact with a previous work where an harmonic oscillator was used as working fluid and the heating process was always found to be faster than the cooling one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and correlations defines a new playground to study boundary criticality in quantum systems. We employ large scale auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a two-dimensional Kane-Mele-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice with zig-zag edges and the Hubbard U-term tuned to the three-dimensional XY bulk critical point. Upon varying the Hubbard-U term on the edge we observe a boundary phase transition from an ordinary phase with a helical Luttinger liquid edge decoupled from the critical bulk to an extraordinary-log phase characterized by a logarithmically diverging spin stiffness. We find that the spectral functions exhibit distinct features in the two phases giving potential experimental signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model: Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.</description>

      <title>Force and geometric signatures of the creep-to-failure transition in a granular pile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular creep is the slow, sub-yield movement of constituents in a granular packing due to the disordered nature of its grain-scale interactions. Despite the ubiquity of creep in disordered materials, it is still not understood how to best predict the creep-to-failure regime based on the forces and interactions among constituents. To address this gap, we perform experiments to explore creep and failure in quasi two-dimensional piles of photoelastic disks, allowing the quantification of both grain movements and grain-scale contact force networks. Through controlled external disturbances, we investigate the emergence and evolution of grain rearrangements, force networks, and voids to illuminate signatures of creep and failure. Surprisingly, the force chain structure remains dynamic even in the absence of particle motion. We find that shifts in force chains provide an indication to larger, avalanche-scale disruptions. We reveal connections between these force signatures and the geometry of the voids in the pile. Overall, our novel experiments and analyses deepen our mechanical and geometric understanding of the creep-to-failure transition in granular systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of quantum coherence on the dynamics and thermodynamics of quenched free fermions coupled to a localized defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and thermodynamics of free fermions suddenly coupled to a localized defect in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. This setup realizes a quantum quench transformation that gives rise to the orthogonalization of the system's wave-function as an effect of the localized perturbation. Using the Loschmidt echo and the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution of the work done by the defect, we quantify the extent and rate of the orthogonalization dynamics. In particular, we show that initializing the system in a coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates leads to non-classical features, such as Wigner function's negativity and non-positivity of the work KDQ distribution. Starting from simple single-particle superpositions and then progressing with coherent and cat states of few-body fermionic systems, we uncover how quantum coherence and few-body correlations shape the out-of-equilibrium response due to the presence of the defect.</description>

      <title>The Philosophy and Physics of Duality</title>

Abstract: This monograph discusses dualities in physics: what dualities are, their main examples--from quantum mechanics and electrodynamics to statistical mechanics, quantum field theory and string theory--and the philosophical questions they raise. Part I first conceptualises dualities and discusses their main roles and themes, including how they are related to familiar notions like symmetry and interpretation. It also discusses the main simple examples of dualities: position-momentum, wave-particle, electric-magnetic, and Kramers-Wannier dualities. Part II discusses advanced examples and their inter-relations: particle-soliton dualities, electric-magnetic dualities in quantum field theories, dualities in string theory, and gauge-gravity duality. This Part ends with discussions of the hole argument, and how string theory counts the microstates of a black hole. Part III is an in-depth discussion of general philosophical issues on which dualities bear: theoretical equivalence (two theories 'saying the same thing, in different words'), scientific realism and the under-determination of theories by data, theory succession and the M-theory programme, explanation, and scientific understanding. It proposes a view of scientific theories that it dubs 'the geometric view of theories'. The book's treatment of the examples is at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level, starting from elementary and progressing to more advanced examples. The discussions of philosophical topics, such as referential semantics, theoretical equivalence, scientific realism and scientific understanding, are both self-contained and in-depth. Thus the book is aimed at students and researchers with an interest in the physical examples and philosophical questions about dualities, and also in how physics and philosophy can fruitfully interact with each other.</description>

      <title>Floquet theory and applications in open quantum and classical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews theoretical methods for analyzing Floquet engineering (FE) phenomena in open (dissipative) quantum or classical systems, with an emphasis on our recent results. In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum systems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum systems, that is based on the Schr\"odinger equation. However, if we consider the FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but finite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is inevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative systems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation. In particular, we show that a nonequilibrium steady state appears after a long driving due to the balance between the energy injection by the driving field and the release to the bath. In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet theory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation of motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied only to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution function of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can arrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems. We illustrate the essence of the Floquet theory for classical systems. On top of fundamentals of the Floquet theory, we review representative examples of FEs (Floquet topological insulators, inverse Faraday effects in metals and magnets, Kapitza pendulum, etc.) and dissipation-assisted FEs.</description>

      <title>Path-Integral Formulation of Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Monte Carlo stochastic trajectories using the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q Functions and Hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability, which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral, and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on an earlier work by Alm, we consider a model of weighted self-avoiding walks on a generic lattice and develop a systematic method for deriving upper bounds on the corresponding weighted connective constant. These bounds are obtained as the dominant eigenvalues of certain matrices and provide detailed information about the domain of convergence of the model's multivariate generating function. We discuss potential applications of this framework to developing Peierls-type estimates for contour models in statistical physics with anisotropic weights, generalizing a technique recently introduced by Fahrbach--Randall.</description>

      <title>Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of charged solid-liquid interfaces with different water models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aqueous solid-liquid interfaces (SLI) are ubiquitous in nature and technology, often hosting molecular-level processes with macroscopic consequences. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a tool of choice to investigate interfacial phenomena with atomistic precision, but there exists a large number of water models, each optimised for a different purpose. Here we compare the ability of common water models to accurately simulate the interface between a charged silica surface and an aqueous solution containing NaCl. We first compare the bulk dielectric constant of water and its dependence on salt concentration for SPC/Fw, SPC/e, TIPS3p, H2O/DC, TIP3P-Fw, OPC3, TIP3P, TIP3P-FB, TIP3P-ST, FBA/e, and TIPS3p-PPPM, revealing large variations between models. Simulating the interface with silica for the most suitable water models (SPC/Fw, H2O/DC, TIP3-ST and TIPS3p-PPPM) show some intrinsic consistency with continuum predictions (Poisson-Boltzmann) whereby the free energy minima obtained from MD and the analytical model are in agreement, provided the latter includes the MD-determined total charge of ions in the Stern layer and dielectric constant. This consistency stands even for water models with a dielectric constant off by 10%. For salt concentrations higher than 0.21 M NaCl, the formation of random ion-ion pairs limits the reproducibility of the MD results and the applicability of the analytical method. The results highlight the applicability of the analytical model down to the nanoscale, provided a priory knowledge of the Stern layer charge is available. The findings could have significant implications for MD simulations of SLIs, especially at charged or electrified interfaces.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory approach to describe ice crystals habit evolution in ice clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice clouds, particularly cirrus clouds, significantly influence Earth's radiative balance but remain poorly characterized in current climate models. A major uncertainty arises from the variability of their microphysical properties, especially the evolution of ice crystal habits under depositional growth. We propose a heuristic method to describe habit evolution based on four fundamental shapes identified in the literature and from in situ observations: droxtals, plates, columns, and rosettes. These represent the primary forms that are relevant under depositional growth, excluding aggregation. In this study, we employ a non-Abelian gauge theory within a field-theoretical framework, imposing an SU(2) $\otimes$ U(1) symmetry on the fields associated with each habit probability growth. This symmetry enables the derivation of a modified system of coupled Fokker-Planck equations, capturing the stochastic growth dynamics of ice crystals while incorporating phenomenological mutual influences among habits. This framework outlines a novel theoretical direction for integrating symmetry principles and field-theoretical tools into the modelling of habit dynamics in ice clouds.</description>

      <title>Thermal effects in conformal field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) are special classes of quantum field theories that find applications ranging from critical phenomena to theories of quantum gravity via holography. Understanding thermal effects in CFTs is crucial: criticality is experimentally probed at finite temperature, and, from the holographic perspective, the study of thermal CFTs is dual to the study of black holes in Anti-de Sitter space. In this thesis, we explore the kinematics and dynamics of finite-temperature CFTs by analyzing broken and unbroken symmetries and adapting various analytical and numerical bootstrap approaches to finite-temperature correlation functions. These methods are non-perturbatively valid and can be tested against exactly solvable models, such as free theories and two-dimensional systems, as well as compared with perturbative calculations. The main applications discussed in this thesis concern one- and two-point functions and the free energy density in the O(N) models in three dimensions, with particular focus on the 3d Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (N = 1,2,3).</description>

      <title>Diverging conditional correlation lengths in the approach to high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Markov length was recently proposed as an information-theoretic diagnostic for quantum mixed-state phase transitions [Sang &amp; Hsieh, Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 070403 (2025)]. Here, we show that the Markov length diverges even under classical stochastic dynamics, when a low-temperature ordered state is quenched into the high temperature phase. Conventional observables do not exhibit growing length scales upon quenching into the high-temperature phase; however, the Markov length grows exponentially in time. Consequently, the state of a system as it heats becomes increasingly non-Gibbsian, and the range of its putative "parent Hamiltonian" must diverge with the Markov length. From this information-theoretic point of view the late-time limit of thermalization is singular. We introduce a numerical technique for computing the Markov length based on matrix-product states, and explore its dynamics under general thermal quenches in the one-dimensional classical Ising model. For all cases, we provide simple information-theoretic arguments that explain our results.</description>

      <title>Neural subspaces, minimax entropy, and mean-field theory for networks of neurons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in experimental techniques enable the simultaneous recording of activity from thousands of neurons in the brain, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge: to build meaningful, scalable models of large neural populations. Correlations in the brain are typically weak but widespread, suggesting that a mean-field approach might be effective in describing real neural populations, and we explore a hierarchy of maximum entropy models guided by this idea. We begin with models that match only the mean and variance of the total population activity, and extend to models that match the experimentally observed mean and variance of activity along multiple projections of the neural state. Confronted by data from several different brain regions, these models are driven toward a first-order phase transition, characterized by the presence of two nearly degenerate minima in the energy landscape, and this leads to predictions in qualitative disagreement with other features of the data. To resolve this problem we introduce a novel class of models that constrain the full probability distribution of activity along selected projections. We develop the mean-field theory for this class of models and apply it to recordings from 1000+ neurons in the mouse hippocampus. This 'distributional mean--field' model provides an accurate and consistent description of the data, offering a scalable and principled approach to modeling complex neural population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement patterns of quantum chaotic Hamiltonians with a scalar U(1) charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our current understanding of quantum chaos in many-body quantum systems hinges on the random matrix theory(RMT) behavior of eigenstates and their energy level statistics. Although RMT has been remarkably successful in describing `coarse' features of many-body quantum Hamiltonians in chaotic regimes, such as the Wigner-Dyson level spacing statistics or the volume-law behavior of eigenstate entanglement entropy, it remains a challenge to describe their `finer' features, particularly those arising from spatial locality. Here, we show that we can accurately describe the statistical behavior of eigenstate ensembles in many-body Hamiltonians by using pure random states with physical constraints that capture the essential features of the Hamiltonian, specifically spatial locality and symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on local spin Hamiltonians with a scalar U(1) charge. By constructing ensembles of constrained random states that account for two commuting scalar charges playing the role of energy and magnetization, we describe the patterns of entanglement of mid-spectrum eigenstates beyond their average volume-law behavior, including $O(1)$ corrections and fluctuations, analytically and numerically. When defining the correspondence between quantum chaotic eigenstates in many-body Hamiltonians and RMT ensembles, our work highlights the important role played by spatial locality in describing universal features beyond the volume-law behavior.</description>

      <title>Universal Linear Response of First-Passage Kinetics: A Framework for Prediction and Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-passage processes are pervasive across numerous scientific fields, yet a general framework for understanding their response to external perturbations remains elusive. While the fluctuation-dissipation theorem offers a complete linear response theory for systems in steady-state, it fails to apply to transient first-passage processes. We address this challenge by focusing on rare - rather than weak - perturbations. Surprisingly, we discover that the linear response of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to such perturbations is universal. It depends solely on the first two moments of the unperturbed first-passage time and the mean completion time following perturbation activation, without any assumptions about the underlying system's dynamics. To demonstrate the utility of our findings, we analyze the MFPT response of drift-diffusion processes in two scenarios: (i) stochastic resetting with information feedback, and (ii) an abrupt transition from a linear to a logarithmic potential. In both cases, our approach bypasses the need for explicit determination of the perturbed dynamics, unraveling a highly non-trivial response landscape with minimal effort. Finally, we show how our framework enables a new type of experiment - inferring molecular-level fluctuations from bulk measurements, a feat previously believed to be impossible. Overall, the newly discovered universality reported herein offers a powerful tool for predicting the impact of perturbations on kinetic processes - and, remarkably, for extracting hidden single-molecule fluctuations from accessible bulk measurements.</description>

      <title>More on the Operator Space Entanglement (OSE): R\'enyi OSE, revivals, and integrability breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the R\'enyi Operator Space Entanglement ($OSE$) entropies $S_n$ across several one-dimensional integrable and chaotic models. As a paradigmatic integrable system, we first consider the so-called rule $54$ chain. Our numerical results reveal that the R\'enyi $OSE$ entropies of diagonal operators with nonzero trace saturate at long times, in contrast with the behavior of von Neumann entropy. Oppositely, the R\'enyi entropies of traceless operators exhibit logarithmic growth with time, with the prefactor of this growth depending in a nontrivial manner on $n$. Notably, at long times, the complete operator entanglement spectrum ($ES$) of an operator can be reconstructed from the spectrum of its traceless part. We observe a similar pattern in the $XXZ$ chain, suggesting universal behavior. Additionally, we consider dynamics in nonintegrable deformations of the $XXZ$ chain. Finite-time corrections do not allow to access the long-time behavior of the von Neumann entropy. On the other hand, for $n&gt;1$ the growth of the entropies is milder, and it is compatible with a sublinear growth, at least for operators associated with global conserved quantities. Finally, we show that in finite-size integrable systems, $S_n$ exhibit strong revivals, which are washed out when integrability is broken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamics of a system of agents who optimize either their individual utility (self-interest) or the collective welfare (cooperation). When agents act selfishly, their interactions are non-reciprocal, driving the system out of equilibrium; by contrast, purely altruistic dynamics restore reciprocity and yield an equilibrium-like description. We investigate how mixtures of these two behaviors shape the macroscopic properties of the liquid of agents. For highly rational agents, we find that introducing a small fraction of altruists can suppress the sub-optimal clustering induced by selfish dynamics. This phenomenon can be attributed to altruists localizing at interfaces and acting as effective surfactants, shedding a new light on earlier findings in fixed neighborhood-based models [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{120}, 208301 (2018)]. When agents are boundedly rational, we introduce a well-mixed approximation that reduces the two-population model to a single effective scalar field theory. This allows us to leverage state-of-the-art tools from active matter to analytically characterize how altruism modifies surface tension and nucleation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Fermion Sign Problem from the Structure of Lee-Yang Zeros. I. The Form of Partition Function for Indistinguishable Particles and Its Zeros at 0~K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To simulate indistinguishable particles, recent studies of path-integral molecular dynamics formulated their partition function $Z$ as a recurrence relation involving a variable $\xi$, with $\xi=1$(-1) for bosons (fermions). Inspired by Lee-Yang phase transition theory, we extend $\xi$ into the complex plane and reformulate $Z$ as a polynomial in $\xi$. By analyzing the distribution of the partition function zeros, we gain insights into the analytical properties of indistinguishable particles, particularly regarding the fermion sign problem (FSP). We found that at 0~K, the partition function zeros for $N$-particles are located at $\xi=-1$, $-1/2$, $-1/3$, $\cdots$, $-1/(N-1)$. This distribution disrupts the analytic continuation of thermodynamic quantities, expressed as functions of $\xi$ and typically performed along $\xi=1\to-1$, whenever the paths intersect these zeros. Moreover, we highlight the zero at $\xi = -1$, which induces an extra term in the free energy of the fermionic systems compared to ones at other $\xi=e^{i\theta}$ values. If a path connects this zero to a bosonic system with identical potential energies, it brings a transition resembling a phase transition. These findings provide a fresh perspective on the successes and challenges of emerging FSP studies based on analytic continuation techniques.</description>

      <title>Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha &lt; D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha &gt; D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha &gt; (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of information scrambling in bosonic systems undergoing Gaussian unitary evolution associated with quadratic Hamiltonians. For initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks under Gaussian random local dynamics. In addition, we show that randomness in the Hamiltonian causes the tripartite mutual information to saturate at relatively large negative values. Therefore, despite being integrable, these systems exhibit information-scrambling diagnostics that mirror those observed in chaotic systems. We note, however, that random quadratic Hamiltonians can have a component exhibiting Wigner-Dyson energy-level statistics; for non-Gaussian states within the corresponding subspace, these systems can display chaotic behavior. Our results provide insight into the Gaussian dynamics of continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Solvent-induced ion clusters generate long-ranged double-layer forces at high ionic strengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental results by the Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) have identified a dramatic deviation from previously established theories of simple electrolytes. This deviation, referred to as anomalous underscreening, suggests that the range of electrostatic interactions increase upon a further addition of salt, beyond some threshold concentration (usually about 1M). In this theoretical work, we explore an extension of the Restricted Primitive Model (RPM) wherein a short-ranged pair potential of mean force (sPMF) is added to the usual Coulombic interactions so as to mimic changes of the hydration as two ions approach one another. The strength of this potential is adjusted so that the modified RPM saturates at a realistic concentration level (within a range 4-7M, typical to aqueous 1:1 salts). We utilise grand canonical simulations to establish surface forces predicted by the model and compare them directly with SFA data. We explore different sPMF models, which in all cases display significant clustering at concentrations above about 1M. In these models, we find significant double-layer repulsion at separations that significantly exceed those expected from standard RPM predictions. We do not, however, observe an increase of the screening length with salt concentration, but rather that this screening length seemingly saturates at a (rather high) value. The simulated long-ranged interactions are shown to correlate with ion cluster formation, implicating the important role of accompanying {\em cluster-cluster} interactions. In particular, steric interactions between clusters (manifested in density-density correlations) are quite relevant in these systems.</description>

      <title>Why collective behaviours self-organise to criticality: A primer on information-theoretic and thermodynamic utility measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective behaviours are frequently observed to self-organise to criticality. Existing proposals to explain these phenomena are fragmented across disciplines and only partially answer the question. This primer compares the underlying, intrinsic, utilities that may explain the self-organisation of collective behaviours near criticality. We focus on information-driven approaches (predictive information, empowerment, and active inference), as well as an approach incorporating both information theory and thermodynamics (thermodynamic efficiency). By interpreting the Ising model as a perception-action loop, we compare how different intrinsic utilities shape collective behaviour and analyse the distinct characteristics that arise when each is optimised. In particular, we highlight that thermodynamic efficiency -- measuring the ratio of predictability gained by the system to its energy costs -- reaches its maximum at the critical regime. Finally, we propose the Principle of Super-efficiency, suggesting that collective behaviours self-organise to the critical regime where optimal efficiency is achieved with respect to the entropy reduction relative to the thermodynamic costs.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Route to Entanglement Steering and Dynamical Freezing in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Intriguingly, CD driving generates spin squeezing and its associated metrologically useful multipartite entanglement at the mid-point of every drive cycle, when the system is initially prepared in a fully x-polarized state. The CD driving induced non-ergodic dynamics is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</description>

      <title>Two-spinon effects on the thermal Tonks-Girardeau gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20929v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of the two-spinon excitations on the field-field correlator of the Tonks-Girardeau gas. While these excitations have been previously examined in the ground state of the system, their role at finite temperatures remains unexplored. Here, we extend the analysis to the one-dimensional interacting Bose gas at thermal equilibrium, focusing on the one-body correlation function of the infinitely repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. We demonstrate that two-spinon excitations, characterized by two holes within the rapidity distribution, constitute the dominant contribution to the field-field correlator at low temperatures. Furthermore, we analytically show that incorporating additional particle-hole excitations diminishes their contribution, highlighting the efficacy of the two-spinon framework in capturing the essential physics of the system. Numerical evaluations of both the Fredholm determinant and the spectral sum stemming from the two-spinon program, with the addition of particle-hole excitations, reveal convergence at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general $U(1)$-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of effective field theory for dissipative fluids in flat Minkowski spacetime. We derive the most general quadratic action for hydrodynamic modes, including stochastic noise, and analyze the corresponding dispersion relations in a consistent gradient expansion. We argue that spontaneous breaking of spacetime symmetry arises in the presence of a local thermal state specified by a local timelike four-vector. We demonstrate that hydrodynamical perturbations can be identified as Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes, analogous to their embedding in global $U(1)$-invariant theories. We find that frame-invariant combinations of hydrodynamic transport coefficients determine the first-order dispersion relations in the low-energy limit, making the mode analysis manifestly independent of the choice of hydrodynamic frame. Assuming local Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry and unitarity of the underlying UV theory, we show that first-order hydrodynamics is stable if the enthalpy density is positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>The "double" square-root law: Evidence for the mechanical origin of market impact using Tokyo Stock Exchange data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of trades on prices is a crucial question for both academic research and industry practice. It is well established that impact follows a square-root impact as a function of traded volume. However, the microscopic origin of such a law remains elusive: empirical studies are particularly challenging due to the anonymity of orders in public data. Indeed, there is ongoing debate about whether price impact has a mechanical origin or whether it is primarily driven by information, as suggested by many economic theories. In this paper, we revisit this question using a very detailed dataset provided by the Japanese stock exchange, containing the trader IDs for all orders sent to the exchange between 2012 and 2018. Our central result is that such a law has in fact microscopic roots and applies already at the level of single child orders, provided one waits long enough for the market to "digest" them. The mesoscopic impact of metaorders arises from a "double" square-root effect: square-root in volume of individual impact, followed by an inverse square-root decay as a function of time. Since market orders are anonymous, we expect and indeed find that these results apply to any market orders, and the impact of synthetic metaorders, reconstructed by scrambling the identity of the issuers, is described by the very same square-root impact law. We conclude that price impact is essentially mechanical, at odds with theories that emphasize the information content of such trades to explain the square-root impact law.</description>

      <title>O(5) multicriticality in the 3D two flavor SU(2) lattice gauge Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the multicritical behavior of the three dimensional lattice system in which a SU(2) gauge field is coupled to two flavors of scalar fields transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this system a multicritical point is present, where the global symmetry O(2)$\oplus$O(3) gets enlarged to O(5). Such a symmetry enlargement is hindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical point, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term triggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice gauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\oplus$O(3) multicritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible implications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Expansion of one-dimensional spinor gases from power-law traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free expansion following the removal of axial confinement represents a fundamental nonequilibrium scenario in the study of many-body ultracold gases. Using the stationary phase approximation, we analytically demonstrate that for all one-dimensional spinor gases with repulsive contact interactions, whether bosonic or fermionic, the asymptotic density and momentum distribution can be directly determined from the quasimomentum distribution (Bethe rapidities) of the trapped gas. We efficiently obtain the quasimomentum distribution numerically by solving the integral equations that characterize the ground state of the integrable system within the local density approximation. Additionally, we derive analytical solutions for both weakly and strongly interacting regimes. Unlike in bosonic gases, where rapidity distributions and density profiles vary significantly across interaction regimes, fermionic gases maintain similar profiles in both weakly and strongly interacting limits. Notably, the gas expands self-similarly only when released from a harmonic trap. For other power-law trapping potentials, the asymptotic density profile is strongly influenced by the initial confinement geometry. Our results extend readily to Bose-Fermi mixtures and finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Anomalous flow in correlated quantum systems: No-go result and multiple-charge scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated quantum systems can exhibit thermodynamic behaviors that defy classical expectations, with anomalous energy flow (AEF) against temperature gradients serving as a paradigmatic example. While AEF has been shown to arise from the consumption of initial quantum correlations, little is known about whether AEF can occur without correlation depletion, or if analogous anomalous transport exists for conserved quantities--dubbed charges--other than energy. Here, we develop a general global-local thermodynamic approach to describe charge exchange between arbitrary correlated quantum systems. For energy-conserving systems, we analytically rule out AEF in initially uncorrelated states, even with the involvement of quantum catalysts, thereby complementing existing studies. In contrast, in systems with multiple conserved charges, we uncover a mechanism for AEF that requires no initial correlations but is instead induced by a drag effect from normal flows of non-energy charges. Furthermore, by treating all conserved charges on equal footing, we generalize AEF to a broader concept of anomalous charge flow, applicable to any conserved charge. We confirm theoretical expectations with numerical examples. These findings deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and open new avenues for controlling transport phenomena in correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Landauer Principle and Thermodynamics of Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the Landauer principle, any logically irreversible process accompanies entropy production, which results in heat dissipation in the environment. Erasing of information, one of the primary logically irreversible processes, has a lower bound on heat dissipated into the environment, called the Landauer bound (LB). However, the practical erasure processes dissipate much more heat than the LB. Recently, there have been a few experimental investigations to reach this bound both in the classical and quantum domains. There has also been a spate of activities to enquire about this LB in finite time, with finite-size heat baths, non-Markovian and nonequilibrium environments in the quantum regime, where the effects of fluctuations and correlation of the systems with the bath can no longer be ignored. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the Landauer bound, which serves as a fundamental principle in the thermodynamics of computation. We also provide a perspective for future endeavors in these directions.
  Furthermore, we review the recent explorations toward establishing energetic bounds of a computational process. We also discuss the thermodynamic aspects of error correction, which is an indispensable part of information processing and computations. In doing so, we briefly discuss the basics of these fields to provide a complete picture.</description>

Abstract: The Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy provides a time-reversal-symmetric framework for describing the nonequilibrium evolution of many-body systems. Despite the success of Boltzmann-based numerical approaches, systematically extending beyond this lowest-order truncation to the full nonlinear BBGKY hierarchy remains a major challenge. Moreover, even at the Boltzmann level, accurately treating the nonlinear collision term still presents significant difficulties. Here we propose the spectral BBGKY hierarchy, an analytically equivalent and numerically tractable reformulation of the conventional BBGKY hierarchy. The spectral formulation reduces the original 6n-dimensional phase-space problem to the evolution of spectral coefficients over the 3n-dimensional coordinate space. We also develop an analytic scheme for computing the collision integrals, which achieves high accuracy and removes the need for ensemble averaging over repeated stochastic evolutions from the same initial state. The scheme evaluates the full eight-fold integral exactly for massless particles, and reduces it to a three-fold one for massive particles. The validity of the spectral BBGKY hierarchy is verified through conservation law analysis, comparison with an analytical solution, convergence tests, and analysis of spectral coefficient leakage. At minimal truncation, the spectral BBGKY yields a spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation that captures full dynamics with a computational cost comparable to that of linearized approaches. When extended to higher-order truncations, the spectral BBGKY hierarchy provides a flexible framework for studying multiparticle correlations. This framework advances our ability to investigate the early thermalization puzzle in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and to elucidate the applicability of hydrodynamics at remarkably early stages of quark-gluon plasma evolution.</description>

      <title>Exact downfolding and its perturbative approximation</title>

Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.</description>

      <title>Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22254</link>

Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks.</description>
