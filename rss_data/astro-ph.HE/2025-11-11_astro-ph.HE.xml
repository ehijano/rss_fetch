      <title>Towards the Composition of sub-PeV Cosmic Rays at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the implementation of a low-energy trigger, the surface array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is able to record cosmic-ray induced air showers with a primary energy of a few hundred TeV. This extension of the energy range closes the gap between direct and indirect observations of primary cosmic rays and provides the potential to test the validity of hadronic interaction models in the sub-PeV regime. Composition analyses at IceCube highly benefit from its multi-detector design. Combining the measurement of the electromagnetic shower component and low-energy muons at the surface with the response of the in-ice array to the associated high-energy muons improves the directional reconstruction accuracy and opens unique possibilities to extract the primary particle's mass. In this contribution, a new methodical approach for the analysis of these low-energy air showers is presented, including techniques for the identification of coincident background in the in-ice detector and a machine learning model based on convolutional neural networks to determine the elemental composition. The achieved performance in primary mass discrimination and energy reconstruction of air-shower events is discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing Jet Compositions with Extreme Mass Ratio Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining whether black hole jets are dominated by leptonic or baryonic matter remains an open question in high-energy astrophysics. We propose that extreme mass ratio binary (EMRB) black holes, where an intermediate mass secondary black hole (a "miniquasar") periodically interacts with the accretion flow of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), offer a natural laboratory to probe jet composition. In an EMRB, the miniquasar jet is launched episodically after each disk-crossing event, triggered by the onset of super-Eddington accretion. The resulting emissions exhibit temporal evolution as the jet interacts with the SMBH accretion disk. Depending on whether the jet is leptonic or hadronic in composition, the radiative signatures differ substantially. Notably, a baryonic jet produces a more pronounced gamma-ray output than a purely leptonic jet. By modeling the evolution of the multifrequency characteristic features, it is suggested that the gamma-ray-to-UV emissions may serve as a diagnostic tool capable of distinguishing between leptonic and baryonic scenarios. The resulting electromagnetic signals, when combined with multi-messenger observations, offer a powerful means to constrain the physical nature of relativistic jets from black holes.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Extragalactic Axion-like Dark Matter in a Decade-long Blazar Optical Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates whose coupling to photons induces periodic oscillations in the polarization angle of astrophysical light. This work reports the first search for such a signature using ten years of optical polarimetric monitoring of the blazar 1ES 1959+650. No statistically significant periodicity is detected using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Monte Carlo analysis. Assuming a central DM density in the host galaxy, this null result places tight upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling constant at $g_{a\gamma}&lt;(5.8 \times 10^{-14}-1.8\times 10^{-10})\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across a broad ALP mass range of $m_a \sim (1.4\times10^{-23}-5.2\times10^{-20})\,\mathrm{eV}$. Our constraints surpass those from Very Long Baseline Array polarimetry of active galactic jets and are competitive with those from long-term Galactic pulsar timing of PSR J0437-4715 over the same ALP mass window. These results establish long-term blazar polarimetry as a competitive and complementary approach for probing axion-like DM on extragalactic scales.</description>

      <title>Formation of Binary Millisecond Pulsars with Helium White Dwarfs in a New Magnetic Braking Prescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic braking (MB) mechanism plays a vital role throughout the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Considering the standard MB prescription, the initial orbital periods of LMXBs that can evolve into binary millisecond pulsar (MSP) with He white dwarfs (WDs) and short orbital periods ($2-9~\rm hours$) are within an extremely narrow interval, which was named the fine-tuning problem. Employing the detailed binary evolution model, we investigate the evolution of LMXBs in both the standard and convection and rotation boosted (CARB) MB laws. In the standard MB case, it is difficult for donor stars to form a He core and exhaust H envelope through mass transfer at short orbital periods, making them semidetached systems. The CARB MB mechanism can drive LMXBs evolve toward compact detached MSP-WD systems in wide initial orbital periods, over which binary MSPs with long orbital periods will be produced. We obtain the initial parameter space of binary MSPs with He WDs in the initial orbital period and donor-star mass plane, which can be applied to future statistics study by population synthesis simulations. We also discuss a new relation between orbital period and WD mass, formation of persistent ultra-compact X-ray binaries with relatively long orbital periods, and detectability of compact MSP-WD systems as low-frequency gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>On the numerical convergence of MRI simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetorotational instability (MRI) plays a crucial role in the evolution of many types of accretion disks. It is often studied using ideal-MHD numerical simulations. In principle, such simulations should be numerically converged, i.e. their properties should not change with resolution. Convergence is often assessed via the MRI quality factor, $Q$, the ratio of the Alfv\'en length to the grid-cell size. If it is above a certain threshold, the simulation is deemed numerically converged. In this paper we argue that the quality factor is not a good indicator of numerical convergence. First, we test the performance of the quality factor on simulations known to be unconverged, i.e. local ideal-MHD simulations with zero net-flux, and show that their $Q$s are well over the typical convergence threshold. The quality-factor test thus fails in these cases. Second, we take issue with the linear theory underpinning the use of $Q$, which posits a constant vertical field. This is a poor approximation in real nonlinear simulations, where the vertical field can vary rapidly in space and generically exhibits zeros. We calculate the linear MRI modes in such cases and show that the MRI can reach near-maximal growth rates at arbitrarily small scales. Yet, the quality factor assumes a single and well-defined scale, near the Alfv\'en length, below which the MRI cannot grow. We discuss other criticisms and suggest a modified quality factor that addresses some, though not all, of these issues.</description>

      <title>A New Phase of Optical Activity of BL Lacertae in the Fall of 2024: Intra-Night Flux and Polarization Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BL Lacertae is not only archetypical of an entire class of jet-dominated active galactic nuclei, blazars, but also one of the most active and rapidly changing objects in this class. In the fall of 2024 (September--November), BL Lacertae underwent another episode of strong optical activity, reaching an R-band magnitude of about 12 and showing extremely rapid and large-amplitude inter- and intra-night flux and polarization variations. During this period, the object was monitored over 40 nights using telescopes with an aperture of up to 2 m at three observatories: Rozhen and Belogradchik in Bulgaria and Skinakas in Greece. The results from this study include some of the most spectacular intra-night variability episodes detected in a blazar. These rapid variations, combined with high photometric accuracy and high time resolution, allowed for confirmation of consistency between different optical bands with zero time delays, down to a minute scale. Unlike previous activity reports, polarization was relatively stable on these short time-scales. Possible connections between polarization, flux, and intra-night variability were explored in order to better model or constrain the physical processes and emission mechanisms in the relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>AthenaK Simulations of Magnetized Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new numerical-relativity simulations of a magnetized binary neutron star merger performed with AthenaK. The simulations employ a temperature- and composition-dependent tabulated nuclear equation of state, with initially dipolar fields with a maximum initial strength of ${\sim}10^{16}\ {\rm G}$ which extend outside the stars. We employ adaptive mesh refinement and consider three grid resolutions, with grid spacing down to $\Delta x_{\rm min} \simeq 92\ {\rm m}$ in the most refined region. When comparing the two highest resolution simulations, we find orbital dephasing of over 7 orbits until merger of only $0.06$ radians. The magnetic field is amplified during the merger and we observe the formation of a magnetized funnel in the polar region of the remnant. Simulations are continued until about $30$ milliseconds after merger. However, due to significant baryonic pollution, the binary fails to produce a magnetically-dominated outflow. Finally, we discuss possible numerical and physical effects that might alter this outcome.</description>

      <title>Probing a cosmogenic origin of astrophysical neutrinos and cosmic rays using gamma-ray observations of TXS 0506+056</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In September 2017, a high-energy neutrino event detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (IceCube-170922A) was associated, at the $3\sigma$ level, with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Cosmic rays that are accelerated in astrophysical sources can escape from their jets and interact with background radiation fields. Interactions with the extragalactic background light can produce pions and hence neutrinos, while interactions with the cosmic microwave background predominantly drive inverse Compton scattering, contributing to electromagnetic cascades in intergalactic space. The resulting secondary gamma-ray emission can be detected with high-energy gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we report on a new search for such cosmogenic cascade emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056, using a combined data set from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope and VERITAS. We compare the gamma-ray spectrum and neutrino observations with the predictions of cosmic-ray induced cascades in intergalactic space. The observed gamma-ray spectrum is modeled as a combination of the primary spectrum and the cascade spectrum. We apply a Monte Carlo simulation with a $\Delta\chi^2$-based likelihood analysis to jointly determine the best-fit parameters of a proton emission spectrum describing the data and derive constraints on the proton escape luminosity. Assuming a log-parabola primary photon spectrum, we find consistency with a proton injection spectral index of $\alpha_{p} \simeq 2.0$ and a cutoff energy of $E_{p,\text{max}} \simeq 1.3 \times 10^{16}$ eV, and constrain the isotropic proton escape luminosity to $1 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ $\lesssim L_{p, esc} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the 90 % confidence level.</description>

      <title>Accretion Geometry of the New Galactic Black Hole Candidate AT2019wey in the Hard State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform broadband spectral and timing studies of the Galactic low-mass black hole candidate AT2019wey during its 2022 outburst, using quasi-simultaneous observations from NICER, Swift, and NuSTAR. The long-term MAXI light curve, along with the hardness-intensity diagram (HID) derived from NICER data, indicates that the source remained in the hard state and did not switch to the soft state. Spectral modeling using two different model combinations reveals that the broadband spectrum is best described by two distinct Comptonizing regions, associated reflection components, and thermal emission from the disk. The harder Comptonizing region dominates ($\gtrsim88\%$) the total flux and is primarily responsible for the observed reflection features from the distant part of the disk. We find that the accretion disk is truncated at a radius of $\sim16-56~r_{\rm{g}}$, while the luminosity is $\sim1.9\%$ of the Eddington limit. Our spectral results also show consistency in the estimated inner disk radius obtained through two independent methods: modeling the disk continuum and the reflection spectrum. The variability studies imply the presence of intrinsic disk variability, likely originating from an instability in the disk. We also detect hard time lags at low frequencies, possibly arising from the inward propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations from the outer to the inner regions of the accretion disk. Moreover, an observed deviation of the lag-energy spectrum from the log-linear trend at $\lesssim 0.7$ keV is most likely attributed to thermal reverberation, arising from the reprocessing of hard coronal photons in the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Kerr Black Hole Shadows in Dispersive Plasma: Frequency-Dependent Geodesics and Shadow Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole shadow, a direct probe of the event horizon's gravitational influence, has been observationally confirmed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV dark matter in neutron stars: halo morphologies and their suppression by vacuum-like pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate neutron stars that contain a unified dark sector composed of cold, degenerate fermionic dark matter and a vacuum-like dark-energy component. Within a general-relativistic two-fluid framework that allows a covariantly conserved, gradient-driven energy exchange between baryons and the dark sector, we quantify how dark microphysics reshapes global structure when the total gravitational radius need not coincide with the luminous baryonic radius. Using a state-of-the-art baryonic equation of state, we explore the halo-forming mass range for fermionic dark matter with particle masses of 400 MeV and 1 GeV, and we characterize sequences by the difference between the total and luminous radii and by the fractional difference between the total and baryonic masses. We confirm established trends: lighter fermions typically support low-density halos that increase the total radius by several kilometers at nearly fixed mass, whereas masses near 1 GeV tend to shrink halos and make the two radii appreciably closer. Our central new result is that a percent-level vacuum-like admixture markedly reduces halo formation, shrinking the radius difference from several kilometers to sub-kilometer scales and the fractional mass difference to $\lesssim 1\%$. Combined gravitational-wave and X-ray observations offer a practical route to bound the halo size and the allowed vacuum-like fraction.</description>

      <title>Formation Channels of Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation channels of magnetars remain an open question. Although core collapse supernovae of isolated massive stars are important, binary interactions -- such as tidal interaction, common envelope evolution, and stellar mergers -- may also play a significant role in making magnetars. Understanding the relative contributions of these channels is crucial for linking magnetars to their observed properties and host environments. In this paper, we investigate potential magnetar formation channels using population synthesis simulations, considering both single-star and isolated binary system evolution. By conducting simulations with different parameters, we compare the effects of various evolution processes on magnetar formation. Additionally, we study the delay times and kick velocities across all formation channels, analyze the orbital properties and companion types of surviving magnetar binaries. We find that the majority of magnetars are observed as single objects ($\geq 90\%$), although a large fraction of them were originally in binary systems and experienced either kick disruption or merger. Surviving binaries are most likely to host main-sequence companions and exhibit different distributions of eccentricities due to different supernova mechanisms. These findings show the critical role of binary evolution in magnetar formation and provide predictions for the properties of magnetar populations that can be tested with future observations.</description>

      <title>Seyfert Galaxies as Neutrino Sources: An Outflow$-$Cloud Interaction Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the identification of the first confirmed individual neutrino source, Seyfert galaxies have emerged as the most prominent class of high-energy neutrino emitters. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation of the outflow--cloud interaction scenario for neutrino production in Seyfert nuclei. In this framework, fast AGN-driven winds collide with clumpy gas clouds in the nuclear region, forming bow shocks that efficiently accelerate cosmic-ray protons. The accelerated protons subsequently interact with cold protons from the outflows via inelastic proton--proton ($pp$) collisions, producing high-energy neutrinos, while the photomeson ($p\gamma$) process with disk photons may provide a subdominant contribution at the highest energies. Applying this model to five neutrino-associated Seyfert galaxies, we successfully reproduce the observed TeV neutrino fluxes without violating existing gamma-ray constraints. By integrating over the Seyfert population using X-ray luminosity functions, we further demonstrate that Seyfert galaxies can account for a substantial fraction of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino background in the $10^4-10^5~{\rm GeV}$ energy range.</description>

      <title>Implication of multiple source populations of Galactic cosmic rays from proton and helium spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complicated hardenings and softenings of the spectra of cosmic ray protons and helium have been revealed by the newest measurements, which indicate the existence of multiple source populations of Galactic cosmic rays. We study the physical implications of these results in this work. A phenomenological fitting shows that three components can properly give the measured structures of the proton and helium spectra. The data are then accounted for in a physically motivated, spatially-dependent propagation model. It has been shown that one background source population plus two local sources, or two background source populations plus one local source can well reproduce the measurements. The spectral structures of individual species of cosmic rays are thus natural imprints of different source components of cosmic rays. Combined with ultra-high-energy $\gamma$-ray observations of various types of sources, the mystery about the origin of Galactic cosmic rays may be uncovered in future.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Polarization Effects in Baryon-Loaded Magnetar Bursts and Implications for X-ray Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars provide natural laboratories for strong-field quantum electrodynamics processes, such as vacuum polarization, which gives rise to vacuum resonance together with the plasma response. We develop a general framework to describe vacuum resonance in a three-component plasma consisting of ions, electrons, and positrons, as expected in baryon-loaded magnetar bursts. By introducing a parametrization of the plasma composition, we establish the general criterion for the occurrence of vacuum resonance in such plasmas. Our analysis encompasses both Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein-like adiabatic mode conversion and nonadiabatic eigenmode transition, highlighting their dependence on the plasma composition. Applying this framework to baryon-loaded fireballs in magnetar bursts, we estimate the characteristic X-ray polarization signatures. Detection of these polarizations will provide observational signatures of vacuum polarization as well as baryon loading in magnetar fireballs.</description>

      <title>A Census of Pulsars in Possible Association with Galactic Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the $\sim 4000$ known pulsars in our Galaxy, $\lesssim 10\%$ are found in globular clusters, but none has been confirmed in any open clusters yet, although they outnumber globular clusters by about 20 times. In this work, we make use of the Gaia DR3 catalog of Galactic open clusters and conduct a pulsar census, in order to identify pulsars that are either 1) current members of open clusters, or 2) escaped from open clusters to the field. Among 164 pulsars with independent distance measurements and 3530 open clusters, we find that 4 pulsars are likely residing in open clusters. In particular, we find compelling evidence that the binary pulsar J1302$-$6350 (B1259$-$63) is a member of the open cluster UBC~525; based on Gaia data, we update its distance to be $2.26\pm 0.07$~kpc and measure the mass of its companion Be star LS 2883 to be $16.8 M_\odot$. For 145 pulsars with both distance and proper motion measurements and 2967 open clusters with full kinematic parameters, we trace the past trajectories of both pulsars and open clusters in the Galactic gravitational potential, and find pulsars that were within 3 times the radius of a cluster. This results in 19 pulsars that were likely born in open clusters. We discuss implications for the formation history of PSR J1302$-$6350 and highlight the scientific potential of searching for pulsars in open clusters.</description>

      <title>Identifying the physical periods in the radio emission from the $\gamma$-ray emitting binary LS I +61 303</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray emitting binary LS I +61 303 exhibits periodic emission across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio up to the very-high-energy regime. The most prominent features are the three periods $P_1 = 26.5$ d, $P_2 = 26.9$ d, and $P_{\rm long} = 4.6$ years. Occasionally, a fourth period of 26.7 d is also detected. Mathematically, these four periods are interrelated via the interference pattern of a beating. Competing scenarios that seek to determine which of these periods are physical and which are secondary are under debate. The detection of a fifth period, $P_3 = 26.3$ d, was recently claimed. Our aim is to determine which of these periods are intrinsic (likely related to physical processes) and which of these are secondary (resulting from interference). We avoided any assumption about the physical scenario and restricted our analysis to the phenomenology of the radio emission variability. We selected intervals from archival radio data and applied the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We fit the observational data to generate synthetic data that only contain specific signals. We analyzed these synthetic data to assess the impact of these signals and their interference on the light curves and the periodogram. The two-peaked profile, consisting of $P_1$ and $P_2$, was detected in the periodogram of the actual data for intervals that are significantly shorter than $P_{\rm long}$, provided that these intervals contain a minimum of the long-term modulation. The characteristics of the observational data and their periodogram could only be reproduced with synthetic data if these explicitly included all three periods $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_{\rm long}$, the residuals being limited by noise. We have found that all three periods, i.e., $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_{\rm long}$, could correspond to physically real processes occurring in LS I +61 303.</description>

      <title>Analysis and implications of the spatio-spectral morphology of the Fermi Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi Bubbles are gamma-ray structures extending from the center of the Milky Way to +/-50 degree Galactic latitude that were discovered in data obtained by the Fermi/LAT instrument. Their origin and power source remain uncertain. To help address this uncertainty, here we use a template-free reconstruction of ten years of all-sky Fermi/LAT data provided by Platz et al. (2023) to carry out a pixel-by-pixel spectral analysis of the Bubbles. We recover the position-dependent spectral shape and normalization that would be required for parent proton or electron cosmic ray populations to produce the Bubbles' observed gamma-ray spectra. We find that models in which the gamma-ray emission is driven by either hadronic or leptonic processes can explain the data equally well. The cosmic ray population driving the emission must have either broken power-law or exponentially cut-off spectra, with break or cutoff energies that are almost constant with latitude but spectral indices below the break that harden towards the Bubbles' southern tip. For the leptonic channel, reproducing the observed position-dependent gamma-ray spectrum also requires a cosmic ray electron energy density that grows with distance from the Galactic plane and increases towards the edges of the Bubbles. This finding disfavors scenarios for the origin of the Bubbles where a population of cosmic ray electrons is accelerated near the Milky Way center and subsequently advected out to the extremities of the Bubbles.</description>

      <title>Pulse profile modelling of the accretion-powered millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 using NICER data from its 2019 and 2022 outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse profile modelling is a relativistic ray-tracing technique that has provided constraints on parameters, with a focus on mass and radius, of five rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. While the technique can also be applied to accretion-powered millisecond pulsars (AMPs), this requires accounting for the X-rays from the accretion disc and has only been applied to archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Here, we apply a previously developed neutron star and accretion disc model to the NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer) data of the 2019 and 2022 outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658. We find that a single circular hotspot model is insufficient to explain the data. Modelling with two hotspots and an accretion disc model provides better phase-residuals, but a spectral residual at around 1 keV remains. In contrast, we find a good fit with a flexible background approach, replacing the accretion disk. However, the inferred parameters are not robust due to a degeneracy in the origin of the non-pulsed radiation, which can be caused either by the background or a hotspot that is at least partially in view throughout a full rotation. This work represents an important next step in pulse profile modelling of AMPs by analysing NICER data and underlines the need for more accurate accretion disc and hotspot modelling to achieve robust parameter constraints. We expect the inclusion of higher energy and polarimetric data will provide complementary constraints on inclination, hotspot colatitude, and hotspot size, improving the accuracy of pulse profile modelling of AMPs.</description>

      <title>Search for steady and flaring neutrino emission from cosmic sources using the complete ANTARES dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ANTARES, a neutrino detector located in the depths of the Mediterranean Sea, operated successfully for over 15 years before being decommissioned in 2022. The telescope offered an ideal vantage view of the Southern Sky and benefited from optimal water properties for enhanced angular resolution. This study makes use of data collected over the entire operational period of ANTARES to search for sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos, considering both steady and flaring emission scenarios. First, a time-integrated search for high-energy neutrino clustering across the celestial sphere is conducted. The most significant accumulation is found at coordinates $(\alpha, \delta) =(200.5^\circ\, 17.7^\circ)$ with a post-trial p-value equal to 0.38. A dedicated search in the Galactic Plane is also performed for extended sources, yielding no significant excess. Additionally, a list of potential neutrino sources are investigated. The blazar MG3 J225517+2409 is identified as the most significant object, yet the excess remains compatible with background fluctuations. A mild local excess of 2.4$\sigma$ is found for the blazar TXS 0506+056. The full sky is also examined for the presence of flaring neutrino emissions. The most significant excess in this case corresponds to a $\sim$4-day flare from the direction $(\alpha, \delta) = (141.3^\circ\, 9.8^\circ)$, with a post-trial p-value of 0.30. Finally, the directions of sources highlighted in IceCube's time-dependent searches are investigated. Temporal overlaps between ANTARES and IceCube flares are identified for PKS 1502+106 and TXS 0506+056, with an estimated chance probability of about 0.02%, making this observation particularly noteworthy.</description>

      <title>The position of SN 1987A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate positional measurement of Supernova (SN) 1987A is important for determining the kick velocity of its compact object and the velocities of the ejecta and various shock components. In this work, we perform absolute astrometry to determine the position of SN 1987A. We used multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope imaging to model the early ejecta and the equatorial ring (ER). We combined our measurements and obtained the celestial coordinates in the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by registering the observations onto Gaia Data Release 3. The final average position of the different measurements is ${\alpha = 5^{\mathrm{h}}~ 35^{\rm{m}}~ 27^{\rm{s}}.9884(30)}$, ${\delta = -69^{\circ}~ 16'~ 11''.1134(136)}$ (ICRS J2016). The early ejecta position is located 14 mas south and 16 mas east of the ER center, with the offset being significant at 96% confidence. The offset may be due to instrument and/or filter-dependent systematics and registration uncertainties, though an intrinsic explosion offset relative to the ER remains possible. Image registration with proper motion corrections yields similar astrometry and a source proper motion of ${\mu_{\rm east} (\equiv \rm{PM_{\alpha }*}) = 1.60 \pm 0.15 ~\rm{mas ~ yr^{-1}}}$ and ${\mu_{\rm{north}} (\equiv \rm{PM_{\delta}}) = 0.44 \pm 0.09~\rm{mas ~ yr^{-1}}}$, in agreement with the typical local motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The absolute positional uncertainty of 21 mas adds a systematic uncertainty to the sky-plane kick velocity of ${123}~(t/40~\rm{yr})^{-1}~\rm{km~s}^{-1}$, where $t$ is the time since the explosion. Comparing the location of the compact source observed with JWST to our updated position implies a sky-plane kick of ${399\pm148~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ and a 3D kick of ${472\pm126~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$, which is consistent with previous estimates.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of GW231123 in Population III Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05634v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is a binary black hole merger whose primary component lies within or above the pair-instability mass gap, while the secondary component falls within this gap. The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop III) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Under our model assumptions, their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001-0.26{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop III star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.</description>

      <title>Continuum Reverberation Mapping of 18 AGN Over Four Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuum reverberation mapping probes the size scale of the optical continuum-emitting region in active galactic nuclei (AGN). The source of this emission has long been thought to originate from the accretion disk, but recent studies suggest the broad line region (BLR) may significantly contribute to both the observed flux and continuum interband delays. We monitored 18 AGN over four years of observations to acquire high quality optical continuum light curves, measuring time lags between different photometric bands and determining continuum emission sizes for each AGN. We add this sample to existing lag measurements to test the correlation between continuum lags at $5100\r{A}$ ($\tau_{5100}$) and $5100\r{A}$ luminosity ($L_{5100}$). We observe that $\tau_{5100} \propto L_{5100}^{0.4}$, broadly consistent with the theoretical expectations of $\tau \propto L^{1/2}$ expected for continuum reverberation from either the accretion disk or the BLR.</description>

      <title>An XMM-Newton View of the ANdromeda Galaxy as Explored in a Legacy Survey (New-ANGELS) II: Luminosity Function of X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the New-ANGELS program, we systematically investigate the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of 4506 X-ray sources projected within a radius of 2.5 deg centering on M31. We construct XLFs for different regions in the disk and halo of M31, accounting for the incompleteness with an effective sensitivity map. Assuming that the halo regions contain (mostly) foreground stars and background active galactic nuclei, they are taken as "background" for deriving the XLFs of the sources in the disk. Through modeling XLFs, we decompose the X-ray sources into distinct populations for each region. We find that low-mass X-ray binaries are the dominant X-ray population throughout the disk of M31. The XLFs of M31 reveal a consistently lower integrated LMXB luminosity per stellar mass ($\alpha_\mathrm{LMXB}$) compared to other galaxies, likely due to M31's prolonged period of quiescent star formation. Variations in the XLF shape and $\alpha_\mathrm{LMXB}$ across different regions of M31 suggest that the relationship between integrated luminosity and stellar mass may vary within the galaxy. Additionally, the relatively low integrated luminosity observed in the inner-arm region provides crucial evidence for a rapid fading of M31's LMXBs around 1 Gyr, a finding consistent with recent observations of other nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-Group Invariant Parity-Doublet Model for Nuclear and Neutron-Star Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parity-Doublet Model (PDM) is a chirally invariant effective theory for strong-interaction matter involving nucleons and their opposite-parity partners in a parity-doubling framework. We introduce a multiplicatively renormalizable mean-field approach to include the baryonic vacuum contributions to the resulting grand-canonical potential in an explicitly renormalization-group invariant form. As an application, we evaluate the pertinent thermodynamics of two-flavor symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter, focusing on the restoration of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry at baryon densities and temperatures relevant for the astrophysics of neutron stars. Special attention is paid to the effect of the baryonic vacuum fluctuations on the evolution of chiral condensate with baryon density and temperature for specific choices of the chirally invariant baryon mass $m_0$ to demonstrate the importance of consistently including these vacuum fluctuations in the PDM.</description>

      <title>A probe of the maximum energetics of fast radio bursts through a prolific repeating source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are sufficiently energetic to be detectable from luminosity distances up to at least seven billion parsecs (redshift $z &gt; 1$). Probing the maximum energies and luminosities of FRBs constrains their emission mechanism and cosmological population. Here we investigate the maximum energetics of a highly active repeater, FRB 20220912A, using 1,500 h of observations. We detect $130$ high-energy bursts and find a break in the burst energy distribution, with a flattening of the power-law slope at higher energy -- consistent with the behaviour of another highly active repeater, FRB 20201124A. There is a roughly equal split of integrated burst energy between the low- and high-energy regimes. Furthermore, we model the rate of the highest-energy bursts and find a turnover at a characteristic spectral energy density of $E^{\textrm{char}}_{\nu} = 2.09^{+3.78}_{-1.04}\times10^{32}$ erg/Hz. This characteristic maximum energy agrees well with observations of apparently one-off FRBs, suggesting a common physical mechanism for their emission. The extreme burst energies push radiation and source models to their limit: at this burst rate a typical magnetar ($B = 10^{15}$ G) would deplete the energy stored in its magnetosphere in $\sim$ 2150 h, assuming a radio efficiency $\epsilon_\mathrm{radio} = 10^{-5}$. We find that the high-energy bursts ($E_\nu &gt; 3 \times 10^{30}$ erg Hz$^{-1}$) play an important role in exhausting the energy budget of the source.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Hadronic Code Comparison for Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the first dedicated comparison of five hadronic codes (AM$^3$, ATHE$\nu$A, B13, LeHa-Paris, and LeHaMoC) that have been extensively used in modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of jetted active galactic nuclei. The purpose of this comparison is to identify the sources of systematic errors (e.g., implementation method of proton-photon interactions) and to quantify the expected dispersion in numerical SED models computed with the five codes. The outputs from the codes are first tested in synchrotron self-Compton scenarios that are the simplest blazar emission models used in the literature. We then compare the injection rates and spectra of secondary particles produced in pure hadronic cases with monoenergetic and power-law protons interacting on black-body and power-law photon fields. We finally compare the photon SEDs and the neutrino spectra for realistic proton-synchrotron and leptohadronic blazar models. We find that the codes are in excellent agreement with respect to the spectral shape of the photons and neutrinos. There is a remaining spread in the overall normalization that we quantify, at its maximum, at the level of $\pm 40\%$. This value should be used as an additional, conservative, systematic uncertainty term when comparing numerical simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>Impact of mass transfer on the orbital evolution of a white dwarf close to an intermediate-mass black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) of low-mass white dwarfs (WDs, 0.1 - 0.3 Msun) around spinning intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, 10^3 - 10^5 Msun) offer unique opportunities for multi-messenger astronomy, emitting both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) signals. Yet, despite their astrophysical relevance, theoretical models often omit key interactions between relativistic dynamics and phase-dependent mass transfer (MT). In this study, we integrate a perturbed Keplerian formalism with post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to simulate the relativistic orbit of a WD around a rotating IMBH, explicitly resolving the narrow phase near pericentre where Roche-lobe overflow initiates MT. We find that GW emission and MT exert competing influences on the orbit: MT episodes can increase both orbital period and eccentricity, potentially enabling the WD to avoid complete tidal disruption and even escape. We further quantify the GW phase evolution induced by MT, identifying parameter regimes in which GW detectors could observe a one-radian phase shift over observational timescales. Finally, we propose that the orbital expansion driven by MT may lead to the disappearance of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs). Our results underscore the necessity of jointly modeling relativistic effects and dynamic mass transfer in WD-IMBH systems.</description>

      <title>Possible binary neutron star merger history of the primary of GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) with masses between $\sim 3-5M_{\odot}$, produced by a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, can further pair up with a neutron star or BH and merge again within a Hubble time. However, the astrophysical environments in which this can happen and the rate of such mergers are open questions in astrophysics. Gravitational waves may play an important role in answering these questions. In this context, we discuss the possibility that the primary of the recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary GW230529_181500 (GW230529, in short) is the product of a previous BNS merger. Invoking numerical relativity (NR)-based fitting formulas that map the binary constituents' masses and tidal deformabilities to the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant BH, we investigate the potential parents of GW230529's primary. Our calculations using NR fits based on BNS simulations reveal that the remnant of a high-mass BNS merger similar to GW190425 is consistent with the primary of GW230529. This argument is further strengthened by the gravitational wave-based merger rate estimation of GW190425-like and GW230529-like populations. We show that around 18% (median) of the GW190425-like remnants could become the primary component in GW230529-like mergers. The dimensionless tidal deformability parameter of the heavier neutron star in the parent binary is constrained to $67^{+163}_{-61}$ at 90% credibility. Using estimates of the gravitational-wave kick imparted to the remnant, we also discuss the astrophysical environments in which these types of mergers can take place and the implications for their future observations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging differentiable programming in the inverse problem of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) probe the high-density regime of the nuclear equation of state (EOS). However, inferring the EOS from observations of NSs is a computationally challenging task. In this work, we efficiently solve this inverse problem by leveraging differential programming in two ways. First, we enable full Bayesian inference in under one hour of wall time on a GPU by using gradient-based samplers, without requiring pre-trained machine learning emulators. Moreover, we demonstrate efficient scaling to high-dimensional parameter spaces. Second, we introduce a novel gradient-based optimization scheme that recovers the EOS of a given NS mass-radius curve. We demonstrate how our framework can reveal consistencies or tensions between nuclear physics and astrophysics. First, we show how the breakdown density of a metamodel description of the EOS can be determined from NS observations. Second, we demonstrate how degeneracies in EOS modeling using nuclear empirical parameters can influence the inverse problem during gradient-based optimization. Looking ahead, our approach opens up new theoretical studies of the relation between NS properties and the EOS, while effectively tackling the data analysis challenges brought by future detectors.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Constraints on Black Hole Formation in M31</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate neutrino signals associated with black hole formation resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, motivated by the candidate failed supernova M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). By compiling numerical simulation results for stellar collapse, we predict the expected neutrino emission and compare these predictions with observational limits from Super-Kamiokande (SK). The simulations reveal a characteristic precursor signal consisting of a short, intense burst whose average neutrino energy rises rapidly and then ceases abruptly once the black hole forms. We examine several nuclear equations of state, specifically the Lattimer \&amp; Swesty, Shen, Togashi, and SFHo models, to evaluate how the emission depends on neutron-star properties and nuclear-physics uncertainties. Comparison of the predicted event counts with SK's non-detection of neutrinos coincident with M31-2014-DS1 already rules out part of the model space and highlights the sensitivity of current neutrino detectors to both progenitor mass and the EOS. These findings demonstrate the capability of neutrino astronomy to probe core collapse and black hole formation in failed supernova scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most significant open questions in modern physics, with its nature and interactions largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the behavior of massive fermionic DM particles in the context of neutron stars (NSs), extending prior studies which focused on the bosonic DM. By incorporating the motion of NSs in the Galaxy and considering scenarios with and without DM self-annihilation, we demonstrate their impact on the DM capture rate and the accumulation process inside NSs. Observational data from pulsars in the Milky Way are used to place constraints on DM properties, including the mass and the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section, offering a more comprehensive picture in probing DM interactions in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>A Mid-Thirties Crisis: Dissecting the Properties of Gravitational Wave Sources Near the 35 Solar Mass Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One striking feature of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in the first decade of gravitational-wave astronomy is an excess of events with component masses around $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1&lt;20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical mergers, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.</description>

      <title>Hadronic origin of the very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has detected very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from NGC 4278, which is known to host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Having only very weak radio jets, the origin of its VHE gamma rays is unclear. In this paper we first show that NGC 4278 has a massive molecular cloud surrounding the nucleus by analyzing data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We then assume that cosmic ray protons are accelerated in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the supermassive black hole, which diffuse into the molecular cloud and produce gamma rays and neutrinos via $pp$ interactions. We model the gamma-ray spectra and find that the observations can be explained by such hadronic processes if the AGN activity was higher in the past than at present, and the diffusion coefficient in the molecular cloud is appreciably smaller than in the Milky Way interstellar medium. We also show that although the high-energy neutrinos co-produced with the gamma rays are unlikely to be detectable even with IceCube-Gen2, the accompanying synchrotron X-ray emission due to pion-decay secondary electrons and positrons may be detectable in the future, providing a valuable test of our hadronic model.</description>

      <title>GW231123: a Binary Black Hole Merger with Total Mass 190-265 $M_{\odot}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On 2023 November 23 the two LIGO observatories both detected GW231123, a gravitational-wave signal consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses $137^{+23}_{-18}\, M_\odot$ and $101^{+22}_{-50}\, M_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals), at luminosity distance 0.7-4.1 Gpc and redshift of $0.40^{+0.27}_{-0.25}$, and a network signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$20.7. Both black holes exhibit high spins, $0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.52}$ respectively. A massive black hole remnant is supported by an independent ringdown analysis. Some properties of GW231123 are subject to large systematic uncertainties, as indicated by differences in inferred parameters between signal models. The primary black hole lies within or above the theorized mass gap where black holes between 60-130 $M_\odot$ should be rare due to pair instability mechanisms, while the secondary spans the gap. The observation of GW231123 therefore suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond standard stellar collapse, and that intermediate-mass black holes of mass $\sim$200 $M_\odot$ form through gravitational-wave driven mergers.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive search for Long and Short Periodic Features from an Extremely Active Cycle of FRB 20240114A</title>

Abstract: Possible periodic features in fast radio bursts (FRBs) may provide insights into their astrophysical origins. Using extensive observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we conduct a multi-timescale periodicity search for the exceptionally active repeater FRB~20240114A. Our analysis is based on different datasets for different timescales: for short-timescale periodicity in Time of Arrivals (TOAs), we use 57 observations from January to August 2024; for long-timescale periodicity, we employ an extended TOA dataset comprising 111 observations spanning from January 2024 to October 2025; and for burst time series analysis, we utilize individual burst data from the 57 FAST observations. We identify three candidate short-timescale periodic signals (0.673~s, 0.635~s, and 0.536~s) with significances of $3.2\sigma$--$6\sigma$, each detected in two independent observations. On longer timescales, we detect a significant $143.40\pm7.19$-day periodicity with $5.2\sigma$ significance, establishing FRB~20240114A as a periodic repeater. In burst time series, we find quasi-periodic oscillations in the few hundred Hz range ($3.4\sigma$ and $3.7\sigma$) and periodic burst trains with periods of several to tens of milliseconds ($3\sigma$--$3.9\sigma$), though these periodic features appear transient and short-lived. The detection of periodic signals at these different time scales indicates that FRB 20240114A exhibits intriguing periodic self-similar characteristics. Despite the comprehensive dataset, no definitive periodicity linked to the source's rotation is confirmed, placing stringent constraints on the intrinsic source properties and the modulation mechanisms. All data are available via the Science Data Bank.</description>

      <title>Enabling Early Transient Discovery in LSST via Difference Imaging with DECam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SLIDE, a pipeline that enables transient discovery in data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), using archival images from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) as templates for difference imaging. We apply this pipeline to the recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1; the first public release of Rubin commissioning data) and search for transients in the resulting difference images. The image subtraction, photometry extraction, and transient detection are all performed on the Rubin Science Platform. We demonstrate that SLIDE effectively extracts clean photometry by circumventing poor or missing LSST templates. We identified 29 previously unreported transients, 12 of which would not have been detected based on the DP1 DiaObject catalog. SLIDE will be especially useful for transient analysis in the early years of LSST, when template coverage will be largely incomplete or when templates may be contaminated by transients present at the time of acquisition. We present multiband light curves for a sample of known transients, along with new transient candidates identified through our search. Finally, we discuss the prospects of applying this pipeline during the main LSST survey. Our pipeline is broadly applicable and will support studies of all transients with slowly evolving phases.</description>

      <title>Identification and photometric classification of extragalactic transients in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1</title>

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will soon survey the southern sky, delivering a depth and sky coverage that is unprecedented in time domain astronomy. As part of commissioning, Data Preview 1 (DP1) has been released. It comprises a LSSTComCam observing campaign between November and December 2024 with multi-band imaging of seven fields, covering roughly 0.4 square degrees each, providing a first glimpse into the data products that will become available once the Legacy Survey of Space and Time begins. In this work, we search three fields for extragalactic transients. We identify eight new likely supernovae, and three known ones from a sample of 369,644 difference image analysis objects. Photometric classification using Superphot+ assigns sub-classes with &gt;95% confidence to only one SN Ia and one SN II in this sample. Our findings are in agreement with supernova detection rate predictions of $15\pm4$ supernovae from simulations using simsurvey. The supernova detection rate in the data is possibly affected by the lack of suitable templates. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates the quality of the data products delivered in DP1 and indicates that the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is well placed to fulfill its discovery potential in time domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>LOFAR constraints on the repetition &amp; environments of CHIME FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behaviour of fast radio bursts (FRBs) at radio frequencies &lt;400 MHz is not well understood due to very few detections, with only two known sources detected below 300 MHz. Characterising low-frequency emission of FRBs is vital for understanding FRB emission mechanisms and circumburst environments. We robustly characterise the 150 MHz activity CHIME-detected FRB sources relative to their 600 MHz activity -- using their non-detection in 473 h of archival observations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS), and 252 h of LOFAR observations of 14 repeating FRB sources, the largest sub-300 MHz targeted FRB campaign to date.
  In the LOTAAS data, we search for repeat bursts from 33 CHIME/FRB repeaters, 10 candidate repeaters and 430 apparent non-repeaters. Their non-detection yields a population-level constraint on the statistical spectral index $\alpha_{s, 150MHz/600MHz}&gt;-0.9$, indicating that FRB spectral indices are, on average, flatter than known spectral indices from pulsars. From the targeted campaign, we find that the prolific repeater FRB 20201124A shows a positive $\alpha_s&gt;0.55$, implying reduced low-frequency activity, unlike the typically negative $\alpha_{s}$ seen from FRBs at higher frequency bands. We explore free-free absorption in the circumburst environment as a cause of the non-detection at 150 MHz. The non-detection of FRB 20201124A is consistent with either a very young $\sim10$ yr old supernova remnant, or a typical HII region.
  Our simulations indicate that LOFAR2.0 can detect 0.3-9 FRBs per week, and up to 4 FRBs at redshifts in the range $1&lt;z&lt;3$. Such detections will provide robust constraints on cosmological parameters due to their clean environments. Our results guide future low-frequency FRB searches by showing how even non-detections can place meaningful constraints on the repetition rates and circumburst environments of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Exciting Stellar Eccentricity in Gaia BH3 via a Hidden Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the high eccentricity of the stellar orbit in Gaia BH3 system could be excited through a secular resonance effect if the inner dark object is, in effect, a tight and eccentric black hole binary (BHB). During the orbital decay of the inner BHB, the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary matches that of the outer stellar orbit, and this resonance advection can drive the outer eccentricity into some extreme values. For a Gaia BH3-like system, we show that a near equal-mass ($q=0.8$) BHB with an initial semi-major axis of 1--3 au and an initial eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.95$ is able to excite the outer orbit to the observed value, leaving a current BHB with semi-major axis 0.25--0.5 au and eccentricity $\sim 0.8$. The eccentric inner BHB imprints two observable signatures on the outer star: (1) short-term RV modulations with an amplitude $\lesssim 100$ m/s and (2) long-term apsidal precession with a rate $\lesssim 0.1^{\circ}$/yr. Although neither of these is detected in the currently available astrometry and RV data, we show that these signals are detectable with the full Gaia astrometry data and dedicated high-precision and/or long-term RV observations. Our work provides a new perspective on the dynamical formation of Gaia BH3, and the methodology is readily applicable to similar systems such as HD 130298, Gaia BH1, and Gaia BH2.</description>

      <title>Hard X-ray view of two $\gamma$-ray detected low-luminosity active galactic nuclei: NGC 315 and NGC 4261</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. The accretion disk of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Our goal is to find evidence of RIAF radiation from LLAGNs with jets and analyze their radiation properties, which also adds samples to future research on LLAGNs. Methods. Weconducted an analysis of the X-ray data obtained from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of NGC 315 and NGC 4261, encompassing both timing and spectral investigations. The joint X-ray spectra of the two LLAGNs were fitted using various functional forms and radiative models in XSPEC. Results. No significant variability on timescales of days is observed for both NGC 315 and NGC 4261. The X-ray continuum emission of NGC 315 is suitable for cutoff power-law (PL) fitting, yielding a cutoff energy of Ecut = 18.45 keV, which is the lowest value found in LLAGNssofar. In contrast, the X-ray continuum of NGC 4261 is composed of two PL components, with no signs of a cutoff energy. A prominent neutral Fe K{\alpha} line is observed in NGC 315, while an ionized Fe XXV line is seen in NGC 4261. The derived reflection fractions are R = 0.61 for NGC 315 and R = 0.18 for NGC 4579. Neither NGC 315 nor NGC 4261 shows evidence of a Compton reflection bump. Conclusions. The X-ray spectral characteristics support the RIAF emission as the dominant origin of the X-rays in both sources, although an additional soft PL component originating from the inner jet is observed in NGC 4261. The higher reflection fraction compared to other LLAGNs, along with the detection of a neutral Fe K{\alpha} line, suggests the existence of a truncated accretion disk with a relatively small radius in NGC 315. Bremsstrahlung radiation appears to be the dominant cooling mechanism for the plasma in NGC315, while Comptonization within the RIAF is more likely responsible for the X-ray emission in NGC 4261.</description>

      <title>A test of Amati relation using HII galaxy distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use model-independent luminosity distances of 186 HII galaxy observations to address the circularity problem in the Amati relation for Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs). For this purpose, we used Artificial Neural Network based interpolation to reconstruct the luminosity distance corresponding to the GRB redshift. We then use two independent GRB datasets to test the robustness of the Amati relation at redshifts below $z=2.6$. Our best-fit Amati relation parameters are consistent for the same datasets to within $1\sigma$. The intrinsic scatters which we obtain for the two datasets of about 28\% and 35\%, are comparatively larger. This implies that the Amati relation using HII galaxies as distance anchors cannot be used as a probe of precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Evolution of Gamma Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are classified as long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs) with collapsars and compact object mergers (neutron star (NS)-NS or NS-Black hole) as progenitors, respectively. The former are expected to follow the cosmic star formation rate (SFR), while the latter follows a delayed version of the SFR. However, this division has come under question in several ways, the most prominent being the observational evidence of a significant excess of LGRBs at low redhifts by several independent investigations, summarized in arXiv:2305.15081. This could indicate that the progenitors of low-redshift LGRBs, whose formation rates are delayed, (similar to that of SGRBs) are compact mergers rather than collapsars. Two recent observations of low-redshift LGRBs show associations with kilonovae, a clear feature of compact mergers. Most results showing this separation are based on analyses of small (less than 200) samples of LGRBs with measured redshifts. The aim of this paper is to use a larger sample of LGRBs. The number of LGRBs with measured redshifts has increased by more than a factor of 2 over the last decade. To this data set we add a sample of LGRBs whose redshifts are estimated using a machine learning (ML) method (arXiv:2410.13985). This, in addition to increasing the sample size, reduces the observational selection bias arising from the process of redshift measurement. To account for this bias, we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron-Petrosian method to establish the degree of correlation between luminosity and redshift, the luminosity evolution, which then allows us to use the Lynden-Bell $C^-$ method to obtain a complete description of the luminosity function. We find similar low redshift excess for the larger sample with measured redshifts. Adding the sources with ML-estimated redshifts, which tend to have more sources in mid-range redshifts, the excess is reduced.</description>

      <title>Spectral Diversity in Type Ibn Supernovae and the Large Host Offset of SN2024acyl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first present observations of SN~2024acyl, a normal Type Ibn supernova with a large projected offset ($\sim$35~kpc) from its host galaxy. The low star-formation rate measured at the explosion site raises the possibility that the progenitor of SN~2024acyl may not have been a massive star. We then examine, more broadly, the spectral diversity of Type Ibn supernovae around 20--35 days after peak brightness and identify two distinct groups: Group I, which shows bluer rest-frame optical color and narrower He~I emission lines; and Group II, which shows redder rest-frame optical color and broader He~I lines. Group~I also tends to show higher peak luminosities. The diversity we identify appears to be closely connected to the diversity observed around peak and to persist into late phases ($&gt;80$ days after peak). Given its redder color and broader He~I lines, we classify SN~2024acyl as belonging to Group II. Based on the current dataset, we find no clear connection between this spectral diversity and either the host environments of Type Ibn SNe or their pre-explosion activity. The observed diversity in Type Ibn SNe likely reflects differences in circumstellar material properties and/or explosion energetics. These differences could result from a range of progenitor properties, such as different helium star mass, orbital period and companion type if they are in binary systems, and may indicate fundamentally diverse progenitors. Whether a continuous distribution exists between the two groups remains to be determined and will require further data to explore.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Processes in Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow as the Origin of TeV Excesses in BL Lac Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of certain BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) exhibit an additional hard $\gamma$-ray component in the TeV energy range that surpasses the predictions of the one-zone leptonic jet model. The origin of this excess emission remains unclear. In this study, we selected five BL Lacs whose SEDs display a very hard intrinsic spectrum in the TeV band and successfully reproduced their broadband SEDs using a two-zone lepto-hadronic model. Within this framework, the emission observed in the optical, X-ray, GeV $\gamma$-ray, and sub-TeV $\gamma$-ray bands is modeled using the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton radiation processes of the relativistic electrons in the jets. Meanwhile, the TeV excess is attributed to $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from the photomeson ($p\gamma$) process via $\pi^0$ decay occurring within advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). This scenario requires a hard proton spectrum with a spectral index of $p \sim 1.6-1.7$ and a cutoff energy ranging from 30 to 90 TeV, as well as a relatively large ADAF radius. Such hard proton spectra suggest that the dominant acceleration mechanisms are likely magnetic reconnection and/or stochastic acceleration processes within ADAFs. Additionally, the emission from the cascaded electrons results in a bump in the keV--MeV band; however, it is overwhelmed by the jet emission. Although the hadronuclear ($pp$) process cannot be entirely ruled out, it would necessitate an even harder proton spectrum and a higher cutoff energy compared to the $p\gamma$ process, making it a less favorable explanation for the observed TeV excess.</description>

      <title>Charge-dependent spectral softenings of primary cosmic-rays from proton to iron below the knee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In most particle acceleration mechanisms, the maximum energy of the cosmic rays can achieve is charge dependent. However, the observational verification of such a fundamental relation is still lack due to the difficulty of measuring the spectra of individual particles from one (kind of) source(s) up to very high energies. This work reports direct measurements of the carbon, oxygen, and iron spectra from ~ 20 gigavolts to ~ 100 teravolts (~ 60 teravolts for iron) with 9 years of on-orbit data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE). Distinct spectral softenings have been directly detected in these spectra for the first time. Combined with the updated proton and helium spectra, the spectral softening appears universally at a rigidity of ~ 15 teravolts. A nuclei mass dependent softening is rejected at a confidence level of &gt; 99.999%. Taking into account the correlated structures at similar energies in the large-scale anisotropies of cosmic rays, one of the most natural interpretations of the spectral structures is the presence of a nearby cosmic ray source. In this case, the softening energies correspond to the acceleration upper limits of such a source, forming the so-called Peters cycle of the spectra. The results thus offer observational verification of the long-standing prediction of the charge-dependent energy limit of cosmic ray acceleration.</description>

      <title>Robust parameter estimation within minutes on gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron star inspirals contain information on nuclear matter above saturation density. However, extracting this information and conducting parameter estimation remains a computationally challenging and expensive task. Wong et al. introduced Jim arXiv:2302.05333, a parameter estimation pipeline that combines relative binning and jax features such as hardware acceleration and automatic differentiation into a normalizing flow-enhanced sampler for gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers. In this work, we extend the Jim framework to analyze gravitational wave signals from binary neutron stars (BNS) mergers with tidal effects included. We demonstrate that Jim can be used for full Bayesian parameter estimation of gravitational waves from BNS mergers within a few tens of minutes, which includes the training of the normalizing flow and computing the reference parameters for relative binning. For instance, Jim can analyze GW170817 in 26 minutes (33 minutes) of total wall time using the TaylorF2 (IMRPhenomD_NRTidalv2) waveform, and GW190425 in around 21 minutes for both waveforms. We highlight the importance of such an efficient parameter estimation pipeline for several science cases as well as its ecologically friendly implementation of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Symmetry energy dependence of the bulk viscosity of nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify how the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity $\zeta$ and the bulk relaxation time $\tau_\Pi$ of neutrino-transparent $npe$ matter depend on the nuclear symmetry energy. We show that, at saturation density, the equation-of-state dependence of these transport quantities is fully determined by the experimentally constrained nuclear symmetry energy $S$ and its slope $L$. Variations of $L$ can change the bulk viscosity by orders of magnitude, which can affect both the dissipative and the conservative tidal response of neutron stars. This suggests that both conservative and dissipative effects encoded in the gravitational-wave signatures of binary neutron star inspirals may help constrain nuclear symmetry energy properties.</description>

      <title>Fully Relativistic Treatment of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals in Collisionless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future mHz gravitational wave (GW) interferometers will precisely probe massive black hole environments, such as accretion discs, cold dark matter overdensities, and clouds of ultralight bosons, as long as we can accurately model the dephasing they induce on the waveform of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Most existing models rely on extrapolations from Newtonian results to model the interaction of the small black hole in an EMRI system with the environment surrounding the massive black hole. Here, we present a fully relativistic formalism to model such interaction with collisionless environments, focusing on the case of cold dark matter overdensities, like 'spikes' and 'mounds'. We implement our new formalism in the FastEMRIWaveforms framework and show that the resulting waveforms are significantly different from those based on a Newtonian treatment of environmental effects. Our results indicate that a fully relativistic treatment is essential to capture the environmental dephasing of GW signals from EMRIs accurately.</description>

      <title>Properties of Pair Plasmas Emerging from Electromagnetic Showers in Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic showers from high-energy electron beams interacting with a target are a promising path to creating pair plasmas in the laboratory. Here, we solve analytically the kinetic equations describing this process. Two regimes are defined by the ratio of the target thickness $L$ to the shower length $L_{\rm{sh}}$, which depends on the electron energy and target composition. For thin targets ($L &lt; L_{\rm{sh}}$), we derive explicit expressions for the spectra of produced photons and pairs, as well as the number of pairs. For thick targets ($L &gt; L_{\rm{sh}}$), we obtain the total pair number and photon spectrum. Analytical results agree well with Geant4 simulations, and it is found that significant pair escape requires $L &lt; L_{\rm{sh}}$. The divergence, density and characteristic dimensions of the escaping pair jets are derived, and a criterion for pair plasma formation is obtained. While current laser wakefield beams are not well adapted, multi-petawatt lasers may provide new electron or photon sources suitable for laboratory pair plasma production.</description>

      <title>Infrared diagnostics of late-time core-collapse supernova spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations of red supergiant and He-star explosions, extending previous work to focus on the infrared emission from atoms and ions in the ejecta during the nebular-phase (i.e., ~200 to ~500d) -- molecules and dust are ignored. We cover non-rotating solar-metallicity progenitors spanning an initial mass between 10 and about 40Msun and exploding as Type II or Ibc supernovae (SNe). Both photometrically and spectroscopically, the SN II models evolve distinctly from the SN Ibc models primarily because of the greater ejecta kinetic-energy-to-mass ratio in the latter, which leads to a greater gamma-ray escape together with a lower density and a higher ionization in our H-deficient ejecta. Type II SN models remain optically luminous at all times, whereas Type Ibc models progressively brighten in the infrared (which holds 80% of their luminosity at 500d), causing strong infrared lines such as [NeII]12.810mic and [NiII]6.634mic to evolve essentially at constant luminosity. The strength of [NeII]12.810mic exhibits a complicated dependence with either He-core or preSN mass because of the additional impact of ejecta ionization -- this line radiates alone up to 20% of the SN luminosity after ~300d in our Type Ibc SN models. The numerous infrared Ni lines are found to be good tracers of the material that underwent explosive nucleosynthesis and can thus be used directly to constrain the level of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SNe. The evolution of the integrated flux in infrared Fe and Co lines shows a great amount of diversity, which compromises their use as a diagnostic of the 56Ni-decay power source in our models. Future spectroscopic observations of core-collapse SNe by JWST will provide unprecedented information on the emission from atoms and ions in their ejecta, delivering critical constraints on massive star explosions.</description>

      <title>An optical to infrared study of type II SN2024ggi at nebular times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) -- all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at &lt;~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell -- accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing -- about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.</description>

Abstract: The precise measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$ provides a sensitive probe of exotic interactions between muons mediated by light beyond the Standard Model (BSM) bosons. Recent advances in both experiment and theory have largely reconciled the long-standing discrepancy in $a_\mu$. Using the latest result, $\Delta a_\mu = a^{\rm exp}_\mu - a^{\rm SM}_\mu = (38 \pm 63) \times 10^{-11}$, we derive updated limits on light BSM boson-mediated exotic muon interactions.</description>

      <title>Confronting general relativity with principal component analysis: Simulations and results from GWTC-3 events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive assessment of multiparameter tests of general relativity (GR) in the inspiral regime of compact binary coalescences using principal component analysis (PCA). Our analysis is based on an extensive set of simulated gravitational-wave (GW) signals, including both general relativistic and non-GR sources, injected into zero-noise data colored by the noise power spectral densities of the LIGO and Virgo GW detectors at their designed sensitivities. We evaluate the performance of PCA-based methods in the context of two established frameworks: TIGER and FTI. For GR-consistent signals, we find that PCA enables stringent constraints on potential deviations from GR, even in the presence of multiple free parameters. Applying the method to simulated signals that explicitly violate GR, we demonstrate that PCA is effective at identifying such deviations. We further test the method using numerical relativity waveforms of eccentric binary black hole systems and show that missing physical effects--such as orbital eccentricity--can lead to apparent violations of GR if not properly included in the waveform models used for analysis. Finally, we apply our PCA-based test to selected real gravitational-wave events from GWTC-3, including GW190814 and GW190412. We present joint constraints from selected binary black hole events in GWTC-3, finding that the 90% credible bound on the most informative PCA parameter is $0.03^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ in the TIGER framework and $-0.01^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in the FTI framework, both of which are consistent with GR. These results highlight the sensitivity and robustness of the PCA-based approach and demonstrate its readiness for application to future observational data from the fourth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.</description>
