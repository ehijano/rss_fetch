      <title>Finite-Time Behavior of Erlang-C Model: Mixing Time, Mean Queue Length and Tail Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Service systems like data centers and ride-hailing are popularly modeled as queueing systems in the literature. Such systems are primarily studied in the steady state due to their analytical tractability. However, almost all applications in real life do not operate in a steady state, so there is a clear discrepancy in translating theoretical queueing results to practical applications. To this end, we provide a finite-time convergence for Erlang-C systems (also known as $M/M/n$ queues), providing a stepping stone towards understanding the transient behavior of more general queueing systems. We obtain a bound on the Chi-square distance between the finite time queue length distribution and the stationary distribution for a finite number of servers. We then use these bounds to study the behavior in the many-server heavy-traffic asymptotic regimes. The Erlang-C model exhibits a phase transition at the so-called Halfin-Whitt regime. We show that our mixing rate matches the limiting behavior in the Super-Halfin-Whitt regime, and matches up to a constant factor in the Sub-Halfin-Whitt regime.
  To prove such a result, we employ the Lyapunov-Poincar\'e approach, where we first carefully design a Lyapunov function to obtain a negative drift outside a finite set. Within the finite set, we develop different strategies depending on the properties of the finite set to get a handle on the mixing behavior via a local Poincar\'e inequality. A key aspect of our methodological contribution is in obtaining tight guarantees in these two regions, which when combined give us tight mixing time bounds. We believe that this approach is of independent interest for studying mixing in reversible countable-state Markov chains more generally.</description>

      <title>Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity, which has attracted much recent attention in the mathematics literature. Timelike Liouville field theory is a version of Liouville field theory where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign, which makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) Liouville field theory. Making sense of this "wrong sign" requires a theory of Gaussian random variables with negative variance. Such a theory is developed in this paper, and is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called "charge neutrality condition". Expressions are derived also for the $k$-point correlation functions for all $k\ge 3$, and it is shown that these functions approach the correct semiclassical limits as the coupling constant is sent to zero.</description>

      <title>Stochastic domination and lifts of random variables in percolation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider some matrix waiting for its coefficients to be written. For each column, sample independently one Bernoulli random variable of some parameter $p$. Seeing all this and possibly using extra randomness, Alice then chooses one spot in each column, in any way she wants. When the Bernoulli random variable of some column is equal to 1, the number 1 is written in the chosen spot. When the Bernoulli random variable of a column is 0, nothing is done on this column. We prove that, using extra randomness, it is possible for Bob to fill the empty spots with well chosen 0's and 1's so that the entries of the matrix are independent Bernoulli random variables of parameter $p$. We investigate various generalisations and variations of this problem, and use this result to revisit and generalise (nonstrict) monotonicity of the percolation threshold $p_c$ with respect to some sort of graph-quotienting, namely fibrations.
  In a second part, which is independent of the first one, we revisit strict monotonicity of $p_c$ with respect to fibrations, a result that naturally requires more assumptions than its nonstrict counterpart. We reprove the bond-percolation case of the result of Martineau--Severo without resorting to essential enhancements, using couplings instead.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Voronoi percolation in higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the uniqueness thresholds for Poisson-Voronoi percolation in symmetric spaces of connected higher rank semisimple Lie groups with property (T) converge to zero in the low-intensity limit. This phenomenon is fundamentally different from situations in which Poisson-Voronoi percolation has previously been studied.
  Our approach builds on a recent breakthrough of Fraczyk, Mellick and Wilkens (arXiv:2307.01194) and provides an alternative proof strategy for Gaboriau's fixed price problem. As a further application of our result, we give a new class of examples of non-amenable Cayley graphs that admit factor of iid bond percolations with a unique infinite cluster and arbitrarily small expected degree, answering a question inspired by Hutchcroft-Pete (Invent. math. 221 (2020)).}</description>

      <title>Berry-Esseen bound for the Moment Estimation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model under fixed step size discrete observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process $\{X_t,\,t\geq 0\}$ driven by a fractional Brownian motion $B^H$ described by $d X_t=-\theta X_t dt+ d B_t^H,\, X_0=0$ with known parameter $H\in (0,\frac34)$ be observed at discrete time instants $t_k=kh, k=1,2,\dots, n $. If $\theta&gt;0$ and if the step size $h&gt;0$ is arbitrarily fixed, we derive Berry-Ess\'{e}en bound for the ergodic type estimator (or say the moment estimator) $\hat{\theta}_n$, i.e., the Kolmogorov distance between the distribution of $\sqrt{n}(\hat{\theta}_n-\theta)$ and its limit distribution is bounded by a constant $C_{\theta, H,h}$ times $n^{-\frac12}$ and $ n^{4H-3}$ when $H\in (0,\,\frac58]$ and $H\in (\frac58,\,\frac34)$, respectively. This result greatly improve the previous result in literature where $h$ is forced to go zero. Moreover, we extend the Berry-Esseen bound to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model driven by a lot of Gaussian noises such as the sub-bifractional Brownian motion and others. A few ideas of the present paper come from Haress and Hu (2021), Sottinen and Viitasaari (2018), and Chen and Zhou (2021).</description>

      <title>Berry-Esseen bounds for step-reinforced random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study both the positively and negatively step-reinforced random walks with parameter $p$. For a step distribution $\mu$ with finite second moment, the positively step-reinforced random walk with $p\in [1/2,1)$ and the negatively step-reinforced random walk with $p\in (0,1)$ converge to a normal distribution under suitable normalization. In this work, we obtain the rates of convergence to normality for both cases under the assumption that $\mu$ has a finite third moment. In the proofs, we establish a Berry-Esseen bound for general functionals of independent random variables, utilize the randomly weighted sum representations of step-reinforced random walks, and apply special comparison arguments to quantify the Kolmogorov distance between a mixed normal distribution and its corresponding normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Symplectic techniques for stochastic differential equations on reductive Lie groups with applications to Langevin diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how Langevin diffusions can be interpreted in the context of stochastic Hamiltonian systems with structure-preserving noise and dissipation on reductive Lie groups. Reductive Lie groups provide the setting in which the Lie group structure is compatible with Riemannian structures, via the existence of bi-invariant metrics. This structure allows for the explicit construction of Riemannian Brownian motion via symplectic techniques, which permits the study of Langevin diffusions with noise in the position coordinate as well as Langevin diffusions with noise in both momentum and position.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the affine preferential attachment model where triangles are randomly added to the graph. We show that the model exhibits an asymptotically power-law degree distribution with adjustable parameter $\gamma\in (1,\infty)$, and positive clustering. However, the clustering behaviour depends on how it is measured. With high probability, the average local clustering coefficient remains positive, independently of $\gamma$, whereas the expectation of the global clustering coefficient does not vanish only when $\gamma&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Sharp connectivity bounds for the vacant set of random interlacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider percolation of the vacant set of random interlacements at intensity $u$ in dimensions three and higher, and derive lower bounds on the truncated two-point function for all values of $u&gt;0$. These bounds are sharp up to principal exponential order for all $u$ in dimension three and all $u \neq u_\ast$ in higher dimensions, where $u_*$ refers to the critical parameter of the model, and they match the upper bounds derived in the article arXiv:2503.14497. In dimension three, our results further imply that the truncated two-point function grows at large distances $x$ at a rate that depends on $x$ only through its Euclidean norm, which offers a glimpse of the expected (Euclidean) invariance of the scaling limit at criticality. The rate function is atypical, it incurs a logarithmic correction and comes with an explicit pre-factor that converges to $0$ as the parameter $u$ approaches the critical point $u_*$ from either side. A particular challenge stems from the combined effects of lack of monotonicity due to the truncation in the super-critical phase, and the precise (rotationally invariant) controls we seek, that measure the effects of a certain "harmonic humpback" function. Among others, their derivation relies on rather fine estimates for hitting probabilities of the random walk in arbitrary direction $e$, which witness this invariance at the discrete level, and preclude straightforward applications of projection arguments.</description>

      <title>The Markov approximation of the periodic multivariate Poisson autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a periodic multivariate Poisson autoregression with potentially infinite memory, with a special focus on the network setting. Using contraction techniques, we study the stability of such a process and provide upper bounds on how fast it reaches the periodically stationary regime. We then propose a computationally efficient Markov approximation using the properties of the exponential function and a density result. Furthermore, we prove the strong consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator for the Markov approximation and empirically test its robustness in the case of misspecification. Our model is applied to the prediction of weekly Rotavirus cases in Berlin, demonstrating superior performance compared to the existing PNAR model.</description>

      <title>Convergence of permuted products of exponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\{A_{i,n}\}$ be a triangular array of elements in a Banach algebra, whose norms do not grow too fast, and whose row averages converge to $A$. Let $\sigma \in S(n)$ be a permutation drawn uniformly at random. If the array only contains $o(n / \log n)$ distinct elements, then almost surely, for all $0 &lt; s &lt; t &lt; 1$, the permuted product of their exponentials $\prod_{i = [s n]}^{[t n]} e^{A_{\sigma(i),n}/n}$ converges in norm to $e^{(t - s) A}$. For an array of finite-dimensional matrices, convergence holds without this restriction. The proof of the latter result consists of an estimate valid in a general Banach algebra, and an application of a matrix concentration inequality.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for interacting particle systems on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study weakly interacting diffusion processes on random graphs. Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness of stationary states. By extending classical bifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and random graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate them to the eigenvalues of the graphon integral operator. Furthermore, we characterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric. We combine these theoretical results with the spectral analysis of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator and extensive numerical simulations to gain insight into the stability and long-term behaviour of stationary solutions. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic interactions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to the dynamical metastability of the system.</description>

      <title>Faster Mixing of the Jerrum-Sinclair Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Jerrum-Sinclair Markov chain on matchings mixes in time $\widetilde{O}(\Delta^2 m)$ on any graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and maximum degree $\Delta$, for any constant edge weight $\lambda&gt;0$. For general graphs with arbitrary, potentially unbounded $\Delta$, this provides the first improvement over the classic $\widetilde{O}(n^2 m)$ mixing time bound of Jerrum and Sinclair (1989) and Sinclair (1992).
  To achieve this, we develop a general framework for analyzing mixing times, combining ideas from the classic canonical path method with the "local-to-global" approaches recently developed in high-dimensional expanders, introducing key innovations to both techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns models and convergence principles for dealing with stochasticity in a wide range of algorithms arising in nonlinear analysis and optimization in Hilbert spaces. It proposes a flexible geometric framework within which existing solution methods can be recast and improved, and new ones can be designed. Almost sure weak, strong, and linear convergence results are established in particular for fixed point and feasibility problems. In these areas, the proposed algorithms exceed the features of the state of the art in several respects. Numerical applications to signal and image recovery are provided.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Markovian iteration for coupled FBSDEs via a differentiation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Markovian iteration method for solving coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) featuring a fully coupled forward drift, meaning the drift term explicitly depends on both the forward and backward processes. An FBSDE system typically involves three stochastic processes: the forward process $X$, the backward process $Y$ representing the solution, and the $Z$ process corresponding to the scaled derivative of $Y$. Prior research by Bender and Zhang (2008) has established convergence results for iterative schemes dealing with $Y$-coupled FBSDEs. However, extending these results to equations with $Z$ coupling poses significant challenges, especially in uniformly controlling the Lipschitz constant of the decoupling fields across iterations and time steps within a fixed-point framework.
  To overcome this issue, we propose a novel differentiation-based method for handling the $Z$ process. This approach enables improved management of the Lipschitz continuity of decoupling fields, facilitating the well-posedness of the discretized FBSDE system with fully coupled drift. We rigorously prove the convergence of our Markovian iteration method in this more complex setting. Finally, numerical experiments confirm our theoretical insights, showcasing the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Persistence and Ball Exponents for Gaussian Stationary Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a real Gaussian stationary process $f_\rho$, indexed on either $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ and admitting a spectral measure $\rho$. We study $\theta_{\rho}^\ell=-\lim\limits_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T} \log\mathbb{P}\left(\inf_{t\in[0,T]}f_{\rho}(t)&gt;\ell\right)$, the persistence exponent of $f_\rho$. We show that, if $\rho$ has a positive density at the origin, then the persistence exponent exists; moreover, if $\rho$ has an absolutely continuous component, then $\theta_{\rho}^\ell&gt;0$ if and only if this spectral density at the origin is finite. We further establish continuity of $\theta_{\rho}^\ell$ in $\ell$, in $\rho$ (under a suitable metric) and, if $\rho$ is compactly supported, also in dense sampling. Analogous continuity properties are shown for $\psi_{\rho}^\ell=-\lim\limits_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T} \log\mathbb{P}\left(\inf_{t\in[0,T]}|f_{\rho}(t)|\le \ell\right)$, the ball exponent of $f_\rho$, and it is shown to be positive if and only if $\rho$ has an absolutely continuous component.</description>

      <title>Coupled bialgebras and Lions trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Bialgebra is a module over a ring that is both an associative algebra and a co-associative coalgebra with the product and coproduct additionally satisfying an appropriate commutative relationship.
  One application of Bialgebras is in the study of Taylor expansions where the product describes how for any increment, two terms of the Taylor expansion can be combined together to obtain a higher order term, while the coproduct describes how a term can be decomposed into lower order terms over two adjacent increments.
  Our motivation is the study of higher order Lions-Taylor expansions and more generally to probabilistic rough paths. The application of iterative Lions derivatives generates a collection of free variables. When terms from a Lions-Taylor expansion are themselves Lions-Taylor expanded, each of these free variables are viewed as tagged and so need Taylor expanding on which greatly increases the number of variables that one needs to keep track of. This additional structure typically takes the form of couplings between terms that arise through the application of the coproduct.
  The purpose of this work is to document the combinatorial properties of Lions forests (which are central to many key interpretations of probabilistic rough paths) and more formally describe the coupled Bialgebra structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study limit shapes in two equivalent models: the six-vertex model in the $c\to0$ limit and the random Mallows permutation with restricted permutation matrix. We give the Euler-Lagrange equation for the limit shape and show how to solve it for a class of rectilinear polygonal domains. Its solutions are given by piecewise-algebraic functions with lines of discontinuities.</description>

      <title>Applications of optimal transport to Dyson Brownian Motions and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain sharp modulus of continuity estimates for $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motions with $\beta\geq 2$. Our approach is based on Caffarelli's contraction theorem in optimal transport. We develop the same estimates for a large class of line ensembles, which can be viewed as log-concave perturbations of Brownian motions, including $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motions, the Airy line ensemble, the KPZ line ensemble, and the O'Connell-Yor line ensemble. Our estimates are uniform for all curves, and this allows us to address a conjecture in [Wu23b].</description>

      <title>Processes on Wasserstein spaces and energy-minimizing particle representations in fractional Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a probability-measure-valued process $(\mu_t)$, we aim to find, among all path-continuous stochastic processes whose one-dimensional time marginals coincide almost surely with $(\mu_t)$ (if there is any), a process that minimizes a given energy in expectation. Building on our recent study (arXiv:2502.12068), where the minimization of fractional Sobolev energy was investigated for deterministic paths on Wasserstein spaces, we now extend the results to the stochastic setting to address some applications that originally motivated our study. Two applications are given. We construct minimizing particle representations for processes on Wasserstein spaces on $\mathbb{R}$ with H\"{o}lder regularity, using optimal transportation. We prove the existence of minimizing particle representations for solutions to stochastic Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations on $\mathbb{R}^\mathrm{d}$ satisfying an integrability condition, using the stochastic superposition principle of Lacker--Shkolnikov--Zhang (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 25, 3229--3288 (2023)).</description>

Abstract: We treat some classes of linear and semilinear stochastic partial differential equations of Schr\"odinger type on $\mathbb{R}^d$, involving a non-flat Laplacian, within the framework of white noise analysis, combined with Wiener-It\^o chaos expansions and pseudodifferential operator methods. The initial data and potential term of the Schr\"odinger operator are assumed to be generalized stochastic processes that have spatial dependence. We prove that the equations under consideration have unique solutions in the appropriate (intersections of weighted) Sobolev-Kato-Kondratiev spaces.</description>

      <title>A time-stepping deep gradient flow method for option pricing in (rough) diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel deep learning approach for pricing European options in diffusion models, that can efficiently handle high-dimensional problems resulting from Markovian approximations of rough volatility models. The option pricing partial differential equation is reformulated as an energy minimization problem, which is approximated in a time-stepping fashion by deep artificial neural networks. The proposed scheme respects the asymptotic behavior of option prices for large levels of moneyness, and adheres to a priori known bounds for option prices. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is assessed in a series of numerical examples, with particular focus in the lifted Heston model.</description>

      <title>The torus plateau for the high-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Ising model on a $d$-dimensional discrete torus of volume $r^d$, in dimensions $d&gt;4$ and for large $r$, in the vicinity of the infinite-volume critical point $\beta_c$. We prove that for $\beta=\beta_c- {\rm const}\, r^{-d/2}$ (with a suitable constant) the susceptibility is bounded above and below by multiples of $r^{d/2}$. Additionally, again for $\beta=\beta_c- {\rm const}\, r^{-d/2}$, the two-point function has a ``plateau'': it decays like $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ when $|x|$ is small relative to the volume, but for larger $|x|$, it levels off to a constant value of order $r^{-d/2}$. We also prove that at $\beta=\beta_c- {\rm const}\, r^{-d/2}$ the renormalised coupling constant is nonzero, which implies a non-Gaussian limit for the average spin. The proof relies on near-critical estimates for the infinite-volume two-point function obtained recently by Duminil-Copin and Panis, and builds upon a strategy proposed by Papathanakos. The random current representation of the Ising model plays a central role in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Free cumulants and freeness for unitarily invariant random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question of the asymptotic description of random tensors that are local-unitary invariant, that is, invariant by conjugation by tensor products of independent unitary matrices. We consider both the mixed case of a tensor with $D$ inputs and $D$ outputs, and the case where there is a factorization between the inputs and outputs, called pure, which includes the random tensor models extensively studied in the physics literature.
  The finite size and asymptotic moments are defined using correlations of certain invariant polynomials encoded by $D$-tuples of permutations, up to relabeling equivalence. Finite size free cumulants associated to the expectations of these invariants are defined through invertible finite size moment-cumulants formulas.
  Two important cases are considered asymptotically: pure random tensors that scale like a complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a Wishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of tensorial free cumulants associated to first order invariants, through moment-cumulant formulas involving summations over non-crossing permutations. The pure and mixed cases involve the same combinatorics, but differ by the invariants that define the distribution at first order. In both cases, the tensorial free-cumulants of a sum of two independent tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of higher orders is provided.
  Tensor freeness is then defined as the vanishing of mixed first order tensorial free cumulants. The equivalent formulation at the level of asymptotic moments is derived in the pure and mixed cases, and we provide an algebraic construction of tensorial probability spaces, which generalize non-commutative probability spaces: random tensors converge in distribution to elements of these spaces, and tensor freeness of random variables corresponds to tensor freeness of the subspaces they generate.</description>

      <title>TowerDebias: A Novel Unfairness Removal Method Based on the Tower Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision-making processes have increasingly come to rely on sophisticated machine learning tools, raising critical concerns about the fairness of their predictions with respect to sensitive groups. The widespread adoption of commercial "black-box" models necessitates careful consideration of their legal and ethical implications for consumers. When users interact with such black-box models, a key challenge arises: how can the influence of sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, be mitigated or removed from its predictions? We propose towerDebias (tDB), a novel post-processing method designed to reduce the influence of sensitive attributes in predictions made by black-box models. Our tDB approach leverages the Tower Property from probability theory to improve prediction fairness without requiring retraining of the original model. This method is highly versatile, as it requires no prior knowledge of the original algorithm's internal structure and is adaptable to a diverse range of applications. We present a formal fairness improvement theorem for tDB and showcase its effectiveness in both regression and classification tasks using multiple real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Games: A Framework for Bounded Perception in Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In everyday life, we frequently make coarse-grained judgments. When we say that Olivia and Noah excel in mathematics, we disregard the specific differences in their mathematical abilities. Similarly, when we claim that a particular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the minor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments are distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting from student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the prevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their underlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games where players may perceive different payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure. We call it a Coarse-Grained Game (CGG). This framework allows us to examine the rational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct micro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are preserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that CGGs possess several desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in the social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in cases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium selection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective quality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through objective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual resolution or recognition ability.</description>
