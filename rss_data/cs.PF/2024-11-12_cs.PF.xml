      <title>Advancing GPU IPC for stiff affine-deformable simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06224</link>

Abstract: Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) is a widely used, robust, and accurate method for simulating complex frictional contact behaviors. However, achieving high efficiency remains a major challenge, particularly as material stiffness increases, which leads to slower Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) convergence, even with the state-of-the-art preconditioners. In this paper, we propose a fully GPU-optimized IPC simulation framework capable of handling materials across a wide range of stiffnesses, delivering consistent high performance and scalability with up to 10x speedup over state-of-the-art GPU IPC methods. Our framework introduces three key innovations: 1) A novel connectivity-enhanced Multilevel Additive Schwarz (MAS) preconditioner on the GPU, designed to efficiently capture both stiff and soft elastodynamics and improve PCG convergence at a reduced preconditioning cost. 2) A C2-continuous cubic energy with an analytic eigensystem for strain limiting, enabling more parallel-friendly simulations of stiff membranes, such as cloth, without membrane locking. 3) For extremely stiff behaviors where elastic waves are barely visible, we employ affine body dynamics (ABD) with a hash-based multi-layer reduction strategy for fast Hessian assembly and efficient affine-deformable coupling. We conduct extensive performance analyses and benchmark studies to compare our framework against state-of-the-art methods and alternative design choices. Our system consistently delivers the fastest performance across soft, stiff, and hybrid simulation scenarios, even in cases with high resolution, large deformations, and high-speed impacts. Our framework will be fully open-sourced upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>On Resolving Non-Preemptivity in Multitask Scheduling: An Optimal Algorithm in Deterministic and Stochastic Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06348</link>

Abstract: The efficient scheduling of multi-task jobs across multiprocessor systems has become increasingly critical with the rapid expansion of computational systems. This challenge, known as Multiprocessor Multitask Scheduling (MPMS), is essential for optimizing the performance and scalability of applications in fields such as cloud computing and deep learning. In this paper, we study the MPMS problem under both deterministic and stochastic models, where each job is composed of multiple tasks and can only be completed when all its tasks are finished. We introduce $\mathsf{NP}$-$\mathsf{SRPT}$, a non-preemptive variant of the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) algorithm, designed to accommodate scenarios with non-preemptive tasks. Our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $\ln \alpha + \beta + 1$ for minimizing response time, where $\alpha$ represents the ratio of the largest to the smallest job workload, and $\beta$ captures the ratio of the largest non-preemptive task workload to the smallest job workload. We further establish that this competitive ratio is order-optimal when the number of processors is fixed. For stochastic systems modeled as M/G/N queues, where job arrivals follow a Poisson process and task workloads are drawn from a general distribution, we prove that $\mathsf{NP}$-$\mathsf{SRPT}$ achieves asymptotically optimal mean response time as the traffic intensity $\rho$ approaches $1$, assuming the task size distribution has finite support. Moreover, the asymptotic optimality extends to cases with infinite task size distributions under mild probabilistic assumptions, including the standard M/M/N model. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of $\mathsf{NP}$-$\mathsf{SRPT}$, demonstrating its asymptotic optimality in both theoretical and practical settings.</description>

      <title>OPTIMA: Design-Space Exploration of Discharge-Based In-SRAM Computing: Quantifying Energy-Accuracy Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06846</link>

Abstract: In-SRAM computing promises energy efficiency, but circuit nonlinearities and PVT variations pose major challenges in designing robust accelerators. To address this, we introduce OPTIMA, a modeling framework that aids in analyzing bit-line discharge and power consumption in 6T-SRAM-based accelerators. It provides insights into limiting factors and enables fast design-space exploration of circuit configurations. Leveraging OPTIMA for in-SRAM multiplications exhibits ~100x simulation speed-up while maintaining an RMS modeling error of 0.88mV. Exploration yields an optimized multiplier with 1.05pJ energy consumption per 4-bit operation and classification accuracies of 71.8% (top-1) and 90.4% (top-5) for ImageNet and 92.5% for CIFAR-10 datasets respectively when applied in quantized DNNs. To further support research and development, we made our tool flow available open source at https://github.com/sevjaeg/optima.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Geometry Framework for Performance Analysis of RIS-assisted OFDM Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06754</link>

Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology allows one to engineer spatial diversity in complex cellular networks. This paper provides a framework for the system-level performance assessment of RIS-assisted networks and in particular downlink coverage probability and ergodic rate. To account for the inherent randomness in the spatial deployments of base stations (BSs) and RISs, we model the placements of the RISs as point processes (PPs) conditioned on the associated BSs, which are modeled by a Poisson point process (PPP). These RIS PPs can be adapted based on the deployment strategy. We focus on modeling the RISs as a Mat\'ern cluster process (MCP), where each RIS cluster is a finite PPP with support a disc centered on the association BS. We assume that the system uses the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique to exploit the multipath diversity provided by RISs. The coverage probability and the ergodic rate can be evaluated when RISs operate as batched powerless beamformers. The resulting analytical expressions provide a general methodology to evaluate the impact of key RIS-related parameters, such as the batch size and the density of RISs, on system-level performance. To demonstrate the framework's broad applicability, we also analyze a RIS placement variant where RISs are deployed around coverage holes. Numerical evaluations of the analytical expressions and Monte-Carlo simulations jointly validate the proposed analytical approach and provide valuable insights into the design of future RIS-assisted cellular networks.</description>
