      <title>Annotated Dependency Pairs for Full Almost-Sure Termination of Probabilistic Term Rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dependency pairs (DPs) are one of the most powerful techniques for automated termination analysis of term rewrite systems. Recently, we adapted the DP framework to the probabilistic setting to prove almost-sure termination (AST) via annotated DPs (ADPs). However, this adaption only handled AST w.r.t. the innermost evaluation strategy. In this paper, we improve the ADP framework to prove AST for full rewriting. Moreover, we refine the framework for rewrite sequences that start with basic terms containing a single defined function symbol. We implemented and evaluated the new framework in our tool AProVE.</description>

      <title>Catamorphic Abstractions for Constrained Horn Clause Satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catamorphisms are functions that are recursively defined on list and trees and, in general, on Algebraic Data Types (ADTs), and are often used to compute suitable abstractions of programs that manipulate ADTs. Examples of catamorphisms include functions that compute size of lists, orderedness of lists, and height of trees. It is well known that program properties specified through catamorphisms can be proved by showing the satisfiability of suitable sets of Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs). We address the problem of checking the satisfiability of those sets of CHCs, and we propose a method for transforming sets of CHCs into equisatisfiable sets where catamorphisms are no longer present. As a consequence, clauses with catamorphisms can be handled without extending the satisfiability algorithms used by existing CHC solvers. Through an experimental evaluation on a non-trivial benchmark consisting of many list and tree processing algorithms expressed as sets of CHCs, we show that our technique is indeed effective and significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art CHC solvers.</description>

      <title>Model Counting in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model counting is a fundamental problem in automated reasoning with applications in probabilistic inference, network reliability, neural network verification, and more. Although model counting is computationally intractable from a theoretical perspective due to its #P-completeness, the past decade has seen significant progress in developing state-of-the-art model counters to address scalability challenges.
  In this work, we conduct a rigorous assessment of the scalability of model counters in the wild. To this end, we surveyed 11 application domains and collected an aggregate of 2262 benchmarks from these domains. We then evaluated six state-of-the-art model counters on these instances to assess scalability and runtime performance.
  Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the performance of model counters varies significantly across different application domains, underscoring the need for careful selection by the end user. Additionally, we investigated the behavior of different counters with respect to two parameters suggested by the model counting community, finding only a weak correlation. Our analysis highlights the challenges and opportunities for portfolio-based approaches in model counting.</description>

      <title>On Representing Humans' Soft-Ethics Preferences As Dispositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to represent humans' soft-ethical preferences by means of dispositional properties. We begin by examining real-life situations, termed as scenarios, that involve ethical dilemmas. Users engage with these scenarios, making decisions on how to act and providing justifications for their choices. We adopt a dispositional approach to represent these scenarios and the interaction with the users. Dispositions are properties that are instantiated by any kind of entity and that may manifest if properly triggered. In particular, the dispositional properties we are interested in are the ethical and behavioural ones. The approach will be described by means of examples. The ultimate goal is to implement the results of this work into a software exoskeleton solution aimed at augmenting human capabilities by preserving their soft-ethical preferences in interactions with autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Structural Games and Number of Quantifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14709v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multi-structural games, played on two sets $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of structures. These games generalize Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} games. Whereas Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} games capture the quantifier rank of a first-order sentence, multi-structural games capture the number of quantifiers, in the sense that Spoiler wins the $r$-round game if and only if there is a first-order sentence $\phi$ with at most $r$ quantifiers, where every structure in $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies $\phi$ and no structure in $\mathcal{B}$ satisfies $\phi$. We use these games to give a complete characterization of the number of quantifiers required to distinguish linear orders of different sizes, and develop machinery for analyzing structures beyond linear orders.</description>

      <title>State-based Modal Logics for Free Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mathematical properties of bilateral state-based modal logic (BSML), a modal logic employing state-based semantics (also known as team semantics), which has been used to account for free choice inferences and related linguistic phenomena. This logic extends classical modal logic with a nonemptiness atom which is true in a state if and only if the state is nonempty. We introduce two extensions of BSML and show that the extensions are expressively complete, and develop natural deduction axiomatizations for the three logics.</description>

      <title>The Distributional Uncertainty of the SHAP score in Explainable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12731v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attribution scores reflect how important the feature values in an input entity are for the output of a machine learning model. One of the most popular attribution scores is the SHAP score, which is an instantiation of the general Shapley value used in coalition game theory. The definition of this score relies on a probability distribution on the entity population. Since the exact distribution is generally unknown, it needs to be assigned subjectively or be estimated from data, which may lead to misleading feature scores. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for reasoning on SHAP scores under unknown entity population distributions. In our framework, we consider an uncertainty region that contains the potential distributions, and the SHAP score of a feature becomes a function defined over this region. We study the basic problems of finding maxima and minima of this function, which allows us to determine tight ranges for the SHAP scores of all features. In particular, we pinpoint the complexity of these problems, and other related ones, showing them to be NP-complete. Finally, we present experiments on a real-world dataset, showing that our framework may contribute to a more robust feature scoring.</description>

      <title>Towards Verifying Exact Conditions of Density Functional Theory Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used extensively in the computation of electronic properties of matter, with various applications. Approximating the exchange-correlation (XC) functional is the key to the Kohn-Sham DFT approach, the basis of most DFT calculations. The choice of this density functional approximation (DFA) depends crucially on the particular system under study, which has resulted in the development of hundreds of DFAs. Though the exact density functional is not known, researchers have discovered analytical properties of this exact functional. Furthermore, these exact conditions are used when designing DFAs. We present XCVerifier, the first approach for verifying whether a DFA implementation satisfies the DFT exact conditions. XCVerifier was evaluated on five DFAs from the popular Libxc library and seven exact conditions from recent work. XCVerifier was able to verify or find violations for a majority of the DFA/condition pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of using formal methods to verify DFA implementations.</description>
