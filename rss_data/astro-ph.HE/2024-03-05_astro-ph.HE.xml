      <title>pAGN: the one-stop solution for AGN disc modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of accretion discs surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) find vast applications in high-energy astrophysics. The broad strategy is to parametrize some of the key disc properties such as gas density and temperature as a function of the radial coordinate from a given set of assumptions on the underlying physics. Two of the most popular approaches in this context were presented by Sirko &amp; Goodman (2003) and Thompson et al. (2005). We present a critical reanalysis of these widely used models, detailing their assumptions and clarifying some steps in their derivation that were previously left unsaid. Our findings are implemented in the pAGN module for the Python programming language, which is the first public implementation of these accretion-disc models. We further apply pAGN to the evolution of stellar-mass black holes embedded in AGN discs, addressing the potential occurrence of migration traps.</description>

      <title>Probing AGN jet precession with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precession of astrophysical jets produced by active-galactic nuclei is likely related to the dynamics of the accretion disks surrounding the central supermassive black holes (BHs) from which jets are launched. The two main mechanisms that can drive jet precession arise from Lense-Thirring precession and tidal torquing. These can explain direct and indirect observations of precessing jets; however, such explanations often utilize crude approximations of the disk evolution and observing jet precession can be challenging with electromagnetic facilities. Simultaneously, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to measure gravitational waves from the mergers of massive binary BHs with high accuracy and probe their progenitor evolution. In this paper, we connect the LISA detectability of binary BH mergers to the possible jet precession during their progenitor evolution. We make use of a semi-analytic model that self-consistently treats disk-driven BH alignment and binary inspiral and includes the possibility of disk breaking. We find that tidal torquing of the accretion disk provides a wide range of jet precession timescales depending on the binary separation and the spin direction of the BH from which the jet is launched. Efficient disk-driven BH alignment results in shorter timescales of $\sim 1$ yr which are correlated with higher LISA signal-to-noise ratios. Disk breaking results in the longest possible times of $\sim 10^7$ yrs, suggesting a deep interplay between the disk critical obliquity (i.e. where the disk breaks) and jet precession. Studies such as ours will help to reveal the cosmic population of precessing jets that are detectable with gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The Physical Properties of Changing-look Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are a special class of AGNs that change their spectral type from type 1 to type 2 or vice versa. In recent years, a number of changing-look blazars (CLBs) were also reported, which transition between flat-spectrum radio quasars and BL Lacs. The physical properties of CLBs are still unclear. Using the $mclust$ R package for Gaussian Mixture Modeling, we performed a clustering analysis for a sample of 105 CLBs selected from the literature. Three kinds of analysis found that CLBs lie in between the parameter distributions of FSRQs and BL Lacs: (i) univariate analysis; (ii) bivariate analysis; and (iii) multivariate analysis, carried out with a dimension reduction approach of the physical properties of the three types of blazars. Our results suggest that CLBs belong to a transition type between FSRQs and BL Lacs, which may be regulated by the change of accretion process and may be similar to other changing-look AGNs.</description>

      <title>Fires in the deep: The luminosity distribution of early-time gamma-ray-burst afterglows in light of the Gamow Explorer sensitivity requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are ideal probes of the Universe at high redshift (z &gt; 5), pinpointing the locations of the earliest star-forming galaxies and providing bright backlights that can be used to spectrally fingerprint the intergalactic medium and host galaxy during the period of reionization. Future missions such as Gamow Explorer are being proposed to unlock this potential by increasing the rate of identification of high-z GRBs to rapidly trigger observations from 6-10 m ground telescopes, JWST, and the Extremely Large Telescopes. Gamow was proposed to the NASA 2021 Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) program as a fast-slewing satellite featuring a wide-field lobster-eye X-ray telescope (LEXT) to detect and localize GRBs, and a 30 cm narrow-field multi-channel photo-z infrared telescope (PIRT) to measure their photometric redshifts using the Lyman-alpha dropout technique. To derive the PIRT sensitivity requirement we compiled a complete sample of GRB optical-near-infrared afterglows from 2008 to 2021, adding a total of 66 new afterglows to our earlier sample, including all known high-z GRB afterglows. We performed full light-curve and spectral-energy-distribution analyses of these afterglows to derive their true luminosity at very early times. For all the light curves, where possible, we determined the brightness at the time of the initial finding chart of Gamow, at different high redshifts and in different NIR bands. We then followed the evolution of the luminosity to predict requirements for ground and space-based follow-up. We find that a PIRT sensitivity of 15 micro-Jy (21 mag AB) in a 500 s exposure simultaneously in five NIR bands within 1000s of the GRB trigger will meet the Gamow mission requirement to recover &gt; 80% of all redshifts at z &gt; 5.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Deep Optical Emission-Line Images of Nine Known and Three New Galactic Supernova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep optical emission-line images are presented for nine known plus three new Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), all but one having at least one angular dimension greater than one degree. Wide-field images taken in H$\alpha$ and [O III] $\lambda$5007 reveal many new and surprising remnant structures including large remnant shock extensions and `blowout' features not seen in published optical or radio data. These images represent over 12,000 individual images totaling more than 1000 hours of exposure time taken over the last two years mainly using small aperture telescopes which detected fainter nebular line emissions than published emission-line images. During the course of this imaging program, we discovered three new SNRs, namely G107.5-5.1 (the Nereides Nebula), G209.9-8.2, and G210.5+1.3, two of which have diameters &gt;1.5 degrees. Besides offering greater structural detail on the nine already known SNRs, a key finding of this study is the importance of [O III] emission-line imaging for mapping the complete shock emissions of Galactic SNRs.</description>

      <title>Observational Evidence for Hot Wind Impact on pc-scale in Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes in galaxies spend majority of their lifetime in the low-luminosity regime, powered by hot accretion flow. Strong winds launched from the hot accretion flow have the potential to play an important role in active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Direct observational evidence for these hot winds with temperature around 10 keV, has been obtained through the detection of highly ionized iron emission lines with Doppler shifts in two prototypical low-luminosity AGNs, namely M81* and NGC 7213. In this work, we further identify blueshifted H-like O/Ne emission lines in the soft X-ray spectra of these two sources. These lines are interpreted to be associated with additional outflowing components possessing velocity around several $10^3$ km/s and lower temperature (~0.2-0.4 keV). Blue-shifted velocity and the X-ray intensity of these additional outflowing components are hard to be explained by previously detected hot wind freely propagating to larger radii. Through detailed numerical simulations, we find the newly detected blue-shifted emission lines would come from circumnuclear gas shock-heated by the hot wind instead. Hot wind can provide larger ram pressure force on the clumpy circumnuclear gas than the gravitational force from central black hole, effectively impeding the black hole accretion of gas. Our results provide strong evidences for the energy and momentum feedback by the hot AGN wind.</description>

      <title>Broadband spectral and temporal study of Ton 599 during the brightest January 2023 flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the broadband temporal and spectral properties of the blazar Ton\,599 by using the observations from \emph{Fermi}-LAT and \emph{Swift}-XRT/UVOT telescopes, during its brightest $\gamma$-ray flaring. The one-day bin $\gamma$-ray light curve exhibits multiple substructures with asymmetric and symmetric profiles. Notably, the $\gamma$-ray light curve shows a maximum flux of $\rm 3.63 \times 10^{-6}\, ph \,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ on MJD\,59954.50, which is the highest flux ever observed from this source. The correlation between the $\gamma$-ray flux and $\gamma$-ray spectral indices suggests a moderate harder when the brighter trend. Taking $\gamma$-ray light curve as the reference, a strong correlation is observed with X-ray, optical, and UV energies. Additionally, the $\gamma$-rays and optical/UV emissions exhibit higher variability compared to X-rays. To understand the parameter variation during the active state of the source, we conducted a statistical broadband spectral modelling of the source in 10 flux intervals of equal duration. A one-zone leptonic model involving synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton, and external-Compton processes successfully reproduces the broadband SED in each of these flux intervals. We observed that the flux variation during the active state is mainly associated with the variation in the magnetic field and the particle spectral indices.</description>

      <title>Sudden breakdown of effective field theory near cool Kerr-Newman black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that (near-)extremal Kerr black holes are sensitive probes of small higher-derivative corrections to general relativity. In particular, these corrections produce diverging tidal forces on the horizon in the extremal limit. We show that adding a black hole charge makes this effect qualitatively stronger. Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Newman solution produce tidal forces that scale inversely in the black hole temperature. We find that, unlike the Kerr case, for realistic values of the black hole charge large tidal forces can arise before quantum corrections due to the Schwarzian mode become important, so that the near-horizon behavior of the black hole is dictated by higher-derivative terms in the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Constraining the abundance of Galactic compact objects with continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic spinning compact objects (COs) with non-zero ellipticity are expected to be sources of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). Certain classes of hypothetical COs, such as neutron stars with quark cores (hybrid stars), and quark stars, are thought to be capable of sustaining large ellipticities from theoretical considerations. Such exotic COs (eCOs) with large ellipticities should produce CGWs detectable by the current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra GW detector network. Since no detections for CGWs, from searches in LIGO-Virgo data, have so far been reported, we place constraints on the abundance of highly elliptical eCOs in our Galaxy. We formulate a Bayesian framework to place upper limits on the number count $N_{tot}$ of highly deformed Galactic eCOs. We divide our constraints into two classes: an "agnostic" set of upper limits on $N_{tot}$ evaluated on a CGW frequency and ellipticity grid that depend only on the choice of spatial distribution of COs; and a model-dependent set that additionally assumes prior information on the distribution of frequencies. We find that COs with ellipticities $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-5}$ have abundance upper limits at $90\%$ confidence, of $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 100$, and those with $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-6}$ have $N_{tot}^{90\%} \lesssim 10^4$. We additionally place upper-limits on the ellipticity of Galactic COs informed by our choices of spatial distributions, given different abundances $N_{tot}$.</description>

      <title>Non-radial oscillations in anisotropic dark energy stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of both isotropic and anisotropic dark energy stars by using the modified Chaplygin prescription of dark energy to model the stellar matter. The anisotropic pressure in the system is modeled with Bowers-Liang prescription. By solving the stellar structure equations in presence of anisotropy, we study the global properties of the dark energy star and compare the mass-radius profiles with data from GW events and milli-second pulsars. We proceed to determine the prominent non-radial $l=2$ $f$-mode frequencies of the anisotropic dark energy star by employing the Cowling approximation and analyse and quantify the spectra by varying the anisotropic parameter. We report that $f$-mode spectra of dark energy star have distinctly different behaviour compared to neutron star and quark star, and this may possibly help in its future identification. Further, the tidal deformability factors of the anisotropic dark energy stars have also been analyzed.</description>

      <title>Ejecta, Rings, and Dust in SN 1987A with JWST MIRI/MRS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A is the nearest supernova in $\sim$400 years. Using the {\em JWST} MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph, we spatially resolved the ejecta, equatorial ring (ER) and outer rings in the mid-infrared 12,927 days after the explosion. The spectra are rich in line and dust continuum emission, both in the ejecta and the ring. Broad emission lines (280-380~km~s$^{-1}$ FWHM) seen from all singly-ionized species originate from the expanding ER, with properties consistent with dense post-shock cooling gas. Narrower emission lines (100-170~km~s$^{-1}$ FWHM) are seen from species originating from a more extended lower-density component whose high ionization may have been produced by shocks progressing through the ER, or by the UV radiation pulse associated with the original supernova event. The asymmetric east-west dust emission in the ER has continued to fade, with constant temperature, signifying a reduction in dust mass. Small grains in the ER are preferentially destroyed, with larger grains from the progenitor surviving the transition from SN into SNR. The ER is fit with a single set of optical constants, eliminating the need for a secondary featureless hot dust component. We find several broad ejecta emission lines from [Ne~{\sc ii}], [Ar~{\sc ii}], [Fe~{\sc ii}], and [Ni~{\sc ii}]. With the exception of [Fe~{\sc ii}]~25.99$\mu$m, these all originate from the ejecta close to the ring and are likely being excited by X-rays from the interaction. The [Fe~{\sc ii}]~5.34$\mu$m to 25.99$\mu$m line ratio indicates a temperature of only a few hundred K in the inner core, consistent with being powered by ${}^{44}$Ti decay.</description>

Abstract: The origin of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux observed by the IceCube experiment is still under debate. In recent years there have been associations of neutrino events with individual blazars, which are active galaxies with relativistic jets pointing toward Earth, such as the source TXS 0506+056. From a theoretical perspective, the properties of these sources as neutrino emitters are not yet well understood. In this work we model a sample of 324 blazars detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), most of which are flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). This amounts to 34% of all FSRQs in the latest Fermi catalog. By numerically modelling the interactions of cosmic-ray electrons and protons, we explain the emitted multi-wavelength fluxes from each source and self-consistently predict the emitted neutrino spectrum. We demonstrate that the optical and GeV gamma-ray broadband features are generally well described by electron emission. For 33% of the blazars in our sample, a description of the observed X-ray spectrum benefits from an additional component from proton interactions, in agreement with recent studies of individual IceCube candidate blazars. We conclude that blazars that are brighter in GeV gamma rays tend to have a higher neutrino production efficiency but a lower best-fit baryonic loading. The predicted neutrino luminosity shows a positive correlation with the observed GeV gamma-ray flux and with the predicted MeV gamma-ray flux. By extrapolating the results for this sample, we show that the diffuse neutrino flux from the population of gamma-ray-bright blazars may be at the level of about 20% of the IceCube flux, in agreement with current limits from stacking analyses. We discuss the implications of our results for future neutrino searches and suggest promising sources for potential detections with future experiments.</description>

      <title>Maximum gravitational mass $M_{\rm TOV}=2.25^{+0.08}_{-0.07}M_\odot$ inferred at about $3\%$ precision with multimessenger data of neutron stars</title>

Abstract: The maximal gravitational mass of nonrotating neutron stars ($M_{\rm TOV}$) is one of the key parameters of compact objects and only loose bounds can be set based on the first principle. With reliable measurements of the masses and/or radii of the neutron stars, $M_{\rm TOV}$ can be robustly inferred from either the mass distribution of these objects or the reconstruction of the equation of state (EoS) of the very dense matter. For the first time we take the advantages of both two approaches to have a precise inference of $M_{\rm TOV}=2.25^{+0.08}_{-0.07}~M_\odot$ (68.3\% credibility), with the updated neutron star mass measurement sample, the mass-tidal deformability data of GW170817, the mass-radius data of PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the theoretical information from the chiral effective theory ($\chi$EFT) and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) at low and very high energy densities, respectively. This narrow credible range is benefited from the suppression of the high $M_{\rm TOV}$ by the pQCD constraint and the exclusion of the low $M_{\rm TOV}$ by the mass function. Three different EoS reconstruction methods are adopted separately, and the resulting $M_{\rm TOV}$ and $R_{\rm TOV}$ are found to be almost identical, where $R_{\rm TOV}=11.90^{+0.63}_{-0.60}$ km is the radius of the most massive non-rotating NS. This precisely evaluated $M_{\rm TOV}$ suggests that the EoS of neutron star matter is just moderately stiff and the $\sim 2.5-3M_\odot$ compact objects detected by the second generation gravitational wave detectors are most likely the lightest black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave triggered searches for high-energy neutrinos from binary neutron star mergers: prospects for next generation detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors -- Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) will have distance horizons up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ Gpc for detecting binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. This will make them ideal for triggering high-energy neutrino searches from BNS mergers at the next generation neutrino detectors, such as IceCube-Gen2. We calculate the distance limits as a function of the time window of neutrino analysis, up to which meaningful triggers from the GW detectors can be used to minimize backgrounds and collect a good sample of high-energy neutrino events at the neutrino detectors, using the sky localization capabilities of the GW detectors. We then discuss the prospects of the next generation detectors to work in synergy to facilitate coincident neutrino detections or to constrain the parameter space in the case of non-detection of neutrinos. We show that good localization of GW events, which can be achieved by multiple third generation GW detectors, is necessary to detect a GW-associated neutrino event or put a meaningful constraint ($\sim 3\sigma$ confidence level) on neutrino emission models. Such an analysis can also help constrain physical models and hence provide insights into neutrino production mechanisms in binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Black-hole formation in binary neutron star mergers: The impact of spin on the prompt-collapse scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of the multi-messenger signatures connected to binary neutron star mergers requires proper knowledge on the final remnant's fate and the conditions under which black holes (BHs) can form in such mergers. In this article, we use a suite of 84 numerical-relativity simulations in 28 different physical setups to explore the impact of the individual stars' spin on the merger outcome and on the early postmerger dynamics. We find that for setups close to the prompt-collapse threshold, the stars' intrinsic spin significantly changes the lifespan of the remnant before collapse and that the mass of the debris disk surrounding the BH is also altered. To enable a better understanding of BH formation, we check if there is at least a theoretical chance of observing densities that are above the maximum density allowed in a stable isolated neutron star, and we investigate the importance of different pressure contributions on the evolution of the postmerger remnant and BH formation.</description>

      <title>Effects of orbital precession on hyperbolic encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hyperbolic encounters of two massive objects are characterized by the emission of a gravitational wave burst, with most of the energy released during the closest approach (near the periastron). The detection of such events, different from the well-known inspiral emission, would be an interesting discovery and provide complementary information to observations of binary mergers of black holes and neutron stars in the observable Universe, shedding light, for instance, on the clustering properties of black holes and providing valuable hints on their formation scenario. Here, we analyze the dynamics of such phenomena in the simplest case where two compact objects follow unbound/hyperbolic orbits. Moreover, we explore the effects of orbital precession on the gravitational wave emission, since the precession encodes certain general relativistic effects between two bodies. We also provide templates for the strain of gravitational waves and the power spectrum for the emission, and analytical expressions for the memory effect associated with such signals.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Conditions for $^{26}$Al Injection into Protosolar Disk from a Nearby Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early solar system contained a short-lived radionuclide, $^{26}$Al (its half-life time $t_{1/2} = 0.7$ Myr). The decay energy $^{26}$Al is thought to have controlled the thermal evolution of planetesimals and, possibly, the water contents of planets. Many hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of $^{26}$Al in the solar system. One of the possible hypotheses is the `disk injection scenario'; when the protoplanetary disk of the solar system had already formed, a nearby $(&lt;1 \,\mathrm{pc})$ supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk. Such a $^{26}$Al injection hypothesis has been tested so far with limited setups for disk structure and supernova distance, and treated disk disruption and $^{26}$Al injection separately. Here, we revisit this problem to investigate whether there are self-consistent conditions under which the surviving disk radius can receive enough $^{26}$Al which can account for the abundance in the early solar system. We also consider a range of disk mass and structure, $^{26}$Al yields from supernova, and a large dust mass fraction $\eta_\mathrm{d}$. We find that $^{26}$Al yields of supernova are required as $\gtrsim 2.1\times10^{-3}M_\odot(\eta_\mathrm{d}/0.2)^{-1}$, challenging to achieve with known possible $^{26}$Al ejection and dust mass fraction ranges. Furthermore, we find that even if the above conditions are met, the supernova flow changes the disk temperature, which may not be consistent with the solar-system record. Our results place a strong constraint on the disk injection scenario. Rather, we suggest that the fresh $^{26}$Al of the early solar system must have been synthesized/injected in other ways.</description>

      <title>Thermal twin stars within a hybrid equation of state based on a nonlocal chiral quark model compatible with modern astrophysical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extension to finite temperatures and neutrino chemical potentials of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model approach to the equation of state of neutron star matter. We consider two light quark flavors and current-current interactions in the scalar-pseudoscalar, vector, and diquark pairing channels, where the nonlocality of the currents is taken into account by a Gaussian form factor that depends on the spatial components of the 4-momentum. Within this framework, we analyze order parameters, critical temperatures, phase diagrams, equations of state, and mass-radius relations for different temperatures and neutrino chemical potentials. For parameters of the model that are constrained by recent multi-messenger observations of neutron stars, we find that the mass-radius diagram for isothermal hybrid star sequences exhibits the thermal twin phenomenon for temperatures above 30 MeV.</description>
