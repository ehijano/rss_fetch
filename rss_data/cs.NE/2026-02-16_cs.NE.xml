      <title>Synaptic Activation and Dual Liquid Dynamics for Interpretable Bio-Inspired Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified framework for various bio-inspired models to better understand their structural and functional differences. We show that liquid-capacitance-extended models lead to interpretable behavior even in dense, all-to-all recurrent neural network (RNN) policies. We further demonstrate that incorporating chemical synapses improves interpretability and that combining chemical synapses with synaptic activation yields the most accurate and interpretable RNN models. To assess the accuracy and interpretability of these RNN policies, we consider the challenging lane-keeping control task and evaluate performance across multiple metrics, including turn-weighted validation loss, neural activity during driving, absolute correlation between neural activity and road trajectory, saliency maps of the networks' attention, and the robustness of their saliency maps measured by the structural similarity index.</description>

      <title>EPRBench: A High-Quality Benchmark Dataset for Event Stream Based Visual Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event stream-based Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is an emerging research direction that offers a compelling solution to the instability of conventional visible-light cameras under challenging conditions such as low illumination, overexposure, and high-speed motion. Recognizing the current scarcity of dedicated datasets in this domain, we introduce EPRBench, a high-quality benchmark specifically designed for event stream-based VPR. EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning. This framework not only achieves highly accurate place recognition but also produces interpretable reasoning processes alongside its predictions, significantly enhancing model transparency and explainability. The dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Classification of Jhana Advanced Concentrative Absorption Meditation (ACAM-J) using 7T fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J) is related to profound changes in consciousness and cognitive processing, making the study of their neural correlates vital for insights into consciousness and well-being. This study evaluates whether functional MRI-derived regional homogeneity (ReHo) can be used to classify ACAM-J using machine-learning approaches. We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p &lt; 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. These findings advocate machine-learning's feasibility in classifying advanced meditation states, future research on neuromodulation and mechanistic models of advanced meditation.</description>

      <title>Which Algorithms Can Graph Neural Networks Learn?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss. Empirical results largely support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Learning to Approximate Uniform Facility Location via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in using neural networks, especially message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems heuristically. However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training. Empirically, we show that our approach outperforms standard non-learned approximation algorithms in terms of solution quality, closing the gap with computationally intensive integer linear programming approaches. Overall, this work provides a step toward bridging learning-based methods and approximation algorithms for discrete optimization.</description>

      <title>Homeostatic Adaptation of Optimal Population Codes under Metabolic Stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information processing in neural populations is inherently constrained by metabolic resource limits and noise properties, with dynamics that are not accurately described by existing mathematical models. Recent data, for example, shows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a "low power mode" in which they maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each state along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential and leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We analytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying energy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how populations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been observed empirically.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Generative Optimization: Towards Fully Data-Driven Evolutionary Optimization via Generative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have demonstrated the potential of leveraging historical data to improve optimization accuracy and adaptability. Despite these advancements, existing methods remain reliant on handcrafted process-level operators. In contrast, Evolutionary Generative Optimization (EvoGO) is a fully data-driven framework designed from the objective level, enabling autonomous learning of the entire search process. EvoGO streamlines the evolutionary optimization process into three stages: data preparation, model training, and population generation. The data preparation stage constructs a pairwise dataset to enrich training diversity without incurring additional evaluation costs. During model training, a tailored generative model learns to transform inferior solutions into superior ones. In the population generation stage, EvoGO replaces traditional reproduction operators with a scalable and parallelizable generative mechanism. Extensive experiments on numerical benchmarks, classical control problems, and high-dimensional robotic tasks demonstrate that EvoGO consistently converges within merely 10 generations and substantially outperforms a wide spectrum of optimization approaches, including traditional EAs, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning based methods.

      <title>Real-time processing of analog signals on accelerated neuromorphic hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensory processing with neuromorphic systems is typically done by using either event-based sensors or translating input signals to spikes before presenting them to the neuromorphic processor. Here, we offer an alternative approach: direct analog signal injection eliminates superfluous and power-intensive analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions, making it particularly suitable for efficient near-sensor processing. We demonstrate this by using the accelerated BrainScaleS-2 mixed-signal neuromorphic research platform and interfacing it directly to microphones and a servo-motor-driven actuator. Utilizing BrainScaleS-2's 1000-fold acceleration factor, we employ a spiking neural network to transform interaural time differences into a spatial code and thereby predict the location of sound sources. Our primary contributions are the first demonstrations of direct, continuous-valued sensor data injection into the analog compute units of the BrainScaleS-2 ASIC, and actuator control using its embedded microprocessors. This enables a fully on-chip processing pipeline$\unicode{x2014}$from sensory input handling, via spiking neural network processing to physical action. We showcase this by programming the system to localize and align a servo motor with the spatial direction of transient noise peaks in real-time.</description>
