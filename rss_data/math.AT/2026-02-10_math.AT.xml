      <title>Deformation theory and cotangent complex of dg operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part, we give an explicit description of the cotangent complex of differential graded (dg) operads, modeled as an operadic infinitesimal bimodule. This leads to a uniform formula for the Quillen cohomology of their associated algebras. We further show that the cotangent complex of the dg $E_\infty$-operad is represented by the Pirashvili functor, while that of the dg $E_n$-operad is conveniently described via its Hochschild complex. In the second part, we establish an explicit relation between deformation theory and (spectral) Quillen cohomology for various types of algebraic objects. Combining these results, we obtain a formulation of the space of first-order deformations of dg operads, which is particularly convenient in the case of dg $E_n$-operads.</description>

      <title>Topological fundamental groups of locally finite infinite configuration spaces and infinite braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological fundamental groups of the locally finite infinite ordered configuration space \(Conf^{lf}_\infty(\C)\) in the plane and the homotopy quotient of $Conf^{lf}_\infty$ by the canonical action of the infinite permutation group $\Aut(\N)$: \[ H^{lf}(\infty):=\pi_1^{\mathrm{top}}(Conf^{lf}_\infty(\C),\widetilde{\N}), \qquad B^{lf}(\infty):=\pi_1^{\mathrm{top}}\!\bigl(Conf^{lf}_\infty(\C)\!/\!/\Aut(\N),[e_0,\widetilde{\N}]\bigr). \] We prove that \(H^{lf}(\infty)\) and \(B^{lf}(\infty)\) are non-discrete and complete topological groups. A main structural theorem identifies \(H^{lf}(\infty)\) with a canonical locally finite inverse-limit model built from finite pure braid groups, and we construct a complete left-invariant ultrametric compatible with the quotient topology from the loop space of $\Conf$. The direct limit of finite pure braid groups admits a dense embedding into \(H^{lf}(\infty)\), and we show that \(H^{lf}(\infty)\) is the Ra\u{\i}kov completion of this subgroup. Moreover, the direct limit of finite braid groups embeds into \(B^{lf}(\infty)\) and is dense in the finitary subgroup \(B^{lf}_{\mathrm{fin}}(\infty)\subseteq B^{lf}(\infty)\).</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism groups of solid tori and the rational pseudoisotopy stable range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the rational homotopy groups of the classifying space $\mathrm{BDiff}_{\partial}(S^1 \times D^{d-1})$ of the topological group of diffeomorphisms of $S^1 \times D^{d-1}$ fixing the boundary for $d \geq 6$, in a range of degrees up until around $d$. This extends results of Budney-Gabai, Bustamante-Randal-Williams, and Watanabe.
  As consequences of this computation, we determine the rational pseudoisotopy stable range for compact spin manifolds with fundamental group $\mathbf{Z}$ of dimension $d\geq 6$ to be $[0,d-5]$, and compute in this range the rational homotopy groups of $\mathrm{BDiff}_{\partial}(S^1 \times N)$ for compact simply-connected spin $(d-1)$-manifolds $N$. Finally, by combining our results with work of Krannich-Randal-Williams and Kupers-Randal-Williams on $\mathrm{BDiff}_{\partial}(D^d)$, we compute the rational homotopy groups of the space $\mathrm{Emb}_{\partial}(D^{d-2}, D^d)$ of long knots in codimension 2 for $d \geq 6$, again in the same range.</description>

      <title>The Dold-Kan theorem for paracyclic modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Karoubi operator on the unnormalized chain complex of a paracyclic module; its restriction to the normalized chain complex has previously been considered by Dwyer and Kan, and in the cyclic case by Cuntz and Quillen. We obtain a direct proof of the Dold-Kan theorem for paracyclic modules of Dwyer and Kan, by directly relating the Karoubi operator to projection to the normalized subcomplex.</description>

      <title>Stability phenomena for Kac-Moody groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a canonical procedure of extending generalized Dynkin diagrams gives rise to families of Kac-Moody groups that satisfy homological stability. We also briefly sketch some emergent structure that appears on stabilization. Our results are illustrated for the family {E_n} which is of interest in String theory. The techniques used involve homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of Kac-Moody groups.</description>

      <title>A criterion for a Hurewicz cofibration to be a Quillen cofibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that $h$-cofibrations between $q$-cofibrant spaces are $q$-cofibrations. We also present a number of applications, including a pushout-product property for symmetrizable cofibrations, a local-to-global gluing lemma for $q$-cofibrations, a proof that $q$-fibrations between $q$-cofibrant spaces are $h$-fibrations, and an alternative proof of Waner's theorem on $G$-spaces with the $G$-homotopy type of a $G$-CW complex in fibre sequences. Moreover, all of the above generalises readily to the equivariant context, and so we work in the more general equivariant setting throughout.</description>

      <title>GKM Theory for Manifolds of Isospectral Matrices in Lie Type D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the manifold $Q_{\Gamma, \lambda}$ of isospectral real skew-symmetric matrices with a prescribed sparsity pattern determined by a graph $\Gamma$. The compact torus $T^n$ acts naturally on $Q_{\Gamma,\lambda}$ by conjugation, and this action can be studied using GKM theory. We prove two results about this manifold and its GKM graph. The first theorem describes how the GKM graph of $Q_{\Gamma, \lambda}$ is obtained from the GKM graph of the corresponding manifold $M_{\Gamma, \lambda}$ of isospectral Hermitian matrices. The second theorem gives a criterion for equivariant formality of $Q_{\Gamma, \lambda}$.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of finite \'etale spaces and generalized inflations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation of a simplicial complex $K$ is a construction well known in combinatorial topology. It replaces each vertex $i$ of $K$ with a finite number $n_i$ of its copies, and each simplex $\{i_0,\ldots,i_k\}$ with $n_{i_0}n_{i_1}\cdots n_{i_k}$ many copies so that the collection of vertex-copies is spanned by a simplex in the inflation if and only if their originals were spanned by a simplex in the original complex. The celebrated poset fiber theorem of Bj\"{o}rner, Wachs, and Welker describes the homotopy type of such inflation in terms of homotopy types of $K$ and its links. In the current paper, we introduce more general inflations over simplicial posets: we replace each simplex with an arbitrary finite set of copies. The way how these sets patch together is specified by a commutative diagram, or, equivalently, a sheaf on the corresponding finite topology. The generalized inflation can be understood as \'etale space of such sheaf. We prove that, whenever this inflation sheaf is flabby, the poset fiber theorem still applies. We prove all results similar to those known for vertex inflations. We also cover the previous result of the first author about homotopy types of clique complexes of multigraphs.</description>

      <title>Universal Coefficients and Mayer-Vietoris Sequence for Groupoid Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study homology of ample groupoids via the compactly supported Moore complex of the nerve. Let $A$ be a topological abelian group. For $n\ge 0$ set $C_n(\mathcal G;A) := C_c(\mathcal G_n,A)$ and define $\partial_n^A=\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i(d_i)_*$. This defines $H_n(\mathcal G;A)$. The theory is functorial for continuous \'etale homomorphisms. It is compatible with standard reductions, including restriction to saturated clopen subsets. In the ample setting it is invariant under Kakutani equivalence. We reprove Matui type long exact sequences and identify the comparison maps at chain level. For discrete $A$ we prove a natural universal coefficient short exact sequence $$0\to H_n(\mathcal G)\otimes_{\mathbb Z}A\xrightarrow{\ \iota_n^{\mathcal G}\ }H_n(\mathcal G;A)\xrightarrow{\ \kappa_n^{\mathcal G}\ }\operatorname{Tor}_1^{\mathbb Z}\bigl(H_{n-1}(\mathcal G),A\bigr)\to 0.$$ The key input is the chain level isomorphism $C_c(\mathcal G_n,\mathbb Z)\otimes_{\mathbb Z}A\cong C_c(\mathcal G_n,A)$, which reduces the groupoid statement to the classical algebraic UCT for the free complex $C_c(\mathcal G_\bullet,\mathbb Z)$. We also isolate the obstruction for non-discrete coefficients. For a locally compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space $X$ with a basis of compact open sets, the image of $\Phi_X:C_c(X,\mathbb Z)\otimes_{\mathbb Z}A\to C_c(X,A)$ is exactly the compactly supported functions with finite image. Thus $\Phi_X$ is surjective if and only if every $f\in C_c(X,A)$ has finite image, and for suitable $X$ one can produce compactly supported continuous maps $X\to A$ with infinite image. Finally, for a clopen saturated cover $\mathcal G_0=U_1\cup U_2$ we construct a short exact sequence of Moore complexes and derive a Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence for $H_\bullet(\mathcal G;A)$ for explicit computations.</description>

      <title>Improving Topological Detection of Weather Regimes in climate dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather regimes provide a useful framework for describing large-scale atmospheric variability and its impacts on regional weather. Despite extensive study, there is still no universally accepted definition or method for identifying weather regimes. Recent work has shown that weather regimes can be interpreted geometrically as topological structures in the phase space of the atmospheric system. In this approach, regimes are identified using a density--radius bifiltration combined with persistent homology, a well-established tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). This topological perspective provides a unifying view of regimes and, unlike traditional methods, does not require the number of regimes to be specified in advance. However, the method relies on density estimation techniques (typically Gaussian kernel density estimation), which can over--smooth weakly populated but dynamically important regions of the phase space.</description>

      <title>Counting Barcodes with the same Betti Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an important inverse problem in topological data analysis (TDA): How many different barcodes produce the same Betti curve? Equivalently, given a function $\beta\colon [n]=\{1&lt;\cdots&lt; n\} \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, how many different ways can we write $\beta$ as a sum of indicator functions supported on intervals in $[n]$? Our answer to this question is to connect persistent homology with the study of the Kostant partition function and the enumerative combinatorics for so-called "magic" juggling sequences studied by Ronald Graham and others. Specifically, we prove an equivalence between our inverse problem and corresponding statements in these other two settings. From an applications and statistics point of view, our work provides a quantification of how lossy the TDA pipeline is when moving from persistent homology to persistent Betti numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a counterexample to both the local and global invariant cycle theorems with integral coefficients. The example is a semistable one-parameter family of elliptic surfaces with $p_g=q=1$ and constant period map. The smooth fibers have the smallest possible discriminant, and are associated with Vinberg's most algebraic K3 surface. Our construction generalizes the Shioda-Inose construction for rational double covers of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Free fibrations, lax colimits and Kan extensions for $(\infty,2)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper we study fibrations of $(\infty,2)$-categories. We give a simple characterization of such fibrations in terms of a certain square being a pullback, and apply this to show that in some cases $(\infty,2)$-categories of functors and partially (op)lax transformations preserve fibrations. We also describe free fibrations of $(\infty,2)$-categories, including in the case where we only ask for (co)cartesian lifts of specified 1- and 2-morphisms in the base, and describe the right adjoint to pullback from fibrations to such partial fibrations along an arbitrary functor. In the second part of the paper we apply these results to study colimits and Kan extensions of $(\infty,2)$-categories. Most notably, we give a fibrational description of both partially (op)lax and weighted (co)limits of $(\infty,2)$-categories and construct partially lax Kan extensions. Among other results, we also include a model-independent version of cofinality for $(\infty,2)$-categories and briefly consider presentable $(\infty,2)$-categories, characterizing them as accessible localizations of presheaves of $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>Independence of homogeneous GKM manifolds and symmetric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G/H$ be a simply connected homogeneous space of maximal rank. Then the maximal torus $T$-action on $G/H$ is a GKM manifold. We call the $T$-action $j$-independent if any $i(\leq j)$ pairwise distinct isotropy weights at a fixed point are linearly independent. Using weighted graphs, we show that the maximal independence of $G/H$ is $2$, $3$ or $n=\dim T$, and that the cases of $3$ or $n=\dim T$ correspond to some symmetric spaces of rank $&gt;2$. As a corollary, using the results of Ayzenberg and Masuda, the lower-degree reduced homology groups (with appropriate coefficients) of the orbit space $T\backslash G/H$ vanish.</description>

      <title>Some notes on tensor triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are notes from the lectures I gave at the Oberwolfach seminar `Tensor Triangular Geometry and Interactions' which was held in October 2025.
  The aim of these notes is to give an introduction to tensor triangular geometry, for both small and large categories, through the lens of lattice theory. We do not try to be exhaustive and this is reflected in both the content and the bibliography. For instance we are quite light on triangulated preliminaries, especially for compactly generated categories.
  The first three sections treat the essentially small case and conclude with a tensor triangular proof of Thomason's theorem computing the spectrum of the perfect complexes on a quasi-compact and quasi-separated scheme. The last section treats the compactly generated case. This final section is somewhat experimental and contains some new thoughts.</description>

      <title>Conformally flat factorization homology in Ind-Hilbert spaces and Conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a metric-dependent geometric variant of factorization homology in conformally flat Riemannian geometry for $d \geq 2$. We introduce a symmetric monoidal category of germs of d-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and orientation-preserving conformal open embeddings, and its full monoidal subcategory generated by flat disks. A conformally flat $d$-disk algebra is a symmetric monoidal functor from this disk category to a target category; in this paper we take the target to be $\mathrm{IndHilb}$, the ind-category of Hilbert spaces, which provides a mathematical formulation of $d$-dimensional conformal field theories.
  The (1-categorical) left Kan extension of an $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebra defines a metric-dependent invariant of conformally flat manifolds. Under suitable positivity and continuity assumptions, we prove that its value on the standard sphere $(S^d,g_{\mathrm{std}})$ reproduces the sphere partition function of the associated conformal field theory. For $d&gt;2$, we construct nontrivial $\mathrm{IndHilb}$-valued conformally flat $d$-disk algebras from unitary representations of $\mathrm{SO}^+(d,1)$.</description>

      <title>Koszul duality for algebras over infinity-operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new notion of algebra over a linear $\infty$-operad and a corresponding notion of coalgebra over an $\infty$-cooperad. We next extend the Koszul duality between linear $\infty$-operads and linear $\infty$-cooperads from our previous paper (arXiv:2105.11943) to their categories of algebras and coalgebras. This duality theorem specialises to the known duality in the case of algebras over classical (non-infinity) operads, but our proof is different. In fact, it is based on a much more general duality between presheaves and copresheaves on a category of trees. The latter duality is a priori independent of the (co)algebra structures, but we show that it can be lifted to (co)presheaves supporting such a structure. Based on this duality, we define the homology of an algebra over an $\infty$-operad, and prove that it can be described in terms of the homology of the same category of trees with coefficients in a presheaf.</description>

      <title>Derived algebras on formal stacks and prismatic gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies how the theory of derived algebras (in the sense of Bhatt-Mathew and Raksit) interacts with formal derived geometry, specifically the formal derived stacks which show up in the theory of prismatization. As an application we prove some classification theorems for derived algebras in quasi-coherent sheaves on a certain class of filtered \emph{formal} stacks, which includes those whose quasi-coherent sheaves are prismatic gauges over a perfectoid ring. Along the way, among other things, we study the behavior of derived algebras along schematic quasi-affine morphisms in derived geometry, and for example, classify derived algebras on the source as precisely those derived algebras on the target which receive a map from the pushforward of the structure sheaf of the source. We also indicate how to extend some of our results to (formal) classifying stacks of diagonalizable group schemes. As an aside, we also show some classification theorems even for quasi-coherent sheaves on formal stacks which (to our knowledge) weren't available in the literature on derived geometry previously. These results are motivated by forthcoming work of the author but hoped to be generally useful.</description>

      <title>Equivariant category and Topological complexity of wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.08956v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the formula \begin{equation*} \text{cat}_G(X\vee Y)=\max\{\text{cat}_G(X),\text{cat}_G(Y)\} \end{equation*} for the equivariant category of the wedge $X\vee Y$. As a direct application, we have that the wedge $\bigvee_{i=1}^m X_i$ is $G$-contractible if and only if each $X_i$ is $G$-contractible, for each $i=1,\ldots,m$. One further application is to compute the equivariant category of the quotient $X/A$, for a $G$-space $X$ and an invariant subset $A$ such that the inclusion $A\hookrightarrow X$ is $G$-homotopic to a constant map $\overline{x_0}:A\to X$, for some $x_0\in X^G$. Additionally, we discuss the equivariant and invariant topological complexities for wedges. For instance, as applications of our results, we obtain the following equalities: \begin{align*} \text{TC}_G(X\vee Y)&amp;=\max\{\text{TC}_G(X),\text{TC}_G(Y),\text{cat}_G(X\times Y)\}, \text{TC}^G(X\vee Y)&amp;=\max\{\text{TC}^G(X),\text{TC}^G(Y),_{X\vee Y}\text{cat}_{G\times G}(X\times Y)\}, \end{align*} for $G$-connected $G$-CW-complexes $X$ and $Y$ under certain conditions.

Abstract: We prove that the mapping class group is not an $h$-cobordism invariant of high-dimensional manifolds by exhibiting $h$-cobordant manifolds whose mapping class groups have different cardinalities. In order to do so, we introduce a moduli space of "$h$-block" bundles and understand its difference with the moduli space of ordinary block bundles.</description>

      <title>A Weiss-Williams theorem for spaces of embeddings and the homotopy type of spaces of long knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a pseudoisotopy result for embedding spaces in the line of that of Weiss and Williams for diffeomorphism groups. In other words, for $P\subset M$ a codimension at least three embedding, we describe the difference in a range of homotopical degrees between the spaces of block and ordinary embeddings of $P$ into $M$ as a certain infinite loop space involving the relative algebraic $K$-theory of the pair $(M,M-P)$. This range of degrees is the so-called concordance embedding stable range, which, by recent developments of Goodwillie-Krannich-Kupers, is far beyond that of the aforementioned theorem of Weiss-Williams.
  We use this result to obtain split fibre sequences in the concordance embedding stable range, with explicit, analysable base and fibre, which determine the homotopy type of spaces of long knots of codimension at least 3. This leads to explicit computations of homotopy groups, including torsion information, in that range. In doing so, we carry out an extensive analysis of certain geometric involutions in algebraic $K$-theory that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A monoidal Grothendieck construction for $\infty$-categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a monoidal version of Lurie's un/straightening equivalence. In more detail, for any symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathbf C$, we endow the $\infty$-category of coCartesian fibrations over $\mathbf C$ with a (naturally defined) symmetric monoidal structure, and prove that it is equivalent the Day convolution monoidal structure on the $\infty$-category of functors from $\mathbf C$ to $\mathbf{Cat}_\infty$.
  In fact, we do this over any $\infty$-operad by categorifying this statement and thereby proving a stronger statement about the functors that assign to an $\infty$-category $\mathbf C$ its category of coCartesian fibrations on the one hand, and its category of functors to $\mathbf{Cat}_\infty$ on the other hand.</description>

      <title>Quantitative bordism over acyclic groups and Cheeger-Gromov $\rho$-invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a solution to a bordism version of Gromov's linearity problem over a large family of acyclic groups, for manifolds with arbitrary dimension. Every group embeds into some acyclic group in this family. Thus, the linear bordism problem has an affirmative solution over a possibly enlarged acyclic group. Our result holds in both PL and smooth categories, and for both oriented and unoriented cases. In the PL case, our results hold without assuming bounded local geometry. As an application, we prove that there is a universal linear bound for the Cheeger-Gromov $L^2$ $\rho$-invariants of PL $(4k-1)$-manifolds associated with arbitrary regular covers. We also show that the minimum number of simplices in a PL triangulation of $(4k-1)$-manifolds with a fixed simple homotopy type is unbounded if the fundamental group has nontrivial torsion. The proof of our main results builds on quantitative algebraic and geometric techniques over the simplicial classifying spaces of groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of locally rigid and rigid symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories over an arbitrary base $\mathcal{V}\in\mathrm{CAlg}(\mathbf{Pr}^\mathrm{L})$. Among other things, we prove that every locally rigid commutative $\mathcal{V}$-algebra arises as a ``completion'' of a rigid commutative $\mathcal{V}$-algebra.
  Along the way, we introduce and study ``$\mathcal{V}$-atomic morphisms'', which are analogues of compact morphisms over an arbitrary base $\mathcal{V}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute certain strict Picard spectra of $K(1)$-local $K$-theory spectra of schemes in terms of Brauer groups, using the map that takes an Azumaya algebra to its $K(1)$-local $K$-theory and proving a K\"unneth formula in that setting. For example, we prove that for semi-local rings of characteristic $\neq p$, $\mathbf{Br}(R)[p^\infty]\simeq \mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{pic}}(L_{K(1)}K(R)\otimes\mathbb{S}_{W(\overline{\mathbb F}_p)})[p^\infty]$, where $\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{pic}}$ is Carmeli's strict Picard spectrum. We prove the same result for $R[\frac{1}{p}]$, when $R$ is $p$-henselian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we construct invariant and coinvariant Morse chain complexes with integer coefficients for any compact effective orbifold. We conjecture that the homology of the coinvariant chain complex computes the homology of the underlying topological space over $\mathbb{Z}$, improving a construction of \cite{cho2014orbifold}, which is isomorphic to the homology of the underlying topological space over $\mathbb{Q}$. In contrast, the homology of the invariant Morse chain complex is sensitive to the orbifold structure itself.</description>
