      <title>Occultation constraints on solar system formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process by which a system of non-luminous bodies form around a star is fundamental to understanding the origins of our own solar system and how it fits into the context of other systems we have begun to study around other stars. Some basics of solar system formation have emerged to describe the process by which dust and gas around a newly formed star evolve into what we see today. The combination of occultation observations and the flyby observations by New Horizons of the Cold-Classical Kuiper Belt Object (CCKBO), (498958) Arrokoth, has provided essential new constraints on formation models through its three-dimensional shape. We present a case that an occultation-driven survey of CCKBOs would provide fundamental new insight into solar system formation processes by measuring population-wide distributions of shape, binarity, and spin-pole orientation as a function of size in this primordial and undisturbed reservoir.</description>

      <title>TRAPPIST-1 d: Exo-Venus, Exo-Earth or Exo-Dead?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TRAPPIST-1 d is generally assumed to be at the boundary between a Venus-like world and an Earth-like world, although recently published works on TRAPPIST-1 b and c raise concerns that TRAPPIST-1 d may be similarly devoid of a substantial atmosphere. TRAPPIST-1 d is also relatively understudied in comparison with TRAPPIST-1 e. The latter has generally appeared to be within the habitable zone of most atmospheric modeling studies. Assuming that TRAPPIST-1 d still retains a substantial atmosphere, we demonstrate via a series of 3D general circulation model experiments using a dynamic ocean that the planet could reside within the habitable zone in a narrow parameter space. At the same time, it could also be an exo-Venus or exo-Dead-type world or in transition between between one of these. Studies like this can help distinguish between these types of worlds.</description>

      <title>Magnetic disk winds in protoplanetary disks: Description of the model and impact on global disk evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canonically, a protoplanetary disk is thought to undergo (gravito-)viscous evolution, wherein the angular momentum of the accreting material is transported outwards. However, several lines of reasoning suggest that the turbulent viscosity in a typical protoplanetary disk is insufficient to drive the observed accretion rates. An emerging paradigm suggests that radially extended magnetic disk winds may play a crucial role in the disk evolution. We propose a global model of magnetic wind-driven accretion for evolution of protoplanetary disks, based on the insights gained from local shearing box simulations. Here we develop this model and constrain its parameters with the help of theoretical expectations and comparison with observations. The magnetic wind is characterized with the associated loss of angular momentum and mass, which depend on the local disk conditions and stellar properties. We incorporate the disk winds self-consistently in the code FEOSAD and study formation and long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks. We include disk self-gravity and an adaptive turbulent alpha, while the co-evolution of dust is also considered. Synthetic observations are obtained via radiation thermo-chemical code ProDiMo. The models with inclusion of disk winds satisfy general expectations from both theory and observations. The disk wind parameters can be guided by observational constraints and the synthetic observations resulting from such a model compare favorably with the selected ALMA survey data of Class II disks. The proposed magnetic disk wind model is a significant step forward in the direction of representing a more complete disk evolution, wherein the disk experiences concurrent torques from viscous, gravitational, and magnetic wind processes.</description>

      <title>Radiation sputtering of hydrocarbon ices at Europa-relevant temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study shows that the sputtering of hydrocarbon water ice leads to the production of mostly CO2, CO, and fragmented hydrocarbons. The onset of sputtered hydrocarbons is immediate, and quickly reaches a steady state, whereas CO2 and CO are formed more gradually. It is found that higher temperatures cause more sputtering, and that there are some notable differences in the distribution of species that are sputtered at different temperatures, indicating local heterogeneity of sputtering yields depending on the surface temperature.</description>

      <title>Short-Period Small Planets with High Mutual Inclinations are more Common around Metal-Rich Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00442v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a correlation between the stellar metallicities and the mutual inclinations of multi-planet systems hosting short-period small planets (a/Rs&lt;12, Rp&lt;4Re). We analyzed 89 multi-planet systems discovered by Kepler, K2, and TESS, where the innermost planets have periods shorter than 10 days. We found that the mutual inclinations of the innermost two planets are higher and more diverse around metal-rich stars. The mutual inclinations are calculated as the absolute differences between the best-fit inclinations of the innermost two planets from transit modeling, which represent the lower limits of the true mutual inclinations. The mean and variance of the mutual inclination distribution of the metal-rich systems are 3.1+-0.5 and 3.1+-0.4 degrees, while for the metal-poor systems they are 1.3+-0.2 and 1.0+-0.2 degrees. This finding suggests that inner planetary systems around metal-rich stars are dynamically hotter. We summarized the theories that could plausibly explain this correlation, including the influence of giant planets, higher solid densities in protoplanetary disks around metal-rich stars, or secular chaos coupled with an excess of angular momentum deficits. Planet formation and population synthesis models tracking the mutual inclination evolution would be essential to fully understand this correlation.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Stellar Chromospheres and Coronae on Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A main source of bias in transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres is magnetic activity of the host star in the form of stellar spots, faculae or flares. However, the fact that main-sequence stars have a chromosphere and a corona, and that these optically thin layers are dominated by line emission may alter the global interpretation of the planetary spectrum, has largely been neglected. Using a JWST NIRISS/SOSS data set of hot Jupiter HAT-P-18 b, we show that even at near-IR and IR wavelengths, the presence of these layers leads to significant changes in the transmission spectrum of the planetary atmosphere. Accounting for these stellar outer layers thus improves the atmospheric fit of HAT-P-18 b, and increases its best-fit atmospheric temperature from 536 K to 736 K, a value much closer to the predicted equilibrium temperature of 852 K. Our analysis also decreases the best-fit abundance of CO2 by almost an order of magnitude. The approach provides a new window to the properties of chromospheres/corona in stars other than our Sun.</description>

      <title>A 16 Myr super-Neptune in Upper-Centaurus Lupus and a preliminary survey of transiting planets in Sco-Cen with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the properties of planets younger than about 50 Myr helps to test different planetary formation and evolution models. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed nearly the entire sky, including a wide range of star-forming regions and young stellar clusters, expanding our census of the newborn planet population. In this work, we present the discovery of the TIC 88785435 planetary system located in the Upper-Centaurus Lupus (UCL) region of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen) and a preliminary survey of the planet population within Sco-Cen. TIC 88785435 is a pre-main sequence, K7V dwarf ($M_\star = 0.72M_\odot$, $R_\star = 0.91R_\odot$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 3998K, V = 11.7 mag) located within the bounds of UCL. We investigate the distribution of rotation periods measured from the TESS long-cadence data and the Halpha and Li abundances from the spectra of TIC 88785435. TESS long-candence data reveal that TIC 88785435 hosts a transiting super-Neptune ($R_b = 5.03R_\oplus$, P = 10.51 days), TIC 88785435 b. Ground-based follow-up validates the planetary nature of TIC 88785435 b. Using the TESS data, we perform a preliminary survey to investigate how TIC 88785435 b compares to the population of newly born planets located within Sco-Cen.</description>

      <title>A Search for Eclipse Cycles Similar to the Hypersaros: Columbus and the Lunar Eclipse of March 14, 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total lunar eclipse on March 14, 2025 UT occurs nearly exactly 521 years (one Hypersaros) after a similar eclipse on March 1, 1504 UT that is renowned for its importance to the voyage of Columbus to Jamaica. Eclipses separated by a Hypersaros have similar depths, appear very close to the same location in the sky, and occur at nearly the same time of year. This paper summarizes the results from a search for analogous cycles within the Five Millennium Catalogs of Lunar and Solar Eclipses. Under the two simple constraints of similar eclipse dates relative to the vernal equinox and similar paths of the Moon through the Earth's shadow, the most common time intervals between lunar eclipses separated by less than 1000 years are the 521-year Hypersaros and a 633-yr period of the Icosa-Inex-Triple-Saros (IITS). Notable cycles at longer periods occur at 1154, 1284, 1787, 1917, and 2308 years.</description>

      <title>KOBE 1: The first planetary system from the KOBE survey. Two planets likely residing in the sub-Neptune mass regime around a late K-dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K-dwarf stars are promising targets in the exploration of potentially habitable planets. Their properties, falling between G and M dwarfs, provide an optimal trade-off between the prospect of habitability and ease of detection. The KOBE experiment is a blind-search survey exploiting this niche, monitoring the radial velocity of 50 late-type K-dwarf stars. It employs the CARMENES spectrograph, with an observational strategy designed to detect planets in the habitable zone of their system. In this work, we exploit the KOBE data set to characterize planetary signals in the K7V star HIP 5957 (KOBE-1) and to constrain the planetary population within its habitable zone. We used 82 CARMENES spectra over a time span of three years. We employed a GLS periodogram to search for significant periodic signals that would be compatible with Keplerian motion on KOBE-1. We carried out a model comparison within a Bayesian framework to ensure the significance of the planetary model over alternative configurations of lower complexity. We also inspected two available TESS sectors in search of planetary signals. We identified two signals: at 8.5d and 29.7d. We confirmed their planetary nature through ruling out other non-planetary configurations. Their minimum masses are 8.80+/-0.76ME and 12.4+/-1.1ME, corresponding to absolute masses within the planetary regime at a high certainty (&gt;99.7%). By analyzing the sensitivity of the CARMENES time series to additional signals, we discarded planets above 8.5ME within the habitable zone. We identified a single transit-like feature in TESS, whose origin is still uncertain, but still compatible within 1sigma with a transit from planet c. We have explored future prospects for characterizing this system, concluding that nulling interferometry with the LIFE mission could be capable of directly imaging both planets and characterizing their atmospheres in future studies.</description>

      <title>Coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical tide consists of various waves that can resonate with orbital motion. We test this coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion using a simple two-dimensional shallow water model, which can be applied to a rocky planet covered with thin ocean or atmosphere. Then we take the earth-moon system as a fiducial model to calculate the tidal resonances and orbital evolution. We find that tidal dissipation can even increase with increasing orbital separation because of the coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion. We draw the conclusion that the coupling is not negligible to study the orbital evolution on secular timescale.</description>

      <title>Grid-based exoplanet atmospheric mass loss predictions through neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast and accurate estimation of planetary mass-loss rates is critical for planet population and evolution modelling. We use machine learning (ML) for fast interpolation across an existing large grid of hydrodynamic upper atmosphere models, providing mass-loss rates for any planet inside the grid boundaries with superior accuracy compared to previously published interpolation schemes. We consider an already available grid comprising about 11000 hydrodynamic upper atmosphere models for training and generate an additional grid of about 250 models for testing purposes. We develop the ML interpolation scheme (dubbed "atmospheric Mass Loss INquiry frameworK"; MLink) using a Dense Neural Network, further comparing the results with what was obtained employing classical approaches (e.g. linear interpolation and radial basis function-based regression). Finally, we study the impact of the different interpolation schemes on the evolution of a small sample of carefully selected synthetic planets. MLink provides high-quality interpolation across the entire parameter space by significantly reducing both the number of points with large interpolation errors and the maximum interpolation error compared to previously available schemes. For most cases, evolutionary tracks computed employing MLink and classical schemes lead to comparable planetary parameters at Gyr-timescales. However, particularly for planets close to the top edge of the radius gap, the difference between the predicted planetary radii at a given age of tracks obtained employing MLink and classical interpolation schemes can exceed the typical observational uncertainties. Machine learning can be successfully used to estimate atmospheric mass-loss rates from model grids paving the way to explore future larger and more complex grids of models computed accounting for more physical processes.</description>

      <title>Effects of planetary mass uncertainties on the interpretation of the reflectance spectra of Earth-like exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric characterization of Earth-like exoplanets through reflected light spectroscopy is a key goal for upcoming direct imaging missions. A critical challenge in this endeavor is the accurate determination of planetary mass, which may influence the measurement of atmospheric compositions and the identification of potential biosignatures. In this study, we used the Bayesian retrieval framework ExoReL$^\Re$ to investigate the impact of planetary mass uncertainties on the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial exoplanets observed in reflected light. Our results indicate that precise prior knowledge of the planetary mass can be crucial for accurate atmospheric retrievals if clouds are present in the atmosphere. When the planetary mass is known within 10\% uncertainty, our retrievals successfully identified the background atmospheric gas and accurately constrained atmospheric parameters together with clouds. However, with less constrained or unknown planetary mass, we observed significant biases, particularly in the misidentification of the dominant atmospheric gas. For instance, the dominant gas was incorrectly identified as oxygen for a modern-Earth-like planet or carbon dioxide for an Archean-Earth-like planet, potentially leading to erroneous assessments of planetary habitability and biosignatures. These biases arise because, the uncertainties in planetary mass affect the determination of surface gravity and atmospheric scale height, leading the retrieval algorithm to compensate by adjusting the atmospheric composition. Our findings emphasize the importance of achieving precise mass measurements-ideally within 10\% uncertainty-through methods such as extreme precision radial velocity or astrometry, especially for future missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>From pre-transit to post-eclipse: investigating the impact of 3D temperature, chemistry, and dynamics on high-resolution emission spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy has provided a wealth of information about the climate and composition of ultra-hot Jupiters. However, the 3D structure of their atmospheres makes observations more challenging to interpret, necessitating 3D forward-modeling studies. In this work, we model phase-dependent thermal emission spectra of the archetype ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b to understand how the line strengths and Doppler shifts of Fe, CO, H$_2$O, and OH evolve throughout the orbit. We post-process outputs of the SPARC/MITgcm global circulation model with the 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code gCMCRT to simulate emission spectra at 36 orbital phases. We then cross-correlate the spectra with different templates to obtain CCF and $K_{\text{p}}$$-$$V_{\text{sys}}$ maps. For each species, our models produce consistently negative $K_{\text{p}}$ offsets in pre- and post-eclipse, which are driven by planet rotation. The size of these offsets is similar to the equatorial rotation velocity of the planet. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the weak vertical temperature gradient on the nightside of ultra-hot Jupiters mutes the absorption features of CO and H$_2$O, which significantly hampers their detectability in pre- and post-transit. We also show that the $K_{\text{p}}$ and $V_{\text{sys}}$ offsets in pre- and post-transit are not always a measure for the line-of-sight velocities in the atmosphere. This is because the cross-correlation signal is a blend of dayside emission and nightside absorption features. Finally, we highlight that the observational uncertainty in the known orbital velocity of ultra-hot Jupiters can be multiple km/s, which makes it hard for certain targets to meaningfully report absolute $K_{\text{p}}$ offsets.</description>

      <title>Million Points of Light (MPoL): a PyTorch library for radio interferometric imaging and inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical radio interferometers achieve exquisite angular resolution by cross-correlating signal from a cosmic source simultaneously observed by distant pairs of radio telescopes to produce a Fourier-type measurement called a visibility. Million Points of Light (MPoL) is a Python library supporting feed-forward modeling of interferometric visibility datasets for synthesis imaging and parametric Bayesian inference, built using the autodifferentiable machine learning framework PyTorch. Neural network components provide a rich set of modular and composable building blocks that can be used to express the physical relationships between latent model parameters and observed data following the radio interferometric measurement equation. Industry-grade optimizers make it straightforward to simultaneously solve for the synthesized image and calibration parameters using stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>K-dwarf Radius Inflation and a 10-Gyr Spin-down Clock Unveiled through Asteroseismology of HD~219134 from the Keck Planet Finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first asteroseismic analysis of the K3\,V planet host HD~219134, based on four consecutive nights of radial velocities collected with the Keck Planet Finder. We applied Gold deconvolution to the power spectrum to disentangle modes from sidelobes in the spectral window, and extracted 25 mode frequencies with spherical degrees $0\leq\ell\leq3$. We derive the fundamental properties using five different evolutionary-modeling pipelines and report a mass of 0.763 $\pm$ 0.020 (stat) $\pm$ 0.007 (sys) M$_\odot$, a radius of 0.748 $\pm$ 0.007 (stat) $\pm$ 0.002 (sys) R$_\odot$, and an age of 10.151 $\pm$ 1.520 (stat) $\pm$ 0.810 (sys) Gyr. Compared to the interferometric radius 0.783 $\pm$ 0.005~R$_\odot$, the asteroseismic radius is 4\% smaller at the 4-$\sigma$ level -- a discrepancy not easily explained by known interferometric systematics, modeling assumptions on atmospheric boundary conditions and mixing lengths, magnetic fields, or tidal heating. HD~219134 is the first main-sequence star cooler than 5000~K with an asteroseismic age estimate and will serve as a critical calibration point for stellar spin-down relations. We show that existing calibrated prescriptions for angular momentum loss, incorporating weakened magnetic braking with asteroseismically constrained stellar parameters, accurately reproduce the observed rotation period. Additionally, we revised the masses and radii of the super-Earths in the system, which support their having Earth-like compositions. Finally, we confirm that the oscillation amplitude in radial velocity scales as $(L/M)^{1.5}$ in K dwarfs, in contrast to the $(L/M)^{0.7}$ relation observed in G dwarfs. These findings provide significant insights into the structure and angular momentum loss of K-type stars.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Luminosity and Mass as Limits to Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth remains the only known example of a planet with technology, and future projections of Earth's trajectory provide a basis and motivation for approaching the search for extraterrestrial technospheres. Conventional approaches toward projecting Earth's technosphere include applications of the Kardashev scale, which suggest the possibility that energy-intensive civilizations may expand to harness the entire energy output available to their planet, host star, or even the entire galaxy. In this study, we argue that the Kardashev scale is better understood as a "luminosity limit" that describes the maximum capacity for a civilization to harvest luminous stellar energy across a given spatial domain, and we note that thermodynamic efficiency will always keep a luminosity-limited technosphere from actually reaching this theoretical limit. We suggest the possibility that an advanced technosphere might evolve beyond this luminosity limit to draw its energy directly from harvesting stellar mass, and we also discuss possible trajectories that could exist between Earth today and such hypothetical "stellivores." We develop a framework to describe trajectories for long-lived technospheres that optimize their growth strategies between exploration and exploitation, unlike Earth today. We note that analyses of compact accreting stars could provide ways to test the stellivore hypothesis, and we more broadly suggest an expansion of technosignature search strategies beyond those that reside exactly at the luminosity limit.</description>

      <title>The Hottest Neptunes Orbit Metal-Rich Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Neptune desert is no longer empty. A handful of close-in planets with masses between those of Neptune and Saturn have now been discovered, and their puzzling properties have inspired a number of interesting theories on the formation and evolution of desert-dwellers. While some studies suggest that Neptune desert planets form and evolve similarly to longer-period Neptunes, others argue that they are products of rare collisions between smaller planets, or that they are the exposed interiors of giant planets (i.e., ``hot Jupiters gone wrong''). These origin stories make different predictions for the metallicities of Neptune desert host stars. In this paper, we use the homogeneous catalog of stellar metallicities from Gaia Data Release 3 to investigate the origins of Neptune desert-dwellers. We find that planets in the Neptune desert orbit stars that are significantly more metal-rich than the hosts of longer-period Neptunes ($p = 0.0016$) and smaller planets ($p = 0.00014$). In contrast, Neptune desert host star metallicities are statistically indistinguishable from those of hot Jupiter host stars ($p = 0.55$). Therefore, we find it relatively unlikely that Neptune desert planets formed and evolved similarly to longer-period Neptunes, or that they resulted from collisions between smaller planets, at least without another metallicity-selective process involved. A more straightforward explanation for this result is that planets in the desert truly are the exposed interiors of larger planets. Atmospheric spectroscopy of Neptune desert worlds may therefore provide a rare glimpse into the interiors of giant exoplanets.</description>

      <title>First unambiguous detection of ammonia in the atmosphere of a planetary mass companion with JWST/MIRI coronagraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The newly accessible mid-infrared (MIR) window offered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for exoplanet imaging is expected to provide valuable information to characterize their atmospheres. In particular, coronagraphs on board the JWST Mid-InfraRed instrument (MIRI) are capable of imaging the coldest directly imaged giant planets at the wavelengths where they emit most of their flux. The MIRI coronagraphs have been specially designed to detect the NH3 absorption around 10.5 microns, which has been predicted by atmospheric models. We aim to assess the presence of NH3 while refining the atmospheric parameters of one of the coldest companions detected by directly imaging GJ 504 b. Its mass is still a matter of debate and depending on the host star age estimate, the companion could either be placed in the brown dwarf regime or in the young Jovian planet regime. We present an analysis of MIRI coronagraphic observations of the GJ 504 system. We took advantage of previous observations of reference stars to build a library of images and to perform a more efficient subtraction of the stellar diffraction pattern. We detected the presence of NH3 at 12.5 sigma in the atmosphere, in line with atmospheric model expectations for a planetary-mass object and observed in brown dwarfs within a similar temperature range. The best-fit model with Exo-REM provides updated values of its atmospheric parameters, yielding a temperature of Teff = 512 K and radius of R = 1.08 RJup. These observations demonstrate the capability of MIRI coronagraphs to detect NH3 and to provide the first MIR observations of one of the coldest directly imaged companions. Overall, NH3 is a key molecule for characterizing the atmospheres of cold planets, offering valuable insights into their surface gravity. These observations provide valuable information for spectroscopic observations planned with JWST.</description>

      <title>HD 206893 B at High Spectral Resolution with the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an atmospheric characterization and orbital analysis of HD 206893 B, an exceptionally red, L/T-transition substellar companion in a multiplanetary system, via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution (R $\sim$ 35,000) K-band spectroscopy. Using PHOENIX atmospheric models in a forward-model framework that fits the spectrum of the companion and diffracted starlight simultaneously, we detect HD 206893 B at $&gt;8\sigma$ significance via cross-correlation in two epochs. We find an effective temperature for the companion of $1634^{+72}_{-38}$ K and a log(g) of $4.55^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$. Only accounting for statistical uncertainties, we measure the carbon-oxygen ratio (C/O) of this companion to be $0.57 \pm 0.02$, or near-solar while assuming solar metallicity. The C/O ratio we measure fits the tentative trend of $&gt;4 M_{Jup}$ companions having near-solar C/O ratios while less massive companions have greater-than-solar C/O ratios. Using substellar evolution models, we find an age of $112^{+36}_{-22}$ Myr, a mass of $22.7^{+2.5}_{-1.7} M_{Jup}$, and a radius of $1.11 \pm 0.03 R_{Jup}$ for this companion. We also use KPIC radial velocity data to fit the orbit of HD 206893 B and analyze the orbital stability of this system. We find that the orbital stability is relatively independent of the mass of HD 206893 B, and favors an orbital configuration where B and its interior planetary companion, HD 206893 c, are co-planar. The measured C/O ratio coupled with the current architecture of the system cannot rule out a core accretion scenario, nor a disk fragmentation scenario regarding the formation pathway of HD 206893 B.</description>

      <title>Mass of particles released by comet 12P/Pons-Brooks during 2023-2024 outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During its most recent return, comet 12P/Pons-Brooks experienced 14 well-documented outbursts, observed between June 13, 2023, and April 2024, at heliocentric distances ranging from $4.26\,$au to $0.85\,$au. After perihelion, two additional outbursts were observed in summer 2024, at heliocentric distances of $1.20\,$au and $2.26\,$au. Using observational data, we developed a numerical model to estimate the mass ejected during these events, focusing on the sublimation of ice through the porous cometary nucleus. The key factors affecting ejected mass estimates are the outburst amplitude and the active surface area during both quiet sublimation and the outburst phases. Pogson's law was used to express outburst magnitude, incorporating scattering cross-sections of cometary agglomerates. The model iteratively determined the mass ejected in observed outbursts, considering various ice types (H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$) controlling sublimation activity. Our results indicate that the mass ejected during these outbursts ranged from 10$^{10}$ to 10$^{13}$ kg. Our findings highlight the significant role of surface morphology and thermodynamic conditions in cometary outbursts, providing insights into the mechanisms driving these phenomena and their implications for cometary evolution and dust trail formation. Based on the analysis of observational data, we propose a six-level classification scheme for cometary outbursts.</description>
