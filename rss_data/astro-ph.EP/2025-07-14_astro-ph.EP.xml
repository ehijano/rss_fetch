      <title>The Kinematic Age of 3I/ATLAS and its Implications for Early Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the third interstellar object (3I/ATLAS) expands the known census from two to three and significantly improves statistical inferences regarding the underlying galactic population. 3I/ATLAS exhibits detectable activity that may increase as the object approaches perihelion. In this paper, we argue that the cometary activity likely significantly contributes to 3I/ATLAS's brightness, since the nuclear size of 3I/ATLAS assuming an asteroidal reflectance implies an untenable interstellar object mass per star. 3I/ATLAS exhibits an excess velocity of $v_\infty=58$ km/s relative to the Sun which is significantly larger than that of 1I/`Oumuamua or 2I/Borisov. This velocity implies that 3I/ATLAS is relatively old in comparison to previous interstellar objects. Here, we calculate the posterior distribution of ages implied by the kinematics of the interstellar objects and find that 3I/ATLAS is likely $\sim3-11$ Gyr old, assuming that the interstellar object and stellar age-velocity relations are equivalent. We also calculate the distribution of host star metallicities and find that 3I/ATLAS likely originated in a lower-metallicity system than the previous interstellar objects. These results show that interstellar object formation is likely efficient at low metallicities and early in the history of the Galaxy. Finally, we estimate and approximate interstellar object formation rate throughout Galactic history implied by these three objects.</description>

      <title>JVLA Measurement of Grain Size in the Compact Dust Ring around Class I Protostar WL 17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum grain size in protoplanetary disks is a critical parameter for planet formation, as the efficiency of mechanisms like streaming instability and pebble accretion depend on grain size. Even young class 0/I objects, such as HL Tau, show substructures in their disks, indicating the potential for early planet formation. In this study, we investigated the grain size in the dust surrounding the class I object WL 17 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Observations were conducted across seven frequency bands (Q, Ka, K, Ku, X, C, and S bands) ranging from 2 to 48 GHz, corresponding to wavelengths of 15 cm to 6.3 mm, with a spatial resolution exceeding 0\farcs5. While the ring structure at 0\farcs1 of WL 17 remains unresolved in our data, its emission is clearly detected at all observed frequencies, except at 2 GHz. To estimate the maximum grain size ($a_{\rm max}$) within the ring, we compared the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) with theoretical SEDs calculated for various $a_{\rm max}$ values using radiative transfer models. Assuming the dust opacity follows the DSHARP model, our analysis suggests that certain structures internal to the ring achieved a maximum grain size of approximately 4.2 mm. Additionally, we discuss the gravitational stability of the ring and the potential planetary core mass that could form through pebble accretion within the structure.</description>

      <title>An Earth-Sized Planet in a 5.4h Orbit Around a Nearby K dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and confirmation of the ultra-short period (USP) planet TOI-2431 b orbiting a nearby ($d\sim36$ pc) late K star ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ = $4109 \pm 28 \, {\rm K}$) using observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), precise radial velocities with the NEID and the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) spectrographs, as well as ground-based high contrast imaging from NESSI. TOI-2431 b has a period of 5 hours and 22 minutes, making it one of the shortest-period exoplanets known to date. TOI-2431 b has a radius of $1.536 \pm 0.033\, \rm{R_\oplus}$, and a mass of $6.2 \pm 1.2\, \rm{M_\oplus}$, suggesting it has a density compatible with an Earth-like composition and, due to its high irradiation, is likely a 'lava-world' with a $T_{\mathrm{eq}}$ = $2063 \pm 30 \, {\rm K}$. We estimate that the current orbital period is only 30% larger than the Roche-limit orbital period, and that it has an expected orbital decay timescale of only $\sim$31 Myr. Finally, due to the brightness of the host star ($V = 10.9$, $K = 7.6$), TOI-2431 b has a high Emission Spectroscopy Metric of 27, making it one of the best USP systems for atmospheric phase-curve analysis.</description>

      <title>Geometric Considerations in Hot Jupiter Magnetic Drag Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are expected to impact the atmospheric dynamics of hot and ultra-hot Jupiters due to their increased ionization fractions, compared to that of cooler exoplanets, but our ability to model these magnetic processes is limited by the different coupling regimes between the day and night sides of the planets. One common approach is to approximate the magnetic interactions as a drag acting on the atmosphere. In this work, we examine, within the context of this drag approximation, the impact of including vertical and meridional drag, in addition to zonal drag, from a background dipole magnetic field on the flows in hot Jupiter atmospheres as well as a relaxation of the assumption of solely meridional currents and demonstrate that the inclusion of meridional and vertical drag can limit flows over the poles in hotter atmospheres, something not seen in models that only consider zonal drag, and the assumption of only meridional currents results in an underestimation of the equatorial drag in all cases examined.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of two directly imaged benchmark L dwarf companions at the stellar-substellar boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used multiple epochs of high-contrast imaging spectrophotometric observations to determine the atmospheric characteristics and thermal evolution of two previously detected benchmark L dwarf companions, HD 112863 B and HD 206505 B. We analyzed IRDIS and IFS data from VLT/SPHERE of each companion, both of which have dynamical masses near the stellar-substellar boundary. We compared each companion with empirical spectral standards, as well as constrained their physical properties through atmospheric model fits. From these analyses, we estimate that HD 112863 B is spectral type $\rm{L}3\pm1$ and that HD 206505 B is spectral type $\rm{L}2\pm1$. Using the BT-Settl atmospheric model grids, we find a bimodal solution for the atmospheric model fit of HD 112863 B, such that $T_{\rm{eff}}=1757^{+37}_{-36}$ K or $2002^{+23}_{-24}$ K and $\log{g}=4.973^{+0.057}_{-0.063}$ or $5.253^{+0.037}_{-0.033}$, while for HD 206505 B, $T_{\rm{eff}}=1754^{+13}_{-13}$ K and $\log{g}=4.919^{+0.031}_{-0.029}$. Comparing the bolometric luminosities of both companions with evolutionary models imply that both companions are likely above the hydrogen burning limit.</description>

      <title>Constraining the survival of HCN during cometary impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cometary impacts have been invoked as an atmosphere-independent method of stockpiling hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a key prebiotic feedstock molecule, into environments favourable for the onset of prebiotic chemistry on the early Earth. This work revisits the prospects for cometary delivery of HCN through new impacts simulations of idealised cometary bodies using the shock physics code iSALE combined with simple chemical modelling. Using temperature and pressure profiles for material within spherical, non-porous comets with a high resolution of Lagrangian tracer particles, we assess the survival rate of HCN across a range of impact velocities, sizes and angles, assuming both steady state and equilibrium chemistry. We find that HCN survival is extremely limited at impact velocities above the escape velocity of the Earth, unless the impact occurs at extreme obliquity ($\theta \sim 15^\circ$). We present a parametrisation of the survival of HCN as a function of impact velocity, angle, and cometary diameter, which provides an upper limit to survival in more realistic scenarios to aid with future studies investigating the role of comets in the origins of life. Although successful HCN delivery may be possible in our idealised model, we neglect to consider the effect of atmospheric passage and our results suggest that delivery alone is not likely to be sufficient for the onset of prebiotic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Multi-frequency analysis of the ALMA and VLA high resolution continuum observations of the substructured disc around CI Tau. Preference for sub-mm-sized low-porosity amorphous carbonaceous grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) We present high angular resolution and sensitivity ALMA 3.1 mm and VLA 9.1 mm observations of the disc around CI Tau. These new data were combined with similar-resolution archival ALMA 0.9 and 1.3 mm observations and new and archival VLA 7.1 mm, 2.0, 3.0, and 6.0 cm photometry to study the properties of dust in this system. At wavelengths &lt;3.1 mm, CI Tau's continuum emission is very extended and highly substructured (with three gaps, four rings, and two additional gap-ring pairs identified by non-parametric visibility modelling). Instead, the VLA 9.1 mm data are dominated by a bright central component, only partially (&lt; 50%) due to dust emission, surrounded by a marginally detected, faint, and smooth halo. We fitted the ALMA and VLA 9.1 mm data together, adopting a physical model that accounts for the effects of dust absorption and scattering. For our fiducial dust composition ("Ricci" opacities), we retrieved a flat maximum grain size distribution across the disc radius of $(7.1\pm0.8)\times10^{-2}$ cm, that we tentatively attributed to fragmentation of fragile dust or bouncing. We tested, for the first time, the dependence of our results on the adopted dust composition model to assess which mixture can best reproduce the observations. We found that the "Ricci" opacities work better than the traditionally adopted "DSHARP" ones, while graphite-rich mixtures perform significantly worse. We also show that, for our fiducial composition, the data prefer low-porosity (&lt; 70%) grains, in contrast with claims of highly porous aggregates in younger sources, which we tentatively justified by time-dependent compaction. Our results are in line with constraints from disc population synthesis models and naturally arise from CI Tau's peculiar spectral behaviour, making this disc an ideal target for deeper cm-wavelength and dust polarisation follow-ups.</description>

      <title>Universal energy limits of radiation belts in planetary and brown dwarf magnetospheric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation belts are regions of magnetically trapped particle radiation found around all of the sufficiently magnetized planets in the Solar System and recently also observed around brown dwarfs, yet despite their ubiquity, there is not yet a general theory or model to predict the uppermost energy limits that any particular magnetospheric system's radiation belts can attain. By considering only the most fundamental loss processes, a model and corresponding theory are developed that successfully bound and explain the maximum observed energies of all documented radiation belt systems. Interestingly, this approach yields a relatively simple function for the uppermost energy limit that depends on only the surface magnetic field strength of the system. The model predicts an energy limit for all radiation belt systems that asymptotes at 7 +/- 2 TeV (for protons and electrons), offering intriguing new insight on potential sources of galactic cosmic rays. This model is also applied to an exoplanetary system, demonstrating that the planet is likely a synchrotron emitter and showcasing the model's use for identifying candidate targets for synchrotron-emitting astrophysical systems and revealing details critical to habitability at those remote worlds.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Limits of Rotation Period Recovery through Gyrochronology Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contamination from nearby sources often compromises stellar rotation periods derived from photometric light curves, particularly in data with large pixel scales such as TESS. This problem is compounded when both the target and contaminant are intrinsically variable, a scenario that challenges deblending algorithms, which often assume constant contaminants. We assess the reliability of rotation period detections using wide binary systems, whose components share a common age and rotational history. By applying gyrochronology constraints, we identify period combinations that yield consistent ages between components, helping to isolate true rotation signals. Simulating blends with degraded Kepler data, our method recovers correct rotation periods with an 88\% success rate for periods $&lt;12$ days, where TESS detections are most reliable. Applying this framework to nearly 300 wide binaries observed by TESS, we find that despite significant contamination, a subset of pairs shows consistent gyrochronological ages. We establish a practical detection threshold for TESS blended observations, finding that periods shorter than $\sim8$ days are reliably recovered, while those longer than $\sim10$ days become significantly more challenging and often remain unresolved. As expected, rotation periods are more often recovered when the highest-amplitude periodogram peak is linked to the brighter star and the second to the dimmer star, although many cases deviate from this pattern, indicating it cannot always be assumed. Our results highlight the limitations of standard deblending methods and demonstrate that astrophysical constraints, such as gyrochronology, provide a valuable tool for extracting reliable rotation periods from complex photometric blends.</description>

      <title>Heat loss and internal dynamics of Venus from lithosphere strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absence of plate tectonics and the young surface age (0.3-1 billion years) of Venus have led to diverse geodynamic models for Venus. The energetics of the Venusian interior drive these models; however, the lack of direct constraints on surface heat flow hampers their quantitative assessment. Here we present a global heat flow model for Venus, as well as estimates of the total heat loss, obtained from an inversion of geophysical data, including lithospheric effective elastic thickness, crustal thickness, and radioactive heat production. Heat flow on Venus is lower and less geographically structured than on Earth, with an average of 31 mW m$^{-2}$, but with highs associated to rifts systems reaching values typical of active terrestrial areas. The obtained total heat loss is 11-17 TW, similar to estimates of the total radioactive heat production. Therefore, at present, Venus proportionally dissipates much less heat than Earth. Furthermore, the calculated crustal temperatures imply that crustal melting or eclogitization are not dominant processes in the Venusian crust.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Earth's Core-Mantle boundary from nutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic variations in the Sun and Moon's gravitational pull cause small changes in Earth's rotational axis direction called nutation. Nutation components in the retrograde quasi-diurnal frequency band measured in the terrestrial reference frame are amplified by resonance with the Free Core Nutation (FCN), a rotational mode of Earth's fluid core. Dissipative processes at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) dampen this resonance, contributing to the observed phase lag between tidal forcing and Earth's rotational response. This phase lag is commonly attributed to electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the core and the electrically conducting lower mantle. However, estimates of mantle conductivity and radial magnetic field strength at the CMB suggest these effects are insufficient. We show that the missing dissipation arises naturally from the excitation of internal waves in the fluid core by topographic features at the CMB. Adapting a theoretical framework originally developed for tidal flow over oceanic topography, we compute the form drag and associated power flux induced by CMB topography. Our results are consistent with a CMB topography characterized by a root mean square amplitude of a few kilometers. The model favors weak stratification at the top of the core, though stronger stratification remains compatible with increased topographic amplitude. This mechanism provides independent constraints on CMB topography and stratification, complementing seismological and magnetic observations. Its generality offers a new framework for probing deep-interior dynamics across terrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of M Dwarf Planet Host Stars from Kepler, K2, and TESS observed by APOGEE: Trends with Exoplanetary Radii and Orbital Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One important property in studying the exoplanet population is the host star metallicity ([M/H]). In this study, we derived stellar metallicities and oxygen abundances for 45 M dwarf stars (with 65 exoplanets) using the near-infrared high-resolution spectra from the SDSS APOGEE survey and synthetic spectra computed in LTE. We also investigated the exoplanetary radii distribution for a larger sample of 246 exoplanets orbiting 188 M dwarf stars. The [M/H] versus [O/M] distribution obtained indicates that our sample is composed mainly of thin disk stars, which follow the behavior of the low-alpha sequence in the Milky Way thin disk. Small planets with radii smaller than 3R$_{\oplus}$ were found around stars with a range of metallicities (-0.6$&lt;$[M/H]$&lt;$+0.3), while larger planets of the sample orbit only stars with [M/H]$&gt;=0.0$. These results indicate that while small planets can form in different environments, larger planets preferentially form in metal-rich protoplanetary disks. Exoplanets with P$_{\rm orb}&lt;$4.3 days orbit on average more metal-rich stars than planets with longer periods. This threshold is smaller than that found for FGK stars (8--10 days) and might be related to M dwarfs having a smaller dust sublimation radius. The distribution of exoplanets with R$_{\rm p}&gt;$4R$_{\oplus}$ shows a concentration at orbital periods between 2 and 5 days, which may result from inward orbital migration. There is also a different behavior between single-detected exoplanets and planets from multiplanetary systems, with the latter being found on average around more metal-poor stars, and with planetary radii roughly up to 3 R$_{\oplus}$.</description>
