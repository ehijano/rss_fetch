      <title>On Hamiltonian projective billiards on boundaries of products of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K\subset\mathbb R^n_q$, $T\subset\mathbb R^n_p$ be two bounded strictly convex bodies (open subsets) with $C^6$-smooth boundaries. We consider the product $\overline K\times\overline T\subset\mathbb R^{2n}_{p,q}$ equipped with the standard symplectic form $\omega=\sum_{j=1}^ndq_j\wedge dp_j$. The $(K,T)$-billiard orbits are continuous curves in the boundary $\partial(K\times T)$ whose intersections with the open dense subset $(K\times\partial T)\cup(\partial K\times T)$ are tangent to the characteristic line field given by kernels of the restrictions of the symplectic form $\omega$ to the tangent spaces to the boundary. For every $(q,p)\in K\times \partial T$ the characteristic line in $T_{(q,p)}\mathbb R^{2n}$ is directed by the vector $(\vec n(p),0)$, where $\vec n(p)$ is the exterior normal to $T_p\partial T$, and similar statement holds for $(q,p)\in\partial K\times T$. The projection of each $(K,T)$-billiard orbit to $K$ is an orbit of the so-called $T$-billiard in $K$. In the case, when $T$ is centrally-symmetric, this is the billiard in $\mathbb R^n_q$ equipped with Minkowski Finsler structure "dual to $T$", with Finsler reflection law introduced in a joint paper by S.Tabachnikov and E.Gutkin in 2002. Studying $(K,T)$-billiard orbits is closely related to C.Viterbo's Symplectic Isoperimetric Conjecture and the famous Mahler Conjecture in convex geometry. We study the special case, when the $T$-billiard reflection law is the projective law introduced by S.Tabachnikov, i.e., given by projective involutions of the projectivized tangent spaces $T_q\mathbb R^n$, $q\in\partial K$. We show that this happens, if and only if $T$ is an ellipsoid, or equivalently, if all the $T$-billiards are simultaneously affine equivalent to Euclidean billiards. As an application, we deduce analogous results for Finsler billiards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact Riemann surface. Let $f$ be a holomorphic self-correspondence of $X$ with dynamical degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$. Assume that $d_1\neq d_2$ or $f$ is non-weakly modular. We show that the graphs of the iterates $f^n$ of $f$ are equidistributed exponentially fast with respect to a positive closed current in $X\times X$.</description>

      <title>On existence of expanding attractors with different dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that $n$-sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$, $n\geq 2$, admits structurally stable diffeomorphisms $\mathbb{S}^n\to\mathbb{S}^n$ with non-orientable expanding attractors of any topological dimension $d\in\{1,\ldots,[\frac{n}{2}]\}$ where $[x]$ is an integer part of $x$. One proves that $n$-torus $\mathbb{T}^n$, $n\geq 2$, admits structurally stable diffeomorphisms $\mathbb{T}^n\to\mathbb{T}^n$ with orientable expanding attractors of any topological dimension $1\leq q\leq n-1$. We also prove that given any closed $n$-manifold $M^n$, $n\geq 2$, and any $d\in\{1,\ldots,[\frac{n}{2}]\}$, there is an axiom A diffeomorphism $f: M^n\to M^n$ with a $d$-dimensional non-orientable expanding attractor. Similar statements hold for axiom A flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The now classical convergence in distribution theorem for well normalized sums ofstationary martingale increments has been extended to multi-indexed martingaleincrements (see Voln\'{y} (2019) and references in there). In the presentarticle we make progress in the identification of the limit law.In dimension one, as soon as the stationary martingale increments form an ergodic process, the limit law is normal, and it is stillthe case for multi-indexed martingale increments when one of the processes defined by one coordinate of the{\it multidimensional time} is ergodic. In the general case, the limit may be non normal.The dynamical properties of the $\mathbb{Z}^d$-measure preserving action associatedto the stationary random field allows us to give a necessary and sufficient conditionfor the existence of a non-normal limit law, in terms of entropy of some random processes.The identification of a {\it natural} factor on which the $\mathbb{Z}^d$-action is {\it of product type</description>

      <title>A Power Tower Control: A New Sliding Mode Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A control based power tower function at order 2 is proposed in this paper. This leads to a new sliding mode control, which allows employing backstepping technique that combines both guaranteed and finite time convergence. The proposed control is applied to a double integrator subject to perturbation $d$. Both guaranteed and finite convergence are ensured by the controller when $d$ is considered constant and bounded, without knowing its upper bound. For the case, when $d$ is variable and bounded with its upper bound known, only a finite time convergence is obtained. Simulation results are given to show the well founded of the proposed novel control.</description>

      <title>On resonant energy sets for Hamiltonian systems with reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two uncoupled oscillators, horizontal and vertical, residing in rectilinear polygons (with only vertical and horizontal sides) and impacting elastically from their boundary. The main purpose of the article is to analyze the occurrence of resonance in such systems, depending on the shape of the analytical potentials that determine the oscillators. We define resonant energy levels; roughly speaking, these are levels for which the resonance phenomenon occurs more often than rarely. We focus on unimodal analytic potentials with the minimum at zero. The most important result of the work describes the size of the set of resonance levels in the form of the following trichotomy: it is mostly empty or is one-element or is large, i.e. non-empty and open. We also indicate which classes of potentials each of the three possibilities can occur in. From this point of view, the last case (strongly resonant) is the most interesting. Then, the potentials belong to a special class of potentials, denoted by $\mathcal{SP}$, which seems unknown in the literature. The presented results appear to be new, even in the simplest case, when the uncoupled oscillators are not trapped in any set.</description>

      <title>Finding bifurcations in mathematical epidemiology via reaction network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical Epidemiology (ME) shares with Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT) the basic mathematical structure of its dynamical systems. Despite this central similarity, methods from CRNT have been seldom applied to solving problems in ME. We explore here the applicability of CRNT methods to find bifurcations at endemic equilibria of ME models.
  In particular, we adapt three CRNT methods to the features of ME. Firstly, we prove that essentially all ME models admit Hopf bifurcations for certain monotone choices of the interaction functions. Secondly, we offer a parametrization of equilibria Jacobians of ME systems where few interactions are not in mass action form. Thirdly, we show that periodic oscillations in closed systems imply periodic oscillations when demography is added.
  Finally, we apply such results to two families of networks: a general SIR model with a nonlinear treatment rate and a recent SIRnS model with a gradual increase in infectiousness. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of bifurcations at endemic equilibria of both families.</description>

      <title>Jump-Switch-Flow: hybrid stochastic-deterministic solutions of compartmental models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many multi-scale systems exhibit stochastic and deterministic dynamics. Capturing these aspects in a compartmental model is challenging. Notably, low occupancy compartments exhibit stochastic dynamics and high occupancy compartments exhibit deterministic dynamics. Failing to account for stochasticity in small populations can produce 'atto-foxes', e.g. in the classic Lotka-Volterra ODE system. This can be resolved with discrete stochastic models e.g. continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs). Unfortunately, simulating CTMCs is infeasible for most realistic populations. We develop a hybrid CTMC-ODE approach, 'Jump-Switch-Flow' (JSF), available as a Python package. JSF couples CTMCs and ODEs, and depending on the state of the system, individual compartments 'switch' between stochastic 'jumping' and deterministic 'flowing' representations. Consequently, compartments can reach extinct states, thereby resolving atto-type problems. JSF has the desired behaviours of exact CTMC simulation, but is substantially faster that existing alternatives. JSF's value for inference problems, particularly multi-scale problems, is demonstrated with a case-study using a particle filter. With existing data of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we perform a novel analysis to quantify within-host viral clearance. JSF offers a novel approach to compartmental model development and simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article produces wave equations and constructs traveling wave solutions that are intimately related to Newton's equations of celestial mechanics. The traveling wave solutions are expressed in ``closed form'' in terms of elementary functions. They are specialized to the 2-body and the relative 2-body problem. The traveling wave solutions disclose the shape and position of wave fronts emanating from collisions by determining the location of the singularities of the traveling wave solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider active nematodynamics on deformable surfaces. Based on a thermodynamically consistent surface Beris-Edwards model we add nematic activity and focus on the emerging additional coupling mechanism between the nematic field, the flow field and the curved surface. We analyse the impact of the active nematic force at topological defects. Under the presence of curvature all defects become active and contribute not only tangential forces but also normal forces. This confirms the proposed role of topological defects in surface evolution and provides the basis for a dynamic description of morphogenetic processes.</description>

      <title>VAE-Var: Variational-Autoencoder-Enhanced Variational Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation refers to a set of algorithms designed to compute the optimal estimate of a system's state by refining the prior prediction (known as background states) using observed data. Variational assimilation methods rely on the maximum likelihood approach to formulate a variational cost, with the optimal state estimate derived by minimizing this cost. Although traditional variational methods have achieved great success and have been widely used in many numerical weather prediction centers, they generally assume Gaussian errors in the background states, which limits the accuracy of these algorithms due to the inherent inaccuracies of this assumption. In this paper, we introduce VAE-Var, a novel variational algorithm that leverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model a non-Gaussian estimate of the background error distribution. We theoretically derive the variational cost under the VAE estimation and present the general formulation of VAE-Var; we implement VAE-Var on low-dimensional chaotic systems and demonstrate through experimental results that VAE-Var consistently outperforms traditional variational assimilation methods in terms of accuracy across various observational settings.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Differential-Algebraic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems often faces numerous data-related challenges. A fundamental requirement is the existence of a unique set of parameters for a chosen model structure, an issue commonly referred to as identifiability. Although this problem is well studied for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), few studies have focused on the more general class of systems described by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Examples of DAEs include dynamical systems with algebraic equations representing conservation laws or approximating fast dynamics. This work introduces a novel identifiability test for models characterized by nonlinear DAEs. Unlike previous approaches, our test only requires prior knowledge of the system equations and does not need nonlinear transformation, index reduction, or numerical integration of the DAEs. We employed our identifiability analysis across a diverse range of DAE models, illustrating how system identifiability depends on the choices of sensors, experimental conditions, and model structures. Given the added challenges involved in identifying DAEs when compared to ODEs, we anticipate that our findings will have broad applicability and contribute significantly to the development and validation of data-driven methods for DAEs and other structure-preserving models.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of the confidence region in orbit determination for hyperbolic maps with a parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When dealing with an orbit determination problem, uncertainties naturally arise from intrinsic errors related to observation devices and approximation models. Following the least squares method and applying approximation schemes such as the differential correction, uncertainties can be geometrically summarized in confidence regions and estimated by confidence ellipsoids. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the confidence ellipsoids while the number of observations and the time span over which they are performed simultaneously increase. Numerical evidences suggest that, in the chaotic scenario, the uncertainties decay at different rates whether the orbit determination is set up to recover the initial conditions alone or along with a dynamical or kinematical parameter, while in the regular case there is no distinction. We show how to improve some of the results in \cite{maro.bonanno}, providing conditions that imply a non-faster-than-polynomial rate of decay in the chaotic case with the parameter, in accordance with the numerical experiments. We also apply these findings to well known examples of chaotic maps, such as piecewise expanding maps of the unit interval or affine hyperbolic toral transformations. We also discuss the applicability to intermittent maps.</description>

Indeed, we discuss several concepts of generation for the semimodule of values of K\"{a}hler differentials of the curve and provide basis of K\"{a}hler differentials, for every of these concepts, whose geometric properties are described.

      <description>arXiv:2405.14429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Koopman operator semigroup $(K^t)_{t\ge 0}$ associated with stochastic differential equations of the form $dX_t = AX_t\,dt + B\,dW_t$ with constant matrices $A$ and $B$ and Brownian motion $W_t$. We prove that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\bH_C$ generated by a Gaussian kernel with a positive definite covariance matrix $C$ is invariant under each Koopman operator $K^t$ if the matrices $A$, $B$, and $C$ satisfy the following Lyapunov-like matrix inequality: $AC^2 + C^2A^\top\le 2BB^\top$. In this course, we prove a characterization concerning the inclusion $\bH_{C_1}\subset\bH_{C_2}$ of Gaussian RKHSs for two positive definite matrices $C_1$ and $C_2$. The question of whether the sufficient Lyapunov-condition is also necessary is left as an open problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the practical interest in the third-body perturbation as a natural cleaning mechanism for high-altitude Earth orbits, we investigate the dynamics stemming from the secular Hamiltonian associated with the lunar perturbation, assuming that the Moon lies on the ecliptic plane. The secular Hamiltonian defined in that way is characterized by two timescales. We compare the location and stability of the fixed points associated with the secular Hamiltonian averaged with respect to the fast variable with the corresponding periodic orbits of the full system. Focusing on the orbit of the Galileo satellites, it turns out that the two dynamics cannot be confused, as the relative difference depends on the ratio between the semi-major axis of Galileo and the one of the Moon, that is not negligible.
  The result is relevant to construct rigorously the Arnold diffusion mechanism that can drive a natural growth in eccentricity that allows a satellite initially on a circular orbit in Medium Earth Orbit to reenter into the Earth's atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Turing instabilities for three interacting species</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Turing instabilities in a general system with three interacting species. Turing instabilities describe situations when a stable steady state of a reaction system (ordinary differential equation) becomes an unstable homogeneous steady state of the corresponding reaction-diffusion system (partial differential equation). Similarly to a well-known inequality condition for Turing instabilities in a system with two species, I find a set of inequality conditions for a system with three species. Furthermore, I distinguish conditions for the Turing instability when spatial perturbations grow steadily and the Turing-Hopf instability when spatial perturbations grow and oscillate in time simultaneously.</description>

      <title>A periodic Kingman model for the balance between mutation and selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a periodic extension of the classical Kingman non-linear model (Kingman, 1978) for the balance between selection and mutation in a large population. In the original model, the fitness distribution of the population is modeled by a probability measure on the unit interval evolving through a simple dynamical system in discrete time: selection acts through size-biasing, and the mutation probability and distribution are kept fixed through time. A natural extension of Kingman model is given by a periodic mutation environment; in this setting, we prove the convergence of the fitness distribution along subsequences and find an explicit criterion in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of an appropriately chosen matrix to decide whether an atom emerges at the largest fitness, a phenomenon usually called condensation.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis on principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. We introduce a semiclassical framework, called Borel-Weil calculus, to investigate $G$-equivariant (pseudo)differential operators acting on $G$-principal bundles over closed manifolds. In this calculus, the semiclassical parameters correspond to the highest roots in the Weyl chamber of the group $G$ that parametrize irreducible representations, and operators are pseudodifferential in the base variable, with values in Toeplitz operators on the flag manifold associated to the group. This monograph unfolds two main applications of our calculus.
  Firstly, in the realm of dynamical systems, we obtain explicit sufficient conditions for rapid mixing of volume-preserving partially hyperbolic flows obtained as extensions of an Anosov flow to a $G$-principal bundle (for an arbitrary $G$). In particular, when $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$, we prove that the flow on the extension is rapid mixing whenever the Anosov flow is not jointly integrable, and the circle bundle is not torsion. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that ergodicity of the extension is equivalent to rapid mixing. Secondly, we study the spectral theory of sub-elliptic Laplacians obtained as horizontal Laplacians of a $G$-equivariant connection on a principal bundle. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that the horizontal Laplacian is globally hypoelliptic as soon as the connection has a dense holonomy group in $G$. Notably, this result encompasses all flat bundles with a dense monodromy group in $G$. We also prove a quantum ergodicity result for flat principal bundles with dense holonomy group if the base space has Anosov geodesic flow (e.g. in negative sectional curvature).
  We believe that this monograph will serve as a cornerstone for future investigations applying the Borel-Weil calculus across different fields.</description>

Abstract: For the space of unimodular lattices in a Euclidean space, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for equidistribution of expanding translates of any real-analytic submanifold under a diagonal flow. This extends the earlier result of Shah in the case of non-degenerate submanifolds.
  We apply the above dynamical result to show that if the affine span of a real-analytic submanifold in a Euclidean space satisfies certain Diophantine and arithmetic conditions, then almost every point on the manifold is not Dirichlet-improvable.</description>

      <title>Subshifts of finite symbolic rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The definition of subshifts of finite symbolic rank is motivated by the finite rank measure-preserving transformations which have been extensively studied in ergodic theory. In this paper we study subshifts of finite symbolic rank as essentially minimal Cantor systems. We show that minimal subshifts of finite symbolic rank have finite topological rank, and conversely, every minimal Cantor system of finite topological rank is either an odometer or conjugate to a minimal subshift of finite symbolic rank. We characterize the class of all minimal Cantor systems conjugate to a rank-$1$ subshift and show that it is dense but not generic in the Polish space of all minimal Cantor systems. Within some different Polish coding spaces of subshifts we also show that the rank-1 subshifts are dense but not generic. Finally we study topological factors of minimal subshifts of finite symbolic rank. We show that every infinite odometer and every irrational rotation is the maximal equicontinuous factor of a minimal subshift of symbolic rank $2$, and that a subshift factor of a minimal subshift of finite symbolic rank has finite symbolic rank.</description>

Abstract: Given a two-sided shift space on a finite alphabet and a continuous potential function, we give conditions under which an equilibrium measure can be described using a construction analogous to Hausdorff measure that goes back to the work of Bowen. This construction was previously applied to smooth uniformly and partially hyperbolic systems by the first author, Pesin, and Zelerowicz. Our results here apply to all subshifts of finite type and H\"older continuous potentials, but extend beyond this setting, and we also apply them to shift spaces with synchronizing words.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been more than twenty years since Moshe Newman, based on work by Neil Calkin and Herbert Wilf, introduced an explicit bijection between the rational and natural numbers. Interestingly, this bijection is dynamic in nature. Indeed, Newman's map has the property that the orbit of zero provides the required bijection. Claudio Bonanno and Stefano Isola, using continued fractions expansions, described the dynamics of its first return time map T. They proved that it is topologically conjugated to the dyadic odometer. In this article, we prove that the correct numerical system needed to analyze this map is the backward continued fractions. Indeed, this approach has the advantage that it provides explicitly the action of T on the expansion. As a by-product, we naturally obtain an explicit formula for Minkowski's question mark function in terms of backward continued fractions. The whole point of Newman was to provide an explicit bijection, our approach shares the same taste for the explicit.</description>

      <title>Gluing Local Dynamics: An Algorithmic Surgery Method in Non-archimedean Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce "non-archimedean surgery" (na-surgery), an adaptation of quasiconformal surgery from the complex plane to non-archimedean fields. Through this approach, we construct rational functions that approximate local dynamics in non-archimedean spaces and advance an algorithmic solution to the Inverse Problem in arithmetic dynamics. Our na-surgery method permits controlled modifications of dynamical systems in non-archimedean contexts, enabling us to synthesize global dynamics from local behaviors with precision up to an \(\varepsilon\)-parameter. This development furnishes a systematic method for both the construction and examination of dynamical systems within non-archimedean frameworks, enhancing the toolkit for research in arithmetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Real-time hybrid testing using iterative control for periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time hybrid testing is a method in which a substructure of the system is realised experimentally and the rest numerically. The two parts interact in real time to emulate the dynamics of the full system. Such experiments however are often difficult to realise as the actuators and sensors, needed to ensure compatibility and force-equilibrium conditions at the interface, can seriously affect the predicted dynamics of the system and result in stability and fidelity issues. The traditional approach of using feedback control to overcome the additional unwanted dynamics is challenging due to the presence of an outer feedback loop, passing interface displacements or forces to the numerical substructure. We, therefore, advocate for an alternative approach, removing the problematic interface dynamics with an iterative scheme to minimise interface errors, thus, capturing the response of the true assembly. The technique is examined by hybrid testing of a bench-top four-storey building with different interface configurations, where using conventional hybrid measurement techniques is very challenging. A case where the physical part exhibits nonlinear restoring force characteristics is also considered. These tests show that the iterative approach is capable of handling even scenarios which are theoretically infeasible with feedback control.</description>

Abstract: We rigorously derive novel error bounds for extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to approximate the Koopman operator for discrete- and continuous time (stochastic) systems; both for i.i.d. and ergodic sampling under non-restrictive assumptions. We show exponential convergence rates for i.i.d. sampling and provide the first superlinear convergence rates for ergodic sampling of deterministic systems. The proofs are based on novel exact variance representations for the empirical estimators of mass and stiffness matrix. Moreover, we verify the accuracy of the derived error bounds and convergence rates by means of numerical simulations for highly-complex dynamical systems including a nonlinear partial differential equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an ergodic map $T$ and a non-constant, real-valued $f \in L^1$, the ergodic averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x) = \frac{1} {N} \sum_{n=1}^N f(T^n x)$ converge a.e., but the convergence is never monotone. Depending on particular properties of the function $f$, the averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x)$ may or may not actually oscillate around the mean value infinitely often a.e. We will prove that a.e. oscillation around the mean is the generic behavior. That is, for a fixed ergodic $T$, the generic non-constant $f\in L^1$ has the averages $\mathbb{A}_N f(x)$ oscillating around the mean infinitely often for almost every $x$. We also consider oscillation for other stochastic processes like subsequences of the ergodic averages, convolution operators, weighted averages, uniform distribution and martingales. We will show that in general, in these settings oscillation around the limit infinitely often persists as the generic behavior.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Marstrand type slicing theorem for the subsets of the integer square lattice. This problem is the dual of the corresponding projection theorem, which was considered by Glasscock, and Lima and Moreira, with the mass and counting dimensions applied to subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. In this paper, more generally we deal with a subset of the plane that is $1$ separated, and the result for subsets of the integer lattice follow as a special case. We show that the natural slicing question in this setting is true with the mass dimension.</description>

Abstract: We study rigidity properties of actions of a torsion-free lattice of $\operatorname{PSU}(1,1)$ on the circle $S^1$. We follow the approaches of Frankel and Thurston proposed in preprints via foliated harmonic measures on the suspension bundles. Our main results are a curvature estimate and a Gauss--Bonnet formula for the $S^1$ connection obtained by taking the average of the flat connection with respect to a harmonic measure. As consequences, we give a precise description of the harmonic measure on suspension foliations with maximal Euler number and an alternative proof of rigidity theorems of Matsumoto and Burger--Iozzi--Wienhard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastability, characterized by a variability of regimes in time, is a ubiquitous type of neural dynamics. It has been formulated in many different ways in the neuroscience literature, however, which may cause some confusion. In this Perspective, we discuss metastability from the point of view of dynamical systems theory. We extract from the literature a very simple but general definition through the concept of metastable regimes as long-lived but transient epochs of activity with unique dynamical properties. This definition serves as an umbrella term that encompasses formulations from other works, and readily connects to concepts from dynamical systems theory. This allows us to examine general dynamical properties of metastable regimes, propose in a didactic manner several dynamics-based mechanisms that generate them, and discuss a theoretical tool to characterize them quantitatively. This perspective leads to insights that help to address issues debated in the literature and also suggest pathways for future research.</description>

      <title>Vocabulary for Universal Approximation: A Linguistic Perspective of Mapping Compositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based sequence modelings, such as language models, have received much attention and success, which pushes researchers to explore the possibility of transforming non-sequential problems into a sequential form. Following this thought, deep neural networks can be represented as composite functions of a sequence of mappings, linear or nonlinear, where each composition can be viewed as a \emph{word}. However, the weights of linear mappings are undetermined and hence require an infinite number of words. In this article, we investigate the finite case and constructively prove the existence of a finite \emph{vocabulary} $V=\{\phi_i: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d | i=1,...,n\}$ with $n=O(d^2)$ for the universal approximation. That is, for any continuous mapping $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$, compact domain $\Omega$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there is a sequence of mappings $\phi_{i_1}, ..., \phi_{i_m} \in V, m \in \mathbb{Z}_+$, such that the composition $\phi_{i_m} \circ ... \circ \phi_{i_1} $ approximates $f$ on $\Omega$ with an error less than $\varepsilon$. Our results demonstrate an unusual approximation power of mapping compositions and motivate a novel compositional model for regular languages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern space missions with uncrewed spacecraft require robust trajectory design to connect multiple chaotic orbits by small controls. To address this issue, we propose a control scheme to design robust trajectories by leveraging a geometrical structure in chaotic zones, known as a {\it lobe}. Our scheme shows that appropriately selected lobes reveal possible paths to traverse chaotic zones in a short time. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through trajectory design in both the standard map and Hill's equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a pre-trained foundation model \textbf{FMint} (\textbf{F}oundation \textbf{M}odel based on \textbf{In}i\textbf{t}ialization), designed to speed up large-scale simulations of various differential equations with high accuracy via error correction. Human-designed simulation algorithms excel at capturing the fundamental physics of engineering problems, but often need to balance the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. While deep learning methods offer innovative solutions across numerous scientific fields, they frequently fall short in domain-specific knowledge. FMint bridges these gaps through conditioning on the initial coarse solutions obtained from conventional human-designed algorithms, and trained to obtain refined solutions for various differential equations. Based on the backbone of large language models, we adapt the in-context learning scheme to learn a universal error correction method for dynamical systems from given prompted sequences of coarse solutions. The model is pre-trained on a corpus of 600K ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and we conduct extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. FMint outperforms various baselines on large-scale simulation, and demonstrates its capability in generalization to unseen ODEs. Our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a 5X speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms.</description>
