      <title>Cellular Development Follows the Path of Minimum Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular development follows a stochastic yet rule-governed trajectory, though the underlying principles remain elusive. Here, we propose that cellular development follows paths of least action, aligning with foundational physical laws that govern dynamic systems across nature. We introduce a computational framework that takes advantage of the deep connection between the principle of least action and maximum entropy to model developmental processes using Transformers architecture. This approach enables precise quantification of entropy production, information flow curvature, and local irreversibility for developmental asymmetry in single-cell RNA sequence data. Within this unified framework, we provide interpretable metrics: entropy to capture exploration-exploitation trade-offs, curvature to assess plasticity-elasticity dynamics, and entropy production to characterize dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation. We validate our method across both single-cell and embryonic development datasets, demonstrating its ability to reveal hidden thermodynamic and informational constraints shaping cellular fate decisions.</description>

      <title>Intracellular phagosome shell is rigid enough to transfer outside torque to the inner spherical particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracellular phagosomes have a lipid bilayer encapsulated fluidic shell outside the particle, on the outer side of which, molecular motors are attached. An optically trapped spherical birefringent particle phagosome provides an ideal platform to probe fluidity of the shell, as the inner particle is optically confined both in translation and in rotation. Using a recently reported method to calibrate the translation and pitch rotations - yielding a spatial resolution of about 2 nm and angular resolution of 0.1 degrees - we report novel roto-translational coupled dynamics. We also suggest a new technique where we explore the correlation between the translation and pitch rotation to study extent of activity. Given that a spherical birefringent particle phagosome is almost a sphere, the fact that it turns due to the activity of the motors is not obvious, even implying high rigidity of shell. Applying a minimal model for the roto-translational coupling, we further show that this coupling manifests itself as sustained fluxes in phase space, a signature of broken detailed balance.</description>

      <title>From Radiation Dose to Cellular Dynamics: A Discrete Model for Simulating Cancer Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation therapy is one of the most common cancer treatments, and dose optimization and targeting of radiation are crucial since both cancerous and healthy cells are affected. Different mathematical and computational approaches have been developed for this task. The most common mathematical approach, dating back to the late 1970's, is the linear-quadratic (LQ) model for the survival probability given the radiation dose. Most simulation models consider tissue as a continuum rather than consisting of discrete cells. While reasonable for large scale models, e.g., for human organs, any cellular scale effects become, by necessity, neglected. They do, however, influence growth, morphology, and metastasis of tumors. Here, we propose a method for modeling the effect of radiation on cells based on the mechanobiological \textsc{CellSim3D} simulation model for growth, division, and proliferation of cells. To model the effect of a radiation beam, we incorporate a Monte Carlo procedure into \textsc{CellSim3D} with the LQ model by introducing a survival probability at each beam delivery. Effective removal of dead cells by phagocytosis was also implemented. Systems with two types of cells were simulated: stiff slowly proliferating healthy cells and soft rapidly proliferating cancer cells. For model verification, the results were compared to prostate cancer (PC-3 cell line) data for different doses and we found good agreement. In addition, we simulated proliferating systems and analyzed the probability density of the contact forces. We determined the state of the system with respect to the jamming transition and found very good agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Simple low-dimensional computations explain variability in neuronal activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of neural computation is founded on the assumption that neurons fire in response to a linear summation of inputs. Yet experiments demonstrate that some neurons are capable of complex computations that require interactions between inputs. Here we show, across multiple brain regions and species, that simple computations (without interactions between inputs) explain most of the variability in neuronal activity. Neurons are quantitatively described by models that capture the measured dependence on each input individually, but assume nothing about combinations of inputs. These minimal models, which are equivalent to binary artificial neurons, predict complex higher-order dependencies and recover known features of synaptic connectivity. The inferred computations are low-dimensional, indicating a highly redundant neural code that is necessary for error correction. These results suggest that, despite intricate biophysical details, most neurons perform simple computations typically reserved for artificial models.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field: A Conceptually Novel Approach for Nonadiabatic Quantum Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable trajectory-based nonadiabatic quantum dynamics methods at the atomic level are critical for understanding many important processes in real systems. The paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually novel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories. Substantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and surface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic force arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic states, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic electronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between electronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the relevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and where the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is derived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with coordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed for discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient integrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic representations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF can in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the time correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are applied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark models where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is shown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of the electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable simulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear dynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Integrator Scheme for Sampling the (Quantum) Isobaric-Isothermal Ensemble in (Path Integral) Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because most chemical or biological experiments are performed under conditions of controlled pressure and temperature, it is important to simulate the isobaric-isothermal ensemble at the atomic level to reveal the microscopic mechanism. By extending our configuration sampling protocol for the canonical ensemble, we propose a unified middle scheme to sample the coordinate (configuration) and volume distribution and thereby are able to accurately simulate either classical or quantum isobaric-isothermal processes. Various barostats and thermostats can be employed in the unified middle scheme for simulating real molecular systems with or without holonomic constraints. In particular, we demonstrate the recommended middle scheme by employing the Martyna-Tuckerman-Tobias-Klein barostat and stochastic cell-rescaling barostat, with the Langevin thermostat, in molecular simulation packages (DL_POLY, Amber, Gromacs, etc.). Benchmark numerical tests show that, without additional numerical effort, the middle scheme is competent in increasing the time interval by a factor of 5~10 to achieve the same accuracy of converged results for most thermodynamic properties in (path integral) molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. We consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated with harsh and mild environmental conditions. When the rate of switching is neither too slow nor too fast, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks and the population is prone to fluctuations or extinction. We analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak, and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to what happens in static environments, the fixation probability depends on the migration rate. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and Phase Transitions in the Origins of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The path toward the emergence of life in our biosphere involved several key events allowing for the persistence, reproduction and evolution of molecular systems. All these processes took place in a given environmental context and required both molecular diversity and the right non-equilibrium conditions to sustain and favour complex self-sustaining molecular networks capable of evolving by natural selection. Life is a process that departs from non-life in several ways and cannot be reduced to standard chemical reactions. Moreover, achieving higher levels of complexity required the emergence of novelties. How did that happen? Here, we review different case studies associated with the early origins of life in terms of phase transitions and bifurcations, using symmetry breaking and percolation as two central components. We discuss simple models that allow for understanding key steps regarding life origins, such as molecular chirality, the transition to the first replicators and cooperators, the problem of error thresholds and information loss, and the potential for "order for free" as the basis for the emergence of life.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control in Soft and Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft and active condensed matter represent a class of fascinating materials that we encounter in our everyday lives -- and constitute life itself. Control signals interact with the dynamics of these systems, and this influence is formalized in control theory and optimal control. Recent advances have employed various control-theoretical methods to design desired dynamics, properties, and functionality. Here we provide an introduction to optimal control aimed at physicists working with soft and active matter. We describe two main categories of control, feedforward control and feedback control, and their corresponding optimal control methods. We emphasize their parallels to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and provide a worked example problem. Finally, we review recent studies of control in soft, active, and related systems. Applying control theory to soft, active, and living systems will lead to an improved understanding of the signal processing, information flows, and actuation that underlie the physics of life.</description>
