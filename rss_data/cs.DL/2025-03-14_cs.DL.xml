      <title>Exploring the dynamics of self-citations and their role in shaping scientific impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms driving the distribution of scientific citations is a key challenge in assessing the scientific impact of authors. We investigate the influence of the preferential attachment rule (PAR) in this process by analyzing individual citation events from the DBLP dataset, enabling us to estimate the probability of citations being assigned preferentially. Our findings reveal that, for the aggregated dataset, PAR dominates the citation distribution process, with approximately 70% of citations adhering to this mechanism. However, analysis at the individual level shows significant variability, with some authors experiencing a greater prevalence of preferential citations, particularly in the context of external citations. In contrast, self-citations exhibit notably different behaviour, with only 20% following PAR. We also demonstrate that the prominence of PAR increases with an author's citability (average citations per paper), suggesting that more citable authors are preferentially cited, while less-cited authors experience more random citation patterns. Furthermore, we show that self-citations may influence bibliometric indexes. Our results emphasise the distinct dynamics of self-citations compared to external citations, raising questions about the mechanisms driving self-citation patterns. These findings provide new insights into citation behaviours and highlight the limitations of existing approaches in capturing the nuances of scientific impact.</description>

      <title>Old Experience Helps: Leveraging Survey Methodology to Improve AI Text Annotation Reliability in Social Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for assessing the reliability of Large Language Model (LLM) text annotations in social science research by adapting established survey methodology principles. Drawing parallels between survey respondent behavior and LLM outputs, the study implements three key interventions: option randomization, position randomization, and reverse validation. While traditional accuracy metrics may mask model instabilities, particularly in edge cases, the framework provides a more comprehensive reliability assessment. Using the F1000 dataset in biomedical science and three sizes of Llama models (8B, 70B, and 405B parameters), the paper demonstrates that these survey-inspired interventions can effectively identify unreliable annotations that might otherwise go undetected through accuracy metrics alone. The results show that 5-25% of LLM annotations change under these interventions, with larger models exhibiting greater stability. Notably, for rare categories approximately 50% of "correct" annotations demonstrate low reliability when subjected to this framework. The paper then introduce an information-theoretic reliability score (R-score) based on Kullback-Leibler divergence that quantifies annotation confidence and distinguishes between random guessing and meaningful annotations at the case level. This approach complements existing expert validation methods by providing a scalable way to assess internal annotation reliability and offers practical guidance for prompt design and downstream analysis.</description>

      <title>DeepInnovation AI: A Global Dataset Mapping the AI innovation from Academic Research to Industrial Patents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), mapping innovation patterns and understanding effective technology transfer from research to applications are essential for economic growth. However, existing data infrastructures suffer from fragmentation, incomplete coverage, and insufficient evaluative capacity. Here, we present DeepInnovationAI, a comprehensive global dataset containing three structured files. DeepPatentAI.csv: Contains 2,356,204 patent records with 8 field-specific attributes. DeepDiveAI.csv: Encompasses 3,511,929 academic publications with 13 metadata fields. These two datasets leverage large language models, multilingual text analysis and dual-layer BERT classifiers to accurately identify AI-related content, while utilizing hypergraph analysis to create robust innovation metrics. Additionally, DeepCosineAI.csv: By applying semantic vector proximity analysis, this file presents approximately one hundred million calculated paper-patent similarity pairs to enhance understanding of how theoretical advancements translate into commercial technologies. DeepInnovationAI enables researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to anticipate trends and identify collaboration opportunities. With extensive temporal and geographical scope, it supports detailed analysis of technological development patterns and international competition dynamics, establishing a foundation for modeling AI innovation and technology transfer processes.</description>
