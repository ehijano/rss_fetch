      <title>Quantum fermion superradiance and vacuum ambiguities on charged black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike a classical charged bosonic field, a classical charged fermion field on a static charged black hole does not exhibit superradiant scattering. We demonstrate that the quantum analogue of this classical process is however present. We construct a vacuum state for the fermion field which has no incoming particles from past null infinity, but which contains, at future null infinity, a nonthermal flux of particles. This state describes both the discharge and energy loss of the black hole, and we analyze how the interpretation of this phenomenon depends on the ambiguities inherent in defining the quantum vacuum.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric String Configurations in Ad$\mathbb{S}_5\times \mathbb{S}^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate off-shell supersymmetric string configurations in Euclidean Ad$\mathbb{S}_5\times \mathbb{S}^5$ background. By extending the Green-Schwarz supersymmetric equations using the pure spinor formalism, we demonstrate that while the solutions to the Green-Schwarz equations are necessarily minimal surfaces, the solutions to the extended equations form infinite-dimensional families, even with fixed boundary conditions, thus preventing direct derivations of exact results via supersymmetric localization. For concreteness, we have selected a supercharge that localizes the off-shell supersymmetric configurations to an Ad$\mathbb{S}_4 \times \mathbb{S}^2$ slice and observed that the corresponding action functional reduces to an integral of a two-form.</description>

      <title>Isometries of N=1 4D supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pursue a generalization isometries and Killing equations to N=1 4D supergravity. Continuous symmetries of spacetime such as spatial homogeneity and isotropy are defined in terms of Killing vectors. In supergravity, the metric, or rather the tetrad, is not a standalone entity, but is part of a multiplet containing also the Rarita-Schwinger spinor-vector and some auxiliary fields. Starting with a superfield generalization of the isometry definition in tetrad form, we derive two extensions of the Killing equations for the whole supergravity multiplet; for spatial isotropy, the first one yields a vanishing spinor-vector, whereas the second one admits a nonzero solution by a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ truncation of the Rarita-Schwinger field.</description>

      <title>The enigmatic gravitational partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The saddle point approximation to formal quantum gravitational partition functions has yielded plausible computations of horizon entropy in various settings, but it stands on shaky ground. In this paper we visit some of that shaky ground, address some foundational questions, and describe efforts toward a more solid footing. We focus on the case of de Sitter horizon entropy which, it has been argued, corresponds to the dimension of the Hilbert space of a ball of space surrounded by the cosmological horizon.</description>

      <title>Classical features, Anderson-Higgs mechanism, and unitarity in pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the dimensional reduction is applied to the Lee-Wick electrodynamics in which the classical sources are confined on a spatial plane. As result, the Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics is achieved as a non-local electromagnetism defined in $1+2$ dimensions. The abelian Anderson-Higgs mechanism is so introduced in the Lee-Wick pseudo-electrodynamics through a complex scalar sector in $1+2$ dimensions, breaking spontaneously the $U(1)$-gauge symmetry of the non-local theory. As consequence, the pseudo-Lee-Wick field acquires a light mass, beyond the usual heavy Lee-Wick mass, that is a natural mass parameter of the theory. After the spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place, classical features of the theory are discussed, as the pseudo-Proca-Lee-Wick electrodynamics, with the field equations and conservation laws. The introduction of Lee-Wick fermions also is proposed, in which it opens the discussion of a viable pseudo-Proca-Lee-Wick quantum electrodynamics in $1+2$ dimensions. The unitarity at the tree level of the pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics is discussed through the Optical theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinor bilinears of generalized spinors and their properties are investigated. Generalized Killing and twistor spinor equations are considered and their relations to the equations satisfied by special types of differential forms are found. Killing equation in generalized geometry is written in terms of the generalized covariant derivative and Killing-Yano forms are described in the framework of generalized geometry. Construction of generalized Killing-Yano forms and generalized closed conformal Killing-Yano forms in terms of the spinor bilinears of generalized Killing spinors are determined.</description>

      <title>Sine-Gordon kink lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an extended model with two real scalar fields, $\phi(x,t)$ and $\chi(x,t)$. The first sector is controlled by the sine-Gordon superpotential, while the second field is submitted to the $\chi^4$ one. The fields mutually interact via a nontrivial coupling function $f(\chi)$ that also changes the kinematics of $\phi$. We briefly review the implementation of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) prescription. We then solve the resulting BPS equations for two different interactions $f$. The first one leads to a single kink-kink configuration, while the second one gives rise to a inhomogeneous sine-Gordon kink lattice. We study the linear stability of these new solutions, focusing on their translational modes. We also explore how the strength of the mutual interaction affects the BPS profiles. In particular, we show that a homogeneous lattice with identical kinks is attained in the regime of extremely strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Model-independent results on parity violation in the trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous parity violation in four dimensions would be significant for phenomenology (baryogenesis, gravitational waves) and mathematical physics. Over the past decade, there has been a controversy in the literature as to whether free Weyl fermions give rise to (anomalous) parity violation in the trace of the energy momentum tensor; expressed by the Pontryagin densities $R\tilde R$ and $F\tilde F$ in the gravity and the gauge sector respectively. In Ref.$^1$, we have shown, using path integral methods, that the trace anomaly of a free Weyl fermion does not violate parity (i.e the absence of the Pontryagin density). In a subsequent work$^2$ we came to the stronger conclusion that for any theory compatible with dimensional regularisation, the Pontryagin-terms are equally absent. It is the \textit{finiteness} of the diffeomorphism, the Lorentz and the gauge anomalies that prevents anomalous parity violation.</description>

      <title>Topological QBits in Flux-Quantized Super-Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first give a brief exposition of our recent realization of anyonic quantum states on single M5-brane probes in 11D super-gravity backgrounds, by non-perturbative quantization of the topological sector of the self-dual tensor field on the 6D worldvolume, after its proper flux-quantization. This opens the prospect of holographic models for topological qbits away from the usual but unrealistic limit of large numbers of branes.
  At the same time, the elementary homotopy-theoretic nature of the construction yields a slick expression of topological quantum gates in homotopically-typed programming languages, opening the prospect of topological-hardware aware quantum programming.
  In view of these results, we end with some more meta-physical remarks on (cohesive) homotopy (type) theory in view of emergent fundamental physics and, possibly, M-theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Construction of the superfield action of the $N=(1,0)$, $d=6$ non-Abelian tensor multiplet based on the non-Abelian tensor hierarchies is considered. It is shown that while straightforward non-Abelian generalization of the Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin action is not a workable solution, a suitable truncation of the PST action can be still be modified to include non-Abelian tensor field. In the modified action, the self-dual equation of motion of the tensor field is induced by a composite Lagrange multiplier, which is not a component of a standard dynamical tensor multiplet. As a result, the constraint that enforces the gauge group to be non-compact, as in the usual tensor hierarchies, can be avoided.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein bound on black hole entropy in non-Gaussian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bekenstein bound, inspired by the physics of black holes, is introduced to constrain the entropy growth of a physical system down to the quantum level in the context of a generalized second law of thermodynamics. We first show that the standard Bekenstein bound is violated when the entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole is described in non-Gaussian statistics Barrow, Tsallis, and Kaniadakis due to the presence of the related indices $\Delta$, $q$ and $\kappa$, respectively. Then, by adding the GUP effects into the Bekenstein bound, we find that the generalized bound is satisfied in the context of the mentioned entropies through a possible connection between the entropies indices and the GUP parameter $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Categorical 't Hooft expansion and chiral algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted holography captures protected aspects of well-known holographic dualities. We show how the holographic dual B-model background can be systematically derived from the 't Hooft expansion of the chiral algebras associated to four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theories. A crucial tool is the match of planar BRST anomalies in the field theory and on the worldsheet, especially in the presence of probe D-branes. Our construction is very general and can be applied to chiral algebras which do not have a four-dimensional origin. The resulting holographic dual backgrounds are typically non-geometric and appear to be novel. We expect our strategy to have a wide range of applications to other examples of twisted holography and, potentially, weak coupling holography.</description>

      <title>3d SUSY enhancement and non-semisimple TQFTs from four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that the celebrated SCFT$_4$/VOA$_2$ correspondence can be bridged via three-dimensional field theories arising from a specific R-symmetry twisted circle reduction. We apply this twisted reduction to the $(A_1,A_{n})$ and $(A_1,D_{n})$ families of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas SCFTs using their $\mathcal{N}=1$ Agarwal-Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangians. From $(A_1,A_{2n})$ we derive the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories with SUSY enhancement to $\mathcal{N}=4$ in the infrared, generalizing a recent derivation made in the special cases $n=1,2$. Topological twists of these theories are known to yield $semisimple$ TQFTs supporting $rational$ VOAs on holomorphic boundaries. From $(A_1,A_{2n-1})$, $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$, and $(A_1,D_{2n})$, we obtain three new infinite families of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian gauge theories, all with monopole superpotentials, flowing to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs without Coulomb branch, but with the same non-trivial Higgs branch as the four-dimensional parent. Their topological A-twist yields $non$-$semisimple$ TQFTs related to $logarithmic$ VOAs such as $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}}(2)_{-4/3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduced a phenomenological dark energy model $H^{2}+H^{-2}$ model) that incorporates the first-order approximation of Kaniadakis holographic entropy dark energy and utilizes the Hubble horizon, $1/H$ as the infrared cutoff. The advantage of this model is that it can relieve the Hubble tension issue and cicumventing the potential issue of a "big rip". In this article, we will study the thermodynamics of the model and obtain the corrected temperature. In addition, we found that the model modified the entropy area relationship by adding an area cubic term in addition to the area term.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the scalar field potential in non-metricity gravity through Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe has been widely confirmed, posing challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, particularly the cosmological coincidence problem. This has motivated the exploration of modified gravity theories, including non-metricity gravity, which explains cosmic acceleration without dark energy. In this work, we incorporate a quintessence scalar field into the non-metricity framework to model both inflation and late-time acceleration. Employing the Gaussian process method with a square exponential kernel, we reconstruct the scalar field potential, $V(\phi)$, from observational Hubble data sets coming from cosmic chronometers (CC) as well as from the method of radial baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in a model-independent approach. This approach allows us to obtain a suitable quintessence scalar field model that aligns with the observational Hubble data under the framework of power-law non-metricity gravity. Additionally, we compare our reconstructed potential with power-law scalar field potentials, revealing that these models show better agreement with the observational data, providing new insights into the dynamics of the universe. In contrast, we find that the early dark energy has minimal effect on the present-time accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <title>An Exact Solution for the Kinetic Ising Model with Non-Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of non-equilibrium phenomena in nature involve non-reciprocal interactions. To understand the novel behaviors that can emerge in such systems, finding tractable models is essential. With this goal, we introduce a non-reciprocal generalization of the kinetic Ising model in one dimension and solve it exactly. Our solution uncovers novel properties driven by non-reciprocity, such as underdamped phases, critically damped phases where a system of size $N$ is described by an $N^{th}$-order exceptional point, and wave phenomena influenced by the parity of $N$. Additionally, we examine the low-energy behavior of these systems in various limits, demonstrating that non-reciprocity leads to unique scaling behavior at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>A functional treatment of small instanton-induced axion potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a functional method to perform complete one-instanton calculations of the axion potential. This is done for an $SU(N)$ gauge theory with a matter content in any representation of the gauge group. This type of computation requires the expression of the fermion zero modes of the theory. We construct them for all representations of $SU(2)$, which serve as building blocks for obtaining the fermion zero modes for arbitrary representations of $SU(N)$. The method is applied to the Minimal Supersymmetric $SU(5)$ model and its low-energy counterpart, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model extended with two color triplets.</description>

      <title>Cluster Reductions, Mutations, and $q$-Painlev\'e Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the Goncharov-Kenyon class of cluster integrable systems by their Hamiltonian reductions. This extension allows us to fill in the gap in cluster construction of the $q$-difference Painlev\'e equations, showing that all of them can be obtained as deautonomizations of the reduced Goncharov-Kenyon systems.
  Conjecturally, the isomorphisms of reduced Goncharov-Kenyon integrable systems are given by mutations in another, dual in some sense, cluster structure. These are the polynomial mutations of the spectral curve equations and polygon mutations of the corresponding decorated Newton polygons. In the Painlev\'e case the initial and dual cluster structures are isomorphic. It leads to self-duality between the spectral curve equation and the Painlev\'e Hamiltonian, and also extends the symmetry from affine to elliptic Weyl group.</description>

      <title>$\theta$ dependence of $T_c$ in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the $\theta$ dependence of the confinement-deconfinement transition temperature $T_c$ for the 4d SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory. We perform lattice numerical simulations on three spatial sizes $N_S=24$, $32$, $48$ with a fixed temporal size $N_T=8$. We introduce a non-zero $\theta$-angle by the re-weighting method, which is combined with the sub-volume method to mitigate the sign problem. By taking advantage of the universality in the second order phase transition and the Binder cumulant of the order parameter, the $\theta$-dependence of $T_c$ is determined to be $T_c(\theta)/T_c(0)=1-0.016(3)\,\theta^2+O(\theta^4)$. We point out that the temperature dependence of the topological susceptibility should exhibit a singularity with the exponent for the specific heat.</description>

      <title>Characterizing topological pumping of charges in exactly solvable Rice-Mele chains of the non-Hermitian variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the nature of the Thouless charge-pumping for a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of the one-dimensional (1d) Rice-Mele model, considering a variety which allows closed-form analytical solutions for the eigensystems. The two-band system is subjected to an ``adiabatic'' time-periodic drive, which effectively gives us a closed two-dimensional (2d) manifold in the momentum-frequency space, mimicking a 2d Brillouin zone (BZ) for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we formulate the non-Bloch generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). All these allow us to compute the Chern numbers of the 2d manifolds emerging for various parameter values, using the BZ or GBZ, which are well-defined integers in the gapped regions of the spectra. If Thouless pumping still holds for NH situations, the expectation values of the net displacement for the particles occupying a given band within a cycle, calculated using the right and left eigenvectors of a biorthogonal basis for the complex Hamiltonians, would coincide with the Chern numbers. However, we find that there are deviations from the expected quantized values whenever the spectra exhibit strongly-fluctuating magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the (generically) complex eigenvalues. This implies that we need to address the question of how to meaningfully define time-evolution, as well as adiabaticity, in the context of NH systems.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Second-order Gravitational Waves in Axion-like Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a hybrid inflation model driven by an axion-like particle (ALP) $\phi$. The model predicts a spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.964$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.003$, in agreement with Planck data and potentially testable by next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. We find that the PBH mass and the peak of the associated scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) spectrum are correlated with the ALP mass. In particular, PBHs in the mass range $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ can constitute either the entire dark matter (DM) content of the universe or a significant fraction of it. The predicted second-order GWs from this mechanism are within the sensitivity reach of future observatories like LISA and ET. The typical reheating temperature in the model is around $10^6 - 10^7$ GeV is consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints.</description>

      <title>Gauge coupling jump and small instantons from a large non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a scalar field couples to the Ricci scalar with a large non-minimal coupling, the Standard Model coupling parameters can differ above and below an intermediate field range of the scalar due to the non-renormalizability. In this paper, we study, for the first time, the threshold effects on a gauge coupling in both Metric and Palatini formulations of gravity. We find that the gauge coupling naturally jumps around this intermediate scale since counter terms for the renormalization behave so. If the gauge coupling becomes strong with a large scalar field value due to this effect, there can be an enhanced small instanton contribution, the dilute gas approximation of which is justified because the gauge sector decouples when the scalar wave mode is very short. Using these findings, we discuss the QCD axion quality problem, the heavy QCD axion, the QCD axion abundance, and the suppression of isocurvature perturbations. We show that axion physics may differ substantially from na\"{i}ve expectations when we introduce a large non-minimal coupling for any scalar field.</description>

      <title>Specific Heats for Quantum BTZ Black Holes in Extended Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was shown recently that extended black hole thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant is a dynamical variable, giving rise to a pressure $p$ and its conjugate volume $V$, can be given a natural setting in the context of braneworld models. We study the specific heat capacities $C_p(T)$ and $C_V(T)$ of the quantum version of the BTZ black hole that lives in the induced gravity theory on the brane. There are multiple branches of solutions, and we explore and characterize key features of the possible behaviour. We identify and study a critical point in the space of solutions where both specific heats diverge. In the regime of weak backreaction where we a close to an ordinary theory of gravity, the black hole is "sub-entropic", but as backreaction is increased we note that there are parts of parameter space that has regions where it is "super-entropic". While a study of the sign of the specific heats does not always show a corresponding instability (conjectured in the literature), the presence of strong backreaction makes interpretation unclear.</description>

      <title>Infrared finite scattering theory: Amplitudes and soft theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any non-trivial scattering with massless fields in four spacetime dimensions will generically produce an out-state with memory. Scattering with any massless fields violates the standard assumption of asymptotic completeness -- that all "in" and "out" states lie in the standard (zero memory) Fock space -- and therefore leads to infrared (IR) divergences in the standard $S$-matrix amplitudes. In this paper we define an infrared finite scattering theory which assumes only (1) the existence of in/out algebras and (2) that Heisenberg evolution is an automorphism of these algebras. The resulting "superscattering" map $\$$ allows for transitions between different in/out memory states and agrees with the standard $S$-matrix when it is defined. We construct $\$$-amplitudes by defining (3) a "generalized asymptotic completeness" which accommodates states with memory in the space of asymptotic states and (4) a complete basis of improper states which generalize the usual $n$-particle momentum basis to account for states with memory. Using only general properties of $\$$, we prove an analog of the Weinberg soft theorems in quantum gravity and QED which imply that all $\$$-amplitudes are well-defined in the infrared. We comment on how one must generalize this framework to consider $\$$-amplitudes for theories with collinear divergences (e.g., massless QED and Yang-Mills theories).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quark-gluon plasma at nonzero density by using two holographic models for QCD based on either brane or Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton actions. We determine the parameters of these models through a systematic statistical fitting procedure to lattice QCD data, which encompasses the equation of state (through the entropy density) and the two lowest baryon number susceptibilities. The predictions from the two models for the higher-order susceptibilities and the equation of state at nonzero density are strikingly similar. In particular, both models suggest the presence of a critical point on the $(\mu_B,T)$-phase diagram near $\mu_B/T \approx 6$. The results for the equation of state are in agreement with lattice data for higher-order susceptibilities and experimental data for the cumulants of the net-proton number from the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the decomposition of gauge-theory amplitudes into kinematic and color factors, the color factors (at a given loop order $L$) span a proper subspace of the extended trace space (which consists of single and multiple traces of generators of the gauge group, graded by powers of $N$). Using an iterative process, we systematically construct the $L$-loop color space of four-point amplitudes of fields in the adjoint representation of SU($N$), SO($N$), or Sp($N$). We define the null space as the orthogonal complement of the color space. For SU($N$), we confirm the existence of four independent null vectors (for $L \ge 2$) and for SO($N$) and Sp($N$), we establish the existence of seventeen independent null vectors (for $L \ge 5$). Each null vector corresponds to a group-theory constraint on the color-ordered amplitudes of the gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the S-matrix bootstrap analysis of theories with non-invertible symmetries in (1+1) dimensions. Our previous work showed that crossing symmetry of S-matrices in such theories is modified, with modification characterized by the fusion category data. By imposing unitarity, symmetry and the modified crossing, we constrain the space of consistent S-matrices, identifying integrable theories with non-invertible symmetries at the cusps of allowed regions. We also extend the modified crossing rules to cases where vacua transform in non-regular representations of fusion category, utilizing a connection to a dual category $\mathscr C^{*}_{\mathscr{M}}$ and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This highlights the utility of SymTFT in the analysis of scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: We derive a cutting rule for equal-time in-in correlators including cosmological correlators based on Keldysh $r/a$ basis, which decomposes diagrams into fully retarded functions and cut-propagators consisting of Wightman functions. Our derivation relies only on basic assumptions such as unitarity, locality, and the causal structure of the in-in formalism, and therefore holds for theories with arbitrary particle contents and local interactions at any loop order. As an application, we show that non-local cosmological collider signals arise solely from cut-propagators under the assumption of microcausality. Since the cut-propagators do not contain (anti-)time-ordering theta functions, the conformal time integrals are factorized, simplifying practical calculations.</description>

The relevant symmetries, the unitary symplectic group $USp(8)$ and the exceptional group $E_6$, are both presented in light-cone superspace and their connections with $SU(8)$ and $E_7$ highlighted. We explain a procedure to derive higher-point interaction vertices in both the 4- and 5-dimensional supergravity theories using exclusively the exceptional symmetries. Specific forms for the quartic and quintic interaction vertices in light-cone superspace are derived.</description>

Abstract: By considering the basis-covariant constituents of N-Higgs-doublet potentials, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for canonical SO(4)_C Custodial Symmetry (CS) of potentials with N&gt;2 doublets, based on representation-theoretical and geometrical relations. In essence, our characterization relates the presence of canonical CS to basis-covariant vectors corresponding to particular bases of the defining representation of the orthogonal Lie algebras. For N=3,4 and 5, the conditions demand little computational effort to be evaluated, and we provide practical algorithms that may be efficiently implemented in a computer program, for deciding whether or not a potential is custodial-symmetric.</description>

Abstract: We compare light propagation through an intense electromagnetic background as described by three different nonlinear electrodynamics: Born-Infeld (BI), Euler-Heisenberg (EH), and Modified Maxwell (MM). We use the concept of effective metric to determine the phase velocities of a propagating wave from the BI and EH nonlinear electrodynamics and use them to set constraints on the MM nonlinear parameter. In a second part of the paper, we consider the black hole solutions of the nonlinear electrodynamics coupled with General Relativity and determine the shadows cast by the static black holes. Confronting the observations of the shadows of M87$^*$ and Sagittarius A$^*$ with our theoretical results allows us to set restrictions on the nonlinear parameters.</description>

Abstract: Magic is the quantum resource allowing a quantum computer to perform operations that cannot be simulated efficiently by classical computation. As such, generating magic in a quantum system is crucial for achieving quantum advantage. This letter shows that magic can be harvested by a three-level Unruh-DeWitt detector (a qutrit) interacting with a quantum field in an initial vacuum state. While the idea of extracting resources from Quantum Field Theories (QFT) was born from the harvesting of entanglement, our result extends the protocol to evolve a qutrit from a non-magical state to a magical one, making it possible to generate magic from QFT.</description>
