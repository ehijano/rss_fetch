      <title>Metric Distortion of Line-up Elections: The Right Person for the Right Job</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide mechanisms and new metric distortion bounds for line-up elections. In such elections, a set of $n$ voters, $k$ candidates, and $\ell$ positions are all located in a metric space. The goal is to choose a set of candidates and assign them to different positions, so as to minimize the total cost of the voters. The cost of each voter consists of the distances from itself to the chosen candidates (measuring how much the voter likes the chosen candidates, or how similar it is to them), as well as the distances from the candidates to the positions they are assigned to (measuring the fitness of the candidates for their positions). Our mechanisms, however, do not know the exact distances, and instead produce good outcomes while only using a smaller amount of information, resulting in small distortion.
  We consider several different types of information: ordinal voter preferences, ordinal position preferences, and knowing the exact locations of candidates and positions, but not those of voters. In each of these cases, we provide constant distortion bounds, thus showing that only a small amount of information is enough to form outcomes close to optimum in line-up elections.</description>

      <title>Comparing Ways of Obtaining Candidate Orderings from Approval Ballots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand and summarize approval preferences and other binary evaluation data, it is useful to order the items on an axis which explains the data. In a political election using approval voting, this could be an ideological left-right axis such that each voter approves adjacent candidates, an analogue of single-peakedness. In a perfect axis, every approval set would be an interval, which is usually not possible, and so we need to choose an axis that gets closest to this ideal. The literature has developed algorithms for optimizing several objective functions (e.g., minimize the number of added approvals needed to get a perfect axis), but provides little help with choosing among different objectives. In this paper, we take a social choice approach and compare 5 different axis selection rules axiomatically, by studying the properties they satisfy. We establish some impossibility theorems, and characterize (within the class of scoring rules) the rule that chooses the axes that maximize the number of votes that form intervals, using the axioms of ballot monotonicity and resistance to cloning. Finally, we study the behavior of the rules on data from French election surveys, on the votes of justices of the US Supreme Court, and on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Prosumer Policies in Periodic Double Auctions Inspired by Equilibrium Analysis (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a periodic double auction (PDA) wherein the main participants are wholesale suppliers and brokers representing retailers. The suppliers are represented by a composite supply curve and the brokers are represented by individual bids. Additionally, the brokers can participate in small-scale selling by placing individual asks; hence, they act as prosumers. Specifically, in a PDA, the prosumers who are net buyers have multiple opportunities to buy or sell multiple units of a commodity with the aim of minimizing the cost of buying across multiple rounds of the PDA. Formulating optimal bidding strategies for such a PDA setting involves planning across current and future rounds while considering the bidding strategies of other agents. In this work, we propose Markov perfect Nash equilibrium (MPNE) policies for a setup where multiple prosumers with knowledge of the composite supply curve compete to procure commodities. Thereafter, the MPNE policies are used to develop an algorithm called MPNE-BBS for the case wherein the prosumers need to re-construct an approximate composite supply curve using past auction information. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the PowerTAC wholesale market simulator against several baselines and state-of-the-art bidding policies.</description>

      <title>Competition between self- and other-regarding preferences in resolving social dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory assumes that individuals maximize their benefits when choosing strategies. However, an alternative perspective proposes that individuals seek to maximize the benefits of others. To explore the relationship between these perspectives, we develop a model where self- and other-regarding preferences compete in public goods games. We find that other-regarding preferences are more effective in promoting cooperation, even when self-regarding preferences are more productive. Cooperators with different preferences can coexist in a new phase where two classic solutions invade each other, resulting in a dynamical equilibrium. As a consequence, a lower productivity of self-regarding cooperation can provide a higher cooperation level. Our results, which are also valid in a well-mixed population, may explain why other-regarding preferences could be a viable and frequently observed attitude in human society.</description>

      <title>Continuity, Uniqueness and Long-Term Behavior of Nash Flows Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic model of traffic that has received a lot of attention in the past few years. Users control infinitesimal flow particles aiming to travel from an origin to a destination as quickly as possible. Flow patterns vary over time, and congestion effects are modeled via queues, which form whenever the inflow into a link exceeds its capacity. Despite lots of interest, some very basic questions remain open in this model. We resolve a number of them:
  - We show uniqueness of journey times in equilibria.
  - We show continuity of equilibria: small perturbations to the instance or to the traffic situation at some moment cannot lead to wildly different equilibrium evolutions.
  - We demonstrate that, assuming constant inflow into the network at the source, equilibria always settle down into a "steady state" in which the behavior extends forever in a linear fashion.
  One of our main conceptual contributions is to show that the answer to the first two questions, on uniqueness and continuity, are intimately connected to the third. To resolve the third question, we substantially extend the approach of Cominetti et al., who show a steady-state result in the regime where the input flow rate is smaller than the network capacity.</description>

      <title>A Game Theoretic Analysis of Validator Strategies in Ethereum 2.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ethereum 2.0 is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and a widely used smart contract platform. Therefore, examining the reliability of Ethereum 2.0's incentive mechanism is crucial, particularly its effectiveness in encouraging validators to adhere to the Ethereum 2.0's protocol. This paper studies the incentive mechanism of Ethereum 2.0 and evaluates its robustness by analyzing the interaction between block proposers and attesters in a single slot. To this end, we use Bayesian games to model the strategies of block proposers and attesters and calculate their expected utilities. Our results demonstrate that the Ethereum 2.0 incentive mechanism is incentive-compatible and promotes cooperation among validators. We prove that a Bayesian Nash equilibrium and an ex ante dominant strategy exist between the block proposer and attesters in a single slot. Our research provides a solid foundation for further analysis of Ethereum 2.0's incentive mechanism and insights for individuals considering participation as a validator in Ethereum 2.0.</description>

      <title>Value Approximation for Two-Player General-Sum Differential Games with State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) PDEs numerically enables equilibrial feedback control in two-player differential games, yet faces the curse of dimensionality (CoD). While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in alleviating CoD in solving PDEs, vanilla PINNs fall short in learning discontinuous solutions due to their sampling nature, leading to poor safety performance of the resulting policies when values are discontinuous due to state or temporal logic constraints. In this study, we explore three potential solutions to this challenge: (1) a hybrid learning method that is guided by both supervisory equilibria and the HJI PDE, (2) a value-hardening method where a sequence of HJIs are solved with increasing Lipschitz constant on the constraint violation penalty, and (3) the epigraphical technique that lifts the value to a higher dimensional state space where it becomes continuous. Evaluations through 5D and 9D vehicle and 13D drone simulations reveal that the hybrid method outperforms others in terms of generalization and safety performance by taking advantage of both the supervisory equilibrium values and costates, and the low cost of PINN loss gradients.</description>
