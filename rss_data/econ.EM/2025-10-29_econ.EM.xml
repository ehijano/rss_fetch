      <title>Dynamic Spatial Treatment Effects and Network Fragility: Theory and Evidence from European Banking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops and empirically implements a continuous functional framework for analyzing systemic risk in financial networks, building on the dynamic spatial treatment effect methodology established in our previous studies. We extend the Navier-Stokes-based approach from our previous studies to characterize contagion dynamics in the European banking system through the spectral properties of network evolution operators. Using high-quality bilateral exposure data from the European Banking Authority Transparency Exercise (2014-2023), we estimate the causal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on network fragility using spatial difference-in-differences methods adapted from our previous studies. Our empirical analysis reveals that COVID-19 elevated network fragility, measured by the algebraic connectivity $\lambda_2$ of the system Laplacian, by 26.9% above pre-pandemic levels (95% CI: [7.4%, 46.5%], p&lt;0.05), with effects persisting through 2023. Paradoxically, this occurred despite a 46% reduction in the number of banks, demonstrating that consolidation increased systemic vulnerability by intensifying interconnectedness-consistent with theoretical predictions from continuous spatial dynamics. Our findings validate the key predictions from \citet{kikuchi2024dynamical}: treatment effects amplify over time through spatial spillovers, consolidation increases fragility when coupling strength rises, and systems exhibit structural hysteresis preventing automatic reversion to pre-shock equilibria. The results demonstrate the empirical relevance of continuous functional methods for financial stability analysis and provide new insights for macroprudential policy design. We propose network-based capital requirements targeting spectral centrality and stress testing frameworks incorporating diffusion dynamics to address the coupling externalities identified in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Dual-Channel Technology Diffusion: Spatial Decay and Network Contagion in Supply Chain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a dual-channel framework for analyzing technology diffusion that integrates spatial decay mechanisms from continuous functional analysis with network contagion dynamics from spectral graph theory. Building on our previous studies, which establish Navier-Stokes-based approaches to spatial treatment effects and financial network fragility, we demonstrate that technology adoption spreads simultaneously through both geographic proximity and supply chain connections. Using comprehensive data on six technologies adopted by 500 firms over 2010-2023, we document three key findings. First, technology adoption exhibits strong exponential geographic decay with spatial decay rate $\kappa \approx 0.043$ per kilometer, implying a spatial boundary of $d^* \approx 69$ kilometers beyond which spillovers are negligible (R-squared = 0.99). Second, supply chain connections create technology-specific networks whose algebraic connectivity ($\lambda_2$) increases 300-380 percent as adoption spreads, with correlation between $\lambda_2$ and adoption exceeding 0.95 across all technologies. Third, traditional difference-in-differences methods that ignore spatial and network structure exhibit 61 percent bias in estimated treatment effects. An event study around COVID-19 reveals that network fragility increased 24.5 percent post-shock, amplifying treatment effects through supply chain spillovers in a manner analogous to financial contagion documented in our recent study. Our framework provides micro-foundations for technology policy: interventions have spatial reach of 69 kilometers and network amplification factor of 10.8, requiring coordinated geographic and supply chain targeting for optimal effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Inference on Welfare and Value Functionals under Optimal Treatment Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide theoretical results for the estimation and inference of a class of welfare and value functionals of the nonparametric conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function under optimal treatment assignment, i.e., treatment is assigned to an observed type if and only if its CATE is nonnegative. For the optimal welfare functional defined as the average value of CATE on the subpopulation with nonnegative CATE, we establish the $\sqrt{n}$ asymptotic normality of the semiparametric plug-in estimators and provide an analytical asymptotic variance formula. For more general value functionals, we show that the plug-in estimators are typically asymptotically normal at the 1-dimensional nonparametric estimation rate, and we provide a consistent variance estimator based on the sieve Riesz representer, as well as a proposed computational procedure for numerical integration on submanifolds. The key reason underlying the different convergence rates for the welfare functional versus the general value functional lies in that, on the boundary subpopulation for whom CATE is zero, the integrand vanishes for the welfare functional but does not for general value functionals. We demonstrate in Monte Carlo simulations the good finite-sample performance of our estimation and inference procedures, and conduct an empirical application of our methods on the effectiveness of job training programs on earnings using the JTPA data set.</description>

      <title>Agentic Economic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Agentic Economic Modeling (AEM), a framework that aligns synthetic LLM choices with small-sample human evidence for reliable econometric inference. AEM first generates task-conditioned synthetic choices via LLMs, then learns a bias-correction mapping from task features and raw LLM choices to human-aligned choices, upon which standard econometric estimators perform inference to recover demand elasticities and treatment effects.We validate AEM in two experiments. In a large scale conjoint study with millions of observations, using only 10% of the original data to fit the correction model lowers the error of the demand-parameter estimates, while uncorrected LLM choices even increase the errors. In a regional field experiment, a mixture model calibrated on 10% of geographic regions estimates an out-of-domain treatment effect of -65\pm10 bps, closely matching the full human experiment (-60\pm8 bps).Under time-wise extrapolation, training with only day-one human data yields -24 bps (95% CI: [-26, -22], p&lt;1e-5),improving over the human-only day-one baseline (-17 bps, 95% CI: [-43, +9], p=0.2049).These results demonstrate AEM's potential to improve RCT efficiency and establish a foundation method for LLM-based counterfactual generation.</description>

      <title>Latent Factor Analysis in Short Panels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a pseudo maximum likelihood method for latent factor analysis in short panels without imposing sphericity nor Gaussianity. We derive an asymptotically uniformly most powerful invariant test for the number of factors. On a large panel of monthly U.S. stock returns, we separate month after month systematic and idiosyncratic risks in short subperiods of bear vs. bull market. We observe an uptrend in the paths of total and idiosyncratic volatilities. The systematic risk explains a large part of the cross-sectional total variance in bear markets but is not driven by a single factor and not spanned by observed factors.</description>

      <title>Compositional difference-in-differences for categorical outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In difference-in-differences (DiD) settings with categorical outcomes, such as voting, occupation, or major choices, treatments often affect both total counts (e.g., turnout) and category shares (e.g., vote shares). Traditional linear DiD models can yield invalid counterfactuals in this context (e.g., negative values) and lack compatibility with standard discrete choice models. I propose Compositional DiD (CoDiD), which identifies counterfactual totals and shares under a parallel growths assumption: absent treatment, each category's size grows or shrinks at the same proportional rate in treated and control groups. I show that under a random utility model, this is equivalent to parallel trends in expected utilities, i.e., the change in average latent desirability for each alternative is identical across groups. Consequently, relative preferences (e.g., how individuals prefer Democrat vs. Republican) evolve in parallel, and counterfactual distributions follow parallel trajectories in the probability simplex. I extend CoDiD to (i) derive bounds under relaxed assumptions, (ii) accommodate staggered treatment timing, and (iii) construct a synthetic DiD analog. I illustrate the method's empirical relevance through two applications: first, I examine how early voting reforms affect voter choice in U.S. presidential elections; second, I analyze how the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) affected the electricity mix in participating states.</description>

      <title>Variable selection in convex nonparametric least squares via structured Lasso: An application to the Swedish electricity distribution networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of variable selection in convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS). Whereas the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) is a popular technique for least squares, its variable selection performance is unknown in CNLS problems. In this work, we investigate the performance of the Lasso estimator and find out it is usually unable to select variables efficiently. Exploiting the unique structure of the subgradients in CNLS, we develop a structured Lasso method by combining $\ell_1$-norm and $\ell_{\infty}$-norm. The relaxed version of the structured Lasso is proposed for achieving model sparsity and predictive performance simultaneously, where we can control the two effects--variable selection and model shrinkage--using separate tuning parameters. A Monte Carlo study is implemented to verify the finite sample performance of the proposed approaches. We also use real data from Swedish electricity distribution networks to illustrate the effects of the proposed variable selection techniques. The results from the simulation and application confirm that the proposed structured Lasso performs favorably, generally leading to sparser and more accurate predictive models, relative to the conventional Lasso methods in the literature.</description>
