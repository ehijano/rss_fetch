      <title>Term-sparse polynomial optimization for the design of frame structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates an efficient solution to two fundamental problems in topology optimization of frame structures. The first one involves minimizing structural compliance under linear-elastic equilibrium and weight constraint, while the second one minimizes the weight under compliance constraints. These problems are non-convex and generally challenging to solve globally, with the non-convexity concentrated in a polynomial matrix inequality. We solve these problems using the moment-sum-of-squares (mSOS) hierarchy and improve the scalability by enhancing (mSOS) with the Term Sparsity Pattern (TSP) technique. Additionally, we exploit the unique polynomial structure of our problems by adopting a reduced monomial basis containing only non-mixed terms. These modifications significantly enhance computational efficiency. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves global solutions for instances twice as large as those previously solved while substantially accelerating the solution process.</description>

      <title>Minimum reflux calculation for multicomponent distillation in multi-feed, multi-product columns: Algorithms and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first algorithm for identifying the minimum reboiler vapor duty requirement for a general multi-feed, multi-product (MFMP) distillation column separating ideal multicomponent mixtures. This algorithm incorporates our latest advancement in developing the first shortcut model for MFMP columns. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this algorithm through case studies. The results obtained from these case studies also provide valuable insights on optimal design of MFMP columns. Many of these insights are against the existing design guidelines and heuristics. For example, placing a colder saturated feed stream above a hotter saturated feed stream sometimes leads to higher energy requirement. Furthermore, decomposing a general MFMP column into individual simple columns may lead to incorrect estimation of the minimum reflux ratio for the MFMP column. Thus, the algorithm presented here offers a fast, accurate, and automated approach to synthesize new, energy-efficient, and cost-effective MFMP columns.</description>

      <title>A new insight into Lagrange duality on DC optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new Lagrange dual problem associated to a primal DC optimization problem under the additivity condition (AC). As usual for DC programming, even weak duality is not guaranteed for free and, due to this issue, we investigate conditions not only for weak, but also for strong duality between this dual and the primal DC problem. In addition, we also analyze conditions for strong duality between the primal and its standard Lagrange dual problem utilizing a revisited regularity condition which is guaranteed by a more general class of functions than the one used in a prior work (see [14]).</description>

      <title>A Hopf-Lax Type Formula for Multi-Agent Path Planning with Pattern Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for a multi-agent path planning problem with pattern coordination based on dynamic programming and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. This falls broadly into the class of partial differential equation (PDE) based optimal path planning methods, which give a black-box-free alternative to machine learning hierarchies. Due to the high-dimensional state space of multi-agent planning problems, grid-based methods for PDE which suffer from the curse of dimensionality are infeasible, so we instead develop grid-free numerical methods based on variational Hopf-Lax type representations of solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi Equations. Our formulation is amenable to nonlinear dynamics and heterogeneous agents. We apply our method to synthetic examples wherein agents navigate around obstacles while attempting to maintain a prespecified formation, though with small changes it is likely applicable to much larger classes of problems.</description>

      <title>A parallel branch-and-bound-and-prune algorithm for irregular strip packing with discrete rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The irregular strip-packing problem consists of the computation of a non-overlapping placement of a set of polygons onto a rectangular strip of fixed width and the minimal length possible. Recent performance gains of the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solvers have encouraged the proposal of exact optimization models for nesting. The Dotted-Board (DB) MILP model solves the discrete version of the nesting problem by constraining the positions of the polygons to be on a grid of fixed points. However, its number of non-overlapping constraints grows exponentially with the number of dots and types of polygons, which encouraged the proposal of a reformulation called the DB Clique Covering (DB-CC) that sets the current state-of-the-art by significantly reducing the constraints required. However, DB-CC requires a significant preprocessing time to compute edge and vertex clique coverings. Moreover, current knowledge of the stable set polytope suggests that achieving a tighter formulation is unlikely. Thus, our hypothesis is that an ad-hoc exact algorithm requiring no preprocessing might be a better option to solve the DB model than the costly Branch-and-Cut approach. This work proposes an exact branch-and-bound-and-prune algorithm to solve the DB model from the conflict inverse graph based on ad-hoc data structures, bounding, and forward-checking for pruning the search space. We introduce two 0-1 ILP DB reformulations with discrete rotations and a new lower-bound algorithm as by-products. Our experiments show that DB-PB significantly reduces the resolution time compared to our replication of the DB-CC model. Seventeen open instances are solved up to optimality.</description>

      <title>A dynamic model of congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classic problem of determining optimal routes in a graph for transporting two given distributions defined on its nodes, originally studied by Wardrop and Beckmann in the 1950s. The global congestion profile at any given time defines a dynamic metric on the graph, for which the routes must be geodesics. Our first contribution is the introduction of a dynamic version of the Beckmann problem, for which we derive the corresponding discrete partial differential equations governing the evolution of the system. These equations enable us to estimate the size of the support of the edge flow. Finally, we present some numerical simulations to illustrate the behavior of efficient equilibria in a dynamic setting with non-local interactions.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Conjugate Subgradient Algorithm for Two-stage Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Optimization is a cornerstone of operations research, providing a framework to solve optimization problems under uncertainty. Despite the development of numerous algorithms to tackle these problems, several persistent challenges remain, including: (i) selecting an appropriate sample size, (ii) determining an effective search direction, and (iii) choosing a proper step size. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework, the Stochastic Conjugate Subgradient (SCS) framework, designed to systematically address these challenges. Specifically, The SCS framework offers structured approaches to determining the sample size, the search direction, and the step size. By integrating various stochastic algorithms within the SCS framework, we have developed a novel stochastic algorithm for two-stage stochastic programming. The convergence and convergence rates of the algorithm have been rigorously established, with preliminary computational results support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Assessing emission certification schemes for grid-connected hydrogen in Australia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certification of low emissions products is crucial to ensure that they can attract a "green premium" in international markets but need to be designed so that they do not impose undue regulatory burden or drive-up production costs. In this work, we employ energy system modelling to evaluate how different policy choices affect the cost and certified emissions of hydrogen produced by grid-connected electrolysers in Australia. As a major exporter of energy and ores, Australia has ambitions to become a 'renewable energy superpower' by providing commodities with low embedded emissions. Our analysis shows that emissions are not always accurately accounted for under the currently proposed Australian methodologies. However, imposing geographic correlation and relatively relaxed temporal correlation requirements on the use of renewable energy certificates could be sufficient to ensure minimal emissions at low cost. Our findings provide evidence to assist in the design of robust and practical certification schemes.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity Learning of Reduced Order Models for Parabolic PDE Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article builds on the recently proposed RB-ML-ROM approach for parameterized parabolic PDEs and proposes a novel hierarchical Trust Region algorithm for solving parabolic PDE constrained optimization problems. Instead of using a traditional offline/online splitting approach for model order reduction, we adopt an active learning or enrichment strategy to construct a multi-fidelity hierarchy of reduced order models on-the-fly during the outer optimization loop. The multi-fidelity surrogate model consists of a full order model, a reduced order model and a machine learning model. The proposed hierarchical framework adaptively updates its hierarchy when querying parameters, utilizing a rigorous a posteriori error estimator in an error aware trust region framework. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Robust Mean Estimation for Optimization: The Impact of Heavy Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing a least conservative estimator of the expected value $\mu$ of a non-negative heavy-tailed random variable. We require that the probability of overestimating the expected value $\mu$ is kept appropriately small; a natural requirement if its subsequent use in a decision process is anticipated. In this setting, we show it is optimal to estimate $\mu$ by solving a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We further show that the statistical properties of KL-DRO compare favorably with other estimators based on truncation, variance regularization, or Wasserstein DRO.</description>

      <title>Mechanostat-type effective density correction for Carter-Hayes growth applied to topology optimization and its efficient interpolation for a target strain energy and volume fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for optimized structures with good mechanical performance for the minimum weight is common in industry. Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) is a Topology Optimization (TO) method offering a trade-off between minimum compliance (i.e., maximum stiffness) and a fixed material amount for a given set of boundary conditions. Since TO is a non-convex problem, its gradient can be tuned by filtering the topology's contour, creating sharper material profiles without necessarily compromising optimality. However, despite simplifying the layout, some filters fail to address manufacturability concerns such as capillarity (thin tweaks as struts) generated by uncertain loading, vibration or fatigue.
  A tailored density-based filtering strategy is offered to tackle this issue. Additionally, volume fraction is left unconstrained so material can be strategically replenished through a logarithmic rule acting on the updated compliance. In doing so, an interpolation space with three degrees of freedom (volume, compliance, minimum thickness) is created, yielding diverse topologies for the same boundary conditions and design values along different stages of evolving topological families with distinct features.
  The optimization process is further accelerated by introducing the volume-compliance iterative scheme as a physical loss function in a Double Distance Neural Network (D$^2$NN), obtaining similar results to 2,000 steps worth of vanilla iteration within 500 training epochs. This proposal offers a novel topology optimization design space based on minimum strut thickness - via filtering - and topological families defined by minimum volume fraction and compliance. The methodology is tested on several examples with diverse loading and boundary conditions, obtaining similarly satisfactory results, and then boosted via Machine Learning, acting as a fast and cheap surrogate.</description>

      <title>Formation Shape Control using the Gromov-Wasserstein Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a formation shape control algorithm, in the optimal control framework, for steering an initial population of agents to a desired configuration via employing the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. The underlying dynamical system is assumed to be a constrained linear system and the objective function is a sum of quadratic control-dependent stage cost and a Gromov-Wasserstein terminal cost. The inclusion of the Gromov-Wasserstein cost transforms the resulting optimal control problem into a well-known NP-hard problem, making it both numerically demanding and difficult to solve with high accuracy. Towards that end, we employ a recent semi-definite relaxation-driven technique to tackle the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. A numerical example is provided to illustrate our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a globalized inexact semismooth Newton method applied to strongly convex optimization problems in Hilbert spaces. Here, the semismooth Newton method is appplied to the dual problem, which has a continuously differentiable objective. We prove global strong convergence of iterates as well as transition to local superlinear convergence. The latter needs a second-order Taylor expansion involving semismooth derivative concepts. The convergence of the globalized method is demonstrated in numerical examples, for which the local unglobalized method diverges.</description>

      <title>Penalty decomposition derivative free method for the minimization of partially separable functions over a convex feasible set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing a smooth function, given as finite sum of black-box functions, over a convex set. In order to advantageously exploit the structure of the problem, for instance when the terms of the objective functions are partially separable, noisy, costly or with first-order information partially accessible, we propose a framework where the penalty decomposition approach is combined with a derivative-free line search-based method. Under standard assumptions, we state theoretical results showing that the proposed algorithm is well-defined and globally convergent to stationary points. The results of preliminary numerical experiments, performed on test problems with number of variables up to thousands, show the validity of the proposed method compared with a standard derivative-free line search algorithm. Moreover, it is shown that the method is easily parallelizable and hence capable of taking advantage of parallelization of computation, when possible.</description>

      <title>FERERO: A Flexible Framework for Preference-Guided Multi-Objective Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding specific preference-guided Pareto solutions that represent different trade-offs among multiple objectives is critical yet challenging in multi-objective problems. Existing methods are restrictive in preference definitions and/or their theoretical guarantees. In this work, we introduce a Flexible framEwork for pREfeRence-guided multi-Objective learning (FERERO) by casting it as a constrained vector optimization problem. Specifically, two types of preferences are incorporated into this formulation -- the relative preference defined by the partial ordering induced by a polyhedral cone, and the absolute preference defined by constraints that are linear functions of the objectives. To solve this problem, convergent algorithms are developed with both single-loop and stochastic variants. Notably, this is the first single-loop primal algorithm for constrained vector optimization to our knowledge. The proposed algorithms adaptively adjust to both constraint and objective values, eliminating the need to solve different subproblems at different stages of constraint satisfaction. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method is very competitive in finding preference-guided optimal solutions. Code is available at https://github.com/lisha-chen/FERERO/.</description>

      <title>Local Stability and Stabilization of Quadratic-Bilinear Systems using Petersen's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic-bilinear (QB) systems arise in many areas of science and engineering. In this paper, we present a scalable approach for designing locally stabilizing state-feedback control laws and certifying the local stability of QB systems. Sufficient conditions are established for local stability and stabilization based on quadratic Lyapunov functions, which also provide ellipsoidal inner-estimates for the region of attraction and region of stabilizability of an equilibrium point. Our formulation exploits Petersen's Lemma to convert the problem of certifying the sign-definiteness of the Lyapunov condition into a line search over a single scalar parameter. The resulting linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions scale quadratically with the state dimension for both stability analysis and control synthesis, thus enabling analysis and control of QB systems with hundreds of state variables without resorting to specialized implementations. We demonstrate the approach on three benchmark problems from the existing literature. In all cases, we find our formulation yields comparable approximations of stability domains as determined by other established tools that are otherwise restricted to systems with up to tens of state variables.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy-Logic-based model predictive control: A paradigm integrating optimal and common-sense decision making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel concept, fuzzy-logic-based model predictive control (FLMPC), along with a multi-robot control approach for exploring unknown environments and locating targets. Traditional model predictive control (MPC) methods rely on Bayesian theory to represent environmental knowledge and optimize a stochastic cost function, often leading to high computational costs and lack of effectiveness in locating all the targets. Our approach instead leverages FLMPC and extends it to a bi-level parent-child architecture for enhanced coordination and extended decision making horizon. Extracting high-level information from probability distributions and local observations, FLMPC simplifies the optimization problem and significantly extends its operational horizon compared to other MPC methods. We conducted extensive simulations in unknown 2-dimensional environments with randomly placed obstacles and humans. We compared the performance and computation time of FLMPC against MPC with a stochastic cost function, then evaluated the impact of integrating the high-level parent FLMPC layer. The results indicate that our approaches significantly improve both performance and computation time, enhancing coordination of robots and reducing the impact of uncertainty in large-scale search and rescue environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning for Entropy-regularized Markov Decision Processes via Multilevel Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient learning algorithms with complexity guarantees for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with large or continuous state and action spaces remains a fundamental challenge. We address this challenge for entropy-regularized MDPs with Polish state and action spaces, assuming access to a generative model of the environment. We propose a novel family of multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) algorithms that integrate fixed-point iteration with MLMC techniques and a generic stochastic approximation of the Bellman operator. We quantify the precise impact of the chosen approximate Bellman operator on the accuracy of the resulting MLMC estimator. Leveraging this error analysis, we show that using a biased plain MC estimate for the Bellman operator results in quasi-polynomial sample complexity, whereas an unbiased randomized multilevel approximation of the Bellman operator achieves polynomial sample complexity in expectation. Notably, these complexity bounds are independent of the dimensions or cardinalities of the state and action spaces, distinguishing our approach from existing algorithms whose complexities scale with the sizes of these spaces. We validate these theoretical performance guarantees through numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the generation of theoretical correlation matrices with specific sparsity patterns, associated to graph structures. We present a novel approach based on convex optimization, offering greater flexibility compared to existing techniques, notably by controlling the mean of the entry distribution in the generated correlation matrices. This allows for the generation of correlation matrices that better represent realistic data and can be used to benchmark statistical methods for graph inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of detecting adjoint mismatch for two linear maps. To clarify, this means that we aim to calculate the operator norm for the difference of two linear maps, where for one we only have a black-box implementation for the evaluation of the map, and for the other we only have a black-box for the evaluation of the adjoint map. We give two stochastic algorithms for which we prove the almost sure convergence to the operator norm. The algorithm is a random search method for a generalization of the Rayleigh quotient and uses optimal step sizes. Additionally, a convergence analysis is done for the corresponding singular vector and the respective eigenvalue equation.</description>

Abstract: Multiple local steps are key to communication-efficient federated learning. However, theoretical guarantees for such algorithms, without data heterogeneity-bounding assumptions, have been lacking in general non-smooth convex problems. Leveraging projection-efficient optimization methods, we propose FedMLS, a federated learning algorithm with provable improvements from multiple local steps. FedMLS attains an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution in $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ communication rounds, requiring a total of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ stochastic subgradient oracle calls.</description>

      <title>LQG Risk-Sensitive Single-Agent and Major-Minor Mean-Field Game Systems: A Variational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15364v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a variational approach to address risk-sensitive optimal control problems with an exponential-of-integral cost functional in a general linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) single-agent setup, offering new insights into such problems. Our analysis leads to the derivation of a nonlinear necessary and sufficient condition of optimality, expressed in terms of martingale processes. Subject to specific conditions, we find an equivalent risk-neutral measure, under which a linear state feedback form can be obtained for the optimal control. It is then shown that the obtained feedback control is consistent with the imposed condition and remains optimal under the original measure. Building upon this development, we (i) propose a variational framework for general LQG risk-sensitive mean-field games (MFGs) and (ii) advance the LQG risk-sensitive MFG theory by incorporating a major agent in the framework. The major agent interacts with a large number of minor agents, and unlike the minor agents, its influence on the system remains significant even with an increasing number of minor agents. We derive the Markovian closed-loop best-response strategies of agents in the limiting case where the number of agents goes to infinity. We establish that the set of obtained best-response strategies yields a Nash equilibrium in the limiting case and an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in the finite-player case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a multi-class traffic model, for which we computationally assess the ability of mean-field games (MFGs) to yield approximate Nash equilibria for traffic flow games of intractable large finite-players. We introduce ad hoc numerical methodologies, with recourse to techniques such as High-Performance Computing (HPC) and regularization of Loose Generalized Minimal Residual (LGMRES) solvers. The developed apparatus allows us to perform simulations at significantly larger space and time discretization scales. For three generic scenarios of cars and trucks, and three cost functionals, we provide numerous numerical results related to the autonomous vehicles (AVs) traffic dynamics, which corroborate for the multi-class case the effectiveness of the approach emphasized in [22]. We additionally provide several original comparisons of macroscopic Nash mean-field speeds with their microscopic versions, allowing us to computationally validate the so-called $\epsilon-$Nash approximation, with a rate slightly better than theoretically expected.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Methods for Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex optimization encompasses a wide range of optimization problems that contain many efficiently solvable subclasses. Interior point methods are currently the state-of-the-art approach for solving such problems, particularly effective for classes like semidefinite programming, quadratic programming, and geometric programming. However, their success hinges on the construction of self-concordant barrier functions for feasible sets. In this work, we investigate and develop a homotopy-based approach to solve convex optimization problems. While homotopy methods have been considered in optimization before, their potential for general convex programs remains underexplored. This approach gradually transforms the feasible set of a trivial optimization problem into the target one while tracking solutions by solving a differential equation, in contrast to traditional central path methods. We establish a criterion that ensures that the homotopy method correctly solves the optimization problem and prove the existence of such homotopies for several important classes, including semidefinite and hyperbolic programs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach numerically outperforms state-of-the-art methods in hyperbolic programming, highlighting its practical advantages.</description>

      <title>Butterfly factorization with error guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the butterfly factorization problem, i.e., the problem of approximating a matrix by a product of sparse and structured factors. We propose a new formal mathematical description of such factors, that encompasses many different variations of butterfly factorization with different choices of the prescribed sparsity patterns. Among these supports, we identify those that ensure that the factorization problem admits an optimum, thanks to a new property called ``chainability''. For those supports we propose a new butterfly algorithm that yields an approximate solution to the butterfly factorization problem and that is supported by stronger theoretical guarantees than existing factorization methods. Specifically, we show that the ratio of the approximation error by the minimum value is bounded by a constant, independent of the target matrix.</description>

      <title>Progressive hedging for multi-stage stochastic lot sizing problems with setup carry-over under uncertain demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate multi-stage demand uncertainty for the multi-item multi-echelon capacitated lot sizing problem with setup carry-over. Considering a multi-stage decision framework helps to quantify the benefits of being able to adapt decisions to newly available information. The drawback is that multi-stage stochastic optimization approaches lead to very challenging formulations. This is because they usually rely on scenario tree representations of the uncertainty, which grow exponentially in the number of decision stages. Thus, even for a moderate number of decision stages it becomes difficult to solve the problem by means of a compact optimization model. To address this issue, we propose a progressive hedging algorithm and we investigate and tune the crucial penalty parameter that influences the conflicting goals of fast convergence and solution quality. While low penalty parameters usually lead to high quality solutions, this comes at the cost of slow convergence. To tackle this problem, we adapt metaheuristic adjustment strategies to guide the algorithm towards a consensus more efficiently. Furthermore, we consider several options to compute the consensus solution. While averaging the subproblem decisions is a common choice, we also apply a majority voting procedure. We test different algorithm configurations and compare the results of progressive hedging to the solutions obtained by solving a compact optimization model on well-known benchmark instances. For several problem instances the progressive hedging algorithm converges to solutions within 1% of the cost of the compact model's solution, while requiring shorter runtimes.</description>

      <title>A scalable sequential adaptive cubic regularization algorithm for optimization with general equality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scalable adaptive cubic regularization method ($\mathrm{ARC_{q}K}$: Dussault et al. in Math. Program. Ser. A 207(1-2):191-225, 2024) has been recently proposed for unconstrained optimization. It has excellent convergence properties, complexity, and promising numerical performance. In this paper, we extend $\mathrm{ARC_{q}K}$ to large scale nonlinear optimization with general equality constraints and propose a scalable sequential adaptive cubic regularization algorithm named $\mathrm{SSARC_{q}K}$. In each iteration, we construct an ARC subproblem with linearized constraints inspired by sequential quadratic optimization methods. Then composite-step approach is used to decompose the trial step into the sum of the vertical step and the horizontal step. By means of reduced-Hessian approach, we rewrite the linearity constrained ARC subproblem as a standard unconstrained ARC subproblem to compute the horizontal step. A CG-Lanczos procedure with shifts is employed to solve this subproblem approximately. We provide a new global convergence analysis of the inexact ARC method. Preliminary numerical results are reported to show the performance of $\mathrm{SSARC_{q}K}$.</description>

      <title>Analytical Strategies and Winning Conditions for Elliptic-Orbit Target-Attacker-Defender Game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an analytical framework for the orbital Target-Attacker-Defender game with a non-maneuvering target along elliptic orbits. Focusing on the linear quadratic game, we derive an analytical solution to the matrix Riccati equation, which yields analytical Nash-equilibrium strategies for all players. Based on the analytical strategies, we derive the analytical form of the necessary and sufficient winning conditions for the attacker. The simulation results show good consistency between the analytical and numerical methods, exhibiting 0.004$\%$ relative error in the cost function. The analytical method achieves over 99.9$\%$ reduction in CPU time compared to the conventional numerical method, strengthening the advantage of developing the analytical strategies. Furthermore, we verify the proposed winning conditions and investigate the effects of eccentricity on the game outcomes. Our analysis reveals that for games with hovering initial states, the initial position of the defender should be constrained inside a mathematically definable set to ensure that the attacker wins the game. This constrained set furthermore permits geometric interpretation through our proposed framework. This work establishes the analytical framework for orbital Target-Attacker-Defender games, providing fundamental insights into the solution analysis of the game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to generate, protect and control GKP qubits. It employs a microwave frequency comb parametrically modulating a Josephson circuit to enforce a dissipative dynamics of a high impedance circuit mode, autonomously stabilizing the finite-energy GKP code. The encoded GKP qubit is robustly protected against all dominant decoherence channels plaguing superconducting circuits but quasi-particle poisoning. In particular, noise from ancillary modes leveraged for dissipation engineering does not propagate at the logical level. In a state-of-the-art experimental setup, we estimate that the encoded qubit lifetime could extend two orders of magnitude beyond the break-even point, with substantial margin for improvement through progress in fabrication and control electronics. Qubit initialization, readout and control via Clifford gates can be performed while maintaining the code stabilization, paving the way toward the assembly of GKP qubits in a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture.</description>

      <title>Quantization-aware Matrix Factorization for Low Bit Rate Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lossy image compression is essential for efficient transmission and storage. Traditional compression methods mainly rely on discrete cosine transform (DCT) or singular value decomposition (SVD), both of which represent image data in continuous domains and, therefore, necessitate carefully designed quantizers. Notably, these methods consider quantization as a separate step, where quantization errors cannot be incorporated into the compression process. The sensitivity of these methods, especially SVD-based ones, to quantization errors significantly degrades reconstruction quality. To address this issue, we introduce a quantization-aware matrix factorization (QMF) to develop a novel lossy image compression method. QMF provides a low-rank representation of the image data as a product of two smaller factor matrices, with elements constrained to bounded integer values, thereby effectively integrating quantization with low-rank approximation. We propose an efficient, provably convergent iterative algorithm for QMF using a block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme, with subproblems having closed-form solutions. Our experiments on the Kodak and CLIC 2024 datasets demonstrate that our QMF compression method consistently outperforms JPEG at low bit rates below 0.25 bits per pixel (bpp) and remains comparable at higher bit rates. We also assessed our method's capability to preserve visual semantics by evaluating an ImageNet pre-trained classifier on compressed images. Remarkably, our method improved top-1 accuracy by over 5 percentage points compared to JPEG at bit rates under 0.25 bpp. The project is available at https://github.com/pashtari/lrf .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a bootstrap method that combines stationary state conditions, thermal inequalities, and semidefinite relaxations of matrix logarithm in the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, at finite rank N as well as in the large N limit, and determine finite temperature observables that interpolate between available analytic results in the low and high temperature limits respectively. We also obtain bootstrap bounds on thermal phase transition as well as preliminary results in the ungauged two-matrix quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Society Caused by Collective and Individual Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00471</link>

Abstract: Decision-making societies may vary in their level of cooperation and degree of conservatism, both of which influence their overall performance. Moreover, these factors are not fixed -- they can change based on the decisions agents in the society make in their interests. But can these changes lead to cyclical patterns in societal evolution? To explore this question, we use the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model. In this framework, the level of cooperation can be measured by group size, while the degree of conservatism is determined by the voting threshold. Agents can adopt either individualistic or group-oriented strategies when voting on stochastically generated external proposals. For Gaussian proposal generators, the expected capital gain (ECG) -- a measure of agents' performance -- can be expressed in standard mathematical functions. Our findings show that in neutral environments, societal evolution with open or democratic groups can follow cyclic patterns. We also find that highly conservative societies or conservative societies with low levels of cooperation can evolve into liberal (less conservative than majoritarian) societies and that mafia groups never let their members go when they want to.</description>

      <title>Follow-the-Regularized-Leader with Adversarial Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO) can be seen as a generalization of the standard Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework. At each round, a cost function and constraint function are revealed after a learner chooses an action. The goal is to minimize both the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) against an adaptive adversary. We show for the first time that is possible to obtain the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on both regret and CCV, improving the best known bounds of $O \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ and $\~{O} \left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ for the regret and CCV, respectively.</description>

      <title>DR-PETS: Learning-Based Control With Planning in Adversarial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring robustness against epistemic, possibly adversarial, perturbations is essential for reliable real-world decision-making. While the Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling (PETS) algorithm inherently handles uncertainty via ensemble-based probabilistic models, it lacks guarantees against structured adversarial or worst-case uncertainty distributions. To address this, we propose DR-PETS, a distributionally robust extension of PETS that certifies robustness against adversarial perturbations. We formalize uncertainty via a p-Wasserstein ambiguity set, enabling worst-case-aware planning through a min-max optimization framework. While PETS passively accounts for stochasticity, DR-PETS actively optimizes robustness via a tractable convex approximation integrated into PETS planning loop. Experiments on pendulum stabilization and cart-pole balancing show that DR-PETS certifies robustness against adversarial parameter perturbations, achieving consistent performance in worst-case scenarios where PETS deteriorates.</description>
