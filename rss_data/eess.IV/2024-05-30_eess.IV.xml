      <title>TotalSegmentator MRI: Sequence-Independent Segmentation of 59 Anatomical Structures in MR images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop an open-source and easy-to-use segmentation model that can automatically and robustly segment most major anatomical structures in MR images independently of the MR sequence.
  Materials and Methods: In this study we extended the capabilities of TotalSegmentator to MR images. 298 MR scans and 227 CT scans were used to segment 59 anatomical structures (20 organs, 18 bones, 11 muscles, 7 vessels, 3 tissue types) relevant for use cases such as organ volumetry, disease characterization, and surgical planning. The MR and CT images were randomly sampled from routine clinical studies and thus represent a real-world dataset (different ages, pathologies, scanners, body parts, sequences, contrasts, echo times, repetition times, field strengths, slice thicknesses and sites). We trained an nnU-Net segmentation algorithm on this dataset and calculated Dice similarity coefficients (Dice) to evaluate the model's performance.
  Results: The model showed a Dice score of 0.824 (CI: 0.801, 0.842) on the test set, which included a wide range of clinical data with major pathologies. The model significantly outperformed two other publicly available segmentation models (Dice score, 0.824 versus 0.762; p&lt;0.001 and 0.762 versus 0.542; p&lt;0.001). On the CT image test set of the original TotalSegmentator paper it almost matches the performance of the original TotalSegmentator (Dice score, 0.960 versus 0.970; p&lt;0.001).
  Conclusion: Our proposed model extends the capabilities of TotalSegmentator to MR images. The annotated dataset (https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11367004) and open-source toolkit (https://www.github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator) are publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Landmark-aware Network for Automated Cobb Angle Estimation Using X-ray Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Cobb angle estimation based on X-ray images plays an important role in scoliosis diagnosis, treatment, and progression surveillance. The inadequate feature extraction and the noise in X-ray images are the main difficulties of automated Cobb angle estimation, and it is challenging to ensure that the calculated Cobb angle meets clinical requirements. To address these problems, we propose a Landmark-aware Network named LaNet with three components, Feature Robustness Enhancement Module (FREM), Landmark-aware Objective Function (LOF), and Cobb Angle Calculation Method (CACM), for automated Cobb angle estimation in this paper. To enhance feature extraction, FREM is designed to explore geometric and semantic constraints among landmarks, thus geometric and semantic correlations between landmarks are globally modeled, and robust landmark-based features are extracted. Furthermore, to mitigate the effect of background noise on landmark localization, LOF is proposed to focus more on the foreground near the landmarks and ignore irrelevant background pixels by exploiting category prior information of landmarks. In addition, we also advance CACM to locate the bending segments first and then calculate the Cobb angle within the bending segment, which facilitates the calculation of the clinical standardized Cobb angle. The experiment results on the AASCE dataset demonstrate that our proposed LaNet can significantly improve the Cobb angle estimation performance and outperform other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Identifying Functional Brain Networks of Spatiotemporal Wide-Field Calcium Imaging Data via a Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) that records neural calcium dynamics allows for identification of functional brain networks (FBNs) in mice that express genetically encoded calcium indicators. Estimating FBNs from WFCI data is commonly achieved by use of seed-based correlation (SBC) analysis and independent component analysis (ICA). These two methods are conceptually distinct and each possesses limitations. Recent success of unsupervised representation learning in neuroimage analysis motivates the investigation of such methods to identify FBNs. In this work, a novel approach referred as LSTM-AER, is proposed in which a long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder (AE) is employed to learn spatial-temporal latent embeddings from WFCI data, followed by an ordinary least square regression (R) to estimate FBNs. The goal of this study is to elucidate and illustrate, qualitatively and quantitatively, the FBNs identified by use of the LSTM-AER method and compare them to those from traditional SBC and ICA. It was observed that spatial FBN maps produced from LSTM-AER resembled those derived by SBC and ICA while better accounting for intra-subject variation, data from a single hemisphere, shorter epoch lengths and tunable number of latent components. The results demonstrate the potential of unsupervised deep learning-based approaches to identifying and mapping FBNs.</description>

      <title>FourierMamba: Fourier Learning Integration with State Space Models for Image Deraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image deraining aims to remove rain streaks from rainy images and restore clear backgrounds. Currently, some research that employs the Fourier transform has proved to be effective for image deraining, due to it acting as an effective frequency prior for capturing rain streaks. However, despite there exists dependency of low frequency and high frequency in images, these Fourier-based methods rarely exploit the correlation of different frequencies for conjuncting their learning procedures, limiting the full utilization of frequency information for image deraining. Alternatively, the recently emerged Mamba technique depicts its effectiveness and efficiency for modeling correlation in various domains (e.g., spatial, temporal), and we argue that introducing Mamba into its unexplored Fourier spaces to correlate different frequencies would help improve image deraining. This motivates us to propose a new framework termed FourierMamba, which performs image deraining with Mamba in the Fourier space. Owning to the unique arrangement of frequency orders in Fourier space, the core of FourierMamba lies in the scanning encoding of different frequencies, where the low-high frequency order formats exhibit differently in the spatial dimension (unarranged in axis) and channel dimension (arranged in axis). Therefore, we design FourierMamba that correlates Fourier space information in the spatial and channel dimensions with distinct designs. Specifically, in the spatial dimension Fourier space, we introduce the zigzag coding to scan the frequencies to rearrange the orders from low to high frequencies, thereby orderly correlating the connections between frequencies; in the channel dimension Fourier space with arranged orders of frequencies in axis, we can directly use Mamba to perform frequency correlation and improve the channel information representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our project proposes an end-to-end 3D face alignment and reconstruction network. The backbone of our model is built by Bottle-Neck structure via Depth-wise Separable Convolution. We integrate Coordinate Attention mechanism and Spatial Group-wise Enhancement to extract more representative features. For more stable training process and better convergence, we jointly use Wing loss and the Weighted Parameter Distance Cost to learn parameters for 3D Morphable model and 3D vertices. Our proposed model outperforms all baseline models both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Landslide mapping from Sentinel-2 imagery through change detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landslides are one of the most critical and destructive geohazards. Widespread development of human activities and settlements combined with the effects of climate change on weather are resulting in a high increase in the frequency and destructive power of landslides, making them a major threat to human life and the economy. In this paper, we explore methodologies to map newly-occurred landslides using Sentinel-2 imagery automatically. All approaches presented are framed as a bi-temporal change detection problem, requiring only a pair of Sentinel-2 images, taken respectively before and after a landslide-triggering event. Furthermore, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture for fusing Sentinel-2 bi-temporal image pairs with Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, showcasing its promising performances w.r.t. other change detection models in the literature. As a parallel task, we address limitations in existing datasets by creating a novel geodatabase, which includes manually validated open-access landslide inventories over heterogeneous ecoregions of the world. We release both code and dataset with an open-source license.</description>

      <title>CV-VAE: A Compatible Video VAE for Latent Generative Video Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal compression of videos, utilizing networks such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE), plays a crucial role in OpenAI's SORA and numerous other video generative models. For instance, many LLM-like video models learn the distribution of discrete tokens derived from 3D VAEs within the VQVAE framework, while most diffusion-based video models capture the distribution of continuous latent extracted by 2D VAEs without quantization. The temporal compression is simply realized by uniform frame sampling which results in unsmooth motion between consecutive frames. Currently, there lacks of a commonly used continuous video (3D) VAE for latent diffusion-based video models in the research community. Moreover, since current diffusion-based approaches are often implemented using pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, directly training a video VAE without considering the compatibility with existing T2I models will result in a latent space gap between them, which will take huge computational resources for training to bridge the gap even with the T2I models as initialization. To address this issue, we propose a method for training a video VAE of latent video models, namely CV-VAE, whose latent space is compatible with that of a given image VAE, e.g., image VAE of Stable Diffusion (SD). The compatibility is achieved by the proposed novel latent space regularization, which involves formulating a regularization loss using the image VAE. Benefiting from the latent space compatibility, video models can be trained seamlessly from pre-trained T2I or video models in a truly spatio-temporally compressed latent space, rather than simply sampling video frames at equal intervals. With our CV-VAE, existing video models can generate four times more frames with minimal finetuning. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed video VAE.</description>

      <title>Fast Low Rank column-wise Compressive Sensing for Accelerated Dynamic MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops a novel set of algorithms, alternating Gradient Descent (GD) and minimization for MRI (altGDmin-MRI1 and altGDmin-MRI2), for accelerated dynamic MRI by assuming an approximate low-rank (LR) model on the matrix formed by the vectorized images of the sequence. The LR model itself is well-known in the MRI literature; our contribution is the novel GD-based algorithms which are much faster, memory efficient, and general compared with existing work; and careful use of a 3-level hierarchical LR model. By general, we mean that, with a single choice of parameters, our method provides accurate reconstructions for multiple accelerated dynamic MRI applications, multiple sampling rates and sampling schemes.
  We show that our methods outperform many of the popular existing approaches while also being faster than all of them, on average. This claim is based on comparisons on 8 different retrospectively under sampled multi-coil dynamic MRI applications, sampled using either 1D Cartesian or 2D pseudo radial under sampling, at multiple sampling rates. Evaluations on some prospectively under sampled datasets are also provided. Our second contribution is a mini-batch subspace tracking extension that can process new measurements and return reconstructions within a short delay after they arrive. The recovery algorithm itself is also faster than its batch counterpart.</description>

      <title>CL-MRI: Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning to Improve the Accuracy of Undersampled MRI Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), image acquisitions are often undersampled in the measurement domain to accelerate the scanning process, at the expense of image quality. However, image quality is a crucial factor that influences the accuracy of clinical diagnosis; hence, high-quality image reconstruction from undersampled measurements has been a key area of research. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have emerged as the state-of-the-art for MRI reconstruction, typically involving deep neural networks to transform undersampled MRI images into high-quality MRI images through data-driven processes. Nevertheless, there is clear and significant room for improvement in undersampled DL MRI reconstruction to meet the high standards required for clinical diagnosis, in terms of eliminating aliasing artifacts and reducing image noise. In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining procedure using contrastive learning to improve the accuracy of undersampled DL MRI reconstruction. We use contrastive learning to transform the MRI image representations into a latent space that maximizes mutual information among different undersampled representations and optimizes the information content at the input of the downstream DL reconstruction models. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy across a range of acceleration factors and datasets, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, our extended experiments validate the proposed framework's robustness under adversarial conditions, such as measurement noise, different k-space sampling patterns, and pathological abnormalities, and also prove the transfer learning capabilities on MRI datasets with completely different anatomy. Additionally, we conducted experiments to visualize and analyze the properties of the proposed MRI contrastive learning latent space.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Latent Energy-Based Style Translation: An Image-Level Structural MRI Harmonization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been extensively employed across clinical and research fields, but often exhibits sensitivity to site effects arising from non-biological variations such as differences in field strength and scanner vendors. Numerous retrospective MRI harmonization techniques have demonstrated encouraging outcomes in reducing the site effects at the image level. However, existing methods generally suffer from high computational requirements and limited generalizability, restricting their applicability to unseen MRIs. In this paper, we design a novel disentangled latent energy-based style translation (DLEST) framework for unpaired image-level MRI harmonization, consisting of (a) site-invariant image generation (SIG), (b) site-specific style translation (SST), and (c) site-specific MRI synthesis (SMS). Specifically, the SIG employs a latent autoencoder to encode MRIs into a low-dimensional latent space and reconstruct MRIs from latent codes. The SST utilizes an energy-based model to comprehend the global latent distribution of a target domain and translate source latent codes toward the target domain, while SMS enables MRI synthesis with a target-specific style. By disentangling image generation and style translation in latent space, the DLEST can achieve efficient style translation. Our model was trained on T1-weighted MRIs from a public dataset (with 3,984 subjects across 58 acquisition sites/settings) and validated on an independent dataset (with 9 traveling subjects scanned in 11 sites/settings) in four tasks: histogram and feature visualization, site classification, brain tissue segmentation, and site-specific structural MRI synthesis. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method over several state-of-the-arts.</description>

Abstract: No-reference image- and video-quality metrics are widely used in video processing benchmarks. The robustness of learning-based metrics under video attacks has not been widely studied. In addition to having success, attacks that can be employed in video processing benchmarks must be fast and imperceptible. This paper introduces an Invisible One-Iteration (IOI) adversarial attack on no reference image and video quality metrics. We compared our method alongside eight prior approaches using image and video datasets via objective and subjective tests. Our method exhibited superior visual quality across various attacked metric architectures while maintaining comparable attack success and speed. We made the code available on GitHub: https://github.com/katiashh/ioi-attack.</description>

      <title>Serpent: Scalable and Efficient Image Restoration via Multi-scale Structured State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional fluorescence microscopy is constrained by inherent trade-offs among resolution, field-of-view, and system complexity. To navigate these challenges, we introduce a simple and low-cost computational multi-aperture miniature microscope, utilizing a microlens array for single-shot wide-field, high-resolution imaging. Addressing the challenges posed by extensive view multiplexing and non-local, shift-variant aberrations in this device, we present SV-FourierNet, a novel multi-channel Fourier neural network. SV-FourierNet facilitates high-resolution image reconstruction across the entire imaging field through its learned global receptive field. We establish a close relationship between the physical spatially-varying point-spread functions and the network's learned effective receptive field. This ensures that SV-FourierNet has effectively encapsulated the spatially-varying aberrations in our system, and learned a physically meaningful function for image reconstruction. Training of SV-FourierNet is conducted entirely on a physics-based simulator. We showcase wide-field, high-resolution video reconstructions on colonies of freely moving C. elegans and imaging of a mouse brain section. Our computational multi-aperture miniature microscope, augmented with SV-FourierNet, represents a major advancement in computational microscopy and may find broad applications in biomedical research and other fields requiring compact microscopy solutions.</description>

Abstract: Removing rain artifacts in images is recognized as a significant issue. In this field, deep learning-based approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have succeeded. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) have exhibited superior performance across various tasks in both natural language processing and image processing due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. This study introduces SSM to rain removal and proposes a Deraining Frequency-Enhanced State Space Model (DFSSM). To effectively remove rain streaks, which produce high-intensity frequency components in specific directions, we employ frequency domain processing concurrently with SSM. Additionally, we develop a novel mixed-scale gated-convolutional block, which uses convolutions with multiple kernel sizes to capture various scale degradations effectively and integrates a gating mechanism to manage the flow of information.
