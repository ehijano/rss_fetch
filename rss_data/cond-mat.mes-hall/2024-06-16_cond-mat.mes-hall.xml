      <title>Universal scaling of Green's functions in disordered non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization leads to various intriguing phenomena concerning spectrums and wavefunctions. Here, we study the linear response of disordered non-Hermitian systems, which is precisely described by the Green's function. We find that the average maximum value of matrix elements of Green's functions, which quantifies the maximum response against an external perturbation, exhibits different phases characterized by different scaling behaviors with respect to the system size. Whereas the exponential-growth phase is also seen in the translation-invariant systems, the algebraic-growth phase is unique to disordered non-Hermitian systems. We explain the findings using the large deviation theory, which provides analytical insights into the algebraic scaling factors of non-Hermitian disordered Green's functions. Furthermore, we show that these scaling behaviors can be observed in the steady states of disordered open quantum systems, offering a quantum-mechanical avenue for their experimental detection. Our work highlights an unexpected interplay between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetism and Topology of the Higher Flat Band in a Fractional Chern Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in moir\'e fractional Chern insulators (FCI) provides opportunities for investigating zero magnetic field anyons. So far, both experimental and theoretical results suggest that filling &gt; 1/3 FCI states in the first Chern band share features with those of the lowest Landau level (LL). To create the possibility of realizing non-Abelian anyons, one route is to engineer higher flat Chern bands that mimic higher LLs. Here, we investigate the interaction, topology, and ferromagnetism of the second moir\'e miniband in twisted MoTe2 bilayer (tMoTe2). Around filling factor v = -3, i.e., half-filling of the second miniband, we uncover spontaneous ferromagnetism and an incipient Chern insulator state. By measuring the anomalous Hall effect as a function of twist angle, we find that the Chern numbers (C) of the top two moir\'e flat bands have opposite sign (C = -+1) at twist angles above 3.1{\deg} but the same sign (C = -1) around 2.6{\deg}. This observation is consistent with the recently predicted twist-angle dependent band topology, resulting from the competition between moir\'e ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity. As we increase the magnetic field, only the small twist-angle device (2.6{\deg}) experiences a topological phase transition with an emergent C = -2 state. This is attributed to a Zeeman field-induced band crossing between opposite valleys, with the determined C = -1 for the top two bands. Our results lay a firm foundation for understanding the higher flat Chern bands, which is essential for the prediction or discovery of non-Abelian FCIs.</description>

      <title>Gate voltage modulation of the superconducting state in a degenerate semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the modulation of carrier density can alter the superconducting transition temperature by up to $204$ mK in epitaxial Indium Nitride on Gallium Nitride, accounting for the $10$% of the transition temperature in ungated conditions. Our samples are likely free from strong localization effects and significant granularity, as indicated by $( k_{f l} \gg 1 )$, suggesting that the primary determinant of the transition temperature in InN is carrier density, rather than disorder scattering. The observed behavior is consistent with BCS s-wave superconductivity, corroborated by the superconducting parameters we measured. Furthermore, we observed a $60$% bipolar suppression of the supercurrent in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Polariton assisted incoherent to coherent excitation energy transfer between colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of energy transfer between two nanocrystal quantum dots placed within an optical microcavity. By adjusting the coupling strength between the cavity photon mode and the quantum dots, we have the capacity to fine-tune the effective coupling between the donor and acceptor. Introducing a nonadiabatic parameter, $\gamma$, governed by the coupling to the cavity mode, we demonstrate the system's capability to shift from the overdamped Forster regime ($\gamma \ll 1$) to an underdamped coherent regime ($\gamma \gg 1$). In the latter regime, characterized by swift energy transfer rates, the dynamics are influenced by decoherence times. To illustrate this, we study the exciton energy transfer dynamics between two closely positioned CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots with sizes and separations relevant to experimental conditions. Employing an atomistic approach, we calculate the excitonic level arrangement, exciton-phonon interactions, and transition dipole moments of the quantum dots within the microcavity. These parameters are then utilized to define a model Hamiltonian. Subsequently, we apply a generalized non-Markovian quantum Redfield equation to delineate the dynamics within the polaritonic framework.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial twisted bilayer chiral excitonic systems: F\"{o}rster coupling and related Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bilayers composed of monolayers of two-dimensional semiconductors with arbitrary twisting angles, an effective excitonic system can be established based on the valley excitons of each layer. Instead of direct interlayer hopping, a pronounced F\"{o}rster coupling connects intralayer excitons in different layers, which modifies the energy of the monolayer excitonic system. Surprisingly, two new types of Hall effect recently discovered in electric systems-the time-reversal even charge Hall effect (TREHE) and the crossed nonlinear dynamical Hall effect (CNDHE)-can occur in these systems due to the chiral structure induced by the twist of two layers. We illustrate this point by employing a general theoretical framework to establish the effective excitonic Hamiltonians in twisted homo-bilayer systems composed of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) and black phosphorus (BP), calculating the Hall effect in these systems as examples. Regarding the TREHE, our calculations show that it depends on the anisotropy of excitons, resulting in a negligible Hall conductivity for TMD without strain due to the isotropic excitons, but a large Hall conductivity for TMD with chiral symmetric excitons induced by strain. Meanwhile, BP exhibits a finite Hall conductivity due to its high anisotropy. As for the CNDHE, only the specific value of twisted angles can induce a significant Hall conductivity in BP and TMD with strain. This work uncovers nontrivial physical properties of twisted bilayer chiral excitonic systems and provides new opportunities for valley exciton optoelectronics in the layer degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Interplay between topology and correlations in the second moir\'e band of twisted bilayer MoTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological flat bands formed in two-dimensional lattice systems offer unique opportunity to study the fractional phases of matter in the absence of an external magnetic field. Celebrated examples include fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects and fractional topological insulators. Recently, FQAH effects have been experimentally realized in both the twisted bilayer MoTe2 (tMoTe2) system and the rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene/hBN moir\'e systems. To date, experimental studies mainly focus on the first moir\'e flat band, except a very recent work that reported the evidence of the integer and fractional quantum spin Hall effects in higher moir\'e bands of a 2.1{\deg} tMoTe2 device. Here, we present the systematical transport study of approximately 3{\deg} tMoTe2 devices, especially for the second moir\'e band. At {\nu} = -2 and -4, time-reversal-symmetric single and double quantum spin Hall states formed, consistent with the previous observation in 2.1{\deg} tMoTe2 device. On the other hand, we observed ferromagnetism in the second moir\'e band, and a Chern insulator state driven by out-of-plane magnetic fields at {\nu} = -3. At {\nu} = -2.5, nonmonotonic temperature dependence of resistivity and large out-of-plane negative magnetoresistance have been observed, which likely arises from the frustrated liquid-like ground state and weak effective Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions. Applying out-of-plane electric field can induce quantum phase transitions at both integer and fractional filling factors. Our studies pave the way for realizing tunable topological states and other unexpected magnetic phases beyond the first moir\'e flat band based on twisted MoTe2 platform.</description>

      <title>Loop unitary and phase band topological invariant in generic multi-band Chern insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quench dynamics of topological phases have been studied in the past few years and dynamical topological invariants are formulated in different ways. Yet most of these invariants are limited to minimal systems in which Hamiltonians are expanded by Gamma matrices. Here we generalize the dynamical 3-winding-number in two-band systems into the one in generic multi-band Chern insulators and prove that its value is equal to the difference of Chern numbers between post-quench and pre-quench Hamiltonians. Moreover we obtain an expression of this dynamical 3-winding-number represented by gapless fermions in phase bands depending only on the phase and its projectors, so it is generic for the quench of all multi-band Chern insulators. Besides, we obtain a multifold fermion in the phase band in (k, t) space by quenching a three-band model, which cannot happen for two band models.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar and dipolar excitons in symmetric trilayer heterostructures: Insights from first principles theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in van der Waals heterostructures come in many different forms. In bilayer structures, the electron and hole may be localized on the same layer or they may be separated forming an interlayer exciton with a finite out-of-plane dipole moment. Using first principles calculations, we investigate the excitons in a symmetric WS$_2$/MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ heterostructure in the presence of a vertical electric field. The excitons exhibit a quadratic Stark shift for low field strengths and a linear Stark shift for stronger fields. This behaviour is traced to the coupling of interlayer excitons with opposite dipole moments, which lead to the formation of quadrupolar excitons at small fields. The formation of quadrupolar excitons is determined by the relative size of the electric field-induced splitting of the dipolar excitons and the coupling between them given by the hole tunneling across the MoS$_2$ layer. For the inverted structure, MoS$_2$/WS$_2$/MoS$_2$, the dipolar excitons are coupled by electron tunneling across the WS$_2$ layer. Because this effect is much weaker, the resulting quadrupolar excitons are more fragile and break at a weaker electric field.</description>

Abstract: The magneto-optical transport of gapless type-I tilted-single Weyl semimetals exhibits suppression of total magnetoconductivities in the presence of orbital magnetic moment in linear and non-linear responses (Yang Gao et al, Phys.\ Rev.\ B {\bf 105}, 165307 (2022)). In this work, we extend our study to investigate magnetoconductivities in gapless type-I tilted double-Weyl semimetals within the semiclassical Boltzmann approach and show the differences that arise compared to single-Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Pathway for Unraveling Chemical Composition Effects of Metal-Organic Precursors for FIBID Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of modern metal deposition techniques like Focused Ion/Electron Beam Induced Deposition FIBID/FEBID relies heavily on the availability of metal-organic precursors of particular properties. To create a new precursor, extensive testing under specialized gas injection systems is required along with time-consuming and costly chemical analysis typically conducted using scanning electron microscopes. This process can be quite challenging due to its complexity and expense. Here, we present a method for investigating the chemical composition effects of new metal-organic precursors, prepared in form of supported thick layers, used in FIBID/FEBID applications by utilizing achievable SEM BSE/EDX analysis along with Machine Learning data processing techniques. This approach enables a comprehensive fast examination of decomposition processes during FIBID, providing valuable insights into how these chemical composition effects impact the final properties of metallic deposits. Our method can be employed to optimize, pre-screen, and score new potential precursors for FIBID applications by significantly reducing the time required and conserving valuable resources. Our finding brings also new perspectives across diverse areas of nanoscience in particularly enhancing strongly the field of metal structures nanofabrication.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectrically driven diamond phononic nanocavity by phonon-matching scheme for quantum applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently exciting and controlling phonons in diamond nanoresonators represents a fundamental challenge for quantum applications. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the possibility to excite mechanical modes within a double-hybrid-cavity (DHC), formed by adjoining to a diamond cavity a second cavity, made of aluminum nitride. The latter is piezoelectric and serves as a microwave-to-phonon transducer, activating mechanical modes in the entire DHC. We show the process to match the cavities phononic properties, making them work coordinately in the DHC and obtaining a well confined mode. In the diamond part of the cavity, this mode replicates the fundamental mode of the individual diamond cavity, showing that the piezoelectric transducer doesn't alter the diamond individual fundamental mode. In the piezoelectric part, the strong confinement of stress and electric field results in a high piezoelectric coupling rate, demonstrating the effectiveness of a phononic cavity as a transducer. The study is contextualized in the framework of a quantum networking application, where the DHC serves as a spin qubit, exploiting the spin-mechanical coupling within diamond color centers.</description>

      <title>The graphene squeeze-film microphone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most microphones operate by detecting the sound-pressure induced motion of a membrane. In contrast, here we introduce a microphone that operates by monitoring the sound-pressure-induced modulation of the compressibility of air. By driving a graphene membrane at its resonance frequency, the gas, that is trapped in a squeeze-film beneath it, is compressed at high frequency. Since the stiffness of the gas film depend on the air pressure, the resonance frequency of the graphene is modulated by variations in sound pressure. We demonstrate that this squeeze-film microphone principle can be used to detect sound and music by tracking the membrane's resonance frequency using a phase-locked loop (PLL). Since the sound detection principle is different from conventional devices, the squeeze-film microphone potentially offers advantages like increased dynamic range, and a lower susceptibility to pressure-induced failure and vibration-induced noise. Moreover, it might be made much smaller, as demonstrated by the microphone in this work that operates using a circular graphene membrane with an area that is more than a factor 1000 smaller than that of MEMS microphones.</description>

      <title>Vertically Graded FeNi Alloys with Low Damping and a Sizeable Spin-Orbit Torque</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-efficient spintronic devices require a large spin-orbit torque (SOT) and low damping to excite magnetic precession. In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping. Here, we investigate an alternative approach based on a 10 nm thick single-layer ferromagnet to attain both low damping and a sizable SOT. Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $\theta_\mathrm{AD} \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Few-Shot Learning: Generalization in Multilayer Physical Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06373v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical neuromorphic computing, exploiting the complex dynamics of physical systems, has seen rapid advancements in implementation sophistication and performance. Physical reservoir computing, a subset of neuromorphic computing where only the output layer is trained, faces limitations due to its reliance on single systems. This constrains output dimensionality and dynamic range, limiting performance to a narrow range of tasks and posing a significant challenge to the field's versatility.
  We address this issue by engineering a suite of nanomagnetic arrays as physical reservoirs, demonstrating that tuning microstate space and geometry can significantly broaden dynamics and enhance performance. We interconnect these reservoirs in parallel and series, where each node is a distinct system to create a multilayer neural network architecture. The output of one reservoir is recorded, scaled and virtually fed as input to the next reservoir. All data is experimentally measured with outputs combined offline. This networked approach increases output dimensionality, internal dynamics and computational performance. We demonstrate that a physical neuromorphic system is capable of achieving an overparameterised state. This state facilitates meta-learning on small training sets, yielding strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Our approach's efficacy is further demonstrated through few-shot learning, where the system rapidly adapts to new tasks.</description>

Abstract: Flat, non-dispersive bands and topological phase transition in multiple Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains, cross-linked via periodically arranged nodal points are explored within a tight binding framework. We give analytic prescription, based on a real space decimation scheme, that extracts the energy eigenvalues corresponding to the flat bands along with their degeneracy. The topological phase transition is confirmed through the existence of quantized Zak phase for all the Bloch bands, and the edge states that are protected by chiral symmetry, consistent with the bulk-boundary correspondence. In addition to the edge states, the entangled systems are shown to give rise to clusters of localized eigenstates in the bulk of the system, in contrast to a purely one dimensional SSH system.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit torques due to topological insulator surface states: an in-plane magnetization as a probe of extrinsic spin-orbit scattering</title>

Abstract: Topological insulator (TI) surface states exert strong spin-orbit torques. When the magnetization is in the plane its interaction with the TI conduction electrons is non-trivial, and is influenced by extrinsic spin-orbit scattering. This is expected to be strong in TIs but is difficult to calculate and to measure unambiguously. Here we show that extrinsic spin-orbit scattering sizably renormalizes the surface state spin-orbit torque resulting in a strong density dependence. The magnitude of the renormalization of the spin torque and the effect of spin-orbit scattering on the relative sizes of the in-plane and out-of-plane field-like torques have strong implications for experiment: We propose two separate experimental signatures for the measurement of its presence.</description>

Abstract: High-aspect-ratio mechanical resonators are pivotal in precision sensing, from macroscopic gravitational wave detectors to nanoscale acoustics. However, fabrication challenges and high computational costs have limited the length-to-thickness ratio of these devices, leaving a largely unexplored regime in nano-engineering. We present nanomechanical resonators that extend centimeters in length yet retain nanometer thickness. We explore this expanded design space using an optimization approach which judiciously employs fast millimeter-scale simulations to steer the more computationally intensive centimeter-scale design optimization. By employing delicate nanofabrication techniques, our approach ensures high-yield realization, experimentally confirming room-temperature quality factors close to theoretical predictions. The synergy between nanofabrication, design optimization guided by machine learning, and precision engineering opens a solid-state path to room-temperature quality factors approaching 10 billion at kilohertz mechanical frequencies -- comparable to the performance of leading cryogenic resonators and levitated nanospheres, even under significantly less stringent temperature and vacuum conditions.</description>

Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of graphene nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surfaces, within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when Dirac-like 1D modes appear in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, at growing impurity concentration $c$, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and even opening, at yet higher $c$, of some narrow delocalized range within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with the similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene and armchair type graphene nanoribbons. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments observe the spin-wave-Meissner-current modes in ferromagnetic insulator-superconductor heterostructures, in which the coherently excited spin waves seemingly do not decay as usual beneath the superconductor strip [Borst et al., Science 382, 430 (2023)]. We interpret this phenomenon by demonstrating that the stray magnetic field emitted by the magnetization dynamics is reflected, focused, and enhanced inside the ferromagnet by the supercurrent induced in the superconductor, such that the group velocity of spin waves is strongly enhanced. Analytical and numerical calculations based on this model predict that the coherent transport of magnons is enhanced by close to 500% for yttrium iron garnet capped by superconducting NbN with a decay length exceeding millimeters. Our finding may augment the performance of magnons in quantum information and quantum transport processing.</description>

      <title>Electric field controlled valley-polarized photocurrent switch based on the circular bulk photovoltaic effect</title>

Abstract: Efficient electric manipulation of valley degrees of freedom is critical and challenging for the advancement of valley-based information science and technology. We put forth an electrical scheme, based on a two-band Dirac model, that can switch the fully valley-polarized photocurrent between K and K' valleys using the circular bulk electro-photovoltaic effect. This is accomplished by applying an out-of-plane electric field to the two-dimensional valley materials, which enables continuous tuning of the Berry curvature and its sign flip. We found that the switch of the fully valley-polarized photocurrent is directly tied to the sign change of Berry curvature, which accompanies a topological phase transition, for instance, the quantum spin Hall effect and the quantum valley Hall effect. This scheme has been confirmed in monolayer BiAsI2 and germanene through first-principles calculations. Our paper offers a promising strategy for the development of a volatile valley-addressable memory device and could inspire further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Near-field Imaging of Optical Resonances in Silicon Metasurfaces Using Photoelectron Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control of light-matter interactions at the nanoscale lies at the heart of nanophotonics. Experimental examination at this length scale is challenging, however, since the corresponding electromagnetic near-field is often confined within volumes below the resolution of conventional optical microscopy. In semiconductor nanophotonics electromagnetic fields are further restricted within the confines of individual subwavelength resonators, limiting access to critical light-matter interactions in these structures. In this work, we demonstrate that photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM) can be used for polarization resolved near-field spectroscopy and imaging of electromagnetic resonances supported by broken-symmetry silicon metasurfaces. We find that the photoemission results, enabled through an in-situ potassium surface layer, are consistent with full-wave simulations and far-field reflectance measurements across visible and near-infrared wavelengths. In addition, we uncover a polarization dependent evolution of collective resonances near the metasurface array edge taking advantage of the far-field excitation and full-field imaging of PEEM. Here, we deduce that coupling between eight resonators or more establishes the collective excitations of this metasurface. All told, we demonstrate that the high-spatial resolution hyperspectral imaging and far-field illumination of PEEM can be leveraged for the metrology of collective, non-local, optical resonances in semiconductor nanophotonic structures.</description>

      <title>3D Topological Semimetal Phases of Strained $\alpha$-Sn on Insulating Substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Sn is an elemental topological material, whose topological phases can be tuned by strain and magnetic field. Such tunability offers a substantial potential for topological electronics. However, InSb substrates, commonly used to stabilize $\alpha$-Sn allotrope, suffer from parallel conduction, restricting transport investigations and potential applications. Here, the successful MBE growth of high-quality $\alpha$-Sn layers on insulating, hybrid CdTe/GaAs(001) substrates, with bulk electron mobility approaching 20000 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ is reported. The electronic properties of the samples are systematically investigated by independent complementary techniques, enabling thorough characterization of the 3D Dirac (DSM) and Weyl (WSM) semimetal phases induced by the strains and magnetic field, respectively. Magneto-optical experiments, corroborated with band structure modeling, provide an exhaustive description of the bulk states in the DSM phase. The modeled electronic structure is directly observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, which reveals linearly dispersing bands near the Fermi level. The first detailed study of negative longitudinal magnetoresistance relates this effect to the chiral anomaly and, consequently, to the presence of WSM. Observation of the $\pi$ Berry phase in Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations agrees with the topologically non-trivial nature of the investigated samples. Our findings establish $\alpha$-Sn as an attractive topological material for exploring relativistic physics and future applications.</description>

Abstract: In classical Hermitian continuous media, the spectral-flow index of topological modes is linked to the bulk topology via index theorem. However, the interface between two bulks is usually non-Hermitian due to the inhomogeneities of system parameters. We show that the connection between topological modes and bulk topology still exists despite the non-Hermiticity at the interface if the system is endowed with PT symmetry. The theoretical framework developed is applied to the Hall magnetohydrodynamic model to identify a topological mode called topological Alfv\'{e}n-sound wave in magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Emergent Quantum Phenomena of Noncentrosymmetric Charge-Density Wave in 1T-Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 1T-transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have been an exciting platform for exploring the intertwinement of charge density waves and strong correlation phenomena. While the David star structure has been conventionally considered as the underlying charge order in the literature, recent scanning tunneling probe experiments on several monolayer 1T-TMD materials have motivated a new, alternative structure, namely the anion-centered David star structure. In this Letter, we show that this novel anion-centered David star structure manifestly breaks inversion symmetry, resulting in flat bands with pronounced Rashba spin-orbit couplings. These distinctive features unlock novel possibilities and functionalities for 1T-TMDs, including the giant spin Hall effect, the emergence of Chern bands, and spin liquid that spontaneously breaks crystalline rotational symmetry. Our findings establish promising avenues for exploring emerging quantum phenomena of monolayer 1T-TMDs with this novel noncentrosymmetric structure.</description>

      <title>Depth resolved study of annealing in IrMn/(Fe, Co, CoFe) exchange bias systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depth resolved study of structural and magnetic profiles of antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic (AFM/FM) system upon annealing was performed in this work. We studied systems comprising of AFM IrMn and FM (Co, Fe, Co$_{70}$Fe$_{30}$) structures using polarized neutron and soft X-ray scattering, secondary neutral spectrometry, and magnetometry. Structural depth profiles obtained from neutron reflectometry indicate non-homogeneity of the AFM layer even before annealing, which is associated with the migration of manganese to the surface of the sample. Annealing of samples with CoFe and Co layers leads to a slight increase ($\sim$ 5 %) in the migration of manganese, which, however, does not lead to significant degradation of the exchange coupling at the AFM/FM interface. A significantly different picture was observed in the Fe/IrMn systems where a strong migration of iron into the AFM layer was observed upon annealing of the sample, leading to erosion of the magnetic profile, the formation of a non-magnetic alloy and degradation of the pinning strength. This study can be useful in the design of AF/FM systems in different spintronics devices, including HDD read heads, where thermal annealing is applied at different stages of the device manufacturing process.</description>

Abstract: Recent reports of room-temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity in copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite, commonly referred to as LK99, have prompted numerous theoretical and experimental studies into its properties. As the electron-phonon interaction is a common mechanism for superconductivity, the electron-phonon coupling strength is an important quantity to compute for LK99. In this work, we compare the electron-phonon coupling strength among the proposed compositions of LK99. The results of our study are in alignment with the conclusion that LK99 is not a likely candidate for room-temperature superconductivity if electron-phonon interaction is to serve as the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Single-photon emitters in WSe$_2$: Critical role of phonons on excitation schemes and indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within optical quantum information processing, single-photon sources based on a two-level system in a semiconductor material allow for on-demand generation of single photons. To initiate the spontaneous emission process, it is necessary to efficiently populate the excited state. However, reconciling the requirement for on-demand excitation with both high efficiency and high photon indistinguishability remains a challenge due to the presence of charge noise and phonon-induced decoherence in the solid-state environment. Here, we propose a method for reconstructing the phonon spectral density experienced by WSe$_{2}$ quantum emitters in the emission process. Using the reconstructed phonon spectral density, we analyze the performance of the resonant, phonon-assisted, and Swing-UP of the quantum EmitteR population (SUPER) swing-up excitation schemes. Under resonant excitation, we obtain an exciton preparation fidelity limited to $\sim$0.80 by the strong phonon coupling, which improves to 0.96 for the SUPER scheme (or 0.89, depending on the type of emitter considered). Under near-resonant phonon-assisted excitation, we observe near-unity excitation fidelity up to 0.976 (0.997). Additionally, we demonstrate that, assuming the suppression of the phonon sidebands, residual dephasing mechanisms such as charge/spin fluctuations are the dominating decoherence mechanisms undermining the photon indistinguishability.</description>
