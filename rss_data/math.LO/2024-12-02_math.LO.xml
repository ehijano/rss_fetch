      <title>Probabilistic consequence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates logical consequence defined in terms of probability distributions, for a classical propositional language using a standard notion of probability. We examine three distinct probabilistic consequence notions, which we call material consequence, preservation consequence, and symmetric consequence. While material consequence is fully classical for any threshold, preservation consequence and symmetric consequence are subclassical, with only symmetric consequence gradually approaching classical logic at the limit threshold equal to 1. Our results extend earlier results obtained by J. Paris in a SET-FMLA setting to the SET-SET setting, and consider open thresholds beside closed ones. In the SET-SET setting, in particular, they reveal that probability 1 preservation does not yield classical logic, but supervaluationism, and conversely positive probability preservation yields subvaluationism.</description>

      <title>Fibred sets within a predicative and constructive effective topos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the fibrational structure of sets within the predicative variant $\mathbf{pEff}$ of Hyland's Effective Topos $\mathbf{Eff}$ previously introduced in Feferman's predicative theory of non-iterative fixpoints $\widehat{ID_1}$. Our structural analysis can be carried out in constructive and predicative variants of $\mathbf{Eff}$ within extensions of Aczel's Constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory. All this shows that the full subcategory of discrete objects of Hyland's Effective topos $\mathbf{Eff}$ contains already a fibred predicative topos validating the formal Church's thesis, even when both are formalized in a constructive metatheory.</description>

      <title>Full Generalized Effective Reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the concept of effective reducibility between statements of set theory with ordinal Turing machines (OTMs) explored in earlier work for $\Pi_{2}$-statements to statements of arbitrary quantifier complexity in prenex normal form and use this to compare various fundamental set-theoretical principles with respect to effective reducibility. This is a preliminary note, in which many arguments are merely sketched, soon to be replaced by a more elaborate version.</description>

      <title>Kurepa trees, continuous images, and perfect set properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon work of L\"{u}cke and Schlicht, we study (higher) Kurepa trees through the lens of higher descriptive set theory, focusing in particular on various perfect set properties and representations of sets of branches through trees as continuous images of function spaces. Answering a question of L\"{u}cke and Schlicht, we prove that it is consistent with $\mathsf{CH}$ that there exist $\omega_2$-Kurepa trees and yet, for every $\omega_2$-Kurepa tree $T \subseteq {^{&lt;\omega_2}}\omega_2$, the set $[T] \subseteq {^{\omega_2}}\omega_2$ of cofinal branches through $T$ is not a continuous image of ${^{\omega_2}}\omega_2$. We also produce models indicating that the existence of Kurepa trees is not necessary to produce closed subsets of ${^{\omega_1}}\omega_1$ failing to satisfy strong perfect set properties, and prove a number of consistency results regarding \emph{full} and \emph{superthin} trees.</description>

      <title>Peano Arithmetic, games and descent recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze Coquand's game-theoretic interpretation of Peano Arithmetic through the lens of elementary descent recursion. In Coquand's game semantics, winning strategies correspond to infinitary cut-free proofs and cut elimination corresponds to debates between these winning strategies. The proof of cut elimination, i.e., the proof that such debates eventually terminate, is by transfinite induction on certain interaction sequences of ordinals. In this paper, we provide a direct implementation of Coquand's proof, one that allows us to describe winning strategies by descent recursive functions. As a byproduct, we obtain yet another proof of well-known results about provably recursive functions and functionals.</description>

      <title>Choice and independence of premise rules in intuitionistic set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choice and independence of premise principles play an important role in characterizing Kreisel's modified realizability and G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation. In this paper we show that a great many intuitionistic set theories are closed under the corresponding rules for finite types over $\mathbb{N}$. It is also shown that the existence property (or existential definability property) holds for statements of the form $\exists y^{\sigma}\, \varphi(y)$, where the variable $y$ ranges over objects of finite type $\sigma$. This applies in particular to ${\sf CZF}$ (Constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory) and ${\sf IZF}$ (Intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory), two systems known not to have the general existence property. On the technical side, the paper uses a method that amalgamates generic realizability for set theory with truth, whereby the underlying partial combinatory algebra is required to contain all objects of finite type.</description>

      <title>Iterating reflection over intuitionistic arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize iterations of consistency, local and uniform reflection over Heyting Arithmetic. The treatment of uniform reflection is based on a proof of Feferman's completeness theorem due to Rathjen. Unlike previous works, this paper does not contain an adaptation of Feferman's proof to the intuitionistic case. Similarly, Rathjen's proof does not translate to intuitionistic logic, but a simple modification will do the trick.</description>

      <title>Epic math battle of history: Grothendieck vs Nikodym</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13145v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a $\sigma$-centered notion of forcing that forces the existence of a Boolean algebra with the Grothendieck property and without the Nikodym property. In particular the existence of such an algebra is consistent with the negation of the continuum hypothesis. The algebra we construct consists of Borel subsets of the Cantor set and has cardinality $\omega_1$. We also show how to apply our method to streamline Talagrand's construction of such an algebra under the continuum hypothesis.</description>
