      <title>The Chaotic Art: Quantum Representation and Manipulation of Color</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its unique computing principles, quantum computing technology will profoundly change the spectacle of color art. Focusing on experimental exploration of color qubit representation, color channel processing, and color image generation via quantum computing, this article proposes a new technical path for color computing in quantum computing environment, by which digital color is represented, operated, and measured in quantum bits, and then restored for classical computers as computing results. This method has been proved practicable as an artistic technique of color qubit representation and quantum computing via programming experiments in Qiskit and IBM Q. By building a bridge between classical chromatics and quantum graphics, quantum computers can be used for information visualization, image processing, and more color computing tasks. Furthermore, quantum computing can be expected to facilitate new color theories and artistic concepts.</description>

      <title>Another formula for calculating Clebsch Gordan coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the derivation of a comprehensive formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients in a quantum system. The formula is derived by employing the iterative application of angular momentum ladder operators on each defined angular momentum subspace to reconstruct the states in the total angular momentum base. The novelty aspect of this approach lies in the utilization of the $J{+}$ raising operator to reconstruct subspaces characterized by non-maximal total angular momentum, in contrast to the conventional Gram-Schmidt procedure typically employed in the standard literature.This enables us to derive a new formula that provides an alternative approach for computing these coefficients, complementing the existing ones found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Assisted Correlation Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a hybrid quantum-classical method to correlation clustering, a graph-based unsupervised learning task that seeks to partition the nodes in a graph based on pairwise agreement and disagreement. In particular, we adapt GCS-Q, a quantum-assisted solver originally designed for coalition structure generation, to maximize intra-cluster agreement in signed graphs through recursive divisive partitioning. The proposed method encodes each bipartitioning step as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, solved via quantum annealing. This integration of quantum optimization within a hierarchical clustering framework enables handling of graphs with arbitrary correlation structures, including negative edges, without relying on metric assumptions or a predefined number of clusters. Empirical evaluations on synthetic signed graphs and real-world hyperspectral imaging data demonstrate that, when adapted for correlation clustering, GCS-Q outperforms classical algorithms in robustness and clustering quality on real-world data and in scenarios with cluster size imbalance. Our results highlight the promise of hybrid quantum-classical optimization for advancing scalable and structurally-aware clustering techniques in graph-based unsupervised learning.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions and Many-Body Backflow in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are non-equilibrium transitions characterized by the orthogonality between an initial quantum state and its time-evolved counterpart following a sudden quench. Recently, studies of this phenomenon have been extended beyond closed quantum systems to include environmental interactions, often modeled through non-Hermitian effects. However, because non-Hermitian descriptions neglect both quantum jump processes and interaction effects, the ultimate fate of interacting quantum systems under full open-system quantum dynamics remains an open question. In this paper, by incorporating both interactions and full Liouvillian dynamics, we prove that DQPTs in open quantum systems remain robust when subject to either particle loss or particle gain alone, but are generically smeared out when both processes coexist, as a result of many-body particle backflow. Furthermore, we uncover a non-perturbative dynamical effect: even a weak admixture of gain (loss) into a system with loss (gain) can dramatically reshape the long-time behavior of DQPT dynamics, leading to substantial deviations over time. These phenomena--including the universal smearing of DQPTs and the emergence of large dynamical deviations in the long-time limit--arise intrinsically from non-equilibrium many-body effects in open quantum systems. Our findings are general and substantiated by both analytical arguments and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of out-of-equilibrium dynamics in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technologies have enabled quantum simulation of gauge theories -- some of the most fundamental frameworks of nature -- in regimes far from equilibrium, where classical computation is severely limited. These simulators, primarily based on neutral atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits, hold the potential to address long-standing questions in nuclear, high-energy, and condensed-matter physics, and may ultimately allow first-principles studies of matter evolution in settings ranging from the early universe to high-energy collisions. Research in this rapidly growing field is also driving the convergence of concepts across disciplines and uncovering new phenomena. In this Review, we highlight recent experimental and theoretical developments, focusing on phenomena accessible in current and near-term quantum simulators, including particle production and string breaking, collision dynamics, thermalization, ergodicity breaking, and dynamical quantum phase transitions. We conclude by outlining promising directions for future research and opportunities enabled by available quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Trading Mathematical for Physical Simplicity: Bialgebraic Structures in Matrix Product Operator Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in the lattice representation theory of (generalized) symmetries, many simple quantum spin chains of physical interest are not included in the rigid framework of fusion categories and weak Hopf algebras. We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by relaxing the requirements on the underlying algebraic structure, and show that general matrix product operator symmetries are described by a pre-bialgebra. As a guiding example, we focus on the anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of the XX model, which manifests the mixed anomaly between its $U(1)$ momentum and winding symmetry. We show how this anomaly is embedded into the non-semisimple corepresentation category, providing a novel mechanism for realizing such anomalous symmetries on the lattice. Additionally, the representation category which describes the renormalization properties is semisimple and semi-monoidal, which provides a new class of mixed state renormalization fixed points. Finally, we show that up to a quantum channel, this anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry is equivalent to a more conventional MPO symmetry obtained on the boundary of a double semion model. In this way, our work provides a bridge between well-understood topological defect symmetries and those that arise in more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Exoplanetary atmospheres retrieval via a quantum extreme learning machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of exoplanetary atmospheres traditionally relies on forward models to analytically compute the spectrum of an exoplanet by fine-tuning numerous chemical and physical parameters. However, the high-dimensionality of parameter space often results in a significant computational overhead. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to atmospheric retrieval leveraging on quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs). QELMs are quantum machine learning techniques that employ quantum systems as a black box for processing input data. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting exoplanetary atmospheric features using QELMs, employing an intrinsically fault-tolerant strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices, and we demonstrate such fault tolerance with a direct implementation on IBM Fez. The QELM architecture we present shows the potential of quantum computing in the analysis of astrophysical datasets and may, in the near-term future, unlock new computational tools to implement fast, efficient, and more accurate models in the study of exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for Uhlmann transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uhlmann's theorem is a central result in quantum information theory, associating the closeness of two quantum states with that of their purifications. This theorem well characterizes the fundamental task of transforming a quantum state into another state via local operations on its subsystem. The optimal transformation for this task is called the Uhlmann transformation, which has broad applications in various fields; however, its quantum circuit implementation and computational cost have remained unclear. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing quantum query and sample algorithms that realize the Uhlmann transformation in the form of quantum circuits. These algorithms achieve exponential improvements in computational costs, including query and sample complexities, over naive approaches based on state measurements such as quantum state tomography, under certain computational models. We apply our algorithms to the square root fidelity estimation task and particularly show that our approach attains a better query complexity than the prior state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we discuss applications to several information-theoretic tasks, specifically, entanglement transmission, quantum state merging, and algorithmic implementation of the Petz recovery map, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the computational costs.</description>

      <title>Long-term stability of driven quantum systems and the time-dependent Bloch equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study looks at the finite-dimensional adiabatic evolution influenced by weak perturbations, extending the analysis to the asymptotic time limit. Beginning with the fundamentals of adiabatic transformations and time-dependent effective Hamiltonians, we intuitively derive the Bloch equation. Our investigation of the solutions of the Bloch equation underscores the critical role of initial conditions and the assured existence of solutions, revealing the intricate link between leakage phenomena and the Bloch transformation. Numerical and analytical evaluations demonstrate that the leakage can remain small eternally. That is, a system that starts in a particular eigenspace of the strong generator remains in the same respective eigenspace for arbitrary long times with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\gamma^{-1})$, where $\gamma$ describes the ratio between the strength of the system's strong Hamiltonian and the perturbation.</description>

      <title>QuLTRA: Quantum hybrid Lumped and TRansmission lines circuits Analyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present QuLTRA (Quantum hybrid Lumped and TRansmission lines circuits Analyzer), an open-source Python package for the accurate simulation of superconducting quantum circuits containing both lumped and distributed elements. QuLTRA directly models coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines and multi-line couplers without discretization into lumped-element equivalents, and extracts the circuit Hamiltonian parameters using the energy participation ratio (EPR) method. This approach enables fast and accurate extraction of mode frequencies, anharmonicities, cross-Kerr interactions, and Purcell decay rates without relying on full electromagnetic simulations, while naturally accounting for higher-order modes of distributed components. The performance of QuLTRA is validated against Ansys HFSS, pyEPR, QuCAT, and results from the literature, showing excellent agreement with orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational time with respect to full electromagnetic simulations. Some application examples are discussed, including the design of Purcell filters, multi-mode ultra-strong coupling systems, and multiplexed qubit readout schemes, demonstrating that QuLTRA can efficiently simulate complex architectures relevant to circuit quantum electrodynamics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transverse contraction methods are extremely promising tools for the efficient contraction of tensor networks associated with the time evolution of quantum many-body systems, allowing in some cases to circumvent the entanglement barrier that would normally prevent the study of quantum dynamics with classical resources. We present here the ITransverse.jl package, written in Julia and based on ITensors.jl, containing several of these high-level algorithms, including novel prescriptions for efficient truncations of temporal matrix product states.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Controlled Dual-State Distribution of Bell and N00N Entanglement Over a Metro-Scale Commercial Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first demonstration of multiphoton, dual state entanglement distribution over a metropolitan scale commercial fiber network, implemented on the EPB Bohr IV quantum network in Chattanooga, TN, using an all fiber optic experimental platform. Employing a spatially degenerate, continuous wave type II SPDC biphoton source and fully fiber coupled linear optics, we generated a 4 photon entangled state. Through polarization projective measurements on two locally retained photons, we then probabilistically heralded the remaining two photons into either a Bell state (particle particle entanglement) or a N00N state (mode-mode entanglement), which were then distributed to two spatially separated network nodes. Experimental verification confirmed successful entanglement distribution across the deployed network despite significant channel losses and limited source fidelity. These results highlight the versatility of our polarization controlled multi photon entanglement distribution over real world telecom infrastructure and lay the groundwork for future upgrades, including higher quality non degenerate photon sources, White Rabbit timing synchronization for true multi node entanglement, and active polarization control for enhanced fidelity and long term stability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing non-Hermitian Floquet theory, the strong-field process of high harmonic (HH) generation by a classical continuous-wave field irradiating ground-state atom is discovered to be controllable by placing the irradiated atom inside a single-mode quantum cavity initiated even with a single photon. Judicious cavity coupling of cavity-free photo-induced atomic Floquet states forms polaritonic Floquet states that generate side harmonics around the (standard no-cavity) odd harmonics. The different possible cavity-controlled HH spectra, including also the ones resulting from several cavities in a row, enable attosecond-pulse sequences different from the one produced without a cavity. Moreover, the present study sets the framework and opens the way for further cavity control over the HH generation process as well as over other strong-field processes</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the theory of Resonance Assisted Tunneling (RAT) to a many-body quantum kicked system with a well-defined semiclassical limit. Using a quantum resonant condition, we identify eigenstates associated with classical resonances and compute their quasienergy splitting semiclassically. We distinguish two regimes: the first, where RAT predictions show excellent agreement with exact quantum results, and a second, where the splitting saturates and coincides with that of a harmonic oscillator with frequency determined by the classical oscillation of the resonance island. We quantify the perturbation strength above which RAT theory is no longer valid and analyze its scaling in the semiclassical limit, providing analytical expressions to estimate this upper bound.</description>

      <title>Coherence-Driven Quantum Battery Charging via Autonomous Thermal Machines: Energy Transfer, Memory Effects, and Ergotropy Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a hybrid quantum system composed of a quantum battery and a coherence-driven charger interacting with a Quantum Autonomous Thermal Machine (QATM). The QATM, made of two qubits each coupled to Markovian Bosonics thermal reservoirs at different temperatures, acts as a structured environment that mediates energy and coherence transfer between the charger and the battery. By presenting a coherent driving field on the charger, we investigate the coherence injection effect on the dynamics, including non-Markovianity, power of charging, coherence storage, and ergotropy. We show that the QATM effectively filters the decoherence induced by the thermal baths and induces non-Markovian memory effects due to correlation backflow. Our results demonstrate that coherence driving enhances the battery's ergotropy and power of charging by preserving the internal energy of the charger and facilitating coherent energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Decoding with Parallelism and Self-Coordination for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast, reliable decoders are pivotal components for enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. Neural network decoders like AlphaQubit have demonstrated significant potential, achieving higher accuracy than traditional human-designed decoding algorithms. However, existing implementations of neural network decoders lack the parallelism required to decode the syndrome stream generated by a superconducting logical qubit in real time. Moreover, integrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes presents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a single bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory experiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily integrated.
  We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for sliding-window decoding. While our network still outputs a single bit per window, we derive training labels from a consistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding windows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate across neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of arbitrarily long memory experiments. As a result, we resolve the throughput limitation that previously prohibited the application of AlphaQubit-type decoders in fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Tunneling induced giant Photonic Spin Hall effect in quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical investigation of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a mid-infrared probe field by employing an asymmetric double AlGaAsGaAs quantum well as the intracavity medium. The system is designed such that an external control beam together with tunable tunneling barriers regulates the quantum interference of the probe tunneling process. This configuration enables precise manipulation of the PSHE for both horizontally and vertically polarized components of light. Our analysis reveals the emergence of a giant horizontal PSHE in the quantum well based cavity system. Moreover, by incorporating absorptive and gain-assisted cavity slabs, the horizontal PSHE is further amplified, leading to an even more pronounced photonic spin separation. The results provide novel insights into light matter interactions in semiconductor quantum wells and suggest an effective route for enhancing and controlling the PSHE in mid-infrared photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Decoherence mitigation for geometric quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric phases depend only on the evolution path determined by the closed circuit in the projective Hilbert space but not on evolution details of the quantum system, leading to geometric quantum computation possessing some intrinsic robustness against control errors. Coordinated with dynamical decoupling, geometric quantum computation admits additional resilience to the environment-induced decoherence. However, the previous schemes of geometric quantum computation protected by dynamical decoupling require multiple physical qubits to encode a logical qubit, which undoubtedly increases the consumption of physical-qubit resources and the difficulty in the implementation of the logical-qubit manipulation based on physical-qubit driving. In this work, we put forward a scheme of decoherence-mitigated geometric quantum computation based only on physical qubits rather than logical qubits, hence avoiding the additional overhead of physical-qubit resources for logical-qubit encoding as well as the difficulty in the manipulation of logical qubits. Moreover, our scheme focuses on the most general interaction between an individual qubit and its environment so that it mitigates not just dephasing noise but rather regular decoherence. Our proposal thus represents a more realistic and effective approach towards the realization of geometric control with decoherence mitigation.</description>

      <title>Near-Term Quantum-Computing-Inspired Sampling for Community Detection in Low-Modularity Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low modularity networks (Q &lt; 0.2) challenge classical community detection algorithms, which get trapped in local optima. We introduce quantum inspired community detection algorithms leveraging non classical sampling techniques to escape modularity optimization plateaus. Using distributions inspired by quantum phenomena including Porter Thomas distributions, Haar random states, and hyperuniform point processes, our approach generates diverse high quality partitions that improve modularity on difficult low Q graphs. We demonstrate 15 to 25% gains in modularity Q over classical methods (Louvain, Leiden). We define a "Modularity Recovery Gap" (MRG), the increase in Q achieved by quantum inspired refinement, and show this serves as a powerful anomaly detection signal. In experiments on high modularity networks (CTU 13 botnet traffic), MRG is near zero, confirming our method doesn't inflate modularity when no hidden structure exists. Results suggest quantum inspired sampling substantially enhances community detection in low modularity regimes, with applications in cybersecurity (stealthy APT/botnet detection), financial contagion modeling, disrupted supply chains, diseased brain connectomes, and crisis era social media analysis. Our refinements expand the search space of algorithms like Leiden without altering the graph, revealing partitions classical heuristics miss. While such partitions need not represent ground truth communities, they illustrate how near term quantum sampling can reshape optimization landscapes and enhance sensitivity to weak structure.</description>

      <title>Electrically pumped ultra-efficient quantum frequency conversion on thin film lithium niobate chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) plays a crucial role in constructing seamless interconnection between quantum systems operating at different wavelengths. To advance future quantum technology, chip-scale integrated QFC components, featuring high efficiency, small footprint, low power consumption and high scalability, are indispensable. In this work, we demonstrate the first hybrid integrated QFC chip on thin film lithium niobate platform that connects the telecom and visible bands. Benefiting from the periodically poled microring resonator with ulta-high normalized conversion efficiency of 386,000 %/W, an ultra-low pump power of 360 {\mu}W is achieved which is more than two orders of magnitude lower than traditional straight waveguide scheme. By injecting current into the chip, an on-chip quantum efficiency of 57% and a noise count of ~ 7k counts per second are achieved. Such an electrically pumped, integrated and scalable QFC chip would significantly advancing the integration of quantum network and the development of chip-scale quantum optical systems.</description>

      <title>Solving quantum-inspired dynamics on quantum and classical annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a practical benchmarking suite inspired by physical dynamics to challenge both quantum and classical computers. Using a parallel in time encoding, we convert the real-time propagator of an $n$-qubit, possibly non-Hermitian, Hamiltonian into a quadratic-unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) problem. The resulting QUBO instances are executed on D-Wave quantum annealers as well as using two classical solvers, Simulated Annealing and VeloxQ, a state-of-the-art classical heuristic solver. This enables a direct comparison. To stress-test the workflow, we use eight representative models, divided into three groups: (i)~single-qubit rotations, (ii)~multi-qubit entangling gates (Bell, GHZ, cluster), and (iii)~$\text{PT}$-symmetric, parity-conserving and other non-Hermitian generators. Across this diverse suite we track the success probability and time to solution, which are well established measures in the realm of heuristic combinatorial optimisation. Our results show that D-Wave Advantage2 consistently surpasses its predecessor, while VeloxQ presently retains the overall lead, reflecting the maturity of classical optimisers. We highlight the rapid progress of analog quantum optimisation, and suggest a clear trajectory toward quantum competitive dynamics simulation, by establishing the parallel in time QUBO framework as a versatile test-bed for tracking and evaluating that progress.</description>

      <title>LATTE: A Decoding Architecture for Quantum Computing with Temporal and Spatial Scalability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction allows inherently noisy quantum devices to emulate an ideal quantum computer with reasonable resource overhead. As a crucial component, decoding architectures have received significant attention recently. In this paper, we introduce LATTE, a FPGA-CPU hybrid decoding architecture aiming to address the key requirements of scaling up in lattice surgery quantum computation -- Latency, Accuracy, Throughput and Transmission Bandwidth, in an Eclectic manner. LATTE follows a hierarchical design: (1) A fully streaming and asynchronous block decoding system on CPU to enable parallelization both temporally and spatially. (2) A super-light yet accurate neural local decoding unit integrated with quantum control hardware on FPGA, which remains \emph{transparent} to the block decoding system, effectively reducing transmission bandwidth and accelerating the decoding process. LATTE delivers accuracy on par with the base decoder while achieving real-time decoding throughput and significantly reducing both bandwidth requirements and computational resources, enabling a level of scalability far beyond previous approaches. Under circuit-level noise $p=0.001$, LATTE achieves over $\mathbf{90\%}$ reduction in transmission bandwidth and a $\mathbf{6.4\times}$ speedup on average in single-block decoding. In the \emph{streaming decoding} scenario: (1) LATTE achieves constant and low latency ($\mathbf{16\times}$-$\mathbf{20\times}$ speedup over existing streaming decoding implementations) in arbitrarily long quantum memory experiments, with near-optimal resources -- merely $\mathbf{2}$ threads are sufficient for decoding the surface code with distance up to $17$. (2) LATTE minimizes latency in multi-patch measurement experiments through highly parallelized decoding operations. These combined efforts ensure sufficient scalability for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Photon Correlations in Weakly Coupled Atomic Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a scattering theory formalism and use it to predict that a resonantly driven atomic ensemble weakly coupled to an optical mode can generate light with non-Gaussian correlations. Our approach -- based on a perturbative diagrammatic expansion of multi-photon interactions -- shows that photon-photon interaction mediated by the emitters causes the transmitted light to have a non-vanishing connected third-order correlation function $g_c^{(3)}$. We explain the temporal pattern of $g_c^{(3)}$ using the interaction processes in our diagrammatic expansion. A quantitative comparison with cascaded master equation simulations for small ensembles with optical depth $\mathrm{OD}\leq 2$ confirms that the perturbative results remain accurate across experimentally relevant optical depths and for drive strengths large enough to make the predicted non-Gaussian signatures detectable. We anticipate that state-of-the-art nanofibre-coupled atomic ensembles can experimentally demonstrate our predictions.</description>

      <title>Real-time adaptive quantum error correction by model-free multi-agent learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can we build efficient Quantum Error Correction (QEC) that adapts on the fly to time-varying noise? In this work we say yes, and show how. We present a two level framework based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) that learns to correct even non-stationary errors from scratch. At the first level we take advantage of model-free Multi-Agent RL (MARL) to automatically discover full QEC cycle -- logical state encoding, stabilizer measurements, and recovery -- without any prior system knowledge, relying only on orthogonality conditions. Leveraging the stabilizer formalism, we demonstrate that our MARL framework can discover novel QEC codes tailored for multi-level quantum architectures. At the second level we introduce BRAVE (Bandit Retraining for Adaptive Variational Error correction), an efficient algorithm that tunes the variational layer on the fly to change the physical basis of the errors, adapting the QEC code to time-varying noise while minimizing computational overhead and reducing the number of retraining steps. By combining our MARL and BRAVE approaches and testing them on multi-level systems subjected to competing bit- and phase-flip errors over time across diverse scenarios, we observed an improvement in logical fidelity by more than an order of magnitude -- under time-dependent noise channels -- compared to conventional QEC schemes.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Low-Dimensional Turbulence via Multi-Dimensional Hybrid Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of complex dynamics remains an open problem across many domains of physics, where nonlinearities and multiscale interactions severely limit the reliability of conventional forecasting methods. Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing by exploiting the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space, where the dynamics of quantum systems take place. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical reservoir architecture capable of handling multivariate time series through quantum evolution combined with classical memory enhancement. Our model employs a five-qubit transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian with input-modulated dynamics and temporal multiplexing, enabling the encoding of input signals over multiple timescales. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic models of chaotic behavior in fluid dynamics, where multiscale dynamics and nonlinearities play a dominant role: a low-dimensional truncation of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the Lorenz-63 system. By systematically scanning the quantum system's parameter space, we identify regions that maximize forecasting performance, as measured by the Valid Prediction Time. The observed robustness and reliable performances for both dynamical systems suggest that this hybrid quantum approach offers a flexible platform for modelling complex nonlinear time series.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Quantum Data Center Emulation Using Digital Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing hardware advances, the limitations of single-chip architectures, particularly in terms of small qubit count, have sparked growing interest in modular quantum computing systems and Quantum Data Centers (QDCs). These architectures interconnect multiple quantum processor units (QPUs) to overcome physical constraints and support complex quantum algorithms. However, the implementation of distributed quantum computing (DQC) faces significant technical challenges, especially in the execution of remote gates. Moreover, no practical emulation tool currently exists to evaluate theoretical proposals of various DQC systems. In this work, we propose a framework that emulates a DQC system using a single quantum processor. We partition the physical qubit coupling map of an existing QPU into multiple logical QPUs, and introduce an experimentally grounded noise model based on quantum collision dynamics to quantify the interconnect-induced noise, representing fiber-connected QPUs. The framework is validated using IBM's quantum hardware, demonstrating the successful execution of remote gates under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we implement distributed versions of Grover's search and the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), showing that complex circuits can be executed within the proposed framework with reasonable fidelity across interconnected QPUs. The emulation result of Grover's algorithm aligns with the real-world experimental implementations between two Ion-trapped QPUs interconnected by optical fiber, which demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our framework. Overall, this work provides a versatile emulation tool for investigating QDC behavior while accounting for interconnect-induced communication noise and offers a practical method for validating distributed quantum protocols without requiring specialized interconnect hardware.</description>

      <title>Temperature-induced measurement sensitivity enhancement via imaginary weak values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of weak measurement and post-selection to enhance measurement sensitivity when the initial probe state is mixed. In our framework, the mixedness of the probe's density operator is controlled by temperature. We focus on two key quantities: the signal-to-noise ratio and the quantum Fisher information of the final probe state, evaluated after post-selection is applied on the system. Our analysis employs a rigorous, all-order coupling treatment of measurement, demonstrating that the signal-to-noise ratio can be enhanced in certain scenarios by increasing the temperature. However, this enhancement is fundamentally constrained by the validity conditions of the weak measurement regime. Regarding the quantum Fisher information, we find that for a pure probe state, incorporating post-selection does not improve precision beyond the standard (non-post-selected) strategy when the post-selection probability is accounted for. In contrast, when the initial probe state is mixed, the quantum Fisher information for the probe state after post-selection in the system can surpass that of the standard strategy. Notably, we show that the quantum Fisher information might diverge and grow unboundedly with temperature, illustrating a scenario where thermal noise can, counterintuitively, enhance metrological precision.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the adiabatic version of Grover's quantum search algorithm as proposed by Roland and Cerf, we study the impact of decoherence caused by a rather general coupling to some environment. For quite generic conditions, we find that the quantum Zeno effect poses strong limitations on the performance (quantum speed-up) since the environment effectively measures the state of the system permanently and thereby inhibits or slows down quantum transitions. Generalizing our results, we find that analogous restrictions should apply universally to adiabatic quantum algorithms and quantum annealing schemes which are based on isolated Landau-Zener type transitions at avoided level crossings (similar to first-order phase transitions). As a possible resort, more gradual changes of the quantum state (as in second-order phase transitions) or suitable error-correcting schemes such as the spin-echo method may alleviate this problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information quantities, such as mutual information and entropies, are essential for characterizing quantum systems and protocols in quantum information science. In this contribution, we identify types of information measures based on generalized divergences and prove their invariance under local isometric or unitary transformations. Leveraging the reversal channel for local isometries together with the data processing inequality, we establish invariance for information quantities used in both asymptotic and one-shot regimes without relying on the specific functional form of the underlying divergence. These invariances can be applied to improve the computation of such information quantities or optimize protocols and their output states whose performance is determined by some invariant measure. Our results improve the capability to characterize and compute many operationally relevant information measures with application across the field of quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Efficient QKD in Non-Ideal Scenarios with User-Defined Output Length Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables two parties to securely share encryption keys by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, offering protection against eavesdropping. In practical implementations, QKD systems often rely on a layered architecture where a key manager stores secret key material in a buffer and delivers it to higher communication layers as needed. However, this buffer can be depleted under high demand, requiring efficient replenishment strategies that minimize resource waste. Given the importance of optimizing time and resources in quantum cryptography protocols, we introduce a variable-length adaptation of the BB84 protocol designed to meet user-defined output key length constraints in non-ideal scenarios. We present a method for dynamically configuring the protocol's initial parameters to generate secret keys of a desired length. To validate our approach, we developed simulation tools to model general QKD networks and discrete-variable protocols. These tools were used to implement and evaluate our strategies, which were developed within the BB84 framework but can be extended to other QKD protocols under reasonable assumptions. The results highlight their usefulness in optimizing quantum resource usage and supporting key management, contributing to the long-term goal of scaling and strengthening secure quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Wavefront correction of high-dimensional two-photon states via coherence-entanglement transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable transmission of quantum optical states through real-world environments is key for quantum communication and imaging. Yet, aberrations and scattering in the propagation path can scramble the transmitted signal and hinder its use. A typical strategy is to employ a classical beacon beam to learn and then correct for the wavefront distortions. However, relying on a separate light source increases the overhead in the experimental apparatus. Moreover, the beacon light must closely match the non-classical state in polarization, wavelength, and even temporal bandwidth, which is highly challenging in practice. Here, we introduce a fast and efficient wavefront correction approach where we use the quantum state itself to correct for optical distortion. Via pump shaping, we control the degree of entanglement in the spatially-entangled two-photon state so that it behaves either as a high-dimensional entangled state or as a classical coherent state. The latter case is used to efficiently measure the transmission matrix of the propagation channel and correct its distortions with a spatial light modulator, thereby enabling the transmission of the high-dimensional entangled state with minimal errors. Our approach paves the way for the practical implementation of quantum imaging and communication protocols based on high-dimensional spatially entangled states.</description>

      <title>Searching for a physical description relative to a quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics is a model of nature able to both describe and predict the results of measurements made with respect to reference systems. These reference systems, in turn, are themselves physical and thus subject to the laws of physics. The situation is no different when the model in use is quantum mechanics: states and observables are relative entities, and reference frames are not exempt from exhibiting quantum behavior. In recent years, the scientific community has shown renewed interest in quantum reference frames, particularly in connection with the covariance of physical laws and quantum resources. However, current approaches fall short of providing a complete prescription for predicting observables associated solely with degrees of freedom accessible from the quantum reference frame. In pursuit of such a description, we show that while this is fully feasible for two-particle systems, there are irreducible difficulties that arise in many-body systems. In particular, within the framework of Galilean relativity, with absolute time, we demonstrate that a canonical and relational description with respect to a particle in the system cannot be achieved through any unitary transformation. Our findings call for new strategies to address the problem of quantum reference frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a classical mechanical oscillator coupled to the simplest quantum system, a single qubit. The qubit's influence manifests as deterministic and stochastic forces, highly dependent on its initial quantum state, imprinting unique measurable quantum-induced signatures onto the oscillator's response. The present results suggest a pathway to quantum state reconstruction through classical noise spectroscopy, with potential applications to mesoscopic optomechanical experiments, quantum metrology, and tabletop tests of the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-unique decompositions of mixed states and deterministic energy transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of non-unique decompositions of mixed states on energy transfer. Mixed states generally have non-unique decompositions into pure states in quantum theory and, by definition, in other non-classical probabilistic theories. We consider energy transfers constituting deterministic energy harvesting, wherein the source transfers energy to the harvester but not entropy. We use the possibility of non-unique decompositions to derive that if source states in a set jointly lead to deterministic energy harvesting for the given harvesting system and interaction, then that set can be expanded to include both mixtures and superpositions of the original states in the set. As a paradigmatic example, we model the source as an EM mode transferring energy to a 2-level system harvester via the Jaynes-Cummings model. We show that the set of coherent EM mode states with fixed $|\alpha|$ that jointly achieve deterministic energy transfer can be expanded to include all mixtures and superpositions of those states. More generally, the results link the defining feature of a non-classical probability theory with the ability to achieve energy transfer without entropy transfer.</description>

      <title>Qubit-optimal quantum phase estimation of block-encoded Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block-encodings have become one of the most common oracle assumptions in the circuit model. I present an algorithm that uses von Neumann's measurement procedure to measure a phase, using time evolution on a block-encoded Hamiltonian as a subroutine. This produces an extremely simple algorithm for quantum phase estimation, which can be performed with a pointer system of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ qubits.
  I then use recent results for block-encoding implementations, showing that one can efficiently prepare QPE beginning from a linear combination of Pauli strings. Using this, I give the Clifford + T complexity bound for QPE with respect to model-relevant parameters of the Hamiltonian and the desired precision. In the process, I provide a very general error analysis for Clifford + T implementations of QSP, quantum eigenvalue transformation, or quantum singular value transformation circuits.</description>

      <title>Foundations of photonic quantum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to introduce the fundamental concepts required to perform computations on photonic quantum computers by presenting the gates specific to this architecture and highlighting the connections between standard Pauli gates and those available in photonic systems. The introduction navigates between physical considerations related to the optical components used, theoretical aspects concerning quantum operators, and a more applied section introducing implementations using the Perceval library developed by Quandela. This paper is intended for engineers and researchers familiar with Pauli gates and standard quantum concepts, looking at a clear and compact introduction to photonic components. A second part aims to introduce the concept of polarization, not from a theoretical perspective, but through its practical applications. To do so, we compare the similarities and differences between the original Grover's algorithm formulation and a version that leverages polarization. Gates specific to polarization are introduced and described in the context of the computations involved in Grover's algorithm. The description provided is as mathematical as possible and deliberately avoids physical considerations, in order to allow researchers familiar with "conventional" quantum circuits to more easily grasp the concepts.</description>

      <title>Coherent Two-State Oscillations in False Vacuum Decay Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent two-state oscillations are observed in numerical simulations of one-dimensional transverse- and longitudinal-field Ising model within the false vacuum decay regimes. Starting from the false vacuum state with all spins up, in moderate-sized systems with a small transverse field, we find conventional decay dynamics at resonance conditions $ h\approx 2J/n$ can change into coherent oscillations between the false vacuum and a symmetric resonant state, manifested by a sub-leading eigenstate overlap approaching $0.5$ and periodic vanishing of the Loschmidt echo. Notably, the oscillation frequency shows a superradiant-like $\sqrt{L}$ enhancement compared to the earlier Schrieffer-Wolff predictions. In larger systems, we find these oscillations persist for $n \gtrsim L/2$ (enabled by a bubble size blockade effect) or when long-range interactions lift multi-bubble degeneracies, revealing a robust many-body coherence mechanism transcending perturbative treatments and finite-size limitations.</description>

      <title>Unifying inequalities bounding quantum speed limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the role of generalized fidelity measures in the derivation of quantum speed limits (QSLs) within a geometric approach. We establish a general theoretical structure and demonstrate that, once a specific generalized fidelity is selected, the resulting Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstam-Tamm bounds for both unitary and non-unitary (Lindblad-type) dynamics depend solely on the chosen fidelity measure. These bounds are shown to be entirely independent of the particular choice of monotonic and differentiable functionals of the selected fidelity. This result highlights the limitations of improving QSL bounds through functional transformations of fidelity and indicates that genuine improvements must stem from alternative fidelity definitions. We further show that several bounds found in the literature are encompassed by our framework. We also discuss how our results can be naturally extended by considering other generalized fidelity measures beyond those explicitly treated</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology through spectral measurements in quantum optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuously monitored quantum systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum metrology, where a central challenge is to identify measurement strategies that optimally extract information about unknown parameters encoded in the complex quantum state of emitted radiation. Different measurement strategies effectively access distinct temporal modes of the emitted field, and the resulting choice of mode can strongly impact the information available for parameter estimation. While a ubiquitous approach in quantum optics is to select frequency modes through spectral filtering, the metrological potential of this technique has not yet been systematically quantified. We develop a theoretical framework to assess this potential by modeling spectral detection as a cascaded quantum system, allowing us to reconstruct the full density matrix of frequency-filtered photonic modes and to compute their associated Fisher information. This framework provides a minimal yet general method to benchmark the performance of spectral measurements in quantum optics, allowing to identify optimal filtering strategies in terms of frequency selection, detector linewidth, and metrological gain accessible through higher-order frequency-resolved correlations and mean-field engineering. These results lay the groundwork for identifying and designing optimal sensing strategies in practical quantum-optical platforms.</description>

Abstract: We construct the most general form of our previously proposed nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics that possesses three basic properties. Unlike the simpler model, the new version is not completely integrable, but it has an underlying Hamiltonian structure. We analyze a particular solution in detail, and we use a natural extension of the Born rule to compute particle trajectories. We find that closed particle orbits are possible.</description>

      <title>DGLAP-BFKL duality from QCD to quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DGLAP integro-differential equation can be solved by applying certain map in the complex plane of Mellin moments. It may be re-written as Schr\"odinger equation for $n$ particles. By applying another map in the complex plane of Mellin moment we may re-write the DGLAP equation as a dual DGLAP equation. Regge limit of the dual DGLAP equation coincides with BFKL integro-differential equation which in turn is the Regge limit of optic theorem in quantum field theory and may be re-written as another Schr\"odinger equation. This means that the BFKL equation and the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation may be solved by the proposed method of complex mapping in the complex plane of Mellin moments. This approach may be useful in solving tasks related to quantum communication processes.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Photonic Implementation of Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) stands as a revolutionary approach to secure communication, using the principles of quantum mechanics to establish unbreakable channels. Unlike traditional cryptography, which relies on the computational difficulty of mathematical problems, QKD utilizes the inherent properties of quantum states to achieve information-theoretic security. This means that the security of the key exchange is guaranteed by the laws of physics, making it theoretically unbreakable even by an adversary with unlimited computational power. Currently, one of the most viable ways to implement QKD for communication is via photonics, namely, using phase-preserving long-distance optical fibers. The objective of this project is to implement photonic QKD in a laboratory setting. This will help demonstrate the protocol's robustness and provide a feasible implementation for educational demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Unilateral Criticality and Phase Transition in the Cavity-Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiant phase transitions from cavity light-matter coupling have been widely explored across platforms. Here, we report a unilateral critical endpoint (UCEP) and a tricritical point (TCP) in the phase diagram of the cavity-coupled transverse Ising model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. At zero temperature, we demonstrate that this model hosts three phases separated by two second-order and one first-order transitions. These lines intersect at a TCP and a UCEP, the latter not captured by existing phase-transition paradigms. The UCEP displays one-sided criticality: approaching the point from one side, the system behaves as a second-order transition, while from the other side it is first-order. Correspondingly, two order parameters, respectively, undergo the first- and the second-order phase transitions at the same point. We construct a minimal description of UCEP with the density of the free energy $f = c_{1}(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})+(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})^{2}\ln{\vert\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2}\vert}$, with the UCEP at $(c_{1},c_{2})=(1/e,0)$ and $\tilde{\alpha}$ being the order parameter. We further map the finite-temperature phase diagram and perform a symmetry analysis. By unifying first- and second-order signatures in a single, direction-dependent endpoint, the UCEP introduces a qualitatively new class of phase transition and may have applications in fields such as quantum measurement and quantum sensing. This work also provides an intriguing platform for exploring novel critical phenomena in cavity-coupled many-body systems with or without dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop Monte Carlo methods for sampling random states and corresponding bit strings in qubit systems. To this end, we derive exact probability density functions that yield the Porter-Thomas distribution in the limit of large systems. We apply these functions in importance sampling algorithms and demonstrate efficiency for qubit systems with 70, 105, 1000, and more than one million ($2^{20}$) qubits. In particular, we simulate the output of recent quantum computations without noise on a PC with minimal computational cost. I would therefore argue that random circuit sampling can be conveniently performed on classical computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of static, geometrically local Hamiltonians that inherit eigenstate properties of periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time buildup of short-range correlations in a nondegenerate ultracold Bose gas near a narrow Fano-Feshbach resonance. Using rapid optical control, we quench the closed-channel molecular energy to resonance on sub-microsecond timescales and track the evolution of the two-body contact through photo-dissociation losses. Repeated pulse sequences enhance sensitivity to early-time two-body losses and reveal long-lived coherence between atom pairs and molecular states. The observed dynamics are accurately reproduced by our dynamical two-channel zero-range theory, which explicitly accounts for the resonance's narrow width and finite closed-channel decay, establishing a predictive framework for correlation dynamics in quantum gases near Fano-Feshbach resonances.</description>

Abstract: Quantum systems of physical interest are often local, but there are at least three competing perspectives on how "locality" should be formalized: an algebraic framework, a path-integral framework, and a lattice framework. One puzzle in this competition is that systems with higher-form symmetries, which are perfectly local from the path-integral and lattice perspectives, can violate the algebraic principle of "additivity". In this paper, we propose a resolution to this puzzle by introducing a weaker locality principle, "disjoint additivity", which together with Haag duality should always be satisfied in local quantum systems. As evidence, we give examples in which disjoint additivity is preserved when ordinary additivity is violated; we show that Haag duality and disjoint additivity are satisfied in rather general lattice systems with local symmetry constraints; we give examples of nonlocal theories in which either disjoint additivity or Haag duality is violated; and finally we give examples of systems with nonlocal symmetry constraints in which disjoint additivity is violated, but can be restored by passing to a local "SymTFT" system in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Weak-link to tunneling regime in a 3D atomic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transition from weak-link transport to the tunneling Josephson regime in a three-dimensional (3D) Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a cylindrical, tube-like trap. By varying the height of a localized barrier, we map out the smooth crossover between these regimes through measurements of the critical current and Josephson oscillations. In the weak-link regime of the Josephson junction, dissipative transport is mediated by solitonic excitations in the form of vortex rings, which drive phase slips and generate a finite chemical potential difference across the junction. Increasing the barrier height suppresses these hydrodynamics excitations, yielding a tunneling-dominated Josephson regime characterized by phononic excitations. These findings elucidate the interplay between geometry, excitations, and dissipation in atomtronic weak links, and provide a quantitative framework for engineering coherent matter-wave circuits. Our results show excellent agreement with numerical simulations and analytical models.</description>

      <title>Fermion Parity Resolution of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is analyzed in the Majorana fermion conformal field theory (CFT) in the vacuum, in the fermion state, and in states built from conformal interfaces. In the boundary-state approach, Hilbert space admits two factorizations for a single interval, producing distinct entanglement spectra determined by spin structures. Although R\'enyi and relative entropiesare shown to be insensitive to these structures, symmetry-resolved entanglement naturally reveals their differences. The Majorana fermion's $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ symmetry, generated by the fermion-parity operator $F$, distinguishes bosonic from fermionic sectors, motivating the notion of fermion-parity resolution. While $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ is naturally a symmetry of the vacuum and fermion reduced density matrices, the Hilbert space factorization is shown to stabilize this symmetry in conformal interface states. When a Majorana zero mode is present, fermion-parity-resolved entropies display equipartition at all orders in the UV cutoff; in its absence, the breaking of equipartition is quantified by Ramond-sector data. This behavior persists across all states considered. Connections with symmetry-protected topological phases of matter are outlined. All results are compared with twist field computations.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of thermoelectric performance via engineered transmission functions in multi-dot Aharonov-Bohm heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate strategies for harnessing quantum interference to optimize the figure of merit $ZT$, power output, and thermodynamic efficiency in multi-quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm (AB) thermoelectric heat engines. Using the non-equilibrium Green function formalism, we show that interference effects such as Fano-type asymmetries, Dicke-like superradiant and subradiant modes, and multi-peaked transmission spectra can be tailored through device geometry, magnetic flux, and dot-lead coupling to produce hybrid transmission profiles that combine Lorentzian, boxcar, and Fano lineshapes. Such engineered profiles enable configurations that balance the high efficiency of sharp Lorentzian resonances with the high power output of boxcar-like spectra, yielding near-optimal power-efficiency trade-offs. For symmetric quantum-dot arrays in square, pentagonal, and hexagonal configurations, we identify an optimal regime, $t/\gamma \approx 2$, where the interdot tunneling amplitude $t$ and the dot-lead coupling $\gamma$ yield the best balance of power and efficiency. A hexagonal six-dot configuration achieves $ZT \sim 30$ at dilution temperatures, while the four-dot geometry reaches about $76\%$ of Carnot efficiency with output power $4.74$ fW. We also find a direct correspondence between the high-$ZT$ regime and maximal violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. Introducing source-drain coupling asymmetry further enhances both efficiency and power. A scaling analysis reveals that efficiency systematically increases with the number of quantum dots, whereas power output is maximized at intermediate system sizes. These findings establish coherent control in multi-dot nanostructures as a promising pathway toward high-performance quantum thermoelectric heat engines for ultralow-power electronics applications.</description>

      <title>Three-channel charge Kondo model at high transparency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum impurity models involving a localized charge that is weakly coupled to electronic leads usually map to Kondo-like Hamiltonians that exhibit various quantum critical behaviors. Here, we address the opposite regime of high contact transparency by solving the model of a quantum island coupled to three quantum Hall edge channels. Using a functional renormalization group (FRG) approach, we demonstrate that the low-energy physics is controlled by a nonperturbative fixed point. The universal energy crossover in both the linear conductance and the impurity entropy is obtained. We reproduce the zero-frequency conductance and the leading low-energy exponent of the three-channel Kondo model, confirming their universality across all transparencies. For interacting leads -- a model that continuously connects to the pseudo-gap Kondo model at low transparency -- we find a line of fixed points as the Luttinger parameter $K$, which encodes the strength of the interactions, changes. Our work demonstrates that FRG methods are an efficient tool for solving quantum impurity problems in regimes where standard approaches fail.</description>

      <title>State-Selective Ionization and Trapping of Single H$_2^+$ Ions with (2+1) Multiphoton Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on efficient rovibrational state-selective loading of single H$_2^+$ molecular ions into a cryogenic linear Paul trap using (2+1) resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI). The H$_2^+$ ions are created by resonant two-photon excitation of H$_2$ molecules from the $X\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state to the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state, followed by non-resonant one-photon ionization. The H$_2^+$ ions are produced from residual gas and sympathetically cooled by a co-trapped, laser-cooled $^9$Be$^+$ ion. By tuning the wavelength of the REMPI laser, we observe the loading of single H$_2^+$ ions via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 0, 1, 2, 3$) rovibrational levels of the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ intermediate state. We measure the success probability for the production of H$_2^+$ in the ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 1$) state via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 1$) level to be 85(6)% by quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) of the hyperfine structure of this rovibrational state. Furthermore, we load an H$_2^+$ ion via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 2$) level and confirm its rovibrational state to be ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 2$) by QLS. We perform QLS probes on the ion over 19 h and observe no decay of the rotationally excited state. Our work demonstrates an efficient state-selective loading mechanism for single-ion, high-precision spectroscopy of hydrogen molecular ions.</description>

      <title>Thin-film Al0.30Ga0.70As (111) as a flat source of high-purity orthogonally polarized entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-optics platforms offer new opportunities for the generation of entangled photons by relaxing traditional phase-matching constraints, enabling the use of a broader range of nonlinear materials. Among these, gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide stand out for their exceptionally high second-order nonlinearities, but their conventional orientation (001) has limited their applicability for photon-pair generation. By transitioning to crystals with (111) surface orientation, we overcome these limitations. We demonstrate a flat-optics-based telecom-range SPDC source using Al0.30Ga0.70As that achieves a high photon-pair generation rate per pump power and bandwidth of up to 0.24 Hz/mW/nm. The choice of 30% aluminum concentration allowed us to reduce pump absorption and photoluminescence background for photon pairs generation at telecom wavelengths by at least an order of magnitude compared to that of GaAs. The specific layer orientation facilitates the generation of orthogonally polarized entangled photons, a prerequisite for polarization-entangled states. Rather than directly probing entanglement, we observe the effect of hidden polarization. Our results highlight AlGaAs (111) as a promising platform for scalable quantum photonic sources and shed light on nonclassical polarization effects accessible through flat-optics engineering.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quadratic Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate minimal two-body Hamiltonians with random interactions that generate spectra resembling those of Gaussian random matrices, a phenomenon we term quadratic quantum chaos. Unlike integrable two-body fermionic systems, the corresponding hard-core boson models exhibit genuinely chaotic dynamics, closely paralleling the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in its spin representation. This chaotic behavior is diagnosed through spectral statistics and measures of operator growth, including Krylov complexity and the late-time decay of higher-order out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs); the latter reveals the emergence of freeness in the sense of free probability. Moreover, the fractal dimension and Stabilizer Renyi entropy of a representative mid-spectrum eigenstate show finite-size deviations yet converge toward Haar-randomness as the system size increases. This convergence, constrained by local interactions, highlights the "weakly chaotic" character of these eigenstates. Owing to its simplicity and bosonic nature, these minimal models may constitute promising and resource-efficient candidates for probing quantum chaos and information scrambling on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in classical spin systems the precise nature of the late-time hydrodynamic tails of the autocorrelation functions of a generic observable is determined by (i) the dynamical critical exponent and (ii) the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the corresponding observable. We provide numerical results for one- and two-dimensional systems and present theoretical considerations that only rely on the notion of ergodicity. Our result extends to the classical framework the relaxation-overlap inequality, first introduced in Capizzi et al. Phys. Rev. X 15, 011059 (2025)] for quantum many-body systems satisfying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the role of time ordering in entanglement experiments involving unstable particles, focusing on $\mu^+ \mu^-$ pairs produced in a maximally-entangled spin state. We analyse the correlations between measurements performed by two experimenters, Alice (who measures $\mu^-$ spin) and Bob (who measures $\mu^+$ decay products). Remarkably, the observed correlations persist irrespective of whether Bob's muon decays before or after Alice's spin measurement. We further discuss different interpretations of the same empirical results depending on the observer's reference frame. The findings reinforce the viewpoint that the Copenhagen interpretation of measurement is a mathematical tool rather than a literal account of physical reality.</description>

Abstract: StoqMA characterizes the computational hardness of stoquastic local Hamiltonians, which is a family of Hamiltonians that does not suffer from the sign problem. Although error reduction is commonplace for many complexity classes, such as BPP, BQP, MA, QMA, etc.,this property remains open for StoqMA since Bravyi, Bessen and Terhal defined this class in 2006. In this note, we show that error reduction forStoqMA will imply that StoqMA = MA.</description>

      <title>Measurement dependence in a Bell inequality arising from the dynamics of hidden variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell inequalities rely on an assumption that the probabilities of adopting configurations of hidden variables describing a system prior to measurement are independent of the choice of measured physical property, also known as measurement independence. Weakening this assumption could alter the inequalities to accommodate experimental data whilst maintaining local interactions. A natural avenue for achieving this would be to model measurement as a dynamical process involving an interaction between the system and its environment (the measurement apparatus), that drives the hidden variables towards attractors representing measurement outcomes of the observable. Implementing such hidden variable dynamics, we can infer from observed correlations the hidden variable probability distributions before measurement, which differ according to which measurement settings were chosen. We explore various models of the dynamics of the hidden variables under measurement, revealing features that can create measurement dependence and others that can not.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Maxwell Demon-assistant Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering via Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>

Abstract: The concept of Maxwell demon plays an essential role in connecting thermodynamics and information theory, while entanglement and non-locality are fundamental features of quantum theory. Given the rapid advancements in the field of quantum information science, there is a growing interest and significance in investigating the connection between Maxwell demon and quantum correlation. The majority of research endeavors thus far have been directed towards the extraction of work from quantum correlation through the utilization of Maxwell demon. Recently, a novel concept called Maxwell demon-assistant Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering has been proposed, which suggests that it is possible to simulate quantum correlation by doing work. This seemingly counterintuitive conclusion is attributed to the fact that Alice and Bob need classical communication during EPR steering task, a requirement that does not apply in the Bell test. In this study, we demonstrate Maxwell demon-assistant EPR steering with superconducting quantum circuits. By compiling and optimizing a quantum circuit to be implemented on a 2D superconducting chip, we were able to achieve a steering parameter of $S_{2} = 0.770 \pm 0.005$ in the case of two measurement settings, which surpasses the classical bound of $1/\sqrt{2}$ by 12.6 standard deviations. In addition, experimental observations have revealed a linear correlation between the non-locality demonstrated in EPR steering and the work done by the demon. Considering the errors in practical operation, the experimental results are highly consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings not only suggest the presence of a Maxwell demon loophole in the EPR steering, but also contribute to a deeper comprehension of the interplay between quantum correlation, information theory, and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanical State Amplifier Based on Optical Inverted Pendulum</title>

Abstract: A contactless control of mean values and fluctuations of position and velocity of a nanoobject belongs among the key methods needed for ultra-precise nanotechnology and the upcoming quantum technology of macroscopic systems. An analysis of experimental implementations of such a control, including assessments of linearity and the effects of added noise, is required. Here, we present a protocol of linear amplification of mean values and fluctuations along an arbitrary phase space variable and squeezing along the complementary one, referred to as a nanomechanical state amplifier. It utilizes the experimental platform of a single optically levitating nanoparticle and the three-step protocol combines a controlled fast switching of the parabolic trapping potential to an inverted parabolic potential and back to the parabolic potential. The protocol can be sequentially repeated or extended to shape the nanomechanical state appropriately. Experimentally, we achieve amplification of position with a gain of $|G| \simeq 2$ and a classical squeezing coefficient above 4 dB in as short a timestep as one period of nanoparticle oscillations ($7.6\,\mu$s). Amplification in velocity, with the same parameters, squeezes the input noise and enhances force sensing.</description>

      <title>Wigner-negative states in the steady-state emission of a two-level system driven by squeezed light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Propagating modes of light with negative-valued Wigner distributions are of fundamental interest in quantum optics and represent a key resource in the pursuit of optics-based quantum information technologies. Most schemes proposed or implemented for the generation of such modes are probabilistic in nature and rely on heralding by detection of a photon or on conditional methods where photons are separated from the original field mode by a beam splitter. In this Letter we demonstrate theoretically, using a cascaded-quantum-systems model, the possibility of deterministic generation of Wigner-negativity in temporal modes of the steady-state emission of a two-level system driven by finite-bandwidth quadrature-squeezed light. Optimal negativity is obtained for a squeezing bandwidth similar to the linewidth of the transition of the two-level system. While the Wigner distribution associated with the incident squeezed light is Gaussian and everywhere positive, the Wigner functions of the outgoing temporal modes show distinct similarities and overlap with a superposition of displaced squeezed states.</description>

      <title>Shadow Quantum Linear Solver: A Resource Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Linear Systems of Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the solution to linear systems is at the heart of many applications in science and technology. Over the years a number of algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem on a digital quantum device, yet most of these are too demanding to be applied to the current noisy hardware. In this work, an original algorithmic procedure to solve the Quantum Linear System Problem (QLSP) is presented, which combines ideas from Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) and the framework of classical shadows. The result is the Shadow Quantum Linear Solver (SQLS), a quantum algorithm solving the QLSP avoiding the need for large controlled unitaries, requiring a number of qubits that is logarithmic in the system size. In particular, our heuristics show an exponential advantage of the SQLS in circuit execution per cost function evaluation when compared to other notorious variational approaches to solving linear systems of equations. We test the convergence of the SQLS on a number of linear systems, and results highlight how the theoretical bounds on the number of resources used by the SQLS are conservative. Finally, we apply this algorithm to a physical problem of practical relevance, by leveraging decomposition theorems from linear algebra to solve the discretized Laplace Equation in a 2D grid for the first time using a hybrid quantum algorithm.</description>

      <title>Efficient Entanglement Routing for Satellite-Aerial-Terrestrial Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of 6G and beyond, space-aerial-terrestrial quantum networks (SATQNs) are shaping the future of the global-scale quantum Internet. This paper investigates the collaboration among satellite, aerial, and terrestrial quantum networks to efficiently transmit high-fidelity quantum entanglements over long distances. We begin with a comprehensive overview of existing satellite-, aerial-, and terrestrial-based quantum networks. Subsequently, we address the entanglement routing problem with the objective of maximizing quantum network throughput by jointly optimizing path selection and entanglement generation rates (PS-EGR). Given that the original problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is inherently intractable, we propose a Benders' decomposition (BD)-based algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed PS-EGR scheme, offering valuable insights into various optimizable factors within the system. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and propose promising avenues for future research in SATQNs.</description>

Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, understanding the interplay between locality, thermal constraints, and communication remains an open challenge. In this manuscript, we introduce Local Thermal Operations and Classical Communication (LTOCC), a novel operational framework that unifies the distant laboratories paradigm with thermodynamic restrictions, defining the fundamental limits on transformations between spatially separated systems. We establish a hierarchy of LTOCC protocols, demonstrating inclusion relations between different levels and revealing their deep connection to semilocal thermal operations. To formalize this framework, we develop thermal tensors and bithermal tensors, extending stochastic and tristochastic tensors to thermodynamic settings and providing new mathematical tools for constrained quantum processes. Finally, we present limitations imposed by LTOCC on single- and multi-copy CHSH scenario, demonstrating no violation in former and a gap between thermal and athermal local operations in the latter with respect to their capability to detect entanglement.</description>

      <title>Exponential improvements to the average-case hardness of BosonSampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BosonSampling and Random Circuit Sampling are important both as a theoretical tool for separating quantum and classical computation, and as an experimental means of demonstrating quantum speedups. Prior works have shown that average-case hardness of sampling follows from certain unproven conjectures about the hardness of computing output probabilities, such as the Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture (PGC), which states that $e^{-n\log{n}-n-O(\log n)}$ additive-error estimates to the output probability of most random BosonSampling experiments are $\#P$-hard. Prior works have only shown weaker average-case hardness results that do not imply sampling hardness. Proving these conjectures has become a central question in quantum complexity.
  In this work, we show that $e^{-n\log n-n-O(n^\delta)}$ additive-error estimates to output probabilities of most random BosonSampling experiments are $\#P$-hard for any $\delta&gt;0$, exponentially improving on prior work. In the process, we circumvent all known barrier results for proving PGC. The remaining hurdle to prove PGC is now "merely" to show that the $O(n^\delta)$ in the exponent can be improved to $O(\log n).$ We also obtain an analogous result for Random Circuit Sampling.
  We then show, for the first time, a hardness of average-case classical sampling result for BosonSampling, under an anticoncentration conjecture. Specifically, we prove the impossibility of multiplicative-error sampling from random BosonSampling experiments with probability $1-2^{-\tilde{\mathstrut O}(N^{1/3})}$ for input size $N$, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses. This exponentially improves upon the state-of-the-art. To do this, we introduce new proof techniques which tolerate exponential loss in the worst-to-average-case reduction. This opens the possibility to show the hardness of average-case sampling without ever proving PGC.</description>

      <title>Emergent disorder and sub-ballistic dynamics in quantum simulations of the Ising model using Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays with Van der Waals interactions provide a controllable path to simulate the locally connected transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), a prototypical model in statistical mechanics. Remotely operating the publicly accessible Aquila Rydberg atom array, we experimentally investigate the physics of TFIM far from equilibrium and uncover significant deviations from the theoretical predictions. Rather than the expected ballistic spread of correlations, the Rydberg simulator exhibits a subballistic spread, along with a logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy in time - all while the system mostly retains its initial magnetization. By modeling the atom motion, we trace these effects to an emergent disorder in Rydberg atom arrays, which we characterize with a minimal random spin model. We further experimentally explore the different dynamical regimes hosted in the system by varying the lattice spacing and the Rabi frequency. Our findings highlight the crucial role of atom motion in the many-body dynamics of Rydberg atom arrays at the TFIM limit, and propose simple benchmark measurements to test for its presence in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Generating non-Clifford gate operations through exact mapping between Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana fermions and their generalizations to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ parafermions are considered promising building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers for their ability to encode quantum information nonlocally. In such topological quantum computers, highly robust quantum gates are obtained by braiding pairs of these quasi-particles. However, it is well-known that braiding Majorana fermions or parafermions only leads to a Clifford gate, hindering quantum universality. This paper establishes an exact mapping between Majorana fermions to $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions in systems under total parity non-conserving and total parity conserving setting. It is revealed that braiding of Majorana fermions may lead to non-Clifford quantum gates in the 4-dimensional qudit representation spanned by $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions, whilst braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions may similarly yield non-Clifford quantum gates in the qubit representation spanned by Majorana fermions. This finding suggests that topologically protected universal quantum computing may be possible with Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) by supplementing the usual braiding operations with the braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions (Majorana fermions) that could be formed out of Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) via the mapping prescribed here. Finally, the paper discusses how braiding of Majorana fermions or $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions could be obtained via a series of parity measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present BAE, a problem-tailored and noise-aware Bayesian algorithm for quantum amplitude estimation. In a fault tolerant scenario, BAE is capable of saturating the Heisenberg limit; if device noise is present, BAE can dynamically characterize it and self-adapt. We further propose aBAE, an annealed variant of BAE drawing on methods from statistical inference, to enhance robustness. Our proposals are parallelizable in both quantum and classical components, offer tools for fast noise model assessment, and can leverage preexisting information. Additionally, they accommodate experimental limitations and preferred cost trade-offs. We propose a robust benchmark for amplitude estimation algorithms and use it to test BAE against other approaches, demonstrating its competitive performance in both noisy and noiseless scenarios. In both cases, it achieves lower error than any other algorithm as a function of the cost. In the presence of decoherence, it is capable of learning when other algorithms fail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum dynamics, symmetries are vital for identifying and assessing conserved quantities that govern the evolution of a quantum system. When promoted to the open quantum system setting, dynamical symmetries can be negatively altered by system-environment interactions, thus, complicating their analysis. Previous work on noisy symmetric quantum dynamics has focused on the Markovian setting, despite the ubiquity of non-Markovian noise in a number of widely used quantum technologies. In this Letter, we develop a framework for quantifying the impact of non-Markovian noise on symmetric quantum evolution via root space decompositions and the filter function formalism. We demonstrate analytically that symmetry-preserving noise maintains the symmetric subspace, while nonsymmetric noise leads to highly specific leakage errors that are block diagonal in the symmetry representation. We support our findings with numerical studies of a transverse-field Ising model and a quantum error detecting code subject to spatiotemporally correlated multiaxis noise. Our results are broadly applicable, providing new analytic insights into the control and characterization of open quantum system dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Random exchanges of energy arise naturally in stochastic systems. As a consequence, apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics can occur, as it holds true on average. Here we investigate the occurrence of these apparent violations -- termed free lunches -- in a quantum-classical system comprised of levitated nanoparticles exchanging energy via the Coulomb interaction. We consider different initial states for the quantum system, and how these exert work and fluctuations upon the classical particle affecting the probability of free lunches. With that, we initiate the study of hybrid quantum-classical systems through the lens of stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Bounding the computational power of bosonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum systems operate in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, unlike discrete-variable quantum systems. This distinct mathematical structure leads to fundamental differences in quantum information processing, such as an exponentially greater complexity of state tomography [MMB+24] or a factoring algorithm in constant space [BCCRK24]. Yet, it remains unclear whether this structural difference of bosonic systems may also translate to a practical computational advantage over finite-dimensional quantum computers. Here we take a step towards answering this question by showing that universal bosonic quantum computations can be simulated in polynomial space (and exponential time) on a classical computer, significantly improving the best previous upper bound requiring exponential memory [CJMM24]. In complexity-theoretic terms, we improve the best upper bound on $\textsf{CVBQP}$ from $ \textsf{EXPSPACE}$ to $\textsf{PSPACE}$. This result is achieved using a simulation strategy based on finite energy cutoffs and approximate coherent state decompositions. While we propose ways to potentially refine this bound, we also present arguments supporting the plausibility of an exponential computational advantage of bosonic quantum computers over their discrete-variable counterparts. Furthermore, we emphasize the role of circuit energy as a resource and discuss why it may act as the fundamental bottleneck in realizing this advantage in practical implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum processes is indispensable for the implementation of any task in quantum information processing. In this paper, we develop an efficient method to fully characterize arbitrary Gaussian processes in continuous-variable quantum systems. This is done by directly obtaining all elements of the symplectic matrix that describes the process. Only Gaussian resources such as coherent probes and quadrature measurements are needed for this task. The method is efficient, involving only $O(N^2)$ steps to characterize an $N$-mode system. Further, the method is resilient to uniform loss. We simulate this procedure using the Python package Strawberry Fields. We observe that heterodyne measurements outperform homodyne measurements for reconstructing Gaussian processes.</description>

Abstract: We present a design and modeling of a scalable quantum processor architecture utilizing hole-spin qubits defined in gate-controlled germanium (Ge) quantum dots, where coherent spin-phonon coupling is predicted to facilitate qubit manipulation and long-range interactions. The architecture exploits the strong, electrically tunable spin-orbit interactions intrinsic to hole states in Ge, integrated with high-quality phononic crystal cavities (PnCCs) to enable fully electrical qubit control and phonon-mediated coupling. Employing a streamlined simulation framework built upon multiband \(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}\) modeling and finite-element methods, we quantify key performance metrics, including electrically tunable \( g \)-factors ranging from \(1.3\) to \(2.0\), spin-phonon coupling strengths up to \(6.3\,\mathrm{MHz}\), phononic cavity quality factors exceeding \(10^4\), and phonon-mediated spin relaxation times (\(T_1\)) reaching milliseconds. The proposed architecture concurrently achieves extended spin coherence and rapid gate operations through strategic electric field modulation and engineered phononic bandgap environments. Furthermore, isotopically enriched high-purity Ge crystals grown in-house at the University of South Dakota, significantly enhance device coherence by minimizing disorder and hyperfine interactions. This integrated approach, merging advanced materials engineering, precise spin-orbit coupling, and phononic cavity design, establishes a promising CMOS-compatible pathway toward scalable, high-fidelity quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations without quantum corrections: A coherent-incoherent correspondence approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the coherent-incoherent correspondence as a framework for deriving quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations under continuous measurement in Lindblad dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence establishes a mapping between the original quantum system that undergoes \textit{ coherent} evolution and its corresponding \textit{incoherent} system without coherent dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence relates quantities across these two systems, including jump statistics, dynamical activity, and entropy production. Since the classical-like properties of the incoherent system allow us to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations within it, these relations can be transferred to the coherent system via the coherent-incoherent correspondence. This enables us to derive quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the original coherent system. Unlike existing quantum uncertainty relations, which typically require explicit quantum correction terms, our approach avoids these additional terms. This means that we can establish a lower bound for quantum entropy production using only current statistics. This approach opens up new possibilities for inferring entropy production in quantum systems. Through numerical calculations for a model with coherent jump operators, we show that steady-state coherence lowers the bounds on precision (i.e., allows higher precision).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the compact convex set of all bi-partite states of Schmidt number less than or equal to $k$, together with that of $k$-blockpositive matrices of trace one, which play the roles of Schmidt number witnesses. In this note, we look for hyperplanes which support those convex sets and are perpendicular to a one parameter family through the maximally mixed state. We show that this is equivalent to determining the intervals for the dual objects on the one parameter family. We illustrate our results for the one parameter families including Werner states and isotropic states. Through the discussion, we give a simple decomposition of the separable Werner state into the sum of product states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics (QM) where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Our approach replaces the standard dependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric algebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish the treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution can be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum action operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral (PI) formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are solutions to a quantum principle of stationary action enabled by the novel notion of timelike correlations.</description>

      <title>Exceptional point rings and $PT$-symmetry in the non-Hermitian XY model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The XY spin chain is a paradigmatic example of a model solved by free fermions, in which the energy eigenspectrum is built from combinations of quasi-energies. In this article we show that by extending the XY model's anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ to complex values, it is possible for two of the quasi-energies to become degenerate. In the non-Hermitian XY model these quasi-energy degeneracies give rise to exceptional points (EPs) where two of the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The distinct $\lambda$ values at which EPs appear form concentric rings in the complex plane which are shown in the infinite system size limit to converge to the unit circle coinciding with the boundary between distinct topological phases. The non-Hermitian model is also seen to possess a line of broken $PT$ symmetry along the pure imaginary $\lambda$-axis. For finite systems, there are four EP values on this broken $PT$-symmetric line if the system size is a multiple of 4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computing, sensing, timing, and networking technologies mature, quantum network testbeds are being deployed across the United States and around the world. To support the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)'s mission of building heterogeneous quantum networks, we report on the development of Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs) operating at telecommunications-band frequencies. The multi-node, reconfigurable QLANs include deployed optical fiber and free-space links connected to pristine laboratory environments and rugged outdoor test facilities. Each QLAN is tailored to distinct operating conditions and use cases, with unique environmental characteristics and capabilities. We present network topologies and in-depth link characterization data for three such networks. Using photonic integrated circuit-based sources of entangled photons, we demonstrate entanglement distribution of time-energy Bell states across deployed fiber in a wooded environment. The high quality of the entanglement is confirmed by a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality violation of $S=2.717$, approaching the theoretical maximum of $S=2.828$. We conclude with a discussion of future work aimed at expanding QLAN functionality and enabling entanglement distribution between heterogeneous matter-based quantum systems, including superconducting qubits and trapped ions. These results underscore the practical viability of field-deployable, qubit-agnostic quantum network infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Vectorized Attention with Learnable Encoding for Quantum Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vectorized quantum block encoding provides a way to embed classical data into Hilbert space, offering a pathway for quantum models, such as Quantum Transformers (QT), that replace classical self-attention with quantum circuit simulations to operate more efficiently. Current QTs rely on deep parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), rendering them vulnerable to QPU noise, and thus hindering their practical performance. In this paper, we propose the Vectorized Quantum Transformer (VQT), a model that supports ideal masked attention matrix computation through quantum approximation simulation and efficient training via vectorized nonlinear quantum encoder, yielding shot-efficient and gradient-free quantum circuit simulation (QCS) and reduced classical sampling overhead. In addition, we demonstrate an accuracy comparison for IBM and IonQ in quantum circuit simulation and competitive results in benchmarking natural language processing tasks on IBM state-of-the-art and high-fidelity Kingston QPU. Our noise intermediate-scale quantum friendly VQT approach unlocks a novel architecture for end-to-end machine learning in quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study scattering in the quantum Ising model in two dimensions. In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.</description>

      <title>Observation of self-oscillating supersonic flow across an acoustic horizon in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics and stability of transonic flows in quantum fluids, especially for those beyond one spatial dimension, is an outstanding challenge, with applications ranging from nonlinear optics and condensed matter to analogue gravity. One intriguing possibility is that a system with a spatially bounded supersonic flow may evolve into a self-oscillating state that periodically emits solitons, in a process originating from the well-known Landau instability. Here, we report observation of self-oscillating supersonic flows in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid. By imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial flow forming an acoustic analogue of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by quasi-periodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and find agreement with numerical simulations of soliton oscillation frequencies within the black-hole horizon. The presented experiment demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids, which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime, supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum optimization has emerged as a promising frontier of quantum computing, providing novel numerical approaches to mathematical optimization problems. The main goal of this paper is to facilitate interdisciplinary research between the Operations Research (OR) and Quantum Computing communities by helping OR scientists to build initial intuition for-, and offering them a hands-on gateway to quantum-powered methods in the context of discrete optimization. To this end, we consider three quantum-powered optimization approaches that make use of different types of quantum hardware available on the market. To illustrate these approaches, we solve three classical optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Weighted Maximum Cut, and Maximum Independent Set. With a general OR audience in mind, we attempt to provide an intuition behind each approach along with key references, describe the corresponding high-level workflow, and highlight crucial practical considerations. In particular, we emphasize the importance of problem formulations and device-specific configurations, and their impact on the amount of resources required for computation (where we focus on the number of qubits). These points are illustrated with a series of experiments on three types of quantum computers: a neutral atom machine from QuEra, a quantum annealer from D-Wave, and gate-based devices from IBM.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, often lead to breakthroughs in the our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.</description>

      <title>Transferable Belief Model on Quantum Circuits</title>

Abstract: The transferable belief model, as a semantic interpretation of Dempster-Shafer theory, enables agents to perform reasoning and decision making in imprecise and incomplete environments. The model offers distinct semantics for handling unreliable testimonies, allowing for a more reasonable and general process of belief transfer compared to the Bayesian approach. However, because both the belief masses and the structure of focal sets must be considered when updating belief functions-leading to extra computational complexity during reasoning-the transferable belief model has gradually lost favor among researchers in recent developments. In this paper, we implement the transferable belief model on quantum circuits and demonstrate that belief functions offer a more concise and effective alternative to Bayesian approaches within the quantum computing framework. Furthermore, leveraging the unique characteristics of quantum computing, we propose several novel belief transfer approaches. More broadly, this paper introduces a new perspective on basic information representation for quantum AI models, suggesting that belief functions are more suitable than Bayesian approach for handling uncertainty on quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</description>

Abstract: We reveal a hidden electrodynamical structure emerging from a general $2\times2$ pseudo-Hermitian system that exhibits real spectra. Even when the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the Berry curvature can be mapped onto a $2+1$ dimensional electromagnetic field arising from an artificial spacetime instanton, in sharp contrast to the Hermitian systems where the Berry curvature is equivalent to the static magnetic field of a magnetic monopole in three spatial dimensions. The instanton appearing as a spacetime singularity carries a topological charge that quantizes the jump of magnetic flux of the Berry curvature at the time origin. Our findings are demonstrated in a simple example related to antiferromagnetic magnons.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer between localized emitters in photonic cavities from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO at ~10nm distances from a dipolar source, using rather moderate cavity with quality factor Q~400. We also show that a similar suppression in the transfer rate can be achieved by off-tuning the cavity resonance relative to the emitter transition energy. The framework presented here is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>Laser-dressed partial density of states</title>

Abstract: The manipulation of material properties by laser light holds great promise for the development of future technologies. However, the full picture of the electronic response to laser driving remains to be uncovered. We present a novel approach to reveal details of the electron dynamics of laser-dressed materials, which consists of calculating and analysing the time-dependent partial density of states (PDOS) of materials during their interaction with a driving electromagnetic field. We show that the laser-dressed PDOS provides information about the structure of the bonds that form the laser-dressed electron density, analogous to the information that a PDOS can provide about the electron structure in a field-free case. We illustrate how our method can provide insights into the electron dynamics of materials in a site- and orbital-selective manner with calculations for a laser-dressed wurtzite ZnO crystal. Our work provides an analytical tool for the interpretation of subcycle-resolved experiments on laser-dressed materials and for the development of strategies for optical manipulation of material properties.</description>

      <title>Residual gauge theory for quanta of surface plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a gauge-theoretical framework to investigate the quanta of surface plasmons. Our formulation, based on quantum electrodynamics, highlights the importance of residual gauge symmetry. We emphasize that residual gauge symmetry, which imposes constraint equations on physical states, is fundamentally linked to Joule heating. This framework is applied to metals, semiconductors, and quantum Hall states, suggesting the presence of a latent transverse electric mode and that the quanta have the ability to maintain light-matter entanglement.</description>

      <title>Distinct Lifetimes for $X$ and $Z$ Loop Measurements in a Majorana Tetron Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a hardware realization and measurements of a tetron qubit device in a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure. The device architecture contains two parallel superconducting nanowires, which support four Majorana zero modes (MZMs) when tuned into the topological phase, and a trivial superconducting backbone. Two distinct readout interferometers are formed by connecting the superconducting structure to a series of quantum dots. We perform single-shot interferometric measurements of the fermion parity for the two loops, designed to implement Pauli-$X$ and $Z$ measurements of the tetron. Performing repeated single-shot measurements yields two widely separated time scales $\tau_X = 14.5\pm 0.3 \, \mathrm{\mu s}$ and $\tau_Z = 12.4\pm 0.4\, \mathrm{ms}$ for parity switches observed in the $X$ and $Z$ measurement loops, which we attribute to intra-wire parity switches and external quasiparticle poisoning, respectively. We estimate assignment errors of $\mathrm{err}^X_a=16\%$ and $\mathrm{err}^Z_a=0.5\%$ for $X$ and $Z$ measurement-based operations, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Compositional Quantum Control Flow with Efficient Compilation in Qunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing quantum programming languages are based on the quantum circuit model of computation, as higher-level abstractions are particularly challenging to implement - especially ones relating to quantum control flow. The Qunity language, proposed by Voichick et al., offered such an abstraction in the form of a quantum control construct, with great care taken to ensure that the resulting language is still realizable. However, Qunity lacked a working implementation, and the originally proposed compilation procedure was very inefficient, with even simple quantum algorithms compiling to unreasonably large circuits.
  In this work, we focus on the efficient compilation of high-level quantum control flow constructs, using Qunity as our starting point. We introduce a wider range of abstractions on top of Qunity's core language that offer compelling trade-offs compared to its existing control construct. We create a complete implementation of a Qunity compiler, which converts high-level Qunity code into the quantum assembly language OpenQASM 3. We develop optimization techniques for multiple stages of the Qunity compilation procedure, including both low-level circuit optimizations as well as methods that consider the high-level structure of a Qunity program, greatly reducing the number of qubits and gates used by the compiler.</description>

      <title>FFTArray: A Python Library for the Implementation of Discretized Multi-Dimensional Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations describing the dynamics of physical systems rarely have closed-form solutions. Fourier spectral methods, which use Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to approximate solutions, are a common approach to solving these equations. However, mapping Fourier integrals to discrete FFTs is not straightforward, as the selection of the grid as well as the coordinate-dependent phase and scaling factors require special care. Moreover, most software packages that deal with this step integrate it tightly into their full-stack implementations. Such an integrated design sacrifices generality, making it difficult to adapt to new coordinate systems, boundary conditions, or problem-specific requirements. To address these challenges, we present FFTArray, a Python library that automates the general discretization of Fourier transforms. Its purpose is to reduce the barriers to developing high-performance, maintainable code for pseudo-spectral Fourier methods. Its interface enables the direct translation of textbook equations and complex research problems into code, and its modular design scales naturally to multiple dimensions. This makes the definition of valid coordinate grids straightforward, while coordinate grid specific corrections are applied with minimal impact on computational performance. Built on the Python Array API Standard, FFTArray integrates seamlessly with array backends like NumPy, JAX and PyTorch and supports Graphics Processing Unit acceleration.

      <title>A spacetime-covariant approach to inertial and accelerated quantum clocks in first-quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity will radically alter our current notion of spacetime geometry. However, contrary to what was commonly assumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much larger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the superposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems whose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very promising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this work, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant formalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account for the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings with external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the (quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when attainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in terms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When this decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even with couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We then apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of quantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii) charged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our clocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix $\rho_{\tau_2|\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields not only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical expected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum fluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile.</description>

      <title>Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</description>
