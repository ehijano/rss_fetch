      <title>GJ 2126 b: A highly eccentric Jovian exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of GJ 2126 b, a highly eccentric (e = 0.85) Jupiter-like planet orbiting its host star every 272.7 days. The planet was detected and characterized using 112 radial velocity (RV) measurements from HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher), provided by HARPS-RVBank. This planet orbits a low-mass star and ranks among the most eccentric exoplanets discovered, placing it in a unique region of the parameter space of the known exoplanet population. This makes it a valuable addition to the exoplanet demographics, helping to refine our understanding of planetary formation and evolution theories.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on MASCARA-1b: A combined analysis of pre- and post-eclipse emission data using CRIRES+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution emission spectroscopy observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter MASCARA-1b with CRIRES+ in the K-band, covering the post-eclipse phases of its orbit. These observations complement previously published pre-eclipse data. The stellar and telluric features were removed using SysRem, and the planetary signal was analysed with the cross-correlation technique. After confirming the presence of chemical species in our atmospheric model, we combined the pre- and post-eclipse datasets for a joint analysis. By employing a Bayesian retrieval framework, this joint retrieval enabled us to constrain the spatially varying temperature-pressure (T-P) profile and atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. We detected strong emission signatures of CO and H$_2$O in the post-eclipse and combined datasets. While a well-mixed retrieval model results in a super-solar C/O, allowing for vertically varying chemistry yields C/O values consistent with solar. The retrieved parameters are not only consistent across the datasets but also across different chemical regimes. We did not identify any significant velocity shifts between the detected species or across the datasets, which could otherwise serve as proxies for possible atmospheric dynamics. We also explored phase dependence through the model scaling factor and found no substantial changes in atmospheric properties throughout the observed phases. Due to strong degeneracies between the temperature gradient and chemical abundances, our retrieved temperatures are broadly consistent with either a full redistribution of heat or strong day-night contrasts. While this complicates direct comparisons with recent Spitzer phase curve analyses suggesting inefficient recirculation, we find no clear evidence of spatial variation in the chemical or temperature structure of MASCARA-1b from pre- to post-eclipse, nor temporal variation over $\approx$2 years.</description>

      <title>A Spiral Structure in the Inner Oort Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the Galactic tide acts to decouple bodies from the scattered disk it creates a spiral structure in physical space that is roughly 15,000 au in length. The spiral is long-lived and persists in the inner Oort cloud to the present time. Here we discuss dynamics underlying the Oort spiral and (feeble) prospects for its observational detection.</description>

      <title>A very young tau-Herculid meteor cluster observed during a 2022 shower outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date only very few meteor clusters have been instrumentally recorded. This means that every new detection is an important contribution to the understanding of these phenomena, which are thought to be evidence of the meteoroid fragmentation in the Solar System. On 31 May 2022, at 6:48:55 UT, a cluster consisting of 52 meteors was detected within 8.5 seconds during a predicted outburst of the tau-Herculid meteor shower. The aim of this paper is to reconstruct the atmospheric trajectories of the meteors and use the collected information to deduce the origin of the cluster. The meteors were recorded by two video cameras during an airborne campaign. Due to only the single station observation, their trajectories were estimated under the assumption that they belonged to the meteor shower. The mutual positions of the fragments, together with their photometric masses, was used to model the processes leading to the formation of the cluster. The physical properties of the cluster meteors are very similar to the properties of the tau-Herculids. This finding confirms the assumption of the shower membership used for the computation of atmospheric trajectories. This was the third cluster that we have studied in detail, but the first one where we do not see the mass separation of the particles. The cluster is probably less than 2.5 days old, which is too short for such a complete mass separation. Such an age would imply disintegration due to thermal stress. However, we cannot rule out an age of only a few hours, which would allow for other fragmentation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Searching for Low-Mass Exoplanets Amid Stellar Variability with a Fixed Effects Linear Model of Line-by-Line Shape Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radial velocity (RV) method, also known as Doppler spectroscopy, is a powerful technique for exoplanet discovery and characterization. In recent years, progress has been made thanks to the improvements in the quality of spectra from new extreme precision RV spectrometers. However, detecting the RV signals of Earth-like exoplanets remains challenging, as the spectroscopic signatures of low-mass planets can be obscured or confused with intrinsic stellar variability. Changes in the shapes of spectral lines across time can provide valuable information for disentangling stellar activity from true Doppler shifts caused by low-mass exoplanets. In this work, we present a fixed effects linear model to estimate RV signals that controls for changes in line shapes by aggregating information from hundreds of spectral lines. Our methodology incorporates a wild-bootstrap approach for modeling uncertainty and cross-validation to control for overfitting. We evaluate the model's ability to remove stellar activity using solar observations from the NEID spectrograph, as the sun's true center-of-mass motion is precisely known. Including line shape-change covariates reduces the RV root-mean-square errors by approximately 70% (from 1.919 m s$^{-1}$ to 0.575 m s$^{-1}$) relative to using only the line-by-line Doppler shifts. The magnitude of the residuals is significantly less than that from traditional CCF-based RV estimators and comparable to other state-of-the-art methods for mitigating stellar variability.</description>

      <title>Solar System Elemental Abundances from the Solar Photosphere and CI-Chondrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar photospheric abundances and CI-chondrite compositions are reviewed and updated to obtain representative solar system abundances of the elements and their isotopes. The new photospheric abundances obtained here lead to higher solar metallicity. Full 3D NLTE photospheric analyses are only available for 11 elements. A quality index for analyses is introduced. For several elements, uncertainties remain large. Protosolar mass fractions are H (X = 0.7060), He (Y = 0.2753), and for metals Li to U (Z = 0.0187). The protosolar (C+N)/H agrees within 13% with the ratio for the solar core from the Borexino experiment. Elemental abundances in CI-chondrites were screened by analytical methods, sample sizes, and evaluated using concentration frequency distributions. Aqueously mobile elements (e.g., alkalis, alkaline earths, etc.) often deviate from normal distributions indicating mobilization and/or sequestration into carbonates, phosphates, and sulfates. Revised CI-chondrite abundances of non-volatile elements are similar to earlier estimates. The moderately volatile elements F and Sb are higher than before, as are C, Br and I, whereas the CI-abundances of Hg and N are now significantly lower. The solar system nuclide distribution curves of s-process elements agree within 4% with s-process predictions of Galactic chemical evolution models. P-process nuclide distributions are assessed. No obvious correlation of CI-chondritic to solar elemental abundance ratios with condensation temperatures is observed, nor is there one for ratios of CI-chondrites/solar wind abundances.</description>

      <title>Connecting Earth and Moon via the L1 Lagrangian point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renewed global interest in lunar exploration requires new orbital strategies to ensure flight safety which can benefit extended lunar missions and service a plethora of planned instruments in the lunar orbit and surface. We investigate here the equivalent fuel consumption cost to transfer from (to) a given orbit and enter (leave) at any point of an invariant manifold associated with a Lyapunov orbit around the Earth-Moon $L_1$ Lagrangian point using bi-impulsive maneuvers. Whereas solving this type of transfer is generally computationally expensive, we simulate here tens of millions of transfers orbits, for different times of flight, Jacobi constants and spatial location on the manifold. We are able to reduce computational cost by taking advantage of the efficient procedure given by the Theory of Functional Connections for solving boundary value problems, represented with special constraints created to the purposes of this work. We develop here the methodology for constructing these transfers, and apply it to find a low-cost transfer from an orbit around the Earth to a stable manifold and another low-cost transfer from an unstable manifold to an orbit around the Moon. In the end, we obtain an innovative Earth-to-Moon transfer that involves a gravity assist maneuver with the Moon and allows a long stationed stage at the Lyapunov orbit around $L_1$ which can be used for designing multi-purpose missions for extended periods of time with low fuel costs. This is paramount to optimize new exploration concepts.</description>

      <title>Evidence for an accretion bridge in the DX Cha circumbinary system from VLTI/MATISSE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DX Cha (HD 104237) is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a Herbig A7.5Ve-A8Ve primary star and a K3-type companion. Here we report on new $3.55$ micrometer interferometric observations of this source with the Multi Aperture Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). To model the four MATISSE observations obtained between 2020 and 2023, we constructed a time-dependent interferometric model of the system, using the oimodeler software. The model consists of an asymmetric ring and two point sources on a Keplerian orbit. Our best-fit model consists of a circumbinary ring with a diameter of $0.86$ au ($8.1$ mas), featuring a strong azimuthal asymmetry. We found that the position angle of the asymmetry changes tens of degrees between the MATISSE epochs. The ring is relatively narrow, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\sim$$0.13$ au ($1.23$ mas). The presence of circumstellar dust emission so close to the binary is unexpected, as previous hydrodynamic simulations predicted an inner disk cavity with a diameter of $\sim$$4$ au ($\sim$$37.5$ mas). Thus, we argue that the narrow envelope of material we detected is probably not a gravitationally stable circumbinary ring, but may be part of tidal accretion streamers channeling material from the inner edge of the disk toward the stars.</description>

      <title>Hot Rocks Survey I : A possible shallow eclipse for LHS 1478 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: M dwarf systems offer an opportunity to study terrestrial exoplanetary atmospheres due to their small size and cool temperatures. However, the extreme conditions imposed by these host stars raise question about whether their close-in rocky planets are able to retain any atmosphere at all. The Hot Rocks Survey aims to answer this question by targeting nine different M dwarf rocky planets. Of these, LHS 1478 b orbits an M3-type star, has an equilibrium temperature of T$_{eq}$ = 585 K and receives 21 times Earth's instellation. We observe two secondary eclipses using photometric imaging at 15$\mu$m using the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST MIRI) to measure thermal emission from the dayside of the planet. We compare these values to atmospheric models to evaluate potential heat transport and CO$_2$ absorption signatures. We find that a secondary eclipse depth of $138\pm 53$ppm at the expected time for a circular orbit is preferred over a null model at $2.8\sigma$, a moderate detection, though dynamical models do favour a non-eccentric orbit for this planet. The second observation results in a non-detection due to significantly larger unexplained systematics. Based on the first observation alone, we can reject the null hypothesis of the dark (zero Bond albedo) no atmosphere bare rock model with a confidence level of 3.3$\sigma$, though for $A_B=0.2$ the significance decreases to $2.1\sigma$. The tentative secondary eclipse depth is consistent with the majority of atmospheric scenarios we considered, spanning CO$_2$-rich atmospheres with surface pressures from 0.1 to 10 bar. However, we stress that the two observations from our program do not yield consistent results, and more observations are needed to verify our findings. The Hot Rocks Survey serves as a relevant primer for the Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) Rocky Worlds program.</description>

      <title>A reassessment of the "hard-steps" model for the evolution of intelligent life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the "hard-steps" model, the origin of humanity required "successful passage through a number of intermediate steps" (so-called "hard" or "critical" steps) that were intrinsically improbable with respect to the total time available for biological evolution on Earth. This model similarly predicts that technological life analogous to human life on Earth is "exceedingly rare" in the universe. Here, we critically reevaluate the core assumptions of the hard-steps model in light of recent advances in the Earth and life sciences. Specifically, we advance a potential alternative model where there are no hard steps, and evolutionary novelties (or singularities) required for human origins can be explained via mechanisms outside of intrinsic improbability. Furthermore, if Earth's surface environment was initially inhospitable not only to human life, but also to certain key intermediate steps in human evolution (e.g., the origin of eukaryotic cells, multicellular animals), then the "delay" in the appearance of humans can be best explained through the sequential opening of new global environmental windows of habitability over Earth history, with humanity arising relatively quickly once the right conditions were established. In this co-evolutionary (or geobiological) scenario, humans did not evolve "early" or "late" with respect to the total lifespan of the biosphere, but "on time."</description>

      <title>The Eclipsing Binaries via Artificial Intelligence. II. Need for Speed in PHOEBE Forward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern astronomy, the quantity of data collected has vastly exceeded the capacity for manual analysis, necessitating the use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist scientists with the most labor-intensive tasks. AI can optimize simulation codes where computational bottlenecks arise from the time required to generate forward models. One such example is PHOEBE, a modeling code for eclipsing binaries (EBs), where simulating individual systems is feasible, but analyzing observables for extensive parameter combinations is highly time-consuming.
  To address this, we present a fully connected feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) trained on a dataset of over one million synthetic light curves generated with PHOEBE. Optimization of the ANN architecture yielded a model with six hidden layers, each containing 512 nodes, provides an optimized balance between accuracy and computational complexity. Extensive testing enabled us to establish ANN's applicability limits and to quantify the systematic and statistical errors associated with using such networks for EB analysis. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of dilution effects in parameter estimation for EBs, and we outline methods to incorporate these effects in AI-based models.
  This proposed ANN framework enables a speedup of over four orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods, with systematic errors not exceeding 1\%, and often as low as 0.01\%, across the entire parameter space.</description>

      <title>A differentiable binary microlensing model using adaptive contour integration method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present microlux, which is a Jax-based code that can compute the binary microlensing light curve and its derivatives both efficiently and accurately. The key feature of microlux is the implementation of a modified version of the adaptive sampling algorithm that was originally proposed by V. Bozza to account for the finite-source effect most efficiently. The efficiency and accuracy of microlux have been verified across the relevant parameter space for binary microlensing. As a differentiable code, microlux makes it possible to apply gradient-based algorithms to the search and posterior estimation of the microlensing modeling. As an example, we use microlux to model a real microlensing event and infer the model posterior via both Fisher information matrix and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, neither of which would have been possible without the access to accurate model gradients.</description>
