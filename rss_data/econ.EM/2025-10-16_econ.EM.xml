      <title>Beyond Returns: A Candlestick-Based Approach to Spot Covariance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spot covariance estimation is commonly based on high-frequency open-to-close return data over short time windows, but such approaches face a trade-off between statistical accuracy and localization. In this paper, I introduce a new estimation framework using high-frequency candlestick data, which include open, high, low, and close prices, effectively addressing this trade-off. By exploiting the information contained in candlesticks, the proposed method improves estimation accuracy relative to benchmarks while preserving local structure. I further develop a test for spot covariance inference based on candlesticks that demonstrates reasonable size control and a notable increase in power, particularly in small samples. Motivated by recent work in the finance literature, I empirically test the market neutrality of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) using 1-minute candlestick data for the full year of 2024. The results show systematic deviations from market neutrality, especially in periods of market stress. An event study around FOMC announcements further illustrates the new method's ability to detect subtle shifts in response to relatively mild information events.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Identification of Spatial Treatment Effect Boundaries: Evidence from Bank Branch Consolidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I develop a nonparametric framework for identifying spatial boundaries of treatment effects without imposing parametric functional form restrictions. The method employs local linear regression with data-driven bandwidth selection to flexibly estimate spatial decay patterns and detect treatment effect boundaries. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the nonparametric approach exhibits lower bias and correctly identifies the absence of boundaries when none exist, unlike parametric methods that may impose spurious spatial patterns. I apply this framework to bank branch openings during 2015--2020, matching 5,743 new branches to 5.9 million mortgage applications across 14,209 census tracts. The analysis reveals that branch proximity significantly affects loan application volume (8.5\% decline per 10 miles) but not approval rates, consistent with branches stimulating demand through local presence while credit decisions remain centralized. Examining branch survival during the digital transformation era (2010--2023), I find a non-monotonic relationship with area income: high-income areas experience more closures despite conventional wisdom. This counterintuitive pattern reflects strategic consolidation of redundant branches in over-banked wealthy urban areas rather than discrimination against poor neighborhoods. Controlling for branch density, urbanization, and competition, the direct income effect diminishes substantially, with branch density emerging as the primary determinant of survival. These findings demonstrate the necessity of flexible nonparametric methods for detecting complex spatial patterns that parametric models would miss, and challenge simplistic narratives about banking deserts by revealing the organizational complexity underlying spatial consolidation decisions.</description>

      <title>Effect Identification and Unit Categorization in the Multi-Score Regression Discontinuity Design with Application to LED Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: RDD (Regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for identifying and estimating causal effects at the cutoff of a single running variable. In practice, however, decision-making often involves multiple thresholds and criteria, especially in production systems. Standard MRD (multi-score RDD) methods address this complexity by reducing the problem to a one-dimensional design. This simplification allows existing approaches to be used to identify and estimate causal effects, but it can introduce non-compliance by misclassifying units relative to the original cutoff rules. We develop theoretical tools to detect and reduce "fuzziness" when estimating the cutoff effect for units that comply with individual subrules of a multi-rule system. In particular, we propose a formal definition and categorization of unit behavior types under multi-dimensional cutoff rules, extending standard classifications of compliers, alwaystakers, and nevertakers, and incorporating defiers and indecisive units. We further identify conditions under which cutoff effects for compliers can be estimated in multiple dimensions, and establish when identification remains valid after excluding nevertakers and alwaystakers. In addition, we examine how decomposing complex Boolean cutoff rules (such as AND- and OR-type rules) into simpler components affects the classification of units into behavioral types and improves estimation by making it possible to identify and remove non-compliant units more accurately. We validate our framework using both semi-synthetic simulations calibrated to production data and real-world data from opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach has practical value in refining production policies and reduces estimation variance. This underscores the usefulness of the MRD framework in manufacturing contexts.</description>
