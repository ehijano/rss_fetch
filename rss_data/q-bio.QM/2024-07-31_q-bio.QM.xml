      <title>Distribution Learning for Molecular Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using "soft" targets to improve model performance has been shown to be effective in classification settings, but the usage of soft targets for regression is a much less studied topic in machine learning. The existing literature on the usage of soft targets for regression fails to properly assess the method's limitations, and empirical evaluation is quite limited. In this work, we assess the strengths and drawbacks of existing methods when applied to molecular property regression tasks. Our assessment outlines key biases present in existing methods and proposes methods to address them, evaluated through careful ablation studies. We leverage these insights to propose Distributional Mixture of Experts (DMoE): A model-independent, and data-independent method for regression which trains a model to predict probability distributions of its targets. Our proposed loss function combines the cross entropy between predicted and target distributions and the L1 distance between their expected values to produce a loss function that is robust to the outlined biases. We evaluate the performance of DMoE on different molecular property prediction datasets -- Open Catalyst (OC20), MD17, and QM9 -- across different backbone model architectures -- SchNet, GemNet, and Graphormer. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is a promising alternative to classical regression for molecular property prediction tasks, showing improvements over baselines on all datasets and architectures.</description>

      <title>Robust CNN Multi-Nested-LSTM Framework with Compound Loss for Patch-based Multi-Push Ultrasound Shear Wave Imaging and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) is a noteworthy tool for in-vivo noninvasive tissue pathology assessment. State-of-the-art techniques can generate reasonable estimates of tissue elasticity, but high-quality and noise-resiliency in SWE reconstruction have yet to demonstrate advancements. In this work, we propose a two-stage DL pipeline producing reliable reconstructions and denoise said reconstructions to obtain lower noise prevailing elasticity mappings. The reconstruction network consists of a Resnet3D Encoder to extract temporal context from the sequential multi-push data. The encoded features are sent to multiple Nested CNN LSTMs which process them in a temporal attention-guided windowing basis and map the 3D features to 2D using FFT-attention, which are then decoded into an elasticity map as primary reconstruction. The 2D maps from each multi-push region are merged and cleaned using a dual-decoder denoiser network, which independently denoises foreground and background before fusion. The post-denoiser generates a higher-quality reconstruction and an inclusion-segmentation mask. A multi-objective loss is designed to accommodate the denoising, fusing, and segmentation processes. The method is validated on sequential multi-push SWE motion data with multiple overlapping regions. A patch-based training procedure is introduced with network modifications to handle data scarcity. Evaluations produce 32.66dB PSNR, 43.19dB CNR in noisy simulation, and 22.44dB PSNR, 36.88dB CNR in experimental data, across all test samples. Moreover, IoUs (0.909 and 0.781) were quite satisfactory in the datasets. After comparing with other reported deep-learning approaches, our method proves quantitatively and qualitatively superior in dealing with noise influences in SWE data. From a performance point of view, our deep-learning pipeline has the potential to become utilitarian in the clinical domain.</description>

      <title>Patterns in soil organic carbon dynamics: integrating microbial activity, chemotaxis and data-driven approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of soil organic carbon (SOC) frequently overlook the effects of spatial dimensions and microbiological activities. In this paper, we focus on two reaction-diffusion chemotaxis models for SOC dynamics, both supporting chemotaxis-driven instability and exhibiting a variety of spatial patterns as stripes, spots and hexagons when the microbial chemotactic sensitivity is above a critical threshold. We use symplectic techniques to numerically approximate chemotaxis-driven spatial patterns and explore the effectiveness of the piecewice dynamic mode decomposition (pDMD) to reconstruct them. Our findings show that pDMD is effective at precisely recreating chemotaxis-driven spatial patterns, therefore broadening the range of application of the method to classes of solutions different than Turing patterns. By validating its efficacy across a wider range of models, this research lays the groundwork for applying pDMD to experimental spatiotemporal data, advancing predictions crucial for soil microbial ecology and agricultural sustainability.</description>

      <title>A survey of machine learning techniques in medical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13268</link>

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, including medical decision-making. The exponential growth of medical data over the past two decades has surpassed the capacity for manual analysis, prompting increased interest in automated data analysis and processing. ML algorithms, capable of learning from data with minimal human intervention, are particularly well-suited for medical data analysis and interpretation. One significant advantage of ML is the reduced cost of collecting labeled training data necessary for supervised learning. While numerous studies have explored the applications of ML in medicine, this survey specifically focuses on the use of ML across various medical research fields. We provide a comprehensive technical overview of existing studies on ML applications in medicine, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches. Additionally, we discuss potential research directions for future exploration. These include the development of more sophisticated reward functions, as the accuracy of the reward function is crucial for ML performance, the integration of ML with other techniques, and the application of ML to new and emerging areas in genomics research. Finally, we summarize our findings and present the current state of the field and the future outlook for ML in medical application.</description>
