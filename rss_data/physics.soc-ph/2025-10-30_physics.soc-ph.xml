      <title>Finite Population Dynamics Resolve the Central Paradox of the Inspection Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Inspection Game is the canonical model for the strategic conflict between law enforcement (inspectors) and citizens (potential criminals), but its classical analysis is crippled by a paradox: the equilibrium crime rate is found to be independent of both the penalty size ($p$) and the crime gain ($g$). This result severely undermines the policy relevance of the static model, suggesting fines are futile. To resolve this paradox, we employ evolutionary game theory and analyze the long-term fixation probabilities of strategies using finite population dynamics. Our results fundamentally demonstrate that high absolute penalties $p$ are highly effective at suppressing crime by driving the system toward the criminal extinction absorbing state, thereby restoring the intuitive role of $p$. Furthermore, we reveal a U-shaped policy landscape where both high penalties and light penalties (where $p \approx g$) are successful suppressors, maximizing criminal risk at intermediate deterrence levels. Most critically, we analyze the realistic asymptotic limit of extreme population asymmetry, where inspectors are exceedingly rare. In this limit, the system's dynamic outcome is entirely decoupled from the citizen payoff parameters $p$ and $g$, and is instead determined by the initial frequency of crime ($x_0$) relative to the deterrence threshold (the ratio of inspection cost to reward for catching a criminal). We find the highly counter-intuitive result of the dominance of the initially rare strategy: crime becomes fixed if $x_0$ is below this threshold, but goes extinct if $x_0$ is above it. These findings highlight the need to move beyond deterministic predictions and emphasize that effective deterrence requires managing demographic noise and initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional yet asymmetric causality between urban systems and traffic dynamics in 30 cities worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how urban systems and traffic dynamics co-evolve is crucial for advancing sustainable and resilient cities. However, their bidirectional causal relationships remain underexplored due to challenges of simultaneously inferring spatial heterogeneity, temporal variation, and feedback mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose a novel spatio-temporal causality framework that bridges correlation and causation by integrating spatio-temporal weighted regression with a newly developed spatio-temporal convergent cross-mapping approach. Characterizing cities through urban structure, form, and function, the framework uncovers bidirectional causal patterns between urban systems and traffic dynamics across 30 cities on six continents. Our findings reveal asymmetric bidirectional causality, with urban systems exerting stronger influences on traffic dynamics than the reverse in most cities. Urban form and function shape mobility more profoundly than structure, even though structure often exhibits higher correlations, as observed in cities such as Singapore, New Delhi, London, Chicago, and Moscow. This does not preclude the reversed causal direction, whereby long-established mobility patterns can also reshape the built environment over time. Finally, we identify three distinct causal archetypes: tightly coupled, pattern-heterogeneous, and workday-attenuated, which map pathways from causal diagnosis to intervention. This typology supports city-to-city learning and lays a foundation for context-sensitive strategies in sustainable urban and transport planning.</description>

      <title>Citizen science dataset on residents' urban heat perception in outdoor public spaces of climate-vulnerable neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dataset generated to investigate urban heat and thermal perception across five neighborhoods in the Barcelona metropolitan area. In collaboration with 14 non-academic partner organizations, we conducted a series of citizen science campaigns involving 439 residents as co-researchers engaged throughout all stages of the research process. Participants, residents of areas classified as highly or very highly climate-vulnerable, identified 210 public outdoor sites relevant to their daily lives. These locations were subsequently characterized using a range of spatial and environmental indicators pertinent to urban heat island effects, urban health, and climate resilience. Over the course of 48 thermal walks, participants carried portable, low-cost sensors that continuously recorded air temperature, relative humidity, and geolocation, resulting in 296,286 processed microclimatic data points. At pre-defined sites, individuals completed standardized surveys to report their Thermal Sensation Votes and Thermal Comfort Votes, yielding 5,169 self-reported entries. Sociodemographic data were also collected to further contextualize participants' responses. The resulting dataset integrates objective environmental measurements with subjective perceptions of heat, enabling point-by-point analysis of thermal experience within the urban fabric. It offers a novel, multi-dimensional resource to support research on heat, thermal inequality, and the experiential dimensions of climate vulnerability, and is intended to inform evidence-based decision-making in urban planning, public health, and climate adaptation.</description>

      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarms. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines the classic opinion dynamics (the French-DeGroot model) with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuee agents in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to the Vicsek flocking model, and it is meaningful to explore complex social behavior during phase transition of a non-equilibrium process.</description>
