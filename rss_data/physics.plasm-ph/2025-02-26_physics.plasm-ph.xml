      <title>Measurement of energy reduction by inertial Alfv\'en waves propagating through parallel gradients in the Alfv\'en speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the propagation of inertial Alfv\'en waves through parallel gradients in the Alfv\'en speed using the Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. The reflection and transmission of Alfv\'en waves through inhomogeneities in the background plasma is important for understanding wave propagation, turbulence, and heating in space, laboratory, and astrophysical plasmas. Here we \rev{present inertial Alfv\'en waves, under conditions relevant to solar flares and the solar corona. We find} that the transmission of the inertial Alfv\'en waves is reduced as the sharpness of the gradient is increased. Any reflected waves were below the detection limit of our experiment and reflection cannot account for all of the energy not transmitted through the gradient. Our findings indicate that, for both kinetic and inertial Alfv\'en waves, the controlling parameter for the transmission of the waves through an Alfv\'en speed gradient is the ratio of the Alfv\'en wavelength along the gradient divided by the scale length of the gradient. Furthermore, our results suggest that an as-yet-unidentified damping process occurs in the gradient.</description>

      <title>Mean-field dynamo as a quantumlike modulational instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Presented here is a novel formulation of the mean-field dynamo as a modulational instability of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. This formulation, termed mean-field wave kinetics (MFWK), is based on the Weyl symbol calculus and allows describing the interaction between the mean fields (magnetic field and fluid velocity) and turbulence without requiring scale separation that is commonly assumed in literature. The turbulence is described by the Wigner--Moyal equation for the spectrum of the two-point correlation matrix (Wigner matrix) of magnetic-field and velocity fluctuations and depicts the turbulence as an effective plasma of quantumlike particles that interact via the mean fields. Eddy--eddy interactions, which serve as `collisions' in this effective plasma, are modeled within the standard minimal tau approximation to aid comparison with existing theories. Using MFWK, the nonlocal electromotive force is calculated for generic turbulence from first principles, modulo the limitations of MFWK. This result is then used to study, both analytically and numerically, the modulational modes of MHD turbulence, which appear as linear instabilities of said effective quantumlike plasma of fluctuations. The standard $\alpha^2$-dynamo and other known results are reproduced as a special cases. A new dynamo effect is predicted that is driven by correlations between the turbulent flow velocity and the turbulent current.</description>

      <title>Deuterium retention in pre-lithiated samples and Li-D co-deposits in the DIII-D tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divertor designs involving liquid lithium have been proposed as an alternative to solid designs and wall conditioning techniques. However, Li affinity with tritium poses a risk for the fuel cycle. This study investigates deuterium retention in pre-lithiated samples and Li-D co-deposits in the DIII-D tokamak, making for the first time a direct comparison between Li-D co-deposits and pre-deposited Li films. Samples were exposed to H-mode plasmas in the far scrape-off layer (SOL), and Li powder was injected in-situ with the impurity powder dropper to study the uniformity of Li coatings, and the dependence of fuel retention on Li thickness. The results show that at temperatures below the melting point of lithium, deuterium retention is independent of the thickness of pre-deposited Li layers, with Li-D co-deposits being the primary factor for fuel retention. Both pre-deposited and in-situ deposited Li showed lower erosion than predicted by sputtering yield calculations. These results suggest that fuel retention in fusion reactors using lithium in the divertor will likely be dominated by co-deposits rather than in the divertor itself. If one desires to use Li to achieve flatter temperature profiles, operando Li injection is advantageous over pre-deposited Li films, at least at temperatures below the melting point of lithium.</description>

      <title>Modelling of a large-scale non-insulated non-planar HTS stellarator coil using Quanscient Allsolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellarators present features such as steady-state operation and intrinsic stability that make them more attractive than tokamaks in their scaling to fusion power plants. By leveraging more possible configurations, stellarators can be optimized for better engineering feasibility, e.g., resilience to manufacturing tolerances, reduced mechanical load on conductor, material optimization, cost of fabrication. Finite Element Analyses are crucial for the design and optimization of High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) REBCO non-planar coils. However, accurate simulation of large-scale magnetostatic, mechanical, and quench models can take days or even weeks to compute. In this work, we present a model of a real-size, HTS, non-insulated, non-planar stellarator coil and perform in Quanscient Allsolve, a transient simulation study including modelling quench, using the $H-\varphi$ formulation. It is shown that transient model benefits heavily from the built-in Domain Decomposition Method (DDM), which allows reaching reasonable computation times. Such models become then invaluable in predicting and understanding the complex behavior of non-insulated large-scale REBCO magnets, including their intrinsic energy imbalance.</description>

      <title>Eulerian and Lagrangian electron energization during magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron energization by magnetic reconnection has historically been studied in the Lagrangian guiding-center framework. Insights from such studies include that Fermi acceleration in magnetic islands can accelerate electrons to high energies. An alternative Eulerian fluid formulation of electron energization was recently used to study electron energization during magnetic reconnection in the absence of magnetic islands. Here, we use particle-in-cell simulations to compare the Eulerian and Lagrangian models of electron energization in a setup where reconnection leads to magnetic island formation. We find the largest energization at the edges of magnetic islands. There, energization related to the diamagnetic drift dominates in the Eulerian model, while the Fermi related term dominates in the Lagrangian model. The models predict significantly different energization rates locally. A better agreement is found after integrating over the simulation domain. We show that strong magnetic curvature can break the magnetic moment conservation assumed by the Lagrangian model, leading to erroneous results. The Eulerian fluid model is a complete fluid description and accurately models bulk energization. However, local measurements of its constituent energization terms need not reflect locations where plasma is heated or accelerated. The Lagrangian guiding center model can accurately describe the energization of particles, but it cannot describe the evolution of the fluid energy. We conclude that while both models can be valid, they describe two fundamentally different quantities, and care should be taken when choosing which model to use.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric escape from exoplanets: recent observations and theoretical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The review aims to give an overview of atmospheric escape processes from exoplanets. I briefly discuss the physics of various escape processes responsible for atmospheric escape across different types of exoplanets. Transmission spectroscopy is one of the major workhorses to observe the escaping atmosphere from exoplanets. I discuss recent observations that established the fact that atmospheric escape is very common in exoplanets, especially during the early phase of their evolution when stellar high-energy radiation (X-ray and extreme ultraviolet, hence XUV) is strong. There are many theoretical efforts/models to understand atmospheric escape processes. Stellar radiation is one of the major drivers of atmospheric escape, but other stellar environments (e.g., stellar flares, stellar winds, stellar coronal mass ejections, and stellar magnetic field) also have control over how the escape process will be affected for a given property of exoplanet, as the planetary properties (e.g., gravity, thermal energy, magnetic field) plays an important role for atmospheric escape. I discuss all governing factors for the atmospheric escape process and corresponding theoretical models in detail. I also discuss how atmospheric escape plays a crucial role in the overall atmospheric evolution of exoplanets and can lead us to understand some features in recently observed exoplanet demographics.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Model of Solar Wind Acceleration Driven by Ambipolar Electric Potential and Velocity-Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations revealed that most of the solar wind acceleration occurs very close to the Sun. This acceleration is partly due to the global electric potential originating from the mass disparity between electrons and protons, coupled with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality and zero-current conditions in the solar wind plasma. However, the exact mechanism that accounts for the remaining acceleration is still not identified. We aim to provide a framework incorporating the electric field-driven component of the acceleration while also introducing an additional acceleration mechanism via velocity-space diffusion of the particles. This will help us determine the extent of extra acceleration, beyond the electric field-driven component, required to fully reproduce the acceleration of the solar wind in theoretical models. We modified an existing kinetic exospheric model to account for the unexplained solar wind acceleration by including velocity-space diffusion. We compared the electric field derived from the sunward deficit of velocity distribution functions observed by PSP between 13.3 and 50 solar radii ($R_s$) with the electric field found self-consistently by the kinetic exospheric model. The effect of velocity-space diffusion is found to reduce the temperature anisotropy and impact the solar wind acceleration while maintaining the electric potential unchanged. Our approach allows for adjusting the diffusion to effectively reduce or increase the solar wind acceleration, providing a way to account for the unexplained acceleration within the kinetic exospheric framework. It is found that, even without diffusion, the model can reproduce the anticorrelation between the electric potential and the solar wind terminal velocity found by PSP. This suggests that the electric potential might still be of major importance in explaining the solar wind acceleration.</description>

      <title>Picosecond imaging of dynamics of solvated electrons during femtosecond laser-induced plasma generation in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of solvated electrons were visualized using absorption imaging with sub-picosecond time resolution based on a pump-probe measurement during the early stages of femtosecond laser-induced plasma generation in water. The solvated electrons were generated by the propagation of a femtosecond laser pump pulse. In the area with a pump laser intensity over 2x10^13 W/cm2, where a high density of free electrons was produced, solvated electrons exhibited an additional rapid increase in optical density (OD) at 800 nm, 7-9 ps after the pump pulse excitation. In contrast, no two-step increase in OD was observed when probed at 400 nm, suggesting that the absorption coefficient of the solvated electrons rapidly changed around 800 nm after femtosecond laser excitation for a few picoseconds. This observation might indicate the structural and electronic modulation of solvated electrons owing to the high density of free electrons in water, accompanied by femtosecond-laser-induced plasma generation.</description>

      <title>Spectrally accurate reverse-mode differentiable bounce-averaging operator and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spectrally accurate, automatically differentiable bounce-averaging operator implemented in the DESC stellarator optimization suite. Using this operator, we can perform efficient optimization of many objectives to improve stellarator performance, such as the $\epsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}^{3/2}$ proxy for the neoclassical transport coefficient in the $1/\nu$ regime. By employing this differentiable approximation, for the first time, we directly optimize a finite-$\beta$ stellarator to reduce neoclassical transport using reverse-mode differentiation, ensuring that the computational cost of determining the gradients is independent of the number of input parameters.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confirm the existence of the spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton and the value of its tOAM, verifying our theory of transverse orbital angular momentum in a simple dispersive medium [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. We also develop a physical picture of the polariton as a structure driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the presence of material dispersion. This is a new type of spatiotemporal torque unanticipated in our recent work [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 011031 (2024)]. These results are accomplished by high resolution particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of STOV pulse reflection from and transmission through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma slab. The linear theory matches the PIC simulations up to near-critical plasma densities and near-relativistic field strengths. For higher intensities, optical tOAM becomes invested in collective modes of the plasma.</description>
