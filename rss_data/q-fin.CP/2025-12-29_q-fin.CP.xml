      <title>Index-Tracking Portfolio Construction and Rebalancing under Bayesian Sparse Modelling and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the construction and rebalancing of sparse index-tracking portfolios from an operational research perspective, with explicit emphasis on uncertainty quantification and implementability. The decision variables are portfolio weights constrained to sum to one; the aims are to track a reference index closely while controlling the number of names and the turnover induced by rebalancing. We cast index tracking as a high-dimensional linear regression of index returns on constituent returns, and employ a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior on the weights. A single global shrinkage parameter controls the trade-off between tracking error and sparsity, and is calibrated by an empirical-Bayes stochastic approximation scheme. Conditional on this calibration, we approximate the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights using proximal Langevin-type Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms tailored to the budget constraint. This yields posterior uncertainty on tracking error, portfolio composition and prospective rebalancing moves. Building on these posterior samples, we propose rules for rebalancing that gate trades through magnitude-based thresholds and posterior activation probabilities, thereby trading off expected tracking error against turnover and portfolio size. A case study on tracking the S&amp;P~500 index is carried out to showcase how our tools shape the decision process from portfolio construction to rebalancing.</description>

      <title>Chaos, Ito-Stratonovich dilemma, and topological supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently established that the formalism of the generalized transfer operator (GTO) of dynamical systems (DS) theory, applied to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of arbitrary form, belongs to the family of cohomological topological field theories (TFT) -- a class of models at the intersection of algebraic topology and high-energy physics. This interdisciplinary approach, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), can be seen as an algebraic dual to the traditional set-theoretic framework of the DS theory, with its algebraic structure enabling the extension of some DS theory concepts to stochastic dynamics. Moreover, it reveals the presence of a topological supersymmetry (TS) in the GTOs of all SDEs. It also shows that among the various definitions of chaos, positive "pressure", defined as the logarithm of the GTO spectral radius, stands out as particularly meaningful from a physical perspective, as it corresponds to the spontaneous breakdown of TS on the TFT side. Via the Goldstone theorem, this definition has a potential to provide the long-sought explanation for the experimental signature of chaotic dynamics known as 1/f noise. Additionally, STS clarifies that among the various existing interpretations of SDEs, only the Stratonovich interpretation yields evolution operators that match the corresponding GTOs and, consequently, have a clear-cut mathematical meaning. Here, we discuss these and other aspects of STS from both the DS theory and TFT perspectives, focusing on links between these two fields and providing mathematical concepts with physical interpretations that may be useful in some contexts.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Financial Data Generation for Enhanced Financial Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity and confidentiality in finance often impede model development and robust testing. This paper presents a unified multi-criteria evaluation framework for synthetic financial data and applies it to three representative generative paradigms: the statistical ARIMA-GARCH baseline, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN). Using historical S and P 500 daily data, we evaluate fidelity (Maximum Mean Discrepancy, MMD), temporal structure (autocorrelation and volatility clustering), and practical utility in downstream tasks, specifically mean-variance portfolio optimization and volatility forecasting. Empirical results indicate that ARIMA-GARCH captures linear trends and conditional volatility but fails to reproduce nonlinear dynamics; VAEs produce smooth trajectories that underestimate extreme events; and TimeGAN achieves the best trade-off between realism and temporal coherence (e.g., TimeGAN attained the lowest MMD: 1.84e-3, average over 5 seeds). Finally, we articulate practical guidelines for selecting generative models according to application needs and computational constraints. Our unified evaluation protocol and reproducible codebase aim to standardize benchmarking in synthetic financial data research.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Real-World Finance: Scalable Solutions for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable, hardware-aware methodology for extending the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to large, realistic Dynamic Portfolio Optimization (DPO) problems. Building on the scaling strategy from our previous work, where we tailored a VQE workflow to both the DPO formulation and the target QPU, we now put forward two significant advances. The first is the implementation of the Ising Sample-based Quantum Configuration Recovery (ISQR) routine, which improves solution quality in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems. The second is the use of the VQE Constrained method to decompose the optimization task, enabling us to handle DPO instances with more variables than the available qubits on current hardware. These advances, which are broadly applicable to other optimization problems, allow us to address a portfolio with a size relevant to the financial industry, consisting of up to 38 assets and covering the full Spanish stock index (IBEX 35). Our results, obtained on a real Quantum Processing Unit (IBM Fez), show that this tailored workflow achieves financial performance on par with classical methods while delivering a broader set of high-quality investment strategies, demonstrating a viable path towards obtaining practical advantage from quantum optimization in real financial applications.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Machine Learning Framework for Option Pricing via Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing need for rapid recalibration of option pricing models in dynamic markets places stringent computational demands on data generation and valuation algorithms. In this work, we propose a hybrid algorithmic framework that integrates the smooth offset algorithm (SOA) with supervised machine learning models for the fast pricing of multiple path-independent options under exponential L\'evy dynamics. Building upon the SOA-generated dataset, we train neural networks, random forests, and gradient boosted decision trees to construct surrogate pricing operators. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that, once trained, these surrogates achieve order-of-magnitude acceleration over direct SOA evaluation. Importantly, the proposed framework overcomes key numerical limitations inherent to fast Fourier transform-based methods, including the consistency of input data and the instability in deep out-of-the-money option pricing.</description>
