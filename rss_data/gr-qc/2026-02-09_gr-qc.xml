      <title>Unscreening of f(R) gravity near the galactic center black hole: Testability through pericenter shift below S0-2's orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) has been tested extensively in the solar system and is being tested in the new environment of the Galactic Centre (GC) black hole where the dimensionless gravitational potential ($GM/c^2r$) is 100 times stronger than the one encountered in solar system. Therefore, the neighbourhood of the GC black hole is a naive opportunity to test modified theories of gravity. In this work, effect of $f(R)$ gravity near the black hole is studied. The difference of pericentre shift between GR and $f(R)$ gravity is studied for compact orbits having semi-major axis equal to and below $a=1000$ au (S0-2 like orbits). In a model dependent approach, we choose $f(R) \propto R^2$ (power law gravity) model which is cosmologically motivated and study the deviation in orbital pericentre shift for both zero spin and non-zero spin of the black hole. It is found that effect of $f(R)$ gravity becomes prominent for compact orbits. In model independent approach to $f(R)$ gravity with the generic scalaron fields ($\psi=f'(R)$), we extract the parameters of $f(R)$ gravity from the current bounds on Parametrised Post Newtonian (PPN) parameters ($\gamma , \beta$) near the GC black hole. The screening of $f(R)$ gravity is also investigated for these bounds on PPN parameters. It has been found that sufficiently massive scalarons ($10^{-16}$ eV) are completely screened but light and intermediate mass scalarons ($10^{-22}$ eV and $10^{-19}$ eV) are unscreened towards S0-2 like orbits as well as in the orbit of the newly discovered short period star S4716 ($a=407$ au). The possibility of detection of the $f(R)$ gravity effects due to these unscreened scalarons is forecasted with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs).</description>

      <title>Combining the Generalized and Extended Uncertainty Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) are modifications to the Heisenberg Uncertainly Principle (HUP), expected to apply as the energy approaches the Planck scale. Here we consider a possible combination of these modifications (GEUP) and analyse the implications in various regions of the ($\Delta x$, $\Delta p$) plane. We also consider an alternative combination (EGUP) which exhibits duality between $\Delta p$ and $\Delta x$, showing that this has some unusual features. The parameters which describe these models are usually assumed to be positive but we extend our analysis to include negative values. All these proposals entail a link between black holes and the various types of Uncertainty Principle. In particular, the GEUP predicts a new kind of strong-gravity black hole and this implies an interesting link between black holes and elementary particles.</description>

      <title>The canonical energy-momentum currents in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parallel theory of relativity predicts conserved energy-momentum currents for an arbitrary metric, without invoking Killing symmetries. By treating the reference frame as an independent variational field and requiring it to carry no energy, the theory naturally unifies Einstein's two formulations of gravity and yields uniquely defined covariant charges. In isotropic and homogeneous cosmology, the canonical time direction selected by the reference frame coincides with the Kodama vector, and the associated Noether energy reproduces the Misner-Sharp mass.</description>

      <title>Continued fraction method for high overtone quasinormal modes in effective potentials with discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we extend Leaver's continued fraction method to evaluate black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) in systems where the effective potential exhibits a discontinuity. Besides the low-lying modes, we particularly focus on high overtones, which are physically pertinent due to the substantial deformation of the QNM spectrum triggered by spectral instability. In our algorithm, we expand the wavefunction at the point of discontinuity, instead of the black hole horizon, and incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. %As the wavefunction convergence condition becomes irrelevant, our proposed algorithm generalizes the original method by expanding the wavefunctions at the point of discontinuity, and the associated difficulty is mitigated by rectifying the recurrence relations between the expansion coefficients to incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. We apply this algorithm to compute the QNMs of the modified Regge-Wheeler potential up to $2000$ modes with high precision. For the low-lying modes, the numerical results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the matrix and Prony methods. The high overtones are significantly deformed, owing to the presence of echoes due to the discontinuity. This deformation in the asymptotic QNM spectrum reveals universal features that are largely independent of the specific form of the discontinuity in the potential, seemingly coinciding with those observed in the modified P\"oschl-Teller effective potential. We speculate on whether the collective effect of the high overtones has an observational impact on gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effective Dynamics and Stability of Vacuum in Anti-de Sitter Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the details of the canonical quantization of effective quantum field theories in anti-de Sitter spacetime, emphasizing the stability of the quantum vacuum. We take the scalar and Maxwell fields as examples. For the non-minimally coupled massless real scalar field with \xi R\phi^2 term in the Lagrangian (mass can be introduced by shift of \xi), only when \xi \le 5/48, the quantized Hamiltonian is spontaneously non-negative and the vacuum is well defined. For \xi &gt; 5/48, one has to assign the negative energy spectrum as that of the ghost particles, introducing anti-commutation relations to make the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian trivial, ensuring the Hamiltonian non-negative and the vacuum (and the Hilbert space) well defined. This method of ghost states is applicable once the proper radial boundary conditions guarantee the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. The resulting dynamics can be compared with those resulting from the positive self-adjoint extensions when the latter is available for \xi\le 9/48. For the Maxwell fields, the gauge invariant canonical energy momentum tensor straightforwardly leads to the gauge invariant non-negative Hamiltonian (well-defined vacuum). Hence the redundant gauge degree of freedom is irrelevant, and the 2-dimensional dynamical degrees of freedom are quantized in a concrete, e.g., temporal gauge. The energy momentum tensors for both quantized fields are renormalized to be finite at operator level, which renders the stable vacuum maximally symmetric. The back-reactions to the background spacetime by excited states via the semi-classical Einstein equations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravastar on the brane with a timelike extra dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a gravastar configuration within the Shtanov-Sahni (SS) braneworld scenario, characterized by a timelike extra dimension and negative brane tension. Unlike classical black holes, which inevitably culminate in central curvature singularities, our model demonstrates that the SS braneworld dynamics naturally regularize the interior geometry and prevent singularity formation. By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose--Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations. This provides the first fully analytic realization of a finite-thickness, stable gravastar in the Shtanov-Sahni braneworld, highlighting a genuinely geometric mechanism for singularity avoidance in compact objects.</description>

      <title>Accelerating TTL noise post-processing via combined coefficients and alternative TDI configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilt-to-length (TTL) noise induced by angular jitter of spacecraft and test masses can affect the sensitivity of space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. Such angular jitter can be measured using the differential wavefront sensing technique, enabling the modeling and subtraction of TTL noise from the data. However, owing to the multiple degrees of freedom of the detector constellation, a linear TTL model requires at least 24 parameters, while a higher-fidelity quadratic model involves up to 60 coefficients, rendering parameter estimation computationally expensive. To accelerate parameter determination, we propose a modified parameter set obtained via a linear transformation of the original angular coupling coefficients, which effectively reduces correlations among TTL noise components. In addition, we perform parameter fitting using an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry configuration, PD4L, rather than the fiducial Michelson configuration. These two improvements enhance the convergence speed of the fitting procedure by a factor of approximately 10 for the linear model and approximately 18 for the quadratic model. The proposed approach can therefore substantially improve the efficiency of TTL noise calibration in space-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Timelike Entanglement Entropy of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of timelike entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation as a novel probe of the black hole information paradox. By analytically continuing black hole spacetimes to Euclidean signature, we define timelike correlations that reveal a sequence of timelike Page times at which the entanglement entropy equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Applying this framework to Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, static higher-dimensional and braneworld solutions, four-dimensional Kerr, and higher-dimensional rotating Myers--Perry black holes, we demonstrate that timelike entanglement exhibits periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, with the recurrence times sensitive to surface gravity, charge, rotation, and spacetime dimensionality. Extremal and near-extremal black holes display effectively frozen thermal oscillations with persistent rotational modulation, reflecting their near-horizon geometries. Unlike conventional approaches based on islands or firewalls, our framework encodes information entirely in the Hawking radiation, preserving unitarity while avoiding violations of horizon smoothness. These results establish timelike entanglement as a robust and physically transparent mechanism for information recovery and provide a versatile tool for exploring quantum gravitational dynamics across a wide range of black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Chaos as a Possible Probe for Scalar Hair in Horndeski Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of black hole scalar hair, a possible deviation from general relativity's "no-hair" theorem, requires sensitive probes beyond conventional methods. This study proposes chaotic dynamics as a novel indicator for scalar hair in Horndeski gravity. We investigate the motion of a spinning test particle in a static, spherically symmetric hairy black hole spacetime. Our results show that increasing scalar hair systematically suppresses orbital chaos, as evidenced by regularized precession, reduced Lyapunov exponents, and contracted Poincare sections. Furthermore, scalar hair enhances the correlation between the two gravitational wave polarization modes, restoring phase coherence. These findings demonstrate that chaotic observables and gravitational wave signatures can jointly serve as sensitive probes for black hole hair, offering a complementary approach to testing gravity in strong-field regimes.</description>

      <title>The N-Body 2PN Hamiltonian and Numerical Integration of the Equations of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, the second-order post-Newtonian (2PN) Hamiltonian has been known in closed analytic form only for systems of up to three point masses. In this paper, we present an analytic expression for the general $N$-body 2PN Hamiltonian in the ADM gauge up to a single integral term that, to our knowledge, has no known closed-form analytic solution. We show that the integrals appearing in the 2PN Hamiltonian can be evaluated numerically to machine precision, allowing for cross-validation against analytical results and enabling the full numerical computation of the $N$-body 2PN Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the numerical integration of the equations of motion for $N$ bodies at 2PN order using different methods and discuss several strategies for improving computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Stable Causality and Microcausality for Drummond-Hathrell Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local superluminal photon propagation arises at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha/m_e^2)$ in the Drummond Hathrell (DH) effective action obtained by integrating out the electron in QED coupled to gravity. Whether such superluminality implies a genuine violation of causality in curved spacetime is subtle and remains conceptually nontrivial. In this work we revisit this question using two complementary and largely symmetry-independent diagnostics.
  First, we analyse the global causal structure of the effective (optical) metric governing DH photon propagation and identify conditions under which it remains stably causal, thereby excluding the formation of closed causal curves. Second, from a quantum-field-theoretic perspective, we examine microcausality by treating the gravitational background as a fixed Lorentz-breaking field and applying flat-spacetime analyticity bounds to the photon commutator within the geometric-optics regime of the EFT.
  For two representative examples, a circular photon orbit in Schwarzschild and a linear trajectory in a two-black-hole geometry, we find that, within the regime of validity of the DH effective theory, both diagnostics indicate that the superluminal photon propagation is causally benign. Our results do not constitute a general definition of microcausality in curved spacetime, but provide a controlled and instructive check of causal consistency for EFT superluminality in gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and other macroscopic objects may be surrounded by potentially large field configurations of very light scalars coupled to ordinary matter. If the star ends in a black hole, e.g. via a supernova or a neutron star merger, the source vanishes, and the field is released. In this paper, we improve on previous estimates for the field configurations arriving at large distances by including the effects of general relativity and an improved modelling of the initial field configurations. The total amount of energy released is typically of the same order of magnitude as suggested by simple flat space estimates. The spectrum receives noticeable corrections.</description>

      <title>Deforming the Double-Scaled SYK &amp; Reaching the Stretched Horizon From Finite Cutoff Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model under chord Hamiltonian deformations based on finite cutoff holography for general dilaton gravity theories with Dirichlet boundaries. The formalism immediately incorporates a lower-dimensional analog of $\text{T}\bar{\text{T}}(+\Lambda_2)$ deformations, denoted $T^2(+\Lambda_1)$, as special cases. In general, the deformation mixes the chord basis of the Hilbert space in the seed theory, which we order through a modification of the Lanczos algorithm. The resulting chord number in the ordered basis represents a wormhole length at a finite cutoff in the bulk. We study the thermodynamic properties of the deformed theory; the evolution of $n$-point correlation functions with matter chords; the growth of complexity of the Hartle-Hawking state; and the entanglement entropy between the double-scaled algebras for a given chord state. The latter, in the triple-scaling limit, manifests as the minimal codimension-two area in the bulk following the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. By performing a sequence of $T^2$ and $T^2+\Lambda_1$ deformations in the upper tail of the energy spectrum in the deformed DSSYK, we concretely realize the cosmological stretched horizon proposal in de Sitter holography by Susskind. We discuss other extensions with sine dilaton gravity, end-of-the-world branes, and the Almheiri-Goel-Hu model.</description>

      <title>Consistency of standard cosmologies using Bayesian model comparison and tension quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified Bayesian assessment of model comparison and data-set consistency for LCDM (cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant) and minimal extensions (neutrino mass, spatial curvature, constant or evolving dark energy) using cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and type Ia supernova (SN) data. The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\ell$ versus high-$\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\,\sigma$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $\tau$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for. We conclude that claims of a required update of our standard cosmological model from LCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Scattering in Spinless WQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the computational framework for gravitational wave - black hole scattering in worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) without spin. Crucially, we prove on general grounds that, in the absence of dissipation, the exponential representation of the $S$-matrix maps -- through a partial-wave transformation -- directly onto the scattering phase shift from black hole perturbation theory (BHPT), indicating an exponentiation of the WQFT amplitude itself in partial-wave space. Computing explicitly, we reproduce the BHPT phase shift without spin up to $O(G^{3})$ from WQFT. While this result is expected, it lays the groundwork for higher-precision analyses involving non-minimal effects. Along the way, we outline our efficient diagram generation technique and include a pedagogical discussion on the computation of the required two-loop integrals.</description>

      <title>Seeing Page Curves and Islands with Blinders On</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper summarizes recent discussions of the Page curve and the information paradox, and responds to the reasoning and examples from arXiv:2506.04311. We review arguments demonstrating that in quantum gravity the algebra of observables at infinity is complete, both in AdS and in asymptotically flat space. This completeness implies that the bulk Hilbert space in quantum gravity does not factorize along the radial direction, undermining a key common assumption in Hawking's argument for information loss and in initial derivations of the Page curve. As a consequence, in a standard theory of gravity, information does not ``emerge'' from a black hole in the manner suggested by the Page curve; rather, it is already encoded in asymptotic observables. Relatedly, the full black hole interior, and not just an ``island'', can be reconstructed from exterior data. Page curves and islands can be obtained by removing the Hamiltonian from the exterior algebra. This may be implemented operationally by restricting access to part of the asymptotic region (a detector with a ``blind spot'') or, in the special case of null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, by formally discarding the Hamiltonian from the set of observables despite its physical accessibility. Such Page curves describe only the redistribution of information between measured and unmeasured degrees of freedom, rather than fundamental information recovery. Finally, Page curves and islands also arise when a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath, a setup that yields a nonstandard theory of gravity. We show how, even in this setting, the unusual localization of information in gravity provides a concrete physical mechanism for information transfer from the gravitational system into the bath.</description>

      <title>Bulk Phase Shift and Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy scattering of a light particle off a black hole at fixed impact parameter is described by an eikonal phase, which encodes the resulting time delay and angular deflection. This bulk phase shift admits a holographic interpretation as of the thermal momentum-space two-point function of a scalar operator in the CFT in the Regge limit. At small impact parameter, the phase shift acquires an imaginary part signaling inelastic scattering, obscuring the interpretation of time delay and deflection which become complex-valued. However, in a holographic CFT these quantities can also be extracted from the so called bulk-cone singularities of the position space thermal correlator. Extending this analysis to small impact parameters, we find that the position-space correlator develops a singularity precisely when a null geodesic reflects off the black hole singularity and reaches the opposite boundary. This provides a more robust identification of bulk time delay and angular deflection through singularities of position-space correlators.</description>

      <title>Universality of Primordial Anisotropies in Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model-independent formalism for describing anisotropies in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) originating from primordial perturbations. Despite their diverse physical origins -- such as Sachs-Wolfe effects, integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, or fossil effects from primordial non-Gaussianity -- SGWB anisotropies exhibit a universal angular structure. We show that this universality arises from a single vertex function, the Cosmological Form Factor (CFF), which encodes the information on how long-wavelength modes modulate the SGWB statistics. Two fundamental principles -- statistical isotropy and locality -- uniquely determine the angular dependence of the CFF, resulting in a universal multipole scaling of the SGWB anisotropies. The CFF formalism provides a common language for classifying SGWB anisotropies and offers a powerful framework for interpreting upcoming observations.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase transition with primordial black holes: Distinct phase structure and catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of primordial black holes (PBHs) on the chiral phase transition and its associated stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) signals. Using the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, we construct the chiral effective potential in a Schwarzschild spacetime background. We find that PBHs promote chiral symmetry restoration and induce a nontrivial local phase structure in the vicinity of the event horizon simultaneously. In particular, this structure exhibits a novel chiral symmetry breaking pattern involving both second- and first-order phase transitions, a feature absent in flat spacetime. We further demonstrate that PBHs act as genuine catalysts for the chiral phase transition by analyzing the bounce solution in curved spacetime. The presence of PBHs substantially enhances the inverse duration parameter $\beta/H$ while leaving the overall transition strength comparable to that in flat spacetime. As a consequence, even a small population of PBHs can induce $\mathcal{O}(1)$ shifts in both the peak frequency and the peak amplitude of the GW spectrum generated by the first-order dark chiral phase transition.</description>

      <title>New Rotating Black Holes in String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new black hole solutions to the low-energy effective action of string theory. We introduce three- and four-dimensional solutions that are rotating, asymptotically flat, and exhibit a linear dilaton vacuum. These solutions cannot be overspun, i.e., do not have an extremality condition, akin to higher-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes with one rotational angle. Studying their thermodynamics reveals that the temperature associated to these solutions does not depend on the black hole mass, similar to the Witten black hole. We also find that their asymptotic symmetry group is more stringent than the BMS group. We consider the charged generalisations for these black holes, which introduces closed timelike curves within the inner horizon. We show that these black holes can be derived from the large-$d$ limit of the Myers-Perry black hole. As such we advocate that large-$d$ can provide a useful vantage point to interpret the here introduced black holes, as well as more generally a way to generate new effective field theories and corresponding non-trivial solutions.</description>

Abstract: We compute the classical Compton amplitude for graviton interaction with a non-spinning massive body up to the third post-Minkowskian order. Our novel result utilizes the enhanced computational efficiency provided by worldline effective field theory in a non-trivial background spacetime. Physical constraints, such as infrared factorization, provide a useful cross-check of the result and we also consider its consistency with computations in black hole perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Raman Scattering: a Systematic Toolkit for Tidal Effects in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for systematic computations of scattering amplitudes for gravitational Raman scattering, -- the inelastic scattering of massless fields off compact relativistic objects. We focus on the small-frequency (post-Minkowskian, PM) regime relevant for the study of tidal effects, which can be mapped onto gravitational wave observables during the inspiraling phase of a merger. We demonstrate that this setup is ideal for systematic studies of tidal effects, in a way that is free from coordinate, gauge, and field redefinition ambiguities. We use a combination of worldline effective field theory, the background field method, and advanced scattering amplitude techniques to derive phase shifts for scattering of spin-$0,1,2$ fields off generic compact objects at third PM order. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the recoil of the object is crucial for consistency of this calculation. Focusing on a particular case of black holes, we extract the leading static and dynamical Love numbers of the spin-0 field and the static Love number of the spin-1 field in four dimensions by matching our EFT amplitudes and calculations in General Relativity. We show, fully on-shell, that the leading static Love numbers vanish identically, while the dynamical Love numbers are not zero and run logarithmically. The latter resolves the ambiguities of previous off-shell matching calculations. We also extend our results to seven dimensions, where spin-2 Love numbers undergo a renormalization group running at 2PM, which we compute explicitly. In addition, we extract the leading static Love numbers of spin-0 and spin-1 fields in five dimensions, which also run.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give a rigorous mathematical treatment of the late time Hawking radiation of massless bosons emitted by a class of collapsing, spherically symmetric, charged models of black hole formation, including both extremal and sub-extremal black holes. We will also prove a bound on the rate at which the radiation emitted approaches this late time limit. This includes an integrable decay rate of radiation emitted by extremal black holes, for which the late time limit vanishes. Thus, we show that the total expected quantity of any massless boson emitted by an extremal \RNS black hole is finite.</description>

      <title>Fundamental oscillations as a tool to distinguish boson stars from neutron stars and black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive boson stars are self-gravitating configurations of self-interacting scalar fields and can be modeled by a massive scalar field with a quartic self-interaction potential. It has been shown that the equation of state and static structure properties, such as mass and radius, follow scaling relations independent of microscopic dark matter properties. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that non-radial fundamental ($f$-)mode characteristics also follow a scaling in the strong interaction limit, opening up the outstanding prospect of evaluating the mode properties for boson stars for arbitrary masses spanning the scalar dark matter parameter space allowed by current observations. We provide the scaling relations within full general relativity and obtain the mode characteristics corresponding to the maximum boson star mass configuration. We apply these to determine the $f$-mode properties for boson stars solely as a function of their mass and compactness, which allows distinguishing them from those of neutron stars and black hole quasinormal modes in comparable mass range. In particular, we show that the frequencies are always lower than those of corresponding black holes of the same mass by a factor of 4.5. This provides a smoking gun for the distinguishability of boson stars from other compact objects using gravitational wave observations.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical excitation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) through the plunge, merger and ringdown of an extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral into a Schwarzschild black hole, for generic orbital configurations. We work out the QNM causality condition, crucial to eliminate amplitude divergences and to incorporate horizon redshift effects. We then use it to derive a model of the time-dependent QNM excitation via a Green's function approach, driven by the point-particle source on a given trajectory. Our model predicts that: i) QNMs propagates along hyperboloidal slices in the minimal gauge; ii) the signal is composed of an ``activation'' term, depending on the source past history, and a local ``impulsive'' term; iii) amplitudes grow in time in an ``activation function'' fashion, and the waveform displays a stationary ringdown regime at times $\sim 10-20M$ after its peak; iv) at these late times, an infinite tower of non-oscillatory, exponentially-damped terms appear: the redshift terms. The model is in good agreement with numerical solutions, capturing the main waveform features after the peak. Additional components of the Green's function are required to complement the QNM description and reproduce the plunge-merger waveform. We predict the late-time, stationary amplitude of the quadrupolar mode as a function of eccentricity, in agreement with accurate numerical solutions, marking the first time that QNM amplitudes are predicted for generic binary configurations. Our work provides a first solid step towards analytically modeling the inspiral's imprint onto ringdown signals, generalizable to include higher orders in the mass ratio, black hole spin, non-vacuum configurations and corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action.</description>

      <title>Theory space and stability analysis of General Relativistic cosmological solutions in modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some aspects of two General Relativistic cosmological solutions, an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ ($j$ is cosmographic jerk parameter), and a specifically designed toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ ($q$ is cosmographic deceleration parameter, $0&lt;|\varepsilon|&lt;1$) that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario as suggested by DESI DR2, are studied within the context of $f(R)$ gravity, by portraying them as a \emph{flow} in the 2-dimensional \emph{theory space} spanned by the quantities $r=\frac{R f'}{f}, m=\frac{R f''}{f'}$. For the $f(R)$ theories exactly reproducing a background $\Lambda$CDM-like expansion history $j=1$, it is shown by means of a \emph{cosmographic} reconstruction approach that the curvature degree of freedom need not necessarily behave like an effective cosmological constant, and that cosmologies under different possible such theories lead to different possible values of $\Omega_{m0}$. With the theory space analysis, it is also shown that $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(R)$ cosmologies that asymptote to General Relativistic $\Lambda$CDM in the limit $q\to1/2$, are prone to instability under small homogeneous and isotropic perturbation, casting a doubt on achieving an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ within $f(R)$ gravity. Regarding the toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario, it is shown that possible underlying $f(R)$ theories that admit it as a solution are inevitably plagued by tachyonic instability ($f''(R)&lt;0$). All the above physically interesting conclusions are derived without explicitly reconstructing, even numerically, the functional form of the underlying $f(R)$, which demonstrates the edge of the $r$-$m$ theory space analysis over the traditional explicit reconstruction approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree of freedom of the scalar field in scalar-tensor gravity is employed as 'time' to deparametrize the Hamiltonian constraint of the theory. The deparametrized system is then non-perturbatively quantized by the approach of loop quantum gravity. This results in a discrete time evolution of the physical states with respect to the gravitational degree of freedom in the quantum theory. In the corresponding Brans-Dicke cosmological model, the physical solutions to the quantum Hamiltonian constraint is obtained in the light of the deparametrization. The quantum dynamics indicates that the classical big bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can a dynamically robust (\textit{aka} stable) $Q$-ball reproduce the rotation curve of a disk galaxy? In an astrophysical environment, $Q$-balls are non-topological solitons that are transparent and only perceived by their gravitational effects. Traditionally, scalar $Q$-balls are modelled with a polynomial potential, but axion-like periodic potentials are also expected to support such solitonic configurations. In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the axially-symmetric structure of disk galaxies. Motivated by this similarity, we investigate whether rotating scalar $Q$-balls can reproduce the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies. In this work, we use a recently developed hybrid numerical framework that combines a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network approach to construct both static and rotating $Q$-ball solutions. We assess their ability to act as the dark matter halos in galaxies by fitting the observed rotation curves of a sample of disk galaxies from the SPARC catalogue. Our simplified model provides an overall good agreement with observational data, and a reasonable fit when compared to standard dark matter profiles such as the Navarro-Frenk-White; we have further found an average constraint on the scalar field particle's mass $m\sim 10^{-27}$ eV, in agreement with similar galactic-scale soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>Numerical tiling-based simulations of decoherence in multifield models of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. The primary contribution of this work is the development of a numerically stable and flexible framework for implementing open-system effects in inflationary perturbations, rather than the extraction of concrete predictions for the primordial spectrum. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Penrose process in Kerr-de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, references [1,2] found that the repetitive Penrose process cannot extract all the extractable rotational energy of a Kerr black hole, and reference [3] found that the repetitive electric Penrose process cannot extract all the electrical energy of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole. This suggests that a law analogous to the third law of thermodynamics exists for the repetitive Penrose process. In this paper, we intend to study the repetitive Penrose process in the Kerr-de Sitter (Kerr-dS) black hole. We will explore influences of the cosmological parameter on the repetitive Penrose process. The results show that, in addition to a similar third law of thermodynamics, the Kerr-dS black hole yields a higher energy return on investment (EROI) and single-extraction energy capability compared to the Kerr black hole. Specifically, the larger the cosmological parameter, the stronger the EROI and the single-extraction energy capability. Furthermore, we also find that at a lower decay radius, the Kerr black hole exhibits a higher energy utilization efficiency (EUE) and more extracted energy after the repetitive Penrose process is completed. However, at a higher decay radius, the situation is reversed, i.e., the Kerr-dS black hole exhibits a higher EUE and more extracted energy, which is due to the existence of stopping condition of the iteration.</description>

      <title>Higher curvature corrections to the black hole Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the annihilation to nothing scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Yeom's annihilation-to-nothing scenario using a modified Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation incorporating higher-curvature corrections. We show that, once these corrections are taken into account, the WDW wave function exhibits severe divergences arising from contributions near the classical singularity. These divergences indicate that the low-energy effective field theory (EFT) description breaks down in this regime.
  Given that general relativity (GR) itself is merely a low-energy effective field theory (EFT) of an underlying ultraviolet (UV) theory, our results suggest that any attempted resolution of the black hole singularity cannot be reliably discussed within the EFT framework. Our analysis does not contradict Yeom's conjecture, but emphasizes that the annihilation-to-nothing scenario should be discussed within a UV-complete theoretical framework. It further clarifies that any genuine resolution of the singularity necessarily requires a framework capable of appropriately describing ultraviolet physics, such as degrees of freedom beyond those captured by GR or dynamics consistently defined up to arbitrarily high energy scales.</description>

      <title>Strong lensing cosmography using binary-black-hole mergers: Prospects for the near future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes (BBHs) will be gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters. Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al.~\cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Penrose Process in Accelerating Kerr Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the repetitive Penrose process in accelerating Kerr black holes and explores the influence of the acceleration factor on the repetitive Penrose process. After a brief review of accelerating Kerr black holes, we study the fundamental equations of the Penrose process in this spacetime, examine the stopping conditions required for the repetitive Penrose process, and obtain corresponding numerical results. The conclusions indicate that, apart from the third law of thermodynamics similar to previous cases, accelerating Kerr black holes exhibit stronger energy extraction capabilities compared to Kerr black holes during the repetitive Penrose process. Moreover, in prior studies, the energy utilization efficiency was difficult to exceed $50\%$. However, in accelerating Kerr black holes, when the decay radius is relatively small, the energy utilization efficiency can exceed $50\%$, indicating that the reduced extractable energy primarily transforms into extracted energy rather than irreducible mass. On the other hand, when the initial value of the acceleration factor is large, the extractable energy can decrease to nearly zero, which also differs from the case of Kerr black holes in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Electrodynamics via the Characteristic Method: Relativistic and Carrollian Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric-magnetic duality plays a pivotal role in understanding the structure of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The Gaillard-Zumino (GZ) criterion provides a powerful constraint for identifying self-dual theories. In this work, we systematically explore solutions to the GZ self-duality condition by applying the method of characteristics, a robust tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Our approach enables the construction of new classes of Lagrangians that respect duality symmetry, both in the relativistic and Carrollian frameworks. In the relativistic setting, we not only recover well-known examples such as Born-Infeld and ModMax theories, but also identify novel models. We then generalize the GZ formalism to the Carrollian case and construct several classes of Carrollian self-dual non-linear electrodynamic models. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the characteristic flow exhibits an attractor behavior, in the sense that different seed theories that may not be self-dual can generate the same descendant self-dual Lagrangian. These findings broaden the landscape of self-dual theories and open new directions for exploring duality in ultra-relativistic regimes.</description>

      <title>Reheating after the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theories with radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) lead to first-order phase transitions and the production of gravitational waves as well as primordial black holes if the supercooling period lasted long enough. Here we explain how to efficiently reheat the universe after such period in the above-mentioned class of theories. Two cases are possible, depending on whether the RSB scale is much larger than the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking scale or not. When it is, the dominant reheating mechanism can be the decays of the field responsible for RSB in the Standard Model (SM) sector. We point out that in a similar way dark matter (DM) can be produced and we analyze in some detail the case of a sterile-neutrino, finding that the full DM abundance is reproduced when this particle is at the $10^2$ MeV scale in a well-motivated SM completion. When the RSB scale is not much larger than the EW symmetry breaking scale, we find that efficient reheating always occurs when the energy density of the false vacuum is first entirely transferred to a dark photon and then to SM fermions via dark-photon decays.</description>

      <title>A Light-Cone Approach to Higher-Order Cosmological Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a second-order cosmological perturbation theory on a background geometry expressed in terms of light-cone coordinates, extending the first-order analyses available in the literature. In particular, we investigate the gauge transformations of second-order perturbative quantities on the light-cone and establish their connection with standard perturbation theory. Through a consistent matching procedure, we identify the second-order gauge fixing that corresponds to the non-linear Geodesic Light-Cone gauge within standard perturbation theory, known as the Observational Synchronous Gauge. We then emphasize its conceptual similarities and differences wrt the standard Synchronous Gauge. Finally, within this new perturbative framework, and adopting a fully gauge-invariant approach, we compute the luminosity distance-redshift relation up to second order with anisotropic stress as seen by a free-falling observer. Remarkably, we show how divergences at the observer position can be eliminated in a completely model independent way. These results validate our perturbative framework and establish it as a novel formalism for evaluating cosmological observables at second order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-loop gravitational path integral around Euclidean de Sitter space $S^D$ has a complex phase that casts doubt on a state counting interpretation. Recently, it was proposed to cancel this phase by including an observer. We explore this proposal in the case where the observer is a charged black hole in equilibrium with the de Sitter horizon. We compute the phase of the one-loop determinant within a two-dimensional dilaton gravity reduction, using both numerical and analytical methods. Our results interpolate between previous studies of a probe geodesic observer and the Nariai solution. We also revisit the prescription for going from the Euclidean path integral to the state-counting partition function, finding a positive sign in the final density of states.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic analysis for the metric of a generic solution of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS theory is provided by solving the field equations in the Fefferman-Graham frame. Using standard holographic renormalization, the counterterms that render the action finite are found up to seven spacetime dimensions. In the case of 6D, an equivalent formulation that permits a fully covariant determination of the counterterms is introduced, based on the finiteness of conformal invariants. It is shown that both schemes end up in the same holographic stress-energy tensor. Physical properties of six-dimensional topological Boulware-Deser black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-AdS$_6$ gravity, whose boundary has nontrivial conformal features, are worked out in detail. Employing both renormalization prescriptions, finite asymptotic charges are found, and the correct black hole thermodynamics is recovered.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model in the near-extremal black brane background with quantum corrections in the near-horizon. The near-horizon geometry is described by Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, and the quantum fluctuations are governed by the Schwarzian action. We introduce the Schwarzian modes into the RS metric, derive the quantum-corrected equation for the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes via the Schwinger-Dyson equation, calculate the correction to the KK mass spectrum, and discuss the impact of quantum corrections on the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. Our work introduces both quantum corrections and temperature into the RS model, providing insights into cosmology and phase transitions within it.</description>

      <title>Diamonds in the Bulk and Large-$N$ Scaling in AdS/CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Field Theory (QFT) introduced us to the notion that a causal diamond in space-time corresponded to a subsystem of a quantum mechanical system defined on the global space-time. Work by Jacobson, Fischler and Susskind, and particularly Bousso suggested that, in the quantum theory of gravity, this subsystem should have a density matrix of finite entropy. These authors formalized older intuitive arguments based on black hole physics. Although mathematically, Type II von Neumann algebras admit finite entropy density matrices, the black hole arguments suggest that the number of physical states in these subsystems is finite. The conjecture that de Sitter (dS) space has a finite number of physical states was first made by Fischler and one of the present authors. Leutheusser and Liu showed that, in the $N = \infty$ limit, causal diamonds with finite area in AdS radius units had Type $III_1$ von Neumann sub-algebras of the full operator algebra. They claimed that this was true for finite values of the UV cutoff, and that the algebra was the algebra of bulk local fields in the diamond. We will argue that the second part of this conjecture is incorrect and that the bulk field algebra emerges only in a double scaled limit, where the boundary UV cutoff is taken to infinity as $N$ is taken to infinity. There is never a bulk field theory description that resolves distances smaller than the AdS radius.</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems approach to studying the equivalence principle in dilaton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a string-inspired dilaton cosmology in the Damour--Polyakov (DP) regime using dynamical-systems methods, aiming to make explicit how cosmological relaxation controls deviations from the equivalence principle. Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions of the Einstein-$SU(2)$ non-linear sigma model in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions, describing bumpy black holes and black branes. Using an Ansatz for superfluid pion multi-vortices, the matter sector reduces to a first-order BPS system, while the Einstein equations reduce to a Liouville equation with a smooth source governing the horizon deformation. These solutions describe horizons of different constant curvatures, with nontrivial bumpy geometries protected by an integer topological invariant, namely the vorticity, which also controls the number of bumps and the black hole thermodynamics. Remarkably, such horizons arise in a minimal and physically motivated matter model, without invoking exotic fields or modified gravity. The physical implications of these results in holography and astrophysics are briefly described.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, Dirac's conjecture and the extended Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the Hamiltonian analysis of constrained systems is a nice and powerful tool, widely used for quantization and non-perturbative counting of degrees of freedom. However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.
  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.</description>
