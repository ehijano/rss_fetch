      <title>Magnetic properties in polyacetylene: Exploring electronic correlation effects through density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyacetylene, a simple polymer, has long been studied for its unique electronic properties, yet the role of correlation in polyacetylene still is not clear. Here, we employ various density functional theory formulations to explore its effects on magnetic characteristics of polyacetylene by ab initio basis. Our results indicate that subtle correlation effects beyond the generalized gradient approximation lead to the formation of spin-density wave solutions on the $\pi$-conjugated carbon $p$ orbitals that could compete with other solutions, possibly leading to emergence of intertwined orders. Our study suggests that the phase diagram of polyacetylene should be explored further.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of Guanidinium Cations to the Air-Water Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining Deep-UV second harmonic generation spectroscopy with molecular simulations, we confirm and quantify the specific adsorption of guanidinium cations to the air-water interface. Using a Langmuir analysis and measurements at multiple concentrations, we extract the Gibbs free energy of adsorption, finding it larger than typical thermal energies. Molecular simulations clarify the role of polarizability in tuning the thermodynamics of adsorption, and establish the preferential parallel alignment of guanidinium at the air-water interface. Guanidinium is the first polyatomic cation proven to exhibit a propensity for the air-water interface. As such, these results expand on the growing body of work on specific ion adsorption.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Electron Density Changes in Excited States -- A Computational Study on Pyrazine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) has enabled ultrafast X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments, which are capable of resolving electronic/vibrational transitions and structural changes in molecules, or capturing molecular movies. While time-resolved XRD has received increasing attention, the extraction of information content from signals is challenging and requires theoretical support. In this work, we combined X-ray scattering theory and trajectory surface hopping approach to resolve dynamical changes in the electronic structure of photo-excited molecules by studying time evolution of electron density changes between electronic excited states and ground state. Using pyrazine molecule as an example, we show that key features of reaction pathways can be identified, enabling the capture of structural changes associated with electronic transitions for a photo-excited molecule.</description>

      <title>Energy Relaxation of N$_2$O in Gaseous, Supercritical and Liquid Xenon and SF$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational and vibrational energy relaxation (RER and VER) of N$_2$O embedded in xenon and SF$_6$ environments ranging from the gas phase to the liquid, including the supercritical regime, is studied at a molecular level. Calibrated intermolecular interactions from high-level electronic structure calculations, validated against experiments for the pure solvents were used to carry out classical molecular dynamics simulations corresponding to experimental state points for near-critical isotherms. Computed RER rates in low-density solvent of $k_{\rm rot}^{\rm Xe} = (3.67\pm0.25)\cdot10^{10}$ s$^{-1}$M$^{-1}$ and $k_{\rm rot}^{\rm SF_6} = (1.25\pm0.12)\cdot10^{11}$ s$^{-1}$M$^{-1}$ compare well with rates determined by analysis of 2-dimensional infrared experiments. Simulations find that an isolated binary collision (IBC) description is successful up to solvent concentrations of $\sim 4$ M. For higher densities, including the supercritical regime, the simulations do not correctly describe RER, probably due to neglect of solvent-solute coupling in the analysis of the rotational motion. For VER, the near-quantitative agreement between simulations and pump-probe experiments captures the solvent density-dependent trends.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of amide + ketone mixtures. 1. Volumetric, speed of sound and refractive index data for N,N-dimethylformamide + 2-alkanone systems at several temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Densities, $\rho$, speeds of sound, $c$, and refractive indices, $n_{\text{D}}$, have been measured for the systems N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) + propanone, + 2-butanone, or + 2-pentanone in the temperature ($T$) range from 293.15 to 303.15 K and at 298.15 K for the DMF + 2-heptanone mixture. Due to the high volatility of acetone, the corresponding $n_{\text{D}}$ measurements were developed at 293.15 K and 298.15 K. The direct experimental data were used to determine the excess molar volumes, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, and the excess refractive indices, $n_{\text{D}}^{\text{E}}$, at the working $T$. Values of the excess functions at 298.15 K, for the speed of sound, $c^{\text{E}}$, the isentropic compressibility, $\kappa_S^{\text{E}}$ and for the excess thermal expansion coefficient, $\alpha_p^{\text{E}}$, were also calculated. The investigated systems are characterized by strong amide-ketone interactions, which become weaker when the alkanone size is increased. This is supported by negative $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values; by the dependence on $T$ and pressure of $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, and by positive $P_{\text{int}}^{\text{E}}$ (excess internal pressure) values. Analysis of the systems in terms of the Rao's constant indicates that there is no complex formation. In addition, negative $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values also reveal the existence of structural effects, which largely contribute to the excess molar enthalpy, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$. $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ and $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values increase with the chain length of the 2-alkanone. It allows to conclude that the relative $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ variation with the ketone size is closely related to that of the interactional contribution to this excess function. Molar refraction values, $R_{\text{m}}$, show that dispersive interactions become more relevant for the systems including longer 2-alkanones.</description>

      <title>chemtrain: Learning Deep Potential Models via Automatic Differentiation and Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Networks (NNs) are promising models for refining the accuracy of molecular dynamics, potentially opening up new fields of application. Typically trained bottom-up, atomistic NN potential models can reach first-principle accuracy, while coarse-grained implicit solvent NN potentials surpass classical continuum solvent models. However, overcoming the limitations of costly generation of accurate reference data and data inefficiency of common bottom-up training demands efficient incorporation of data from many sources. This paper introduces the framework chemtrain to learn sophisticated NN potential models through customizable training routines and advanced training algorithms. These routines can combine multiple top-down and bottom-up algorithms, e.g., to incorporate both experimental and simulation data or pre-train potentials with less costly algorithms. chemtrain provides an object-oriented high-level interface to simplify the creation of custom routines. On the lower level, chemtrain relies on JAX to compute gradients and scale the computations to use available resources. We demonstrate the simplicity and importance of combining multiple algorithms in the examples of parametrizing an all-atomistic model of titanium and a coarse-grained implicit solvent model of alanine dipeptide.</description>

      <title>Constraints on exotic interactions from scalar spin-spin coupling in tritium deuteride (DT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15442v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comparison of theoretical and experimental values of the scalar spin-spin interaction ($J$-coupling) in tritium deuteride molecules yield constraints for nucleon-nucleon exotic interactions of the dimensionless coupling strengths $g_Vg_V$, $g_Ag_A$ and $g_pg_p$, corresponding to the exchange of an vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar (axionlike) boson. The couplings between proton ($p$) and nucleon ($N$), denoted by $g_V^p g_V^N$, $g_p^p g_p^N$ are constrained to be less than $1.4 \times 10^{-6}$ and $2.7\times 10^{-6}$, respectively, for boson masses around 5 keV. The coupling constant $g_A^p g_A^N$ is constrained to be less than $1.0 \times 10^{-18}$ for boson masses $\leq 100$ eV. It is noteworthy that this study represents the first instance in which constraints on $g_V g_V$ have been established through the analysis of the potential term $V_2 + V_3$ for both tritium deuteride and hydrogen deuteride molecules.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Microscopic Origins in Nonlinear Optical Crystals: Based on Rigorous Atomic Space Tessellating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clarifying the contribution of various atoms and structural units formed in nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal materials to macroscopic optical response is crucial for NLO crystal design. In this work, the rigorous atomic space tessellating (AST) method without any empirical parameters is introduced to evaluate the correlated contributions in wavelength dependent optical responses. The NLO crystal CsSbF2SO4 with significant asymmetric electron distribution of Sb3+ was selected as the case study. This study indicates that there are significant differences in atomic and dipole moment contributions between static and dynamic second harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility. Using only the information obtained from NLO-active unit analysis of static SHG susceptibilities to explain the NLO phenomenon in actual photoexcitation can even lead to qualitative errors. Among all the transitions in SHG effects, the on-site transition of Sb has the largest component, while the O-Sb off-site transition with multiple transition channels contributes the most to the macroscopic SHG susceptibilities. The relevant methods have also been extended to linear optics and used to study first-order susceptibilities anisotropy, which is important for achieving phase matching. Sb3+ contributes significantly to the linear optical anisotropy with the same sign as SO42-.</description>

      <title>Towards Fully Autonomous Research Powered by LLMs: Case Study on Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created new opportunities for the automation of scientific research, spanning both experimental processes and computational simulations. This study explores the feasibility of constructing an autonomous simulation agent (ASA) powered by LLM, through sophisticated API integration, to automate the entire research process, from experimental design, remote upload and simulation execution, data analysis, to report compilation. Using a simulation problem of polymer chain conformations as a case study, we assessed the performance of ASAs powered by different LLMs including GPT-4-Turbo. Our findings revealed that ASA-GPT-4o achieved near-flawless execution on designated research missions, underscoring the potential of LLMs to manage complete scientific investigations autonomously. The outlined automation can be iteratively performed up to twenty cycles without human intervention, illustrating the potential of LLMs for large-scale autonomous research endeavors. Additionally, we discussed the intrinsic traits of ASAs in managing extensive tasks, focusing on self-validation mechanisms and the balance between local attention and global oversight.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory for open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework to study the dynamics of open quantum systems with linearly coupled Gaussian baths. Our approach replaces the continuous bath with an auxiliary discrete set of pseudomodes with dissipative dynamics, but we further relax the complete positivity requirement in the Lindblad master equation and formulate a quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory. We show that this quasi-Lindblad pseudomode formulation directly leads to a representation of the bath correlation function in terms of a complex weighted sum of complex exponentials, an expansion that is known to be rapidly convergent in practice and thus leads to a compact set of pseudomodes. The pseudomode representation is not unique and can differ by a gauge choice. When the global dynamics can be simulated exactly, the system dynamics is unique and independent of the specific pseudomode representation. However, the gauge choice may affect the stability of the global dynamics, and we provide an analysis of why and when the global dynamics can retain stability despite losing positivity. We showcase the performance of this formulation across various spectral densities in both bosonic and fermionic problems, finding significant improvements over conventional pseudomode formulations.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Benchmark and Framework for Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of structure-spectrum relationships is essential for spectral interpretation, impacting structural elucidation and material design. Predicting spectra from molecular structures is challenging due to their complex relationships. Herein, we introduce NMRNet, a deep learning framework using the SE(3) Transformer for atomic environment modeling, following a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. To support the evaluation of NMR chemical shift prediction models, we have established a comprehensive benchmark based on previous research and databases, covering diverse chemical systems. Applying NMRNet to these benchmark datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in both liquid-state and solid-state NMR datasets, demonstrating its robustness and practical utility in real-world scenarios. This marks the first integration of solid and liquid state NMR within a unified model architecture, highlighting the need for domainspecific handling of different atomic environments. Our work sets a new standard for NMR prediction, advancing deep learning applications in analytical and structural chemistry.</description>

      <title>DWR-Drag: A new generation software for the Double Wall-Ring Interfacial Shear Rheometer's data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double wall-ring (DWR) rotational configuration is nowadays the instrument of choice regarding interfacial shear rheometers (ISR) in rotational configurations. Complex numerical schemes must be used in the analysis of the output data in order to appropriately deal with the coupling between interfacial and bulk fluid flows, and to separate viscous and elastic contribution or the interfacial response. We present a second generation code for analyzing the interfacial shear rheology experimental results of small amplitude oscillatory measurements made with a DWR rotational rheometer. The package presented here improves significantly the accuracy and applicability range of the previous available software packages by implementing: i) a physically motivated iterative scheme based on the probe's equation of motion, ii) an increased user selectable spatial resolution, and iii) a second order approximation for the velocity gradients at the ring surfaces. Moreover, the optimization of the computational effort allows, in many cases, for on-the-fly execution during data acquisition in real experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Tree Tensor Network Operators for Tensor Network Simulations: Applications to Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree tensor network states (TTNS) decompose the system wavefunction to the product of low-rank tensors based on the tree topology, serving as the foundation of the multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method. In this work, we present an algorithm that automatically constructs the optimal and exact tree tensor network operators (TTNO) for any sum-of-product symbolic quantum operator.The construction is based on the minimum vertex cover of a bipartite graph. With the optimal TTNO, we simulate open quantum systems such as spin relaxation dynamics in the spin-boson model and charge transport in molecular junctions. In these simulations, the environment is treated as discrete modes and its wavefunction is evolved on equal footing with the system. We employ the Cole-Davidson spectral density to model the glassy phonon environment, and incorporate temperature effects via thermo field dynamics. Our results show that the computational cost scales linearly with the number of discretized modes, demonstrating the efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ionization potential (IP) of radium monofluoride (RaF) was measured to be 4.969(2)[10] eV, revealing a relativistic enhancement in the series of alkaline earth monofluorides. The results are in agreement with a relativistic coupled-cluster prediction of 4.969[7] eV, incorporating up to quantum electrodynamics corrections. Using the same computational methodology, an improved calculation for the dissociation energy ($D_{e}$) of 5.56[5] eV is presented. This confirms that radium monofluoride joins the small group of diatomic molecules for which $D_{e}&gt;\mathrm{IP}$, paving the way for precision control and interrogation of its Rydberg states.</description>
