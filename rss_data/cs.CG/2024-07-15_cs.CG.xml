      <title>Structure and Independence in Hyperbolic Uniform Disk Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider intersection graphs of disks of radius $r$ in the hyperbolic plane. Unlike the Euclidean setting, these graph classes are different for different values of $r$, where very small $r$ corresponds to an almost-Euclidean setting and $r \in \Omega(\log n)$ corresponds to a firmly hyperbolic setting. We observe that larger values of $r$ create simpler graph classes, at least in terms of separators and the computational complexity of the \textsc{Independent Set} problem.
  First, we show that intersection graphs of disks of radius $r$ in the hyperbolic plane can be separated with $\mathcal{O}((1+1/r)\log n)$ cliques in a balanced manner. Our second structural insight concerns Delaunay complexes in the hyperbolic plane and may be of independent interest. We show that for any set $S$ of $n$ points with pairwise distance at least $2r$ in the hyperbolic plane the corresponding Delaunay complex has outerplanarity $1+\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log n}{r})$, which implies a similar bound on the balanced separators and treewidth of such Delaunay complexes.
  Using this outerplanarity (and treewidth) bound we prove that \textsc{Independent Set} can be solved in $n^{\mathcal{O}(1+\frac{\log n}{r})}$ time. The algorithm is based on dynamic programming on some unknown sphere cut decomposition that is based on the solution. The resulting algorithm is a far-reaching generalization of a result of Kisfaludi-Bak (SODA 2020), and it is tight under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. In particular, \textsc{Independent Set} is polynomial-time solvable in the firmly hyperbolic setting of $r\in \Omega(\log n)$. Finally, in the case when the disks have ply (depth) at most $\ell$, we give a PTAS for \textsc{Maximum Independent Set} that has only quasi-polynomial dependence on $1/\varepsilon$ and $\ell$. Our PTAS is a further generalization of our exact algorithm.</description>

      <title>Bipartizing (Pseudo-)Disk Graphs: Approximation with a Ratio Better than 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a disk graph, every vertex corresponds to a disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and two vertices are connected by an edge whenever the two corresponding disks intersect. Disk graphs form an important class of geometric intersection graphs, which generalizes both planar graphs and unit-disk graphs. We study a fundamental optimization problem in algorithmic graph theory, Bipartization (also known as Odd Cycle Transversal), on the class of disk graphs. The goal of Bipartization is to delete a minimum number of vertices from the input graph such that the resulting graph is bipartite. A folklore (polynomial-time) $3$-approximation algorithm for Bipartization on disk graphs follows from the classical framework of Goemans and Williamson [Combinatorica'98] for cycle-hitting problems. For over two decades, this result has remained the best known approximation for the problem (in fact, even for Bipartization on unit-disk graphs). In this paper, we achieve the first improvement upon this result, by giving a $(3-\alpha)$-approximation algorithm for Bipartization on disk graphs, for some constant $\alpha&gt;0$. Our algorithm directly generalizes to the broader class of pseudo-disk graphs. Furthermore, our algorithm is robust in the sense that it does not require a geometric realization of the input graph to be given.</description>

      <title>A Distance for Geometric Graphs via the Labeled Merge Tree Interleaving Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric graphs appear in many real-world data sets, such as road networks, sensor networks, and molecules. We investigate the notion of distance between embedded graphs and present a metric to measure the distance between two geometric graphs via merge trees. In order to preserve as much useful information as possible from the original data, we introduce a way of rotating the sublevel set to obtain the merge trees via the idea of the directional transform. We represent the merge trees using a surjective multi-labeling scheme and then compute the distance between two representative matrices. We show some theoretically desirable qualities and present two methods of computation: approximation via sampling and exact distance using a kinetic data structure, both in polynomial time. We illustrate its utility by implementing it on two data sets.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein convergence of \v{C}ech persistence diagrams for samplings of submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \v{C}ech Persistence diagrams (PDs) are topological descriptors routinely used to capture the geometry of complex datasets. They are commonly compared using the Wasserstein distances $OT_{p}$; however, the extent to which PDs are stable with respect to these metrics remains poorly understood. We partially close this gap by focusing on the case where datasets are sampled on an $m$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Under this manifold hypothesis, we show that convergence with respect to the $OT_{p}$ metric happens exactly when $p\gt m$. We also provide improvements upon the bottleneck stability theorem in this case and prove new laws of large numbers for the total $\alpha$-persistence of PDs. Finally, we show how these theoretical findings shed new light on the behavior of the feature maps on the space of PDs that are used in ML-oriented applications of Topological Data Analysis.</description>
