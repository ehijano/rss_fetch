      <title>Growth of ({\alpha},\b{eta},{\gamma})-order solutions of linear differential equations with analytic coefficients in the unit disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the growth of solutions to higher-order complex linear differential equations in the unit disc, where the analytic coefficients are of finite ({\alpha},\b{eta},{\gamma})-order. By employing the concepts of ({\alpha},\b{eta},{\gamma})-order and ({\alpha},\b{eta},{\gamma})-type, we establish new results concerning the growth of such solutions. These results extend and generalize previous work by the second author and by Biswas.</description>

      <title>Resurgence and perverse sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a point of view on resurgence theory based on the study of perverse sheaves on the complex line carrying an algebraic structure with respect to additive convolution. In particular, we lift the concept of alien derivatives introduced originally by J. \'Ecalle, to the framework of perverse sheaves and study its behavior under sheaf-theoretic convolution. The full fledged resurgence theory needs a (yet undeveloped) generalization of the concept of perverse sheaves allowing infinite, possibly dense, sets of singularities. We discuss possible approaches to defining such objects and some potential examples of them coming from Cohomological Hall Algebras, wall-crossing structures and Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using recently developed algorithms, we compute and compare best $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ rational approximations of analytic functions on the unit disk. Although there is some theory for these problems going back decades, this may be the first computational study. To compute the $L^2$ best approximations, we employ a new formulation of TF-IRKA in barycentric form.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Semipositivity of a Nef and Big Line Bundle on Grauert's Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relation between semipositivity, nefness, and bigness of line bundles on compact K\"ahler manifolds. Every nef and big line bundle on a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ is positive when ${\rm dim}\,X = 1$. Kim constructed an explicit example of a nef and big line bundle that is not semipositive in the case ${\rm dim}\,X \ge 3$. Motivated by a conjecture of Filip and Tosatti, we then focus on the case of dimension two. In this talk, we show that the line bundle on Grauert's example is nef and big but not semipositive, by explicitly computing its first obstruction class, which was originally introduced by Koike as a generalization of the Ueda class.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the Jacobian conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jacobian conjecture is thought to have been proposed by O. H. Keller in 1939. However, we have found that the statement of the conjecture is precisely the main result of a paper published by L. Kraus in 1884. Although the final step of Kraus's proof is flawed, the ideas he introduced anticipated approaches to the problem that would only emerge more than a century later. Interestingly, the root of Kraus's error remains the principal obstacle to algebro-geometric approaches: controlling the ramification at infinity.</description>

      <title>Quadrature Domains and the Faber Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for reconstructing any simply connected, bounded or unbounded, quadrature domain $\Omega$ from its quadrature function $h$. Using the Faber transform, we derive formulae directly relating $h$ to the Riemann map for $\Omega$. Through this approach, we obtain a complete classification of one point quadrature domains with complex charge. We proceed to develop a theory of weighted quadrature domains with respect to weights of the form $\rho_a(w)=|w|^{2(a-1)}$ when $a &gt; 0$ ("power-weighted" quadrature domains) and the limiting case of when $a=0$ ("log-weighted" quadrature domains). Furthermore, we obtain Faber transform formulae for reconstructing weighted quadrature domains from their respective quadrature functions. Several examples are presented throughout to illustrate this approach both in the simply connected setting and in the presence of rotational symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by refining approximation theorems for holomorphic sections of adjoint line bundles, it is proved that the regular locus of a weakly pseudoconvex complex space admitting a positive line bundle can be holomorphically embedded into a complex projective space. As an application of approximation theorems, it is shown that the Union problem can be solved for weakly pseudoconvex manifolds.</description>

      <title>Complex exponential integral means spectrums of univalent functions and the Brennan conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the complex exponential integral means spectrums of univalent functions in the unit disk. We show that all integral means spectrum (IMS) functionals for complex exponents on the universal Teichm\"uller space, the closure of the universal Teichm\"uller curve, and the universal asymptotic Teichm\"uller space are continuous. We also show that the complex exponential integral means spectrum of any univalent function admitting a quasiconformal extension to the extended complex plane is strictly less than the universal integral means spectrum. These extend some related results in our recent work \cite{Jin}. Here we employ a different and more direct approach to prove the continuity of IMS functional on the universal asymptotic Teichm\"uller space. Additionally, we completely determine the integral means spectrums of all univalent rational functions in the unit disk. As a consequence, we show that the Brennan conjecture is true for this class of univalent functions. Finally, we present some remarks and raise some problems and conjectures regarding IMS functionals on Teichm\"uller spaces, univalent rational functions, and a multiplier operator whose norm is closely related to the Brennan conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the higher-order Volterra-type integral operator $T_{g,n}$ on the unit disk, defined for $n\in\mathbb N$ by \[ T_{g,n}[f](z) := \underbrace{\int_{0}^{z}\int_{0}^{t_1}\cdots\int_{0}^{t_{n-1}}}_{n\ \text{times}} f(t_n)g'(t_n)\,dt_n\cdots dt_1,\quad z\in\mathbb D, \] where $f$ and $g$ are analytic in the unit disk $\mathbb D$. We establish sharp norm and essential norm estimates, and give complete characterizations of boundedness and compactness of $T_{g,n}$ on Hardy spaces $H^p$ and weighted Bergman spaces $A_\alpha^p$, in terms of (vanishing) Carleson measure conditions determined by $|g'|$.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Fefferman spaces over CR three-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalisation of Fefferman's conformal circle bundle over a contact Cauchy-Riemann three-manifold. These can be viewed as exact `perturbations' of Fefferman's structure by a semi-basic one-form, which encodes additional data on the CR three-manifold.
  We find conditions on the Weyl tensor and the Bach tensor for a Lorentzian conformal four-manifold equipped with a twisting non-shearing congruence of null geodesics to be locally conformally isometric to such a perturbed Fefferman space.
  We investigate the existence of metrics in the perturbed Fefferman conformal class satisfying appropriate sub-conditions of the Einstein equations, such as the so-called pure radiation equations. These metrics are defined only off cross-sections of Fefferman's circle bundle, and are conveniently expressed in terms of densities that generalise Gover's notion of almost Einstein scales. Our setup allows us to reduce the prescriptions on the Ricci tensor to the underlying CR three-manifold in terms of differential constraints on a complex density and the CR data of the perturbation one-form. One such constraint turns out to arise from a non-linear, or gauged, analogue of a second-order differential operator on densities. A solution thereof provides a criterion for the existence of a CR function and, under certain conditions, for the realisability of the CR three-manifold. These findings are consistent with previous works by Lewandowski, Nurowski, Tafel, Hill, and independently, by Mason.
  We also provide an analysis of the Weyl curvature of such conformal structures in terms of the underlying CR data. In particular, we arrive at a CR formulation of the asymptotic Einstein condition by viewing conformal infinity as a cross-section of Fefferman's circle bundle.</description>

      <title>Weighted cscK metrics on K\"ahler varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the weighted constant scalar curvature K\"ahler equations on mildly singular K\"ahler varieties. Assuming the existence of a suitable resolution of singularities, we establish the existence of singular weighted cscK metrics when the weighted Mabuchi functional is coercive for an extremal weight. This extends the works of Chen-Cheng and He to the singular weighted setting. Moreover, we provide a method for constructing examples of singular cscK metrics inspired by the work of Arezzo-Pacard. In contrast to the usual gluing techniques, our approach does not require a precise understanding about of the metric behavior near the singular locus.</description>

Abstract: We determine the number of singularities - counted whit multiplicities - of generic distributions of dimension and codimension one on smooth complete intersections in compact toric orbifolds with isolated singularities. We also present some applications of this results. First, we analyze the case of regular distributions. As a second application, we establish a Poincar\'e-type inequality that relates the multidegree of a foliation to the multidegrees of an invariant smooth complete intersection curve.</description>

      <title>Geometric Theory of Quark Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13688v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the nonperturbative solution of the loop equation in quenched QCD (one quark loop in full gluon vacuum, including nonplanar graphs). This solution relies on a specific local minimum of the Plateau problem -- one that is additive over the closed parts of the bounding loop formed at self-intersections. This surface applies to large loops, leading to quark confinement via a factor $\exp(-\kappa S[C])$ multiplying the perturbative Wilson loop $W_{pert}[C]$. Crucially, the confinement mechanism relies on the self-duality of the area derivative -- a property that exists exclusively in four dimensions. This geometric constraint ensures stability only in four dimensions, distinguishing the resulting spectrum from standard string models, which are stable only in higher embedding dimensions. We compute the high-energy meson spectrum resulting from this novel confinement mechanism. The result is a usual linear Regge trajectory with the slope $\alpha' = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma}$ in our normalization of string tension $\sigma = 2 \sqrt{2} \kappa$. However, there are no string modes to be added to the spectrum in our solution, which amounts to the static linear potential for the quark pair. As we argue, the fluctuations of ``flux tube'' between quarks are accounted for in the gluon diagrams in $W_{pert}[C]$, and do not contribute to the confining force. This eliminates the problems of quantization of string in four dimensions.</description>
