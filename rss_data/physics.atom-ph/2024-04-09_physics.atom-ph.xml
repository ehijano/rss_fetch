      <title>Strong-field ionization of chiral molecules with bicircular laser fields : sub-barrier dynamics, interference, and vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong-field ionization by counter-rotating two-color laser fields produces quantum interference between photoelectrons emitted on the leading and trailing edges of the laser field oscillations. We show that in chiral molecules, this interference is asymmetric along the light propagation direction and strongly enhances the sensitivity of the attoclock scheme to molecular chirality. Calculations in a toy-model molecule with a short-range chiral potential show that this enhanced sensitivity already emerges at the exit of the tunnel. We investigate the possible sources of chiral sensitivity in the tunneling process, and find that the interference between electron vortices plays a crucial role in the chiral response.</description>

      <title>Lifetimes of excited states in Rh-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative decay of excited states of the negative ion of rhodium, Rh$^-$, has been investigated experimentally and theoretically. The experiments were conducted at the Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring Experiment (DESIREE) facility at Stockholm University using selective photodetachment from a stored ion beam to monitor the time evolution of the excited state populations. The lifetimes of the Rh$^-$ $^3F_{3}$ and $^3F_{2}$ fine structure levels were measured to be 3.2(6)~s and 21(4)~s, respectively. An additional, previously unreported, higher-lying bound state of mixed $^1D_2+^3P_2+(4d^95s)^1D_2+^3F_2$ composition was observed and found to have a lifetime of 10.9(8)s. The binding energy of this state was determined to be in the interval $0.1584(2) $ eV $ &lt; E_b &lt; 0.2669(2)$ eV, using laser photodetachment threshold (LPT) spectroscopy. An autodetaching state with a lifetime of 480(10) microseconds was also observed. Theoretical calculations of the excited-state compositions, energies, and magnetic-dipole transition lifetimes were performed using the multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods. The calculated lifetimes of the $^3F_{3}$ and $^3F_{2}$ fine structure levels are in excellent agreement with the measured values. The present study should provide valuable insights into electron correlation effects in negative ions and forbidden radiative transitions.</description>

      <title>Precision measurements on Si-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision measurements of the electron affinities (EA) of the three stable isotopes of silicon, $^{28}$Si, $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si, have been performed at the cryogenic electrostatic ion-beam storage ring DESIREE. The quantum states of the ions were manipulated using laser depletion, and the ions were photodetached by laser photodetachment threshold spectroscopy. These EA values are the first reported for $^{29}$Si$^-$ and $^{30}$Si$^-$ and provide a reduced uncertainty for $^{28}$Si$^-$. The resulting EAs are $EA(^{28}$Si$) = 1.38952201(17)$ eV, $EA(^{29}$Si$) = 1.38952172(12)$ eV and $EA(^{29}$Si$) = 1.38952078(12)$ eV, with the corresponding isotope shifts $IS(^{29-28}$Si$) = 0.29(16)$ micro eV and $IS(^{30-28}$Si$) = 1.23(16) $ micro eV. In addition to these measurements, the resolution and signal-to-background level was sufficient to reveal the hyperfine structure splitting in the $^{29}$Si$^-$ isotope, which we report to be $1.8(4) micro eV.</description>

      <title>Intra- and intercycle analysis of intraband high-order harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study intraband high-order harmonic generation arising from a band-gap material driven by a linearly polarized laser field. We factorize the intraband high-order harmonic-generation signal into intracycle and intercycle terms. The intracycle term uniquely determines the spectral characteristics whereas the intercycle term merely modulates the spectral features by imposing energy conservation in the long-pulse limit. Through analysis of the intracycle interference, the cutoff is identified, and the origin of the harmonic selection rules is revealed. Further, it is outlined how different components of the bandstructure contribute to different regions of the harmonic spectrum, giving rise to non-trivial intensity scaling of individual harmonics in the plateau region.</description>
