      <title>An Improved Atlas of Full-Scan Spectra from ISO/SWS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an atlas of full-scan spectra from the Short-Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) aboard the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) after reprocessing and improving an earlier version published 22 years ago. The SWS spectra cover the wavelength range from 2.35 to 45.3 {\mu}m. They include scans in 12 separate bands, and we have updated the methods used to combine those bands into a single continuous spectrum. The main improvement comes from applying multiple constraints, including new photometry and spectra from the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope that have become available since the release of the original products, and individualized attention to each spectrum, to renormalize the separate bands into a more consistent single spectrum. In particular this removed unphysical negative fluxes that were common in the original data products. The new database, with 1035 reprocessed spectra, will be available to the community at IRSA, which also hosts the original processing.</description>

      <title>A family of binaries with an extreme mass ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplicity is ubiquitous among massive stars. While the stellar components usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars. We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature, rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong constraints for star formation models.</description>

      <title>Extending TESS Flare Frequency Distributions with CHEOPS: power-law or lognormal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar flares are intense bursts of radiation caused by magnetic reconnection events on active stars. They are especially frequent on M dwarfs, where they can strongly influence planetary habitability. Flare frequency distributions (FFDs) are usually modeled as power laws, but recent studies have proposed alternatives such as lognormal distributions, implying different flare mechanisms and planetary impacts. This work investigates which statistical distribution best describes flare occurrences on M dwarfs, considering both equivalent duration (ED), the quantity directly measured from photometry, and bolometric energy, which is more relevant for habitability assesments. We analyzed 110 M dwarfs observed with TESS and CHEOPS, detecting 5,620 flares. Complex events were decomposed, detection biases corrected, and FFDs from both missions scaled to build a combined distribution spanning nearly 10 orders of magnitude in bolometric energy. ED-based FFDs follow a power law, reflecting intrinsic photometric flare occurrence. However, bolometric energy-based FFDs deviate from a pure power law, being better described by a lognormal distribution or, more accurately, by a truncated power law with a break near $10^{33}$ erg, the typical superflare threshold. This truncation suggests a change in flare-generation physics between regular flares and superflares, with implications for the cumulative impact on exoplanetary atmospheres. The apparent low-energy flattening previously attributed to lognormal behavior arises from observational biases, while the drop in flare frequency above $10^{35}$ erg remains unexplained, possibly reflecting an intrinsic cutoff or current observational limits. The upcoming PLATO mission will be well suited to probe both regimes.</description>

      <title>The lack of fast rotators in Cyg OB2. I. Insights from spectral reclassification of its B0 population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex -- one of the most active star-forming regions of the Galaxy -- hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies, the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}&gt;200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive star evolution.
  Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars, and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0, are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2.
  Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassify the known B0 population in Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both new and pre-existing optical spectroscopy. Finally, we compute projected rotational velocities using iacob-broad.
  Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in fact, late-O types. Only 6 stars in the entire dataset show $v\sin{i}&gt;200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just 1 new O-type star exceeding this threshold.
  Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may imply that fast rotators has not been produced yet due to binary interactions; (ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway stars; (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation (reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at birth.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in planetary nebulae detected through non-thermal radio continuum emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Planetary nebulae are shells ejected by low- and intermediate-mass stars. The slow wind ejected by the asymptotic giant branch star is compressed by a fast stellar wind to produce an expanding gaseous shell surrounding a hot bubble. The shell is a source of thermal radio emission which shows a spectral index between -0.1 and 2. Only two planetary nebulae are known to show non-thermal radio emission indicating magnetic fields and non-thermal electrons. Aims. The aim of this paper is verification of presence of magnetic fields of planetary nebulae. Magnetic fields can have a significant influence on shaping planetary nebulae. Methods. We observed a sample of northern planetary nebulae in radio continuum at 144 MHz with the Low Frequency Array. We combined our observations with archival observations at higher frequencies. Results. The spectral indices in 30 planetary nebulae were below -0.1, indicating non-thermal radio emission. The majority of this sample consists of bipolar planetary nebulae, which are known to originate from binary central stars. Most of the nebulae have sizes larger than 20 arcsec. Magnetic fields and nonthermal emission may be common in smaller planetary nebulae, but can be suppressed by thermal emission. Our results suggest that different mechanisms can be responsible for the origin of magnetic fields and non-thermal emission in planetary nebulae.</description>

      <title>Glycolaldehyde and ethanol toward the L1157 outflow: resolved images and constraints on glycolaldehyde formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two main formation routes have been proposed for interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs): on dust grain surfaces and in the gas phase. Observing such molecules in protostellar outflow shock regions - provided that their ages are well-constrained - can help distinguish between these pathways by probing chemical evolution over time. This study focuses on the potential daughter-mother relationship of glycolaldehyde (CH$_2$OHCHO) and ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH), previously proposed in the literature. We test whether gas-phase reactions converting ethanol into glycolaldehyde derived in these works can explain the observed abundance of the latter in star-forming regions. We target the southern outflow of L1157, which hosts three shock regions, B0, B1 and B2, of increasing ages: about 900, 1500 and 2300 yr. We obtained high-resolution IRAM NOEMA maps of three lines of glycolaldehyde and one line of ethanol. We derived their abundances in the three shocks and used a pseudo time-dependent astrochemical model to simulate gas-phase and grain-surface formation scenarios for glycolaldehyde. Ethanol is assumed to form on grains and be released in the gas by shocks, where it is gradually converted into glycolaldehyde via the ethanol-tree reaction network. We present the first spatially resolved maps of glycolaldehyde and ethanol in the L1157 southern outflow, and more generally toward solar-like star forming regions. The abundance ratio [CH$_2$OHCHO]/[C$_2$H$_5$OH] increases from B1 to B2, consistent with model predictions. However, the model cannot reproduce all three shocked regions simultaneously, suggesting that one of the assumptions of our model, such as the same excitation temperature and grain composition in B0, B1 and B2, or gas temperature evolution, is wrong. Nonetheless, our modeling rules out the possibility that all the observed gaseous glycolaldehyde is a grain-surface product.</description>

      <title>Rare Find: Discovery and chemo-dynamical properties of two s-process enhanced RR Lyrae stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15723v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of two RR Lyrae stars exhibiting significant s-process element enrichment, a rare class previously represented solely by TY Gruis. Our goal is to characterise these objects chemically and dynamically, exploring their origins and evolutionary histories. Using high-resolution spectroscopy from HERMES@AAT and UVES@VLT, we derived detailed chemical abundances of key s-process elements, carbon along with $\alpha$-elements. We also employed Gaia DR3 astrometric data to analyse their kinematics, orbital properties, and classify their Galactic population membership. We compared observational results with theoretical asymptotic giant branch nucleosynthesis models to interpret their enrichment patterns. Both stars exhibit clear signatures of s-process enrichment, with significant overabundances in second-peak elements such as Ba and La compared to first-peak Y and Zr. Comparison with AGB nucleosynthesis models suggests their progenitors experienced pollution of s-process-rich material, consistent with early binary interactions. However, notable discrepancies in dilution factors highlight the need for more refined low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models. We also explore and discuss alternative scenarios, including sub-luminous post-AGB-like evolution or double episodes of mass transfer. Our findings confirm the existence of s-process-enhanced RR Lyrae stars and demonstrate the importance of combining chemical and dynamical diagnostics to unveil their complex evolutionary pathways. Future detailed binary evolution modelling and long-term orbital monitoring are essential to resolve their formation scenarios and assess the role of binarity in the evolution of pulsating variables.</description>

      <title>Radiative Correction from Secret Neutrino Interactions and Implications for Neutrino-Scattering Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New, neutrinophilic mediators are one potential extension beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Often, studies of neutrinophilic mediator consist of searching for direct evidence of its production and/or its tree-level virtual effect for generating strong neutrino self-interaction. In this work, we focus instead on the fact that such new mediators \textit{also} lead to deviations in neutrino-matter scattering via radiative corrections. With a mediator mass well below the electroweak scale, these effects are potentially observable in a variety of contexts, including coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), neutrino deeply-inelastic scattering ($\nu$DIS), and neutrino-electron scattering (e.g., at Borexino). Additionally, such effects lead to new contributions to the $Z$-boson decay width and to non-standard neutrino interactions relevant for long-baseline oscillation experiments. We explore all of these scenarios in some depth, building on the rich phenomenology associated with neutrinophilic mediators.</description>

      <title>TOI-283 b: A transiting mini-Neptune in a 17.6-day orbit discovered with TESS and ESPRESSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are missing from our Solar System, yet they appear to be the most abundant planetary types in our Galaxy. A detailed characterization of key planets within this population is important for understanding the formation mechanisms of rocky and gas giant planets and the diversity of planetary interior structures. In 2019, NASA's TESS satellite found a transiting planet candidate in a 17.6-day orbit around the star TOI-283. We started radial velocity (RV) follow-up observations with ESPRESSO to obtain a mass measurement. Mass and radius are measurements critical for planetary classification and internal composition modeling. We used ESPRESSO spectra to derive the stellar parameters of the planet candidate host star TOI-283. We then performed a joint analysis of the photometric and RV data of this star, using Gaussian processes to model the systematic noise present in both datasets. We find that the host is a bright K-type star ($d = 82.4$ pc, $\mathrm{T}_\mathrm{eff} = 5213 \pm 70$ K, $V = 10.4$ mag) with a mass and radius of $\mathrm{M}_\star = 0.80 \pm 0.01\; \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $\mathrm{R}_\star = 0.85 \pm 0.03\; \mathrm{R}_\odot$. The planet has an orbital period of $P = 17.617$ days, a size of $\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{p} = 2.34 \pm 0.09\; \mathrm{R}_\oplus$, and a mass of $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{p} = 6.54 \pm 2.04\; \mathrm{M}_\oplus$. With an equilibrium temperature of $\sim$600 K and a bulk density of $\rho_\mathrm{p} = 2.81 \pm 0.93$ g cm$^{-3}$, this planet is positioned in the mass-radius diagram where planetary models predict H$_2$O- and H/He-rich envelopes. The ESPRESSO RV data also reveal a long-term trend that is probably related to the star's activity cycle. Further RV observations are required to confirm whether this signal originates from stellar activity or another planetary body in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the formulation, algorithm and numerical tests of the magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell (MHD-PIC) method with particles treated under the guiding center approximation, which we term the MHD-gPIC method, and it is implemented in the Athena++ MHD code. The new MHD-gPIC model consists of thermal (cold) fluid and high-energy particles whose dynamics are integrated through guiding center equations including drift motion, with carefully evaluated source terms as particle backreaction. The code is validated with a series of tests, and it is expected to be primarily applicable to study particle acceleration and transport in systems where gyro-resonance is considered insignificant. We also present preliminary studies of particle acceleration during non-relativistic magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Follow-up of Young High-$\alpha$ Dwarf Star Candidates: Still Likely Genuinely Young</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of whether genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars exist has been discussed for over a decade since their discovery from asteroseismology of giant stars as it is challenging to break the degeneracy between the binary interaction and the genuinely young scenarios. Young high-$\alpha$ stars are hard to explain with traditional chemical evolution model as the high-$\alpha$ disk is typically associated with the early epoch of star formation in the Milky Way. Combined with recent advances of gyrochronology, and that $^7$Li can serve as an unambiguous indicator for identifying merger products in dwarfs thanks to its low burning temperature, we identified young high-$\alpha$ dwarf candidate stars through their fast rotation in a previous study. In this paper, we performed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates using Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI), and confirm 3 additional stars that are most likely genuinely young. Together with the star from the earlier paper, we find three out of four of them center around [Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, are ~5 Gyr old, and have a similar amount of elevated Li (~0.5 dex) and Al (~0.1 dex) compared to stars with matching $\log g$, $T_{\rm eff}$, Mg, and Fe within observational uncertainties, hinting at their common formation pathway.</description>

Abstract: HD 100453 disk is a prototypical companion-disk interaction system hosting a pair of spirals and a substellar companion. We present new noncoronagraphic high-contrast imaging observations of HD 100453 with $V$ filter on SPHERE/ZIMPOL. We combined high-contrast imaging data of the reflected light from 0.55 to 2.2 $\mu m$ using the $V$, $I'$, $J$, and $Ks$ band data of ZIMPOL and IRDIS at VLT/SPHERE. For each observational epoch, we corrected for the smearing effect to derive the intrinsic disk-integrated polarized flux. We derived a steady increase with wavelengths from $\hat{Q}_{\varphi}/I_{\star}(V)=0.3\%$ to $\hat{Q}_{\varphi}/I_{\star}(K)=1.2\%$. We applied reference differential imaging to extract the disk intensity for the $V$ and $Ks$ bands using star hopping observations. We obtained the first $V$-band total intensity for HD 100453 with ZIMPOL star hopping. The integrated total flux $I_{\rm disk}/I_{\star}(V)=1.5\%$ increases to $I_{\rm disk}/I_{\star}(K)=4.8\%$. Both the total intensity and the polarization fraction show red colors, and the intrinsic maximum degree of polarization increases moderately from $40\%$ to $55\%$. We then used RADMC-3D radiative transfer modeling with a parametrized Henyey-Greenstein phase function to constrain the dust properties. From the $V$ to $Ks$ band, the dominating dust in the outer disk has an increasing scattering albedo and degree of polarization, while the asymmetry parameter slightly decreases. The outer disk of HD 100453 contains sub-micron-sized low porosity grains/aggregates. The cavity in scattered light is not empty and is replenished with optically thin dust with a maximum size of $\leq 0.1\mu m$. The linear polarization is higher in the spiral region than in the other regions, suggesting different dust properties in those regions.</description>

Abstract: The equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating anisotropic self-gravitating fluids are computed using the extended Hartle structure equations, including anisotropic effects, derived in our previous paper. We focus on the so-called $\mathcal{C}$-star, whose anisotropic pressure follows a fully covariant equation of state (EoS), while a standard polytrope describes the radial pressure. We determine surface and integral properties, such as the moment of inertia, mass change, mass quadrupole moment, and ellipticity. Notably, for certain values of the compactness parameter, highly anisotropic $\mathcal{C}$-stars exhibit a prolate shape rather than the typical oblate form, an intriguing behavior also observed in other anisotropic systems like Bowers-Liang spheres and stars governed by a quasi-local EoS. Although the $\mathcal{C}$-stars considered in this study are limited by stability criteria and cannot sustain compactness beyond $M/R\approx0.38$, we found indications that certain rotational perturbations exhibit similarities to those observed in other ultracompact systems approaching the black hole limit.</description>
