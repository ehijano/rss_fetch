      <title>Infinitely Stable Disordered Systems on Emergent Fractal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quenched disordered systems, the existence of ordering is generally believed to be only possible in the weak disorder regime (disregarding models of spin-glass type). In particular, sufficiently large random field is expected to prohibit any finite temperature ordering. Here, we show that this is not necessarily true. We provide physically motivated examples of systems in which disorder induces an ordering that is *infinitely stable* in the sense that: (1) there exists ordering at arbitrarily large disorder strength and (2) the transition temperature remains, asymptotically, nonzero in the limit of infinite disorder. The ordering is spatially localized on the boundary of a disorder-induced, emergent percolating fractal structure. The examples we give are most naturally described when the spatial dimension $d \ge 3$, but can also be formulated when $d=2$, provided that the underlying graph is non-planar.</description>

      <title>A statistical mechanics derivation and implementation of non-conservative phase field models for front propagation in elastic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past several decades, phase field modeling has been established as a standard simulation technique for mesoscopic science, allowing for seamless boundary tracking of moving interfaces and relatively easy coupling to other physical phenomena. However, despite its widespread success, phase field modeling remains largely driven by phenomenological justifications except in a handful of instances. In this work, we leverage a recently developed statistical mechanics framework for non-equilibrium phenomena, called Stochastic Thermodynamics with Internal Variables (STIV), to provide the first derivation of a phase field model for front propagation in a one dimensional elastic medium without appeal to phenomenology or fitting to experiments or simulation data. In the resulting model, the variables obey a gradient flow with respect to a non-equilibrium free energy, although notably, the dynamics of the strain and phase variables are coupled, and while the free energy functional is non-local in the phase field variable, it deviates from the traditional Landau-Ginzburg form. Moreover, in the systems analyzed here, the model accurately captures stress induced nucleation of transition fronts without the need to incorporate additional physics. We find that the STIV phase field model compares favorably to Langevin simulations of the microscopic system and we provide two numerical implementations enabling one to simulate arbitrary interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Exact closed-form recurrence probabilities for biased random walks at any step number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a closed-form expression for the survival probability of a discrete 1D biased random walk to not return to its origin after N steps. Our expression is exact for any N, including the elusive intermediate range, thereby allowing one to study its convergence to the large N limit. In that limit we recover Polya's recurrence probability, i.e. the survival probability equals the magnitude of the bias. We then obtain a closed-form expression for the probability of last return. In contrast to the bimodal behavior for the unbiased case, we show that the probability of last return decays monotonically throughout the walk beyond a critical bias. We obtain a simple expression for the critical bias as a function of the walk length, and show that it saturates at $1/\sqrt{3}$ for infinitely long walks. This property is missed when using expressions developed for the large N limit. Finally, we discuss application to molecular motors' biased random walks along microtubules, which are of intermediate step number.</description>

      <title>Field-theoretic approach to flat polymerized membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the field-theoretic renormalization-group approach to critical properties of flat polymerized membranes. We start with a presentation of the flexural effective model that is entirely expressed in terms of a transverse (flexural) field with non-local interactions. We then provide a detailed account of the full three-loop computations of the renormalization-group functions of the model within the dimensional regularization scheme. The latter allows us to consider the general case of a $d$-dimensional membrane embedded in $D$-dimensional space. Focusing on the critical flat phase of two-dimensional membranes $(d = 2)$ in three-dimensional space $(D = 3)$, we analyse the corresponding flow diagram and present the derivation of the anomalous stiffness. The latter controls all the other critical exponents of the theory such as the roughness exponent and the scaling of the elastic constants. State-of-the-art four-loop results as well as discussions on the structure of the perturbative series and comparison with other approaches are also provided.</description>

      <title>The $S=\frac{1}{2}$ XY and XYZ models on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice do not possess nontrivial local conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Inferring intermediate states by leveraging the many-body Arrhenius law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. Moreover, they dominate a system's evolution in deciding the selective outcome or shedding light on the preferred mechanism on how a system explores the energy landscape. It is thus crucial to develop techniques to quantify these metastabilities hence uncovering key details of the energy landscape. Here, we propose a powerful method by leveraging a many-body Arrhenius law that detects the metastabilites in an escape problem, involving interacting particles with excluded volume confined to a complex energy landscape. Observing transport in colloidal systems or translocation of macromolecules through biological pores can be an ideal test bed to verify our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we investigate how to correctly describe sums of independent and identically distributed random velocities in the theory of special relativity. We derive a one-dimensional probability distribution of velocities stable under relativistic velocity addition. In a given system, this allows identifying distinct physical regimes in terms of the distribution's concavity at the origin and the probability of measuring relativistic velocities. These features provide a protocol to assess the relevance of stochastic relativistic effects in actual experiments. As examples, we find agreement with previous results about heavy-ion diffusion and show that our findings are consistent with the distribution of momentum deviations observed in measurements of antiproton cooling.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of an active wheel rolling in circles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrated granular matter constitutes a useful system for studying the physics of active matter. Usually, self-propulsion is induced in grains through suitable asymmetry in the particle design. In this paper, we show that a symmetrical mini wheel placed on a vibrating plate self-propels along circular trajectories, showing chiral active dynamics. The chiral activity emerges through a sequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the particle's kinetics. The fact that isotropy, fore-aft, and chiral symmetries are broken spontaneously leads to distinct statistics, which include a temporal evolution involving stochastic resetting, a non-Gaussian velocity distribution with multiple peaks, broad power-law curvature distribution, and a bounded chirality probability, along with a phase transition from passive achiral to active chiral state as a function of vibration amplitude. Our study establishes the vibrated wheel as a three-state chiral active system that can serve as a model experimental system to study the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics of chiral active systems and can inspire novel locomotion strategies in robotics.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous generation of angular momentum in chiral active crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional chiral active crystal composed of underdamped chiral active particles. These particles, characterized by intrinsic handedness and persistence, interact via linear forces derived from harmonic potentials. Chirality plays a pivotal role in shaping the system's behavior: it reduces displacement and velocity fluctuations while inducing cross-spatial correlations among different Cartesian components of velocity. These features distinguish chiral crystals from their non-chiral counterparts, leading to the emergence of net angular momentum, as predicted analytically. This angular momentum, driven by the torque generated by the chiral active force, exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the degree of chirality. Additionally, it contributes to the entropy production rate, as revealed through a path-integral analysis. We investigate the dynamic properties of the crystal in both Fourier and real space. Chirality induces a non-dispersive peak in the displacement spectrum, which underlies the generation of angular momentum and oscillations in time-dependent autocorrelation functions or mean-square displacement, all of which are analytically predicted.</description>

      <title>Dissipation alters modes of information encoding in small quantum reservoirs near criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing near-term quantum devices to tackle temporal machine learning tasks. Yet identifying the mechanisms that underlie enhanced performance remains challenging, particularly in many-body open systems where nonlinear interactions and dissipation intertwine in complex ways. Here, we investigate a minimal model of a driven-dissipative quantum reservoir described by two coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, an experimentally realizable platform that features controllable coupling, intrinsic nonlinearity, and tunable photon loss. Using Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we examine how different dynamical regimes encode input drive signals in terms of redundancy (information shared by each oscillator) and synergy (information accessible only through their joint observation). Our key results show that, near a critical point marking a dynamical bifurcation, the system transitions from predominantly redundant to synergistic encoding. We further demonstrate that synergy amplifies short-term responsiveness, thereby enhancing immediate memory retention, whereas strong dissipation leads to more redundant encoding that supports long-term memory retention. These findings elucidate how the interplay of instability and dissipation shapes information processing in small quantum systems, providing a fine-grained, information-theoretic perspective for analyzing and designing QRC platforms.</description>

      <title>Modern Approach to 2D Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary aim of these lecture notes is to introduce the modern approach to two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT). The study of analytical methods in two-dimensional conformal field theory has developed over several decades, starting with BPZ. The development of analytical methods, particularly in rational conformal field theory (RCFT), has been remarkable, with complete classifications achieved for certain model groups. One motivation for studying CFT comes from its ability to describe quantum critical systems. Given that realistic quantum critical systems are fundamentally RCFTs, it is somewhat natural that the analytical methods of RCFT have evolved significantly.
  CFTs other than RCFTs are called irrational conformal field theories (ICFTs). Compared to RCFTs, the study of ICFTs has not progressed as much. Putting aside whether there is a physical motivation or not, ICFTs inherently possess a difficulty that makes them challenging to approach. However, with the development of quantum gravity, the advancement of analytical methods for ICFTs has become essential. The reason lies in the AdS/CFT correspondence. AdS/CFT refers to the relationship between $d+1$ dimensional quantum gravity and $d$ dimensional CFT. Within this correspondence, the CFT appears as a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity. Except in special cases, this CFT belongs to ICFT. Against this backdrop, the methods for ICFTs have rapidly developed in recent years. Many of these ICFT methods are indispensable for modern quantum gravity research. Unfortunately, they cannot be learned from textbooks on 2D CFTs. These lecture notes aim to fill this gap. Specifically, we will cover techniques that have already been applied in many studies, such as {\it HHLL block} and {\it monodromy method}, and important results that have become proper nouns, such as {\it Hellerman bound} and {\it HKS bound}.</description>

      <title>Classical Annealing of Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass Using Kubo-Suzuki Mean-field Ising Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate numerically a fast classical annealing scheme for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, employing the Suzuki-Kubo meanfield Ising dynamics (supplemented by a modified Thouless-Anderson-Palmer reaction field). The resultant dynamics, starting from any arbitrary paramagnetic phase (with local $m_i=\pm 1$ for the $i^{th}$ spin, and the global magnetization $m=0$), takes the system quickly to an appropriate state with small local values of magnetization ($m_i$) commensurate with the (frustrated) interactions as the temperature decreases with the annealing which practically remains (in an effective adiabatic way) close to the ground state as the $m_i$'s and the spin glass order parameter $q$ grows to unity. For an $N$-spin SK model (with $N$ up to 8000) the annealed ground state energy per spin $E^0_N - E_0$ is found to scale as $N^{-2/3}$, with $E^0 = -0.7633\pm 0.0003 $ (the universal value is $E^0 =-0.7631667265 \dots$), fluctuation $\sigma_N $ in $E^0_N$ decreases as $\sim N^{-3/4}$ and the annealing time $\tau_N \sim N$.</description>

      <title>Scheme to Detect the Strong-to-weak Symmetry Breaking via Randomized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking plays a central role in classifying the phases of quantum many-body systems. Recent developments have highlighted a novel symmetry-breaking pattern, in which the strong symmetry of a density matrix spontaneously breaks to the week symmetry. This strong-to-weak symmetry breaking is typically detected using multi-replica correlation functions, such as the R\'enyi-2 correlator. In this letter, we propose a practical protocol for detecting strong-to-weak symmetry breaking in experiments using the randomized measurement toolbox. Our scheme involves collecting the results of random Pauli measurements for (i) the original quantum state and (ii) the quantum state after evolution with the charged operators. Based on the measurement results, with a large number of samples, we can obtain the exact solution to the R\'enyi-2 correlator. With a small sample size, we can still provide an alternative approach to estimate the phase boundary to a decent accuracy. We perform numerical simulations of Ising chains with all-to-all decoherence as an exemplary demonstration. Our result opens the opportunity for the experimental studies of the novel quantum phases in mixed quantum states.</description>

      <title>Finite size scaling of survival statistics in metapopulation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial metapopulation models are fundamental to theoretical ecology, enabling to study how landscape structure influences global species dynamics. Traditional models, including recent generalizations, often rely on the deterministic limit of stochastic processes, assuming large population sizes. However, stochasticity - arising from dispersal events and population fluctuations - profoundly shapes ecological dynamics. In this work, we extend the classical metapopulation framework to account for finite populations, examining the impact of stochasticity on species persistence and dynamics. Specifically, we analyze how the limited capacity of local habitats influences survival, deriving analytical expressions for the finite-size scaling of the survival probability near the critical transition between survival and extinction. Crucially, we demonstrate that the deterministic metapopulation capacity plays a fundamental role in the statistics of survival probability and extinction time moments. These results provide a robust foundation for integrating demographic stochasticity into classical metapopulation models and their extensions.</description>

      <title>Role of electron-electron interaction in the Mpemba effect in quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect has initially been noticed in macroscopic systems -- namely that hot water can freeze faster than cold water -- but recently its extension to open quantum systems has attracted significant attention. This phenomenon can be explained in the context of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of Markovian systems, relying on the amplitudes of different decay modes of the system dynamics. Here, we study the Mpemba effect in a single-level quantum dot coupled to a thermal bath, highlighting the role of the sign and magnitude of the electron-electron interaction in the occurrence of the Mpemba effect. We gain physical insights into the decay modes from a dissipative symmetry of this system called fermionic duality. Based on this analysis of the relaxation to equilibrium of the dot, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the Mpemba effect using two thermodynamically relevant measures of the distance to equilibrium, the nonequilibrium free energy and the dot energy. We furthermore compare this effect to a possible exponential speedup of the relaxation. Finally, we propose experimentally relevant schemes for the state preparation and explore different ways of observing the Mpemba effect in quantum dots in experiments.</description>

      <title>Effects of noise-induced coherence on the performance of a four-level laser heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of noise-induced coherence on the performance analysis of a degenerate four-level quantum heat engine with particular focus on the universal nature of efficiency, which refers to the appearance of the first two universal terms $\eta_C/2$ and $\eta_C^2/8$ in series expansion of the efficiency at maximum power under a left-right symmetry in the system. Firstly, for a two-parameter optimization scheme, we derive an analytic expression for the efficiency at maximum power for the near-equilibrium condition and show that presence of noise-induced coherence breaks the left-right symmetry of the system. However, when the operation of the engine is restricted to either high-temperature or low-temperature regime, we discuss the conditions under which the left-right symmetry can be retained in each case, giving rise to the universal characteristic of efficiency. In case of one-parameter optimization, we show that while the universality of the first linear term $\eta_c/2$ is robust and holds consistently across all conditions, the universality of the quadratic term $\eta_C^2/8$ depends on the constraints imposed on the control parameters. Finally, we examine the behavior of power as a function of noise-induced coherence parameter highlighting the role of matter-field coupling in determining the suitable operation regime for the heat engine to reap the benefits of noise-induced coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms by which complex correlations emerge through the dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonequilibrium states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we propose a novel quench protocol, termed the ``crosscap quench'', to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Essential difference between 2D and 3D from the perspective of real-space renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that area laws of quantum-information concepts indicate limitations of block transformations as well-behaved real-space renormalization group (RG) maps, which in turn guides the design of better RG schemes. Mutual-information area laws imply the difficulty of Kadanoff's block-spin method in two dimensions (2D) or higher due to the growth of short-scale correlations among the spins on the boundary of a block. A leap to the tensor-network RG, in hindsight, follows the guidance of mutual information and is efficient in 2D, thanks to its mixture of quantum and classical perspectives and the saturation of entanglement entropy in 2D. In three dimensions (3D), however, entanglement grows according to the area law, posing a threat to 3D block-tensor map as an apt RG transformation. As a numerical evidence, we show that estimations of 3D Ising critical exponents fail to improve by retaining more couplings. As a guidance to proceed, a tensor-network toy model is proposed to capture the 3D entanglement-entropy area law.</description>

      <title>Probing levitodynamics with multi-stochastic forces and the simple applications on the dark matter detection in optical levitation experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the terrestrial environment is permeated by dark matter, the levitation experiences damping forces and fluctuations attributed to dark matter. This paper investigates levitodynamics with multiple stochastic forces, including thermal drag, photon recoil, feedback, etc., assuming that all of these forces adhere to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The ratio of total damping to the stochastic damping coefficient distinguishes the levitodynamics from cases involving only one single stochastic force. The heating and cooling processes are formulated to determine the limits of temperature change. All sources of stochastic forces are comprehensively examined, revealing that dark matter collisions cannot be treated analogously to fluid dynamics. Additionally, a meticulous analysis is presented, elucidating the intricate relationship between the fundamental transfer cross-section and the macroscopic transfer cross-section. While the dark damping coefficient is suppressed by the mass of the levitated particle, scattering can be coherently enhanced based on the scale of the component microscopic particle, the atomic form factor, and the static structure factor. Hence, dark damping holds the potential to provide valuable insights into the detection of the macroscopic strength of fundamental particles. We propose experimental procedures for levitation and employ linear estimation to extract the dark damping coefficient. Utilizing current levitation results, we demonstrate that the fundamental transfer cross section of dark matter can be of the order $\sigma^{\rm D}_{T}\lsim {\cal O}(10^{-26})\rm cm^2$.</description>

      <title>Condensate-induced organization of the mass profile and emergent power laws in the Takayasu aggregation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-mass condensates, which coexist with a power-law-decaying distribution in the one-dimensional Takayasu model of mass aggregation with input, were recently found in numerical simulations. Here, we establish the occurrence of condensates by analyzing exact recursions for finite systems and further show that they have a strong effect on the properties of the system. In the steady state of a large but finite system, there is a single condensate, whose random movement through the system leads to a reorganization of the mass profile on a macroscopic scale. A scaling analysis of the mean mass and standard deviation at different distances from the condensate leads to the surprising conclusion that the mass distribution on a macroscopic number of sites around the condensate follows a power-law decay with an exponent 5/3, while farther-away sites show the customary Takayasu exponent 4/3, with a crossover in between. Finally, the exit of condensates from a system with open boundaries has a strong effect on the temporal fluctuations of the total mass in the steady state. Their departure is followed by a buildup of mass and subsequent departures, leading to strong intermittency, established through a divergence of the flatness as the scaled time approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Construction of $G_2$ symmetry in a Hubbard-type model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.14126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the smallest exceptional Lie group and the automorphism group of the non-associative algebra octonions, $G_2$ is often employed for describing exotic symmetry structures. We construct $G_2$ symmetry in a self-dual Hubbard-type model with 4-component fermions in a bipartite lattice, which lies in the intersection of two $SO(7)$ algebras connected by the structure constants of octonions. Depending on the representations of the order parameters, the $G_2$ symmetry can be spontaneously broken into either an $SU(3)$ one associated with an $S^6$ sphere Goldstone manifold, or, into $SU(2)\times U(1)$ with a Grassmannian Goldstone manifold. In the quantum disordered states, quantum fluctuations generate the effective $SU(3)$ and $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge theories for low energy fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although quantum mechanics underpins the microscopic behavior of all materials, its effects are often obscured at the macroscopic level by thermal fluctuations. A notable exception is a zero-temperature phase transition, where scaling laws emerge entirely due to quantum correlations over a diverging length scale. The accurate description of such transitions is challenging for classical simulation methods of quantum systems, and is a natural application space for quantum simulation. These quantum simulations are, however, not without their own challenges \textemdash~representing quantum critical states on a quantum computer requires encoding entanglement of a large number of degrees of freedom, placing strict demands on the coherence and fidelity of the computer's operations. Using Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer, we address these challenges by employing hierarchical quantum tensor-network techniques, creating the ground state of the critical transverse-field Ising chain on 128-sites with sufficient fidelity to extract accurate critical properties of the model. Our results suggest a viable path to quantum-assisted tensor network contraction beyond the limits of classical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermalization slowing down of a quantum many-body spin system upon approach to two distinct integrability limits. Motivated by previous studies of classical systems, we identify two thermalization time scales: one quantum Lyapunov time scale is extracted by quantifying operator growth in time on an appropriately defined basis, while another ergodization time scale is related to the statistics of fluctuations of the time-evolved operator around its mean value based on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Using a paradigmatic Quantum Ising chain we find that both timescales diverge upon approach to integrability. We investigate the relative strength of the divergence in the two limits and find that despite significant qualitative differences in the mechanism of integrability breaking, the timescales diverge in a similar fashion. This allows us to establish a universality of integrability breaking in quantum spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deep thermalization in Gaussian continuous-variable quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover emergent universality arising in the equilibration dynamics of multimode continuous-variable systems. Specifically, we study the ensemble of pure states supported on a small subsystem of a few modes, generated by Gaussian measurements on the remaining modes of a globally pure bosonic Gaussian state. We find that beginning from highly entangled, complex global states, such as random Gaussian states and product squeezed states coupled via a deep array of linear optical elements, the induced ensemble attains a universal form, independent of the choice of measurement basis: it is composed of unsqueezed coherent states whose displacements are distributed normally and isotropically, with variance depending on only the particle-number density of the system. We further show that the emergence of such a universal form is consistent with a generalized maximum entropy principle, which endows the limiting ensemble, which we call the "Gaussian Scrooge distribution", with a special quantum information-theoretic property of having minimal accessible information. Our results represent a conceptual generalization of the recently introduced notion of "deep thermalization" in discrete-variable quantum many-body systems -- a novel form of equilibration going beyond thermalization of local observables -- to the realm of continuous-variable quantum systems. Moreover, it demonstrates how quantum information-theoretic perspectives can unveil new physical phenomena and principles in quantum dynamics and statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Quantum Distinction of Regular and Chaotic Classical Dynamics in Dissipative Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chaos has recently received increasing attention due to its relationship with experimental and theoretical studies of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, thermalization, and the scrambling of quantum information. In an isolated system, quantum chaos refers to properties of the spectrum that emerge when the classical counterpart of the system is chaotic. However, despite experimental progress leading to longer coherence times, interactions with an environment can never be neglected, which calls for a definition of quantum chaos in dissipative systems. Advances in this direction were brought by the Grobe-Haake-Sommers (GHS) conjecture, which connects chaos in a dissipative classical system with cubic repulsion of the eigenvalues of the quantum counterpart and regularity with linear level repulsion. Here, we show that the GHS conjecture does not hold for the open Dicke model, which is a spin-boson model of experimental interest. We show that the onset of cubic level repulsion in the open quantum model is not always related with chaotic structures in the classical limit. This result challenges the universality of the GHS conjecture and raises the question of what is the source of spectral correlations in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Thermomechanical Approach to Calculating Mechanical Stresses in Inhomogeneous Fluids and Its Applications to Ionic Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10597v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This extended article presents a thermomechanical approach for calculating the stress tensor from the thermodynamic potential of inhomogeneous fluids and some applications to ionic fluids. The technique, based on the invariance of the fluid's thermodynamic potential with respect to spatial transformations of translation and rotation, offers an alternative to the general covariant approach developed by two of the authors. We apply this technique to both pure mean-field theories of fluids in general and a theory that includes thermal fluctuations of the order parameter, using the example of ionic fluids. Additionally, we apply the thermomechanical approach to fluid models with vector order parameters, such as liquid dielectrics. For this case, we obtain a general expression for the stress tensor. Furthermore, we discuss specific issues related to the calculation of disjoining pressure in ionic fluids confined in nanoscale slit-like pores with metal or dielectric walls, using the Coulomb gas model. To test the robustness of the proposed approach, we reproduce a number of known results from the statistical theory of inhomogeneous fluids and obtain several new ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with ``ultrafast'' dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits.</description>

Abstract: Achieving general (off-diagonal) measurements is one of the most significant challenges in quantum Monte Carlo, which strongly limits its application during the decades of development. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and (imaginary) time. Our work paves an easy and efficient way to capture the complex off-diagonal operators in quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which provides new insight to address the challenge of quantum Monte Carlo.</description>
