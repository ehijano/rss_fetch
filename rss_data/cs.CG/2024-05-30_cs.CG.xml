      <title>Minimum Strict Consistent Subset in Paths, Spiders, Combs and Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a connected simple graph G = (V,E), each vertex of V is colored by a color from the set of colors C={c_1, c_2,..., c_{\alpha}}. We take a subset S of V, such that for every vertex v in V\S, at least one vertex of the same color is present in its set of nearest neighbors in S. We refer to such a S as a consistent subset (CS) The Minimum Consistent Subset (MCS) problem is the computation of a consistent subset of the minimum size. It is established that MCS is NP-complete for general graphs, including planar graphs. We expand our study to interval graphs and circle graphs in an attempt to gain a complete understanding of the computational complexity of the MCS problem across various graph classes. The strict consistent subset is a variant of consistent subset problems. We take a subset S^{\prime} of V, such that for every vertex v in V\S^{\prime}, all the vertices in its set of nearest neighbors in S have the same color as v. We refer to such a S^{\prime} as a strict consistent subset (SCS). The Minimum Strict Consistent Subset (MSCS) problem is the computation of a consistent subset of the minimum size.
  We demonstrate that MSCS is NP-hard in general graphs. We show a 2-approximation in trees. Later, we show polynomial-time algorithms in trees. Later, we demonstrate faster polynomial-time algorithms in paths, spiders, and combs.</description>

      <title>Homotopy-Aware Multi-Agent Path Planning in Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient framework using the Dynnikov coordinates for homotopy-aware multi-agent path planning in the plane. We developed a method to generate multiple homotopically distinct solutions of multi-agent path planning problem in the plane by combining our framework with revised prioritized planning and proved its completeness in the grid world under specific assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrated the scalability of our method for the number of agents. We also confirmed experimentally that homotopy-aware planning contributes to avoiding locally optimal solutions when searching for low-cost trajectories for a swarm of agents in a continuous environment.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Bounds on the Reach of an Algebraic Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Separation bounds are a fundamental measure of the complexity of solving a zero-dimensional system as it measures how difficult it is to separate its zeroes. In the positive dimensional case, the notion of reach takes its place. In this paper, we provide bounds on the reach of a smooth algebraic variety in terms of several invariants of interest: the condition number, Smale's $\gamma$ and the bit-size. We also provide probabilistic bounds for random algebraic varieties under some general assumptions.</description>
