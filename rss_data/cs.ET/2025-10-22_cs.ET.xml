      <title>Machine Olfaction and Embedded AI Are Shaping the New Global Sensing Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine olfaction is rapidly emerging as a transformative capability, with applications spanning non-invasive medical diagnostics, industrial monitoring, agriculture, and security and defense. Recent advances in stabilizing mammalian olfactory receptors and integrating them into biophotonic and bioelectronic systems have enabled detection at near single-molecule resolution thus placing machines on par with trained detection dogs. As this technology converges with multimodal AI and distributed sensor networks imbued with embedded AI, it introduces a new, biochemical layer to a sensing ecosystem currently dominated by machine vision and audition. This review and industry roadmap surveys the scientific foundations, technological frontiers, and strategic applications of machine olfaction making the case that we are currently witnessing the rise of a new industry that brings with it a global chemosensory infrastructure. We cover exemplary industrial, military and consumer applications and address some of the ethical and legal concerns arising. We find that machine olfaction is poised to bring forth a planet-wide molecular awareness tech layer with the potential of spawning vast emerging markets in health, security, and environmental sensing via scent.</description>

      <title>Low-cost mobile 3D scanning of heritage objects to facilitate long-distance research collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While three-dimensional visualization has become a common tool in various cultural heritage applications, the emphasis has been on high fidelity representation, essentially the generation of digital twins or digital reconstructions. Overlooked appears to be the utility of 3D in research collaboration where one of the researchers has access to the original, potentially fragile object while the others are based in remote locations. This paper describes the application of a low-cost, mobile and swiftly executable 3D scanning process and discusses the benefits of this for remote collaboration of three-dimensional objects of material culture</description>

      <title>Res-DPU: Resource-shared Digital Processing-in-memory Unit for Edge-AI Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) has emerged as the go to solution for addressing the von Neumann bottleneck in edge AI accelerators. However, state-of-the-art (SoTA) digital PIM approaches suffer from low compute density, primarily due to the use of bulky bit cells and transistor-heavy adder trees, which impose limitations on macro scalability and energy efficiency. This work introduces Res-DPU, a resource-shared digital PIM unit, with a dual-port 5T SRAM latch and shared 2T AND compute logic. This reflects the per-bit multiplication cost to just 5.25T and reduced the transistor count of the PIM array by up to 56% over the SoTA works. Furthermore, a Transistor-Reduced 2D Interspersed Adder Tree (TRAIT) with FA-7T and PG-FA-26T helps reduce the power consumption of the adder tree by up to 21.35% and leads to improved energy efficiency by 59% compared to conventional 28T RCA designs. We propose a Cycle-controlled Iterative Approximate-Accurate Multiplication (CIA2M) approach, enabling run-time accuracy-latency trade-offs without requiring error-correction circuitry. The 16 KB REP-DPIM macro achieves 0.43 TOPS throughput and 87.22 TOPS/W energy efficiency in TSMC 65nm CMOS, with 96.85% QoR for ResNet-18 or VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, including 30% pruning. The proposed results establish a Res-DPU module for highly scalable and energy-efficient real-time edge AI accelerators.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Computing Approach to the Closest Vector Problem for Lattice-Based Factoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The closest vector problem (CVP) is a fundamental optimization problem in lattice-based cryptography and its conjectured hardness underpins the security of lattice-based cryptosystems. Furthermore, Schnorr's lattice-based factoring algorithm reduces integer factoring (the foundation of current cryptosystems, including RSA) to the CVP. Recent work has investigated the inclusion of a heuristic CVP approximation `refinement' step in the lattice-based factoring algorithm, using quantum variational algorithms to perform the heuristic optimization. This coincides with the emergence of probabilistic computing as a hardware accelerator for randomized algorithms including tasks in combinatorial optimization. In this work we investigate the application of probabilistic computing to the heuristic optimization task of CVP approximation refinement in lattice-based factoring. We present the design of a probabilistic computing algorithm for this task, a discussion of `prime lattice' parameters, and experimental results showing the efficacy of probabilistic computing for solving the CVP as well as its efficacy as a subroutine for lattice-based factoring. The main results found that (a) this approach is capable of finding the maximal available CVP approximation refinement in time linear in problem size and (b) probabilistic computing used in conjunction with the lattice parameters presented can find the composite prime factors of a semiprime number using up to 100x fewer lattice instances than similar quantum and classical methods.</description>
