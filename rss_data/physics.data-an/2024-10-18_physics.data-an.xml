      <title>Annealed Stein Variational Gradient Descent for Improved Uncertainty Estimation in Full-Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) has been extensively used to derive high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic data. However, due to the nonlinearity and ill-posed nature of the problem, FWI requires a good starting model to avoid producing non-physical solutions. Moreover, conventional optimization methods fail to quantify the uncertainty associated with the recovered solution, which is critical for decision-making processes. Bayesian inference offers an alternative approach as it directly or indirectly evaluates the posterior probability density function. For example, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods generate multiple sample chains to characterize the solution's uncertainty. Despite their ability to theoretically handle any form of distribution, MCMC methods require many sampling steps; this limits their usage in high-dimensional problems with computationally intensive forward modeling, as is the FWI case. Variational Inference (VI), on the other hand, provides an approximate solution to the posterior distribution in the form of a parametric or non-parametric proposal distribution. Among the various algorithms used in VI, Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is recognized for its ability to iteratively refine a set of samples to approximate the target distribution. However, mode and variance-collapse issues affect SVGD in high-dimensional inverse problems. This study aims to improve the performance of SVGD within the context of FWI by utilizing, for the first time, an annealed variant of SVGD and combining it with a multi-scale strategy. Additionally, we demonstrate that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to evaluate the performance of the optimization process. Clustering techniques are also employed to provide more rigorous and meaningful statistical analysis of the particles in the presence of multi-modal distributions.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy in dynamic complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of complex networks studies a wide variety of interacting systems by representing them as networks. To understand their properties and mutual relations, the randomisation of network connections is a commonly used tool. However, information-theoretic randomisation methods with well-established foundations mostly provide a stationary description of these systems, while stochastic randomisation methods that account for their dynamic nature lack such general foundations and require extensive repetition of the stochastic process to measure statistical properties. In this work, we extend the applicability of information-theoretic methods beyond stationary network models. By using the information-theoretic principle of maximum caliber we construct dynamic network ensemble distributions based on constraints representing statistical properties with known values throughout the evolution. We focus on the particular cases of dynamics constrained by the average number of connections of the whole network and each node, comparing each evolution to simulations of stochastic randomisation that obey the same constraints. We find that ensemble distributions estimated from simulations match those calculated with maximum caliber and that the equilibrium distributions to which they converge agree with known results of maximum entropy given the same constraints. Finally, we discuss further the connections to other maximum entropy approaches to network dynamics and conclude by proposing some possible avenues of future research.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning prediction of tipping with applications to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anticipating a tipping point, a transition from one stable steady state to another, is a problem of broad relevance due to the ubiquity of the phenomenon in diverse fields. The steady-state nature of the dynamics about a tipping point makes its prediction significantly more challenging than predicting other types of critical transitions from oscillatory or chaotic dynamics. Exploiting the benefits of noise, we develop a general data-driven and machine-learning approach to predicting potential future tipping in nonautonomous dynamical systems and validate the framework using examples from different fields. As an application, we address the problem of predicting the potential collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), possibly driven by climate-induced changes in the freshwater input to the North Atlantic. Our predictions based on synthetic and currently available empirical data place a potential collapse window spanning from 2040 to 2065, in consistency with the results in the current literature.</description>
