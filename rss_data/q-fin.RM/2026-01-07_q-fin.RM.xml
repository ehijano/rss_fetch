      <title>Uni-FinLLM: A Unified Multimodal Large Language Model with Modular Task Heads for Micro-Level Stock Prediction and Macro-Level Systemic Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial institutions and regulators require systems that integrate heterogeneous data to assess risks from stock fluctuations to systemic vulnerabilities. Existing approaches often treat these tasks in isolation, failing to capture cross-scale dependencies. We propose Uni-FinLLM, a unified multimodal large language model that uses a shared Transformer backbone and modular task heads to jointly process financial text, numerical time series, fundamentals, and visual data. Through cross-modal attention and multi-task optimization, it learns a coherent representation for micro-, meso-, and macro-level predictions. Evaluated on stock forecasting, credit-risk assessment, and systemic-risk detection, Uni-FinLLM significantly outperforms baselines. It raises stock directional accuracy to 67.4% (from 61.7%), credit-risk accuracy to 84.1% (from 79.6%), and macro early-warning accuracy to 82.3%. Results validate that a unified multimodal LLM can jointly model asset behavior and systemic vulnerabilities, offering a scalable decision-support engine for finance.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Learning in Spatial Agent-Based Models for Physical Climate Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate risk assessment requires modelling complex interactions between spatially heterogeneous hazards and adaptive economic systems. We present a novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines geospatial agent-based modelling with asset-level damage functions, featuring an illustrative three-sector economy (commodity, manufacturing, retail) with adaptive learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections under RCP8.5 until 2100, comparing four scenarios: baseline and hazard conditions with and without evolutionary learning. Our results show that increasingly frequent and intense acute hazards lower firm production levels, liquidity, and capital, while increasing the prices of goods and unemployment. The framework reveals systemic risks where even agents not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply chain disruptions. Importantly, evolutionary adaptation enables firms to maintain higher production, capital, liquidity, wages and employment levels while keeping prices lower compared to non-learning counterparts. This open-source framework provides financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.</description>

      <title>When Indemnity Insurance Fails: Parametric Coverage under Binding Budget and Risk Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-risk environments, traditional indemnity insurance is often unaffordable or ineffective, despite its well-known optimality under expected utility. We compare excess-of-loss indemnity insurance with parametric insurance within a common mean-variance framework, allowing for fixed costs, heterogeneous premium loadings, and binding budget constraints. We show that, once these realistic frictions are introduced, parametric insurance can yield higher welfare for risk-averse individuals, even under the same utility objective. The welfare advantage arises precisely when indemnity insurance becomes impractical, and disappears once both contracts are unconstrained. Our results help reconcile classical insurance theory with the growing use of parametric risk transfer in high-risk settings.</description>
