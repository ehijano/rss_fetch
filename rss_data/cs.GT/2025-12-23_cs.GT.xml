      <title>Which Coauthor Should I Nominate in My 99 ICLR Submissions? A Mathematical Analysis of the ICLR 2026 Reciprocal Reviewer Nomination Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conference submissions has created an overwhelming reviewing burden. To alleviate this, recent venues such as ICLR 2026 introduced a reviewer nomination policy: each submission must nominate one of its authors as a reviewer, and any paper nominating an irresponsible reviewer is desk-rejected. We study this new policy from the perspective of author welfare. Assuming each author carries a probability of being irresponsible, we ask: how can authors (or automated systems) nominate reviewers to minimize the risk of desk rejections? We formalize and analyze three variants of the desk-rejection risk minimization problem. The basic problem, which minimizes expected desk rejections, is solved optimally by a simple greedy algorithm. We then introduce hard and soft nomination limit variants that constrain how many papers may nominate the same author, preventing widespread failures if one author is irresponsible. These formulations connect to classical optimization frameworks, including minimum-cost flow and linear programming, allowing us to design efficient, principled nomination strategies. Our results provide the first theoretical study for reviewer nomination policies, offering both conceptual insights and practical directions for authors to wisely choose which co-author should serve as the nominated reciprocal reviewer.</description>

      <title>Will AI Trade? A Computational Inversion of the No-Trade Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classic no-trade theorems attribute trade to heterogeneous beliefs. We re-examine this conclusion for AI agents, asking if trade can arise from computational limitations, under common beliefs. We model agents' bounded computational rationality within an unfolding game framework, where computational power determines the complexity of its strategy. Our central finding inverts the classic paradigm: a stable no-trade outcome (Nash equilibrium) is reached only when "almost rational" agents have slightly different computational power. Paradoxically, when agents possess identical power, they may fail to converge to equilibrium, resulting in persistent strategic adjustments that constitute a form of trade. This instability is exacerbated if agents can strategically under-utilize their computational resources, which eliminates any chance of equilibrium in Matching Pennies scenarios. Our results suggest that the inherent computational limitations of AI agents can lead to situations where equilibrium is not reached, creating a more lively and unpredictable trade environment than traditional models would predict.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Agents in Spatial Double-Auction Markets: Modeling the Emergence of Industrial Symbiosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial symbiosis fosters circularity by enabling firms to repurpose residual resources, yet its emergence is constrained by socio-spatial frictions that shape costs, matching opportunities, and market efficiency. Existing models often overlook the interaction between spatial structure, market design, and adaptive firm behavior, limiting our understanding of where and how symbiosis arises. We develop an agent-based model where heterogeneous firms trade byproducts through a spatially embedded double-auction market, with prices and quantities emerging endogenously from local interactions. Leveraging reinforcement learning, firms adapt their bidding strategies to maximize profit while accounting for transport costs, disposal penalties, and resource scarcity. Simulation experiments reveal the economic and spatial conditions under which decentralized exchanges converge toward stable and efficient outcomes. Counterfactual regret analysis shows that sellers' strategies approach a near Nash equilibrium, while sensitivity analysis highlights how spatial structures and market parameters jointly govern circularity. Our model provides a basis for exploring policy interventions that seek to align firm incentives with sustainability goals, and more broadly demonstrates how decentralized coordination can emerge from adaptive agents in spatially constrained markets.</description>

      <title>Privacy Data Pricing: A Stackelberg Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data markets are emerging as key mechanisms for trading personal and organizational data. Traditional data pricing studies -- such as query-based or arbitrage-free pricing models -- mainly emphasize price consistency and profit maximization but often neglect privacy constraints and strategic interactions. The widespread adoption of differential privacy (DP) introduces a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off: noise protects individuals' privacy but reduces data accuracy and market value. This paper develops a Stackelberg game framework for pricing DP data, where the market maker (leader) sets the price function and the data buyer (follower) selects the optimal query precision under DP constraints. We derive the equilibrium strategies for both parties under a balanced pricing function where the pricing decision variable enters linearly into the original pricing model. We obtain closed-form solutions for the optimal variance and pricing level, and determine the boundary conditions for market participation. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to Stackelberg games involving nonlinear power pricing functions. The model bridges DP and economic mechanism design, offering a unified foundation for incentive-compatible and privacy-conscious data pricing in data markets.</description>

      <title>Snowveil: A Framework for Decentralised Preference Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregating subjective preferences of a large group is a fundamental challenge in computational social choice, traditionally reliant on central authorities. To address the limitations of this model, this paper introduces Decentralised Preference Discovery (DPD), the problem of determining the collective will of an electorate under constraints of censorship resistance, partial information, and asynchronous communication. We propose Snowveil, a novel framework for this task. Snowveil uses an iterative, gossip-based protocol where voters repeatedly sample the preferences of a small, random subset of the electorate to progressively converge on a collective outcome. We demonstrate the framework's modularity by designing the Constrained Hybrid Borda (CHB), a novel aggregation rule engineered to balance broad consensus with strong plurality support, and provide a rigorous axiomatic analysis of its properties. By applying a potential function and submartingale theory, we develop a multi-level analytical method to show that the system almost surely converges to a stable, single-winner in finite time, a process that can then be iterated to construct a set of winning candidates for multi-winner scenarios. This technique is largely agnostic to the specific aggregation rule, requiring only that it satisfies core social choice axioms like Positive Responsiveness, thus offering a formal toolkit for a wider class of DPD protocols. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis through extensive simulation, validating Snowveil's $O(n)$ scalability. Overall, this work advances the understanding of how a stable consensus can emerge from subjective, complex, and diverse preferences in decentralised systems for large electorates.</description>

      <title>Obnoxious Facility Location Problems: Strategyproof Mechanisms Optimizing $L_p$-Aggregated Utilities and Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of locating a single obnoxious facility on the normalized line segment $[0,1]$ with strategic agents from a mechanism design perspective. Each agent has a preference for the undesirable location of the facility and would prefer the facility to be far away from their location. We consider the utility of the agent, defined as the distance between the agent's location and the facility location, and the cost of each agent, equal to one minus the utility. Given this standard setting of obnoxious facility location problems, our goal is to design (group) strategyproof mechanisms to elicit agent locations truthfully and determine facility location approximately optimizing the $L_p$-aggregated utility and cost objectives, which generalizes the $L_p$-norm ($p\ge 1$) of the agents' utilities and agents' costs to any $p \in [-\infty, \infty]$, respectively. We establish upper and lower bounds on the approximation ratios of deterministic and randomized (group) strategyproof mechanisms for maximizing the $L_p$-aggregated utilities or minimizing the $L_p$-aggregated costs across the range of \(p\)-values. While there are gaps between upper and lower bounds for randomized mechanisms, our bounds for deterministic mechanisms are tight.</description>

      <title>Adapting Skill Ratings to Luck-Based Hidden-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rating systems play a crucial role in evaluating player skill across competitive environments. The Elo rating system, originally designed for deterministic and information-complete games such as chess, has been widely adopted and modified in various domains. However, the traditional Elo rating system only considers game outcomes for rating calculation and assumes uniform initial states across players. This raises important methodological challenges in skill modelling for popular partially randomized incomplete-information games such as Rummy. In this paper, we examine the limitations of conventional Elo ratings when applied to luck-driven environments and propose a modified Elo framework specifically tailored for Rummy. Our approach incorporates score-based performance metrics and explicitly models the influence of initial hand quality to disentangle skill from luck. Through extensive simulations involving 270,000 games across six strategies of varying sophistication, we demonstrate that our proposed system achieves stable convergence, superior discriminative power, and enhanced predictive accuracy compared to traditional Elo formulations. The framework maintains computational simplicity while effectively capturing the interplay of skill, strategy, and randomness, with broad applicability to other stochastic competitive environments.</description>

      <title>Considering the Difference in Utility Functions of Team Players in Adversarial Team Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires that all countries collaborate to fight adversarial factors to achieve peace and prosperity for humans and the planet. This scenario can be formulated as an adversarial team game in AI literature, where a team of players play against an adversary. However, previous solution concepts for this game assume that team players have the same utility functions, which cannot cover the real-world case that countries do not always have the same utility function. This paper argues that studying adversarial team games should not ignore the difference in utility functions of team players. We show that ignoring the difference in utility functions of team players could cause the computed equilibrium to be unstable. To show the benefit of considering the difference in utility functions of team players, we introduce a novel solution concept called Co-opetition Equilibrium (CoE) for the adversarial team game. In this game, team players with different utility functions (i.e., cooperation between team players) correlate their actions to play against the adversary (i.e., competition between the team and the adversary). We further introduce the team-maximizing CoE, which is a CoE but maximizes the team's utility among all CoEs. Both equilibria can overcome the issue caused by ignoring the difference in utility functions of team players. We further show the opportunities for theoretical and algorithmic contributions based on our position of considering the difference in utility functions of team players.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework and Comparative Study of Decentralized Finance Derivatives Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications introduce novel financial instruments replicating and extending traditional ones through blockchain-based smart contracts. Among these, derivatives protocols enable the decentralized trading of cryptoassets that are the counterpart of derivative products available in traditional finance. Despite their growing significance, DeFi derivatives protocols remain relatively understudied compared to other DeFi instruments, such as lending protocols and decentralized exchanges with automated market makers. This paper systematically analyzes DeFi derivatives protocols - categorized into perpetual, options, and synthetics - in the field, highlighting similarities, differences, dynamics, and actors. As a result of our study, we provide a formal characterization of decentralized derivative products and introduce a unifying conceptual framework that captures the design principles and core architecture of such protocols. We complement our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations: we evaluate protocol dynamics under various economic conditions, including changes in underlying asset prices, volatility, protocol-specific fees, leverage, and their impact on liquidation and profitability.</description>

      <title>LOCO: A Low-Cost SNU-Self-Resilient Latch Using an Output-Split C-Element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the CMOS technology enters nanometer scales, integrated circuits (ICs) become increasingly sensitive to radiation-induced soft errors, which can corrupt the state of storage elements and cause severe reliability issues. Many hardened designs have been proposed to mitigate soft errors by using filtering elements. However, existing filtering elements only protect their inputs against soft errors and leave their outputs unprotected. Therefore, additional filtering elements must be added to protect outputs, resulting in extra overhead. In this paper, we first propose a novel Output-Split C-element (OSC) to protect both its input and output nodes, and then a novel LOw-COst single-node-upset (SNU) self-resilient latch (LOCO) to use OSCs to achieve both soft error resilience and low overhead. The usage of OSCs effectively reduce the short-circuit current of the LOCO latch during switching activities. Furthermore, the usage of clock gating and high-speed path reduces power consumption and delay, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art SNU-resilient hardened designs, the LOCO latch achieves 19% fewer transistors, 63.58% lower power, 74% less delay, and 92% lower power-delay-product (PDP) on average. In addition, the LOCO latch exhibits better stability under variations in PVT (Process, Voltage, and Temperature).</description>

      <title>Stochastic assignment games for Mobility-as-a-Service markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stochastic assignment game and extend it to model multimodal mobility markets with a regulator or a Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform. We start by presenting general forms of one-to-one and many-to-many stochastic assignment games. Optimality conditions are discussed. The core of stochastic assignment games is defined, with expected payoffs of sellers and buyers in stochastic assignment games as payoffs from a hypothetical "ideal matching" that represent sellers' and buyers' expectations under imperfect information. To apply stochastic assignment games to the urban mobility markets, we extend the general stochastic many-to-many assignment game into a stochastic Stackelberg game to model MaaS systems, where the platform is the leader, and users and operators are the followers. The platform sets fares to maximize revenue. Users and operator react to the fare settings to form a stochastic many-to-many assignment game considering both fixed-route services and Mobility-on-Demand (MOD). The Stackelberg game is formulated as a bilevel problem. The lower level is the stochastic many-to-many assignment game between users and operators, shown to yield a coalitional logit model. The upper-level problem is a fare adjustment problem maximizing revenue. An iterative balancing algorithm is proposed to solve the lower-level problem exactly. The bilevel problem is solved through an iterative fare adjusting heuristic, whose solution is shown to be equivalent to the bilevel problem with an additional condition when it converges. Two case studies are conducted. The model can be applied to design MaaS fares maximizing income of the platform while anticipating the selfish behavior and heterogeneity of users and operators. Public agencies can also use the model to manage multimodal transportation systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A principal selects a team of agents for collaborating on a joint project. The principal aims to design a revenue-optimal contract that incentivize the team of agents to exert costly effort while satisfying fairness constraints. We show that the optimal fair contract ensures that there is a minimum share, and every agent receives a linear contract weakly higher than the minimum share that is sufficient to incentivize them to exert costly effort. We utilize this structure to design an FPTAS for additive success functions and a constant approximation algorithm for submodular success functions. Moreover, we show that adopting optimal fair contracts can lead to a 25% revenue increase compared to the optimal non-discriminatory contracts even for additive success functions.</description>

      <title>Three Tiers and Thresholds: Incentives in Private Market Investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies optimal contract design in private market investing, focusing on internal decision making in venture capital and private equity firms. A principal relies on an agent who privately exerts costly due diligence effort and then recommends whether to invest. Outcomes are observable ex post even when an opportunity is declined, allowing compensation to reward both successful investments and prudent decisions to pass. We characterize profit maximizing contracts that induce information acquisition and truthful reporting. We show that three tier contracts are sufficient, with payments contingent on the agent's recommendation and the realized return. In symmetric environments satisfying the monotone likelihood ratio property, the optimal contract further simplifies to a threshold contract that pays only when the recommendation is aligned with an extreme realized return. These results provide guidance for performance based compensation that promotes diligent screening while limiting excessive risk taking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tariff setting in public transportation networks is an important challenge. A popular approach is to partition the network into fare zones ("zoning") and fix journey prices depending on the number of traversed zones ("pricing"). In this paper, we focus on finding revenue-optimal solutions to the zoning problem for a given concave pricing function. We consider tree networks with $n$ vertices, since trees already pose non-trivial algorithmic challenges. Our main results are efficient algorithms that yield a simple $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-approximation as well as a more involved $\mathcal{O}(\log n/\log \log n)$-approximation. We show how to solve the problem exactly on rooted instances, in which all demand arises at the same source. For paths, we prove strong NP-hardness and outline a PTAS. Moreover, we show that computing an optimal solution is in FPT or XP for several natural problem parameters.</description>

Abstract: A growing body of computational studies shows that simple machine learning agents converge to cooperative behaviors in social dilemmas, such as collusive price-setting in oligopoly markets, raising questions about what drives this outcome. In this work, we provide theoretical foundations for this phenomenon in the context of self-play multi-agent Q-learners in the iterated prisoner's dilemma. We characterize broad conditions under which such agents provably learn the cooperative Pavlov (win-stay, lose-shift) policy rather than the Pareto-dominated "always defect" policy. We validate our theoretical results through additional experiments, demonstrating their robustness across a broader class of deep learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Preference Elicitation with LLM-Based Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bidders in combinatorial auctions face significant challenges when describing their preferences to an auctioneer. Classical work on preference elicitation focuses on query-based techniques inspired from proper learning--often via proxies that interface between bidders and an auction mechanism--to incrementally learn bidder preferences as needed to compute efficient allocations. Although such elicitation mechanisms enjoy theoretical query efficiency, the amount of communication required may still be too cognitively taxing in practice.
  We propose a family of efficient LLM-based proxy designs for eliciting preferences from bidders using natural language. Our proposed mechanism combines LLM pipelines and DNF-proper-learning techniques to quickly approximate preferences when communication is limited. To validate our approach, we create a testing sandbox for elicitation mechanisms that communicate in natural language. In our experiments, our most promising LLM proxy design reaches approximately efficient outcomes with five times fewer queries than classical proper learning based elicitation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Does Timeboost Reduce MEV-Related Spam? Theory and Evidence from Layer-2 Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximal extractable value opportunities often induce spam in Layer-2 blockchains: many identical transactions are submitted near simultaneously, most of which revert, wasting blockspace. We study Timeboost, a mechanism on Arbitrum that auctions a timestamp advantage, crucial under first-come first-served sequencing rules. We develop a game-theoretic model in which users choose the number of transaction copies to submit, and extend upon the baseline setting by modeling the Timeboost auction and subsequent transaction submission behavior. We show that Timeboost reduces spam and increases sequencer/DAO revenue in equilibrium relative to the baseline, transferring user payments from revert costs to auction bids. Empirically, we assemble mempool data from multiple Layer-2 networks, measuring spam via identical transactions submitted in narrow time intervals, and conduct an event study around Timeboost adoption on Arbitrum using other L2s as contemporaneous benchmarks. We find a decline in MEV-related spam and an increase in revenue on Arbitrum post-adoption, consistent with model predictions.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Forecasters to Learn: Summarized vs. Unrestricted Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How should forecasters be incentivized to acquire the most information when learning takes place over time? We address this question in the context of a novel dynamic mechanism design problem in which a designer incentivizes an expert to learn by conditioning rewards on an event's outcome and the expert's reports. Eliciting summarized advice at a terminal date maximizes information acquisition if an informative signal either fully reveals the outcome or has predictable content. Otherwise, richer reporting capabilities may be required. Our findings shed light on incentive design for consultation and forecasting by illustrating how learning dynamics shape the qualitative properties of effort-maximizing contracts.</description>

      <title>Majority voting is not good for heaven or hell, with mirrored performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00592v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model, we study the effectiveness of majority voting in various environments. As shown by the pit-of-losses paradox identified in previous work, majority decisions in apparently hostile environments tend to reduce the capital of society. In such cases, the simple social decision rule of ``rejecting all proposals without voting'' outperforms majority voting. In this paper, we identify another pit of losses appearing in favorable environments; here, the simple social decision rule of ``accepting all proposals without voting'' is superior to majority voting. We prove that, under a version of simple majority called symmetrized majority and under the antisymmetry of the voting body, this second pit of losses is a mirror image of the one arising in hostile environments, and we explain this phenomenon. Technically, we consider a voting society consisting of individualists who support all proposals that increase their personal capital and a group (or groups) whose members vote to increase their group's wealth. According to the key lemma, the expected capital gain of each agent under the social decision rule when the random gain generator is $X$ with mean $\mu&gt;0$ exceeds their expected gain under the reflected generator $-X$ by exactly $\mu$. This extends to location-scale families of generators with distributions symmetric about their mean. This result reveals a mirror symmetry in the performance of the symmetrized majority rule relative to a baseline rule. The baseline rule accepts all proposals in favorable environments and rejects them in unfavorable (hostile) ones.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Mean-Field Games with Function Approximation and Empirical Mean-Field Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent algorithms allow decentralised agents, possibly connected via a communication network, to learn equilibria in mean-field games from a non-episodic run of the empirical system. However, these algorithms are for tabular settings: this computationally limits the size of agents' observation space, meaning the algorithms cannot handle anything but small state spaces, nor generalise beyond policies depending only on the agent's local state to so-called 'population-dependent' policies. We address this limitation by introducing function approximation to the existing setting, drawing on the Munchausen Online Mirror Descent method that has previously been employed only in finite-horizon, episodic, centralised settings. While this permits us to include the mean field in the observation for players' policies, it is unrealistic to assume decentralised agents have access to this global information: we therefore also provide new algorithms allowing agents to locally estimate the global empirical distribution, and to improve this estimate via inter-agent communication. We prove theoretically that exchanging policy information helps networked agents outperform both independent and even centralised agents in function-approximation settings. Our experiments demonstrate this happening empirically, and show that the communication network allows decentralised agents to estimate the mean field for population-dependent policies.</description>

      <title>Peer-Aware Cost Estimation in Nonlinear General-Sum Dynamic Games for Mutual Learning and Intent Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is a powerful tool in modeling multi-agent interactions and human-robot systems. In practice, since the objective functions of both agents may not be explicitly known to each other, these interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum dynamic games. Solving for equilibrium policies for such games presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (ILQ) approximation of dynamic games, each agent explicitly models the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective functions and updating its own control policy accordingly in real time, which leads to unbiased and fast learning of the unknown objective function of the peer agent. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables intent communication by explicitly modeling the peer's learning dynamics. Finally, we show how N-PACE outperforms baseline methods that disregard the learning behavior of the other agent, both analytically and using our case studies</description>

      <title>A Decision-Theoretic Approach for Managing Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When should we delegate decisions to AI systems? While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>MAPPO-LCR: Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Local Cooperation Reward in Spatial Public Goods Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial public goods games model collective dilemmas where individual payoffs depend on population-level strategy configurations. Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.</description>
