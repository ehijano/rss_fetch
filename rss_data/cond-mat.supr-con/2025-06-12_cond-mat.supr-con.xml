      <title>Time reversal symmetry breaking and s-wave superconductivity in CaPd2Ge2: A $\mu$SR study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$ which crystallizes in ${\rm ThCr_2Si_2}$-type body-centered tetragonal structure exhibits superconductivity below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c} = 1.69$~K\@. We have investigated the superconducting gap structure and time reversal symmetry of the ground state in ${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$ by means of muon spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Our analysis of $\mu$SR data collected in transverse magnetic field reveals BCS superconductivity with a single-band $s$-wave singlet pairing and an isotropic energy gap having the value $2\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} = 3.50(1)$. Further, an increased relaxation rate in zero field $\mu$SR asymmetry spectra below $T_{\rm c} $ provides evidence for the presence of a spontaneous magnetic field in the superconducting state revealing that the time-reversal symmetry is broken in ${\rm CaPd_2Ge_2}$.</description>

      <title>Above 20K conventional superconductivity in Cerium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high superconducting critical temperature (Tc) under normal laboratory conditions in a material that is chemically simple and stable, like an elemental metal, is a hitherto unattained goal of modern science and technology. Certain elemental metals are known to display reasonably high Tc only under extraordinarily high pressures where their spectroscopic characterization and application are tightly restricted. Here we show that a Tc exceeding 20 K can be realized on pure elemental Ce under uniaxial pressure created simply by pressing a sharp metallic needle on the metal. This is a breakthrough because pure Ce does not superconduct under ambient conditions and the application of 54 GPa of hydrostatic pressure yields only a low Tc of 1.8 K in the metal. In addition, by driving the area under the needle in a mechanically controlled way to the ballistic transport regime, for the first time, we spectroscopically characterized the superconducting energy gap in a high-pressure superconducting phase and found that superconducting Ce respects the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer (BCS) theory.</description>

      <title>From Fractionalization to Chiral Topological Superconductivity in Flat Chern Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that interacting electrons in a flat Chern band can form, in addition to fractional Chern insulators, a chiral $f$-wave topological superconductor that hosts neutral Majorana fermion edge modes. Superconductivity emerges from an interaction-induced metallic state that exhibits anomalous Hall effect, as observed in rhombohedral graphene and near the $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ fractional Chern insulator in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Topotactic oxidation of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates reveals new structural family: oxygen-intercalated layered perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered perovskites such as the Dion-Jacobson, Ruddlesden-Popper, and Aurivillius families host a wide range of correlated electron phenomena, from high-temperature superconductivity to multiferroicity. Here we report a new family of layered perovskites, realized through topotactic oxygen intercalation of La_{n+1}Ni_{n}O_{3n+1} (n=1-4) Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate thin films grown by ozone-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy. Post-growth ozone annealing induces a large c-axis expansion - 17.8% for La_{2}NiO_{4} (n=1) - that monotonically decreases with increasing n. Surface X-ray diffraction coupled with Coherent Bragg Rod Analysis reveals that this structural expansion arises from the intercalation of approximately 0.7 oxygen atoms per formula unit into interstitial sites within the rock salt spacer layers. The resulting structures exhibit a spacer layer composition intermediate between that of the Ruddlesden-Popper and Aurivillius phases, defining a new class of layered perovskites. Oxygen-intercalated nickelates exhibit metallicity and significantly enhanced nickel-oxygen hybridization, a feature linked to high-temperature superconductivity. Our work establishes topotactic oxidation as a powerful synthetic approach to accessing highly oxidized, metastable phases across a broad range of layered oxide systems, offering new platforms to tune properties via spacer-layer chemistry.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs in unconventional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena Using Floquet formalism, we reveal multiple spin-degenerate nodes in the Floquet spin density, which can be dissected into single- and double-photon processes, and connected to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. Notably, both odd- and even-frequency spin-triplet pairs can be generated by the interplay between the driving field and the unconventional magnetism. Moreover, the intrinsic spatial asymmetry of the unconventional magnet allows linearly polarized light to control magnetic and polarization directions. By tuning the driving amplitude, frequency, and polarization, Floquet spin density and pairing amplitude can be dynamically controlled, offering promising applications in Floquet engineering spintronic and superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Approach to Wannier Pairing and Bogoliubov Orbitals in Square-Octagon Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy lattice models are the cornerstone for studying many-body physics and interactions between the system and measurement fields. A key challenge is identifying appropriate quasiparticle states that canonically transform between momentum and real space while retaining the correlation, entanglement, and geometric properties - generally called the Wannier obstruction. Here, we introduce a phase-space approach to bypass these obstructions. Instead of treating the phase space as a manifold, we embed a real space through a Bloch vector space at each momentum. Orbital and spin states are introduced through product states with the Bloch vector, while quantum statistics, correlations, topology, and entanglements are inherited from the Hamiltonian. We apply this framework to explore the unconventional pairing symmetry and the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation in phase space. Our findings demonstrate that while superconductivity exhibits global coherence, the local Wannier orbital symmetry primarily determines the pairing symmetry. We analytically solve the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing symmetry on the phase space by engineering a flat band with artificial gauge fields. We validate the model on the square-octagon superconductor Lu$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT), revealing the coexistence of nodeless $s^{\pm}$ and nodal $s_{z^2}$ pairing symmetries. This phase-space framework provides a robust, obstruction-free lattice model for complex many-body systems and their exotic excitations.</description>
