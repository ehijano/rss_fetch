      <title>Polar Coding and Linear Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar encoding, described by Arikan in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 55, No. 7, July 2009, was a milestone for telecommunications. A Polar code distributes information among high and low-capacity channels, showing the possibility of achieving perfect channel capacity. The high-capacity channels allow almost noiseless transmission of data. When these channels are not high noise, reliability is achieved in the signal transmission. It starts to compete against codes such a Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. Polar code can be also considered error correcting, based on the redundancy inherent in its structure. This feature makes polar encoding also applicable to digital quantum-resistant cryptography protocols. This work explores linear decoding at a first or single trial in the case of small losses or small number of bit-flipping, and repeated transmission for medium level losses. This is distinct from Arikans successive probabilistic decoding by application of probabilistic rules. Linear decoding is done directly from solving the linear equations connecting the codewords x and the received signals y after transmission via noisy channels. Numerical examples will be shown. Along with this work, programming in Mathematica language was used. Codes are available for copy-and-paste for Mathematica users to immediately try the described formalism.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of Marton's Error Exponent via Constraint Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The error exponent in lossy source coding characterizes the asymptotic decay rate of error probability with respect to blocklength. The Marton's error exponent provides the theoretically optimal bound on this rate. However, computation methods of the Marton's error exponent remain underdeveloped due to its formulation as a non-convex optimization problem with limited efficient solvers. While a recent grid search algorithm can compute its inverse function, it incurs prohibitive computational costs from two-dimensional brute-force parameter grid searches. This paper proposes a composite maximization approach that effectively handles both Marton's error exponent and its inverse function. Through a constraint decoupling technique, the resulting problem formulations admit efficient solvers driven by an alternating maximization algorithm. By fixing one parameter via a one-dimensional line search, the remaining subproblem becomes convex and can be efficiently solved by alternating variable updates, thereby significantly reducing search complexity. Therefore, the global convergence of the algorithm can be guaranteed. Numerical experiments for simple sources and the Ahlswede's counterexample, demonstrates the superior efficiency of our algorithm in contrast to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Neural Estimation of the Information Bottleneck Based on a Mapping Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information bottleneck (IB) method is a technique designed to extract meaningful information related to one random variable from another random variable, and has found extensive applications in machine learning problems. In this paper, neural network based estimation of the IB problem solution is studied, through the lens of a novel formulation of the IB problem. Via exploiting the inherent structure of the IB functional and leveraging the mapping approach, the proposed formulation of the IB problem involves only a single variable to be optimized, and subsequently is readily amenable to data-driven estimators based on neural networks. A theoretical analysis is conducted to guarantee that the neural estimator asymptotically solves the IB problem, and the numerical experiments on both synthetic and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the neural estimator.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Alternating Minimization Algorithm for Computing Quantum Rate-Distortion Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the computation of the entanglement-assisted quantum rate-distortion function, which plays a central role in quantum information theory. We propose an efficient alternating minimization algorithm based on the Lagrangian analysis. Instead of fixing the multiplier corresponding to the distortion constraint, we update the multiplier in each iteration. Hence the algorithm solves the original problem itself, rather than the Lagrangian relaxation of it. Moreover, all the other variables are iterated in closed form without solving multi-dimensional nonlinear equations or multivariate optimization problems. Numerical experiments show the accuracy of our proposed algorithm and its improved efficiency over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learned Belief Propagation for Decoding Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted belief propagation (WBP) for the decoding of linear block codes is considered. In WBP, the Tanner graph of the code is unrolled with respect to the iterations of the belief propagation decoder. Then, weights are assigned to the edges of the resulting recurrent network and optimized offline using a training dataset. The main contribution of this paper is an adaptive WBP where the weights of the decoder are determined for each received word. Two variants of this decoder are investigated. In the parallel WBP decoders, the weights take values in a discrete set. A number of WBP decoders are run in parallel to search for the best sequence of weights in real time. In the two-stage decoder, a small neural network is used to dynamically determine the weights of the WBP decoder for each received word. The proposed adaptive decoders demonstrate significant improvements over the static counterparts in two applications. In the first application, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, polar and quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes are used over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. The results indicate that the adaptive WBP achieves bit error rates (BERs) up to an order of magnitude less than the BERs of the static WBP at about the same decoding complexity, depending on the code, its rate, and the signal-to-noise ratio. The second application is a concatenated code designed for a long-haul nonlinear optical fiber channel where the inner code is a QC-LDPC code and the outer code is a spatially coupled LDPC code. In this case, the inner code is decoded using an adaptive WBP, while the outer code is decoded using the sliding window decoder and static belief propagation. The results show that the adaptive WBP provides a coding gain of 0.8 dB compared to the neural normalized min-sum decoder, with about the same computational complexity and decoding latency.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Spatiotemporal 2-D Polar Codes for Massive MIMO with MMSE Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the evolution from 5G to 6G, ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) faces increasingly stringent performance requirements. Lower latency constraints demand shorter channel coding lengths, which can severely degrade decoding performance. The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is considered a crucial technology to address this challenge due to its abundant spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). While polar codes are theoretically capacity-achieving in the limit of infinite code length, their practical applicability is limited by significant decoding latency. In this paper, we establish a unified theoretical framework and propose a novel spatiotemporal two-dimensional (2-D) polar coding scheme for massive MIMO systems employing minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. The polar transform is jointly applied over both spatial and temporal dimensions to fully exploit the large spatial DoF. By leveraging the near-deterministic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) property of MMSE detection, the spatial domain is modeled as a set of parallel Gaussian sub-channels. Within this framework, we perform a theoretical analysis of the 2-D polarization behavior using the Gaussian approximation method, and the capacity-achieving property of the proposed scheme is proved under finite blocklength constraints and large spatial DoF. Simulation results further demonstrate that, compared to traditional time-domain polar codes, the proposed 2-D scheme can significantly reduce latency while guaranteeing reliability, or alternatively improve reliability under the same latency constraint -- offering a capacity-achieving and latency-efficient channel coding solution for massive MIMO systems in future 6G URLLC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rotatable RIS Assisted Physical Layer Multicasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) dynamically control signal propagation to enhance wireless communications. This paper presents a novel framework for rotatable RIS assisted physical-layer multicast systems, aiming to maximize the sum of minimum multicast rates via joint optimization of base station beamforming, RIS phase shifts, and orientation. Unlike unicast or non-rotatable setups, the rotatable RIS adapts orientation to align signals with user groups, improving fairness and rates for weak users. An alternating optimization approach combines convex optimization for beamforming/phase shifts with exhaustive search and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for orientation. Majorization-Minimization-based algorithms solve subproblems iteratively. Simulation results show the framework achieves 24.1% rate improvement via exhaustive search and 20.0% via PSO over the non-rotatable RIS baseline, with PSO performance close to the exhaustive search upper bound, highlighting the benefits of physical-layer multicast and orientation optimization.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Transport-Based Method for Computing LM Rate and Its Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mismatch capacity characterizes the highest information rate of the channel under a prescribed decoding metric and serves as a critical performance indicator in numerous practical communication scenarios. Compared to the commonly used Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), the Lower bound on the Mismatch capacity (LM rate) generally provides a tighter lower bound on the mismatch capacity. However, the efficient computation of the LM rate is significantly more challenging than that of the GMI, particularly as the size of the channel input alphabet increases. This growth in complexity renders standard numerical methods (e.g., interior point methods) computationally intensive and, in some cases, impractical. In this work, we reformulate the computation of the LM rate as a special instance of the optimal transport (OT) problem with an additional constraint. Building on this formulation, we develop a novel numerical algorithm based on the Sinkhorn algorithm, which is well known for its efficiency in solving entropy regularized optimization problems. We further provide the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, revealing that the algorithm has a sub-linear convergence rate. Numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for the computation of the LM rate.</description>

      <title>Sparse Regression Codes for Secret Key Agreement: Achieving Strong Secrecy and Near-Optimal Rates for Gaussian Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secret key agreement from correlated physical layer observations is a cornerstone of information-theoretic security. This paper proposes and rigorously analyzes a complete, constructive protocol for secret key agreement from Gaussian sources using Sparse Regression Codes (SPARCs). Our protocol systematically leverages the known optimality of SPARCs for both rate-distortion and Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coding, facilitated by their inherent nested structure. The primary contribution of this work is a comprehensive end-to-end analysis demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal secret key rates with strong secrecy guarantees, as quantified by a vanishing variational distance. We explicitly characterize the gap to the optimal rate, revealing a fundamental trade-off between the key rate and the required public communication overhead, which is governed by a tunable quantization parameter. Furthermore, we uncover a non-trivial constrained optimization for this parameter, showing that practical constraints on the SPARC code parameters induce a peak in the achievable secret key rate. This work establishes SPARCs as a viable and theoretically sound framework for secure key generation, providing a compelling low-complexity alternative to existing schemes and offering new insights into the practical design of such protocols.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Channel Models for Satellite Mega-Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general satellite channel model is proposed for communications between a rapidly moving low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite in a mega-constellation and a stationary user on Earth. The channel uses a non-homogeneous binomial point process (NBPP) for modelling the satellite positions, marked with an ascending/descending binary random variable for modelling the satellite directions. Using the marked NBPP, we derive the probability distributions of power gain, propagation delay, and Doppler shift, resulting in a stochastic signal propagation model for the mega-constellation geometry in isolation of other effects. This forms the basis for our proposed channel model as a randomly time-varying channel. The scattering function of this channel is derived to characterise how the received power is spread in the delay-Doppler domain. Global channel parameters such as path loss and channel spread are analysed in terms of the scattering function. The channel statistics and the global channel parameters closely match realistic orbit simulations of the Starlink constellation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combinatorial analysis of the false alarm (FA) and misdetection (MD) probabilities of non-adaptive group testing with sparse pooling graphs is developed. The analysis targets the combinatorial orthogonal matching pursuit and definite defective detection algorithms in the noiseless, non-quantitative setting. The approach follows an ensemble average perspective, where average FA/MD probabilities are computed for pooling graph ensembles with prescribed degree distributions. The accuracy of the analysis is demonstrated through numerical examples, showing that the proposed technique can be used to characterize the performance of non-adaptive group testing schemes based on sparse pooling graphs.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Multi-User Communication in Semantic Domain: Enhanced OMDMA by Shuffle-Based Orthogonalization and Diffusion Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-user interference remains a critical bottleneck in wireless communication systems, particularly in the emerging paradigm of semantic communication (SemCom). Compared to traditional systems, inter-user interference in SemCom severely degrades key semantic information, often causing worse performance than Gaussian noise under the same power level. To address this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal Model Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality rooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to distinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the need for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA. Our key innovation lies in shuffle-based orthogonalization, where randomly permuting the positions of JSCC feature vectors transforms inter-user interference into Gaussian-like noise. By assigning each user a unique shuffling pattern, the interference is treated as channel noise, enabling effective mitigation using diffusion models (DMs). This approach not only simplifies system design by requiring a single universal JSCC model but also enhances privacy, as shuffling patterns act as implicit private keys. Additionally, we extend the framework to scenarios involving semantically correlated data. By grouping users based on semantic similarity, a cooperative beamforming strategy is introduced to exploit redundancy in correlated data, further improving system performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-user SemCom frameworks, achieving superior semantic fidelity, robustness to interference, and scalability-all without requiring additional training overhead.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Jamming Detection Using Low-Rank Structure of Received Signal Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communication can be simply subjected to malicious attacks due to its open nature and shared medium. Detecting jamming attacks is the first and necessary step to adopt the anti-jamming strategies. This paper presents novel cooperative jamming detection methods that use the low-rank structure of the received signal matrix. We employed the likelihood ratio test to propose detectors for various scenarios. We regarded several scenarios with different numbers of friendly and jamming nodes and different levels of available statistical information on noise. We also provided an analytical examination of the false alarm performance of one of the proposed detectors, which can be used to adjust the detection threshold. We discussed the synthetic signal generation and the Monte Carlo (MC)-based threshold setting method, where knowledge of the distribution of the jamming-free signal, as well as several parameters such as noise variance and channel state information (CSI), is required to accurately generate synthetic signals for threshold estimation. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed detectors outperform several existing methods, offering robust and accurate jamming detection in a collaborative network of sensing nodes.</description>

      <title>Construction of non-generalized Reed-Solomon MDS codes based on systematic generator matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are considered optimal because the minimum distance cannot be improved for a given length and code size. The most prominent MDS codes are likely the generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes. In 1989, Roth and Lempel constructed a type of MDS code that is not a GRS code (referred to as non-GRS). In 2017, Beelen et al. introduced twisted Reed-Solomon (TRS) codes and demonstrated that many MDS TRS codes are indeed non-GRS. Following this, the definition of TRS codes was generalized to the most comprehensive form, which we refer to as generalized twisted Reed-Solomon (GTRS) codes. In this paper, we prove that two families of GTRS codes are non-GRS and provide a systematic generator matrix for a class of GTRS codes. Inspired by the form of the systematic generator matrix for GTRS codes,we also present a construction of non-GRS MDS codes.</description>

      <title>A note on the Artstein-Avidan-Milman's generalized Legendre transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artstein-Avidan and Milman [Annals of mathematics (2009), (169):661-674] characterized invertible reverse-ordering transforms on the space of lower-semi-continuous extended real-valued convex functions as affine deformations of the ordinary Legendre transform. In this note, we prove that all those generalized Legendre transforms on functions correspond to the ordinary Legendre transform on dually corresponding affine-deformed functions. That is, generalized convex conjugates are convex conjugates of affine-deformed functions. We conclude this note by sketching how this result can be interpreted from the lens of information geometry.</description>

      <title>The Coverage Depth Problem in DNA Storage Over Small Alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coverage depth problem in DNA data storage is about minimizing the expected number of reads until all data is recovered. When they exist, MDS codes offer the best performance in this context. This paper focuses on the scenario where the base field is not large enough to allow the existence of MDS codes. We investigate the performance for the coverage depth problem of codes defined over a small finite field, providing closed formulas for the expected number of reads for various code families. We also compare the results with the theoretical bounds in asymptotic regimes. The techniques we apply range from probability, to duality theory and combinatorics.</description>

      <title>The Random Variables of the DNA Coverage Depth Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA data storage systems encode digital data into DNA strands, enabling dense and durable storage. Efficient data retrieval depends on coverage depth, a key performance metric. We study the random access coverage depth problem and focus on minimizing the expected number of reads needed to recover information strands encoded via a linear code. We compute the asymptotic performance of a recently proposed code construction, establishing and refining a conjecture in the field by giving two independent proofs. We also analyze a geometric code construction based on balanced quasi-arcs and optimize its parameters. Finally, we investigate the full distribution of the random variables that arise in the coverage depth problem, of which the traditionally studied expectation is just the first moment. This allows us to distinguish between code constructions that, at first glance, may appear to behave identically.</description>

      <title>Handoff Design in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks Using DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff (HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA) observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF). Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a response time less than 0.4 ms.</description>

      <title>Spatial Language Likelihood Grounding Network for Bayesian Fusion of Human-Robot Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network (FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot collaborative task performance.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Channel-Enabled Online Resource Allocation for 6G: Principle, Architecture and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging applications such as holographic communication, autonomous driving, and the industrial Internet of Things impose stringent requirements on flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G networks. Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>ModShift: Model Privacy via Designed Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, shifts are introduced to preserve model privacy against an eavesdropper in federated learning. Model learning is treated as a parameter estimation problem. This perspective allows us to derive the Fisher Information matrix of the model updates from the shifted updates and drive them to singularity, thus posing a hard estimation problem for Eve. The shifts are securely shared with the central server to maintain model accuracy at the server and participating devices. A convergence test is proposed to detect if model updates have been tampered with and we show that our scheme passes this test. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves a higher model shift when compared to a noise injection scheme while requiring a lesser bandwidth secret channel.</description>

      <title>Product-Congruence Games: A Unified Impartial-Game Framework for RSA ($\phi$-MuM) and AES (poly-MuM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RSA exponent reduction and AES S-box inversion share a hidden commonality: both are governed by the same impartial combinatorial principle, which we call a Product-Congruence Game (PCG). A Product-Congruence Game tracks play via the modular or finite-field product of heap values, providing a single invariant that unifies the algebraic cores of these two ubiquitous symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems. We instantiate this framework with two companion games. First, $\phi$-MuM, in which a left-associated "multi-secret" RSA exponent chain compresses into the game of Multiplicative Modular Nim, PCG($k,\{1\}$), where $k = ord_N(g)$. The losing predicate then factorizes via the Chinese remainder theorem, mirroring RSA's structure. Second, poly-MuM, our model for finite-field inversion such as the AES S-box. For poly-MuM we prove the single-hole property inside its threshold region, implying that the Sprague-Grundy values are multiplicative under disjunctive sums in that region. Beyond these instances, we establish four structural theorems for a general Product-Congruence Game PCG($m,R$): (i) single-heap repair above the modulus, (ii) ultimate period $m$ per coordinate, (iii) exact and asymptotic losing densities, and (iv) confinement of optimal play to a finite indeterminacy region. An operation-alignment collapse principle explains why some variants degenerate to a single aggregate while MuM, $\phi$-MuM and poly-MuM retain rich local structure. All ingredients (multiplicative orders, the Chinese remainder theorem, finite fields) are classical; the contribution is the unified aggregation-compression viewpoint that embeds both RSA and AES inside one impartial-game framework, together with the structural and collapse theorems.</description>

      <title>Graded Transformers: A Symbolic-Geometric Approach to Structured Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT, exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data.
  We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work.
  The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven models and paving the way for interpretable, efficient systems in complex domains.</description>

      <title>Joint Fiber and Free Space Optical Infrastructure Planning for Hybrid Integrated Access and Backhaul Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) is one of the promising techniques for 5G networks and beyond (6G), in which the same node/hardware is used to provide both backhaul and cellular services in a multi-hop architecture. Due to the sensitivity of the backhaul links with high rate/reliability demands, proper network planning is needed to ensure the IAB network performs with the desired performance levels. In this paper, we study the effect of infrastructure planning and optimization on the coverage of IAB networks. We concentrate on the cases where the fiber connectivity to the nodes is constrained due to cost. Thereby, we study the performance gains and energy efficiency in the presence of free-space optical (FSO) communication links. Our results indicate hybrid fiber/FSO deployments offer substantial cost savings compared to fully fibered networks, suggesting a beneficial trade-off for strategic link deployment while improving the service coverage probability. As we show, with proper network planning, the service coverage, energy efficiency, and cost efficiency can be improved.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting via Partially Asymmetric Convolution and Sub-Sliding Window Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the experimental results.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Cram\'er-Rao Bound Using Information Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In information geometry, statistical models are considered as differentiable manifolds, where each probability distribution represents a unique point on the manifold. A Riemannian metric can be systematically obtained from a divergence function using Eguchi's theory (1992); the well-known Fisher-Rao metric is obtained from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The geometric derivation of the classical Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) by Amari and Nagaoka (2000) is based on this metric. In this paper, we study a Riemannian metric obtained by applying Eguchi's theory to the Basu-Harris-Hjort-Jones (BHHJ) divergence (1998) and derive a generalized Cram\'er-Rao bound using Amari-Nagaoka's approach. There are potential applications for this bound in robust estimation.</description>

      <title>Capacity Bounds for Broadcast Channels with Bidirectional Conferencing Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-user broadcast channel (BC) with receivers connected by bidirectional cooperation links of finite capacities, known as conferencing decoders, is considered. A novel capacity region outer bound is established based on multiple applications of the Csisz\'{a}r-K\"{o}rner identity. Achievable rate regions are derived by using Marton's coding as the transmission scheme, together with different combinations of decode-and-forward and quantize-bin-and-forward strategies at the receivers. It is shown that the outer bound coincides with the achievable rate region for a new class of semi-deterministic BCs with degraded message sets; for this class of channels, one-round cooperation is sufficient to achieve the capacity. Capacity result is also derived for a class of more capable semi-deterministic BCs with both common and private messages and one-sided conferencing. For the Gaussian BC with conferencing decoders, if the noises at the decoders are perfectly correlated (i.e., correlation is either 1 or -1), the new outer bound yields exact capacity region for two cases: i) BC with degraded message sets; ii) BC with one-sided conferencing from the weaker receiver to the stronger receiver. When the noises have arbitrary correlation, the outer bound is shown to be within half a bit from the capacity region for these same two cases. Finally, for the general Gaussian BC, a one-sided cooperation scheme based on decode-and-forward from the stronger receiver to the weaker receiver is shown to achieve the capacity region to within $\frac{1}{2}\log (\frac{2}{1-|\lambda|})$ bits, where $\lambda$ is the noise correlation. An interesting implication of these results is that for a Gaussian BC with perfectly negatively correlated noises and conferencing decoders with finite cooperation link capacities, it is possible to achieve a strictly positive rate using only an infinitesimal amount of transmit power.</description>

      <title>DRL-AdaPart: DRL-Driven Adaptive STAR-RIS Partitioning for Fair and Frugal Resource Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method for efficient resource utilization of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) elements to ensure fair and high data rates. We introduce a subsurface assignment variable that determines the number of STAR-RIS elements allocated to each user and maximizes the sum of the data rates by jointly optimizing the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS and the subsurface assignment variables using an appropriately tailored deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. The proposed DRL method is also compared with a Dinkelbach algorithm and the designed hybrid DRL approach. A penalty term is incorporated into the DRL model to enhance resource utilization by intelligently deactivating STAR-RIS elements when not required. The proposed DRL method can achieve fair and high data rates for static and mobile users while ensuring efficient resource utilization through extensive simulations. Using the proposed DRL method, up to 27% and 21% of STAR-RIS elements can be deactivated in static and mobile scenarios, respectively, without affecting performance.</description>

      <title>Channel-Aware Distributed Transmission Control and Video Streaming in UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of distributed transmission control and video streaming optimization for UAVs operating in unlicensed spectrum bands. We develop a rigorous cross-layer analysis framework that jointly considers three inter-dependent factors: (i) in-band interference introduced by ground-aerial nodes at the physical layer, (ii) limited-size queues with delay-constrained packet arrival at the MAC layer, and (iii) video encoding rate at the application layer. First, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average throughput by optimizing the fading threshold. To this end, we jointly analyze the queue-related packet loss probabilities as well as the outage probability due to the low SINR. We introduce the DTC algorithm that maximizes the average throughput by adjusting transmission policies to balance the trade-offs between packet drop from queues vs. transmission errors due to low SINRs. Second, we incorporate the video distortion model to develop distributed PSNR optimization for video streaming. The formulated optimization incorporates two cross-layer parameters, specifically the fading threshold and video encoding rate. To tackle this problem, we develop the JDVT-EC algorithm that enhances the average PSNR for all nodes by fine-tuning transmission policies and video encoding rates to balance the trade-offs between packet loss and lossy video compression distortions. Through extensive numerical analysis, we thoroughly examine the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that they are able to find the optimal transmission policies and video encoding rates under various scenarios. Notably, our approach improves the average throughput by 1.7% to 51.65% compared to various baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate an average PSNR increase of 0.24 dB and 1.7 dB compared to separately optimizing the fading threshold and video encoding rate, respectively.</description>

      <title>Rate-reliability tradeoff for deterministic identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02389v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate deterministic identification over arbitrary memoryless channels under the constraint that the error probabilities of first and second kind are exponentially small in the block length $\mathbf{n}$, controlled by reliability exponents $\mathbf{E_1,E_2 \geq 0}$. In contrast to the regime of slowly vanishing errors, where the identifiable message length scales linearithmically as $\mathbf{\Theta(n\log n)}$, here we find that for positive exponents linear scaling is restored, now with a rate that is a function of the reliability exponents. We give upper and lower bounds on the ensuing rate-reliability function in terms of (the logarithm of) the packing and covering numbers of the channel output set, which for small error exponents $\mathbf{E_1,E_2&gt;0}$ can be expanded in leading order as the product of the Minkowski dimension of a certain parametrisation the channel output set and $\mathbf{\log\min\{E_1,E_2\}}$. These allow us to recover the previously observed slightly superlinear identification rates, and offer a different perspective for understanding them in more traditional information theory terms. We also show that even if only one of the two errors is required to be exponentially small, the linearithmic scaling is lost. We further illustrate our results with a discussion of the case of dimension zero, and extend them to classical-quantum channels and quantum channels with tensor product input restriction.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Deletion/Substitution Channel Capacity for Small Deletion and Substitution Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider binary input deletion/substitution channels, which model certain types of synchronization errors encountered in practice. Specifically, we focus on the regime of small deletion and substitution probabilities, and by extending an approach developed for the deletion-only channel, we obtain an asymptotic characterization of the channel capacity for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) deletion/substitution channels. To do so, given a target probability of successful decoding, we first develop an upper bound on the codebook size for arbitrary but fixed numbers of deletions and substitutions, and then extend the result to the case of random deletions and substitutions to obtain a bound on the channel capacity. Our final result is: The i.i.d. deletion/substitution channel capacity is approximately \(1 - H(p_d) - H(p_s)\), for \(p_d, p_s \approx0\), where \(p_d\) and \(p_s\) are the deletion and substitution probabilities, respectively.</description>

      <title>Communication via Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an alternative take on the recently popularized concept of `\textit{joint sensing and communications}', which focuses on using communication resources also for sensing. Here, we propose the opposite, where we utilize the receiver's sensing capabilities for communication. Our goal is to characterize the fundamental limits of communication over such a channel, which we call `\textit{communication via sensing}'. We assume that changes in the sensed attributes, such as location and speed, are limited due to practical constraints, which are captured by assuming a finite-state channel (FSC) with an input cost constraint. We first formulate an upper bound on the \(N\)-letter capacity as a cost-constrained optimization problem over the input sequence distribution, and then convert it to an equivalent problem over the state sequence distribution. Moreover, by breaking a walk on the underlying Markov chain into a weighted sum of traversed graph cycles in the long walk limit, we obtain a compact single-letter formulation of the capacity upper bound. Finally, for a specific case of a two-state FSC with noisy sensing characterized by a binary symmetric channel (BSC), we obtain a closed-form expression for the capacity upper bound. Comparison with an existing numerical lower bound shows that our proposed upper bound is very tight for all crossover probabilities.</description>

      <title>Remote Safety Monitoring: Significance-Aware Status Updating for Situational Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a problem of remote safety monitoring, where a monitor pulls status updates from multiple sensors monitoring several safety-critical situations. Based on the received updates, multiple estimators determine the current safety-critical situations. Due to transmission errors and limited channel resources, the received status updates may not be fresh, resulting in the possibility of misunderstanding the current safety situation. In particular, if a dangerous situation is misinterpreted as safe, the safety risk is high. We study the joint design of transmission scheduling and estimation for multi-sensor, multi-channel remote safety monitoring, aiming to minimize the loss due to the unawareness of potential danger. We show that the joint design of transmission scheduling and estimation can be reduced to a sequential optimization of estimation and scheduling. The scheduling problem can be formulated as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit (RMAB) , for which it is difficult to establish indexability. We propose a low-complexity Maximum Gain First (MGF) policy and prove it is asymptotically optimal as the numbers of sources and channels scale up proportionally, without requiring the indexability condition. We also provide an information-theoretic interpretation of the transmission scheduling problem. Numerical results show that our estimation and scheduling policies achieves higher performance gain over periodic updating, randomized policy, and Maximum Age First (MAF) policy.</description>

Abstract: We study skew polycyclic codes over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, associated with a skew polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{F}_q[x;\sigma]$, where $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb{F}_q$. We start by proving the Roos-like bound for both the Hamming and the rank metric for this class of codes. Next, we focus on the Hamming and rank equivalence between two classes of polycyclic codes by introducing an equivalence relation and describing its equivalence classes. Finally, we present examples that illustrate applications of the theory developed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Action-List Reinforcement Learning Syndrome Decoding for Binary Linear Block Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>AI/ML Life Cycle Management for Interoperable AI Native RAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are rapidly permeating the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), powering beam management, channel state information (CSI) feedback, positioning, and mobility prediction. However, without a standardized life-cycle management (LCM) framework, challenges, such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and limited transparency, hinder large-scale adoption. 3GPP Releases 16-20 progressively evolve AI/ML from experimental features to managed, interoperable network functions. Beginning with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in Rel-16, subsequent releases introduced standardized interfaces for model transfer, execution, performance monitoring, and closed-loop control, culminating in Rel-20's two-sided CSI-compression Work Item and vendor-agnostic LCM profile. This article reviews the resulting five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven monitoring mechanisms, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes, while identifying open challenges in resource-efficient monitoring, environment drift detection, intelligent decision-making, and flexible model training. These developments lay the foundation for AI-native transceivers as a key enabler for 6G.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a two-player zero-sum game between a probabilist and Nature defined by a convex function $f$, a finite collection $\mathcal{B}$ of Markov generators (or its convex hull), and a target distribution $\pi$. The probabilist selects a mixed strategy $\mu \in \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B})$, the set of probability measures on $\mathcal{B}$, while Nature adopts a pure strategy and selects a $\pi$-reversible Markov generator $M$. The probabilist receives a payoff equal to the $f$-divergence $D_f(M \| L)$, where $L$ is drawn according to $\mu$. We prove that this game always admits a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium and satisfies a minimax identity. In contrast, a pure strategy equilibrium may fail to exist. We develop a projected subgradient method to compute approximate mixed strategy equilibria with provable convergence guarantees. Connections to information centroids, Chebyshev centers, and Bayes risk are discussed. This paper extends earlier minimax results on $f$-divergences to the context of Markov generators.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Markov chains generalize classical Markov chains for random variables to the quantum realm and exhibit unique inherent properties, making them an important feature in quantum information theory. In this work, we propose the concept of virtual quantum Markov chains (VQMCs), focusing on scenarios where subsystems retain classical information about global systems from measurement statistics. As a generalization of quantum Markov chains, VQMCs characterize states where arbitrary global shadow information can be recovered from subsystems through local quantum operations and measurements. We present an algebraic characterization for virtual quantum Markov chains and show that the virtual quantum recovery is fully determined by the block matrices of a quantum state on its subsystems. Notably, we find a distinction between two classes of tripartite entanglement by showing that the W state is a VQMC while the GHZ state is not. Furthermore, we introduce the virtual non-Markovianity to quantify the non-Markovianity of a given quantum state, which also assesses the optimal sampling overhead for virtually recovering this state. Our findings elucidate distinctions between quantum Markov chains and virtual quantum Markov chains, extending our understanding of quantum recovery to scenarios prioritizing classical information from measurement statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement distillation is a fundamental information processing task whose implementation is key to quantum communication and modular quantum computing. Noise experienced by such communication and computing platforms occurs not only in the form of Pauli noise such as dephasing (sometimes called $T_2$) but also non-Pauli noise such as amplitude damping (sometimes called $T_1$). We initiate a study of practical and asymptotic distillation over what we call the joint damping-dephasing noise channel. In the practical setting, we propose a distillation scheme that completely isolates away the damping noise. In the asymptotic setting we derive lower bounds on the entanglement sharing capacities including the coherent and reverse coherent information. Like the protocol achieving the reverse coherent information, our scheme uses only backward classical communication. However, for realistic damping noise ($T_1 \neq 2T_2$) our strategy can exceed the reverse coherent strategy, which is the best known for pure damping. In the forward communication setting we numerically exceed the single-letter coherent information strategy by observing the channel displays non-additivity at the two-letter level. The work shows non-additivity can also be found in realistic noise models with magnitudes of non-additivity similar to those found in more idealized noise channels.</description>

      <title>Non-convex matrix sensing: Breaking the quadratic rank barrier in the sample complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13276v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, two classes of algorithms have been widely studied in the literature: convex approaches based on nuclear norm minimization, and non-convex approaches that use factorized gradient descent. Under certain statistical model assumptions, it is known that nuclear norm minimization recovers the ground truth as soon as the number of samples scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom of the ground-truth. In contrast, while non-convex approaches are computationally less expensive, existing recovery guarantees assume that the number of samples scales at least quadratically with the rank $r$ of the ground-truth matrix. In this paper, we close this gap by showing that the non-convex approaches can be as efficient as nuclear norm minimization in terms of sample complexity. Namely, we consider the problem of reconstructing a positive semidefinite matrix from a few Gaussian measurements. We show that factorized gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the ground truth at a linear rate as soon as the number of samples scales with $ \Omega (rd\kappa^2)$, where $d$ is the dimension, and $\kappa$ is the condition number of the ground truth matrix. This improves the previous rank-dependence in the sample complexity of non-convex matrix factorization from quadratic to linear. Furthermore, we extend our theory to the noisy setting, where we show that with noisy measurements, factorized gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the minimax optimal error up to a factor linear in $\kappa$. Our proof relies on a probabilistic decoupling argument, where we show that the gradient descent iterates are only weakly dependent on the individual entries of the measurement matrices. We expect that our proof technique is of independent interest for other non-convex problems.</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>

      <title>NestQuant: Nested Lattice Quantization for Matrix Products and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot (8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation benchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Combinatorial Semi-bandits with Graph Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18826v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In combinatorial semi-bandits, a learner repeatedly selects from a combinatorial decision set of arms, receives the realized sum of rewards, and observes the rewards of the individual selected arms as feedback. In this paper, we extend this framework to include \emph{graph feedback}, where the learner observes the rewards of all neighboring arms of the selected arms in a feedback graph $G$. We establish that the optimal regret over a time horizon $T$ scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}(S\sqrt{T}+\sqrt{\alpha ST})$, where $S$ is the size of the combinatorial decisions and $\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$. This result interpolates between the known regrets $\widetilde\Theta(S\sqrt{T})$ under full information (i.e., $G$ is complete) and $\widetilde\Theta(\sqrt{KST})$ under the semi-bandit feedback (i.e., $G$ has only self-loops), where $K$ is the total number of arms. A key technical ingredient is to realize a convexified action using a random decision vector with negative correlations. We also show that online stochastic mirror descent (OSMD) that only realizes convexified actions in expectation is suboptimal. In addition, we describe the problem of \emph{combinatorial semi-bandits with general capacity} and apply our results to derive an improved regret upper bound, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Smoothed analysis in compressed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arbitrary matrices $M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, randomly perturbed in an additive manner using a random matrix $R \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, are shown to asymptotically almost surely satisfy the so-called {\sl robust null space property}. Whilst insisting on an asymptotically optimal order of magnitude for $m$ required to attain {\sl unique reconstruction} via $\ell_1$-minimisation algorithms, our results track the level of arbitrariness allowed for the fixed seed matrix $M$ as well as the degree of distributional irregularity allowed for the entries of the perturbing matrix $R$. Starting with sub-gaussian entries for $R$, our results culminate with these allowed to have substantially heavier tails than sub-exponential ones. Throughout this trajectory, two measures control the arbitrariness allowed for $M$; the first is $\|M\|_\infty$ and the second is a localised notion of the Frobenius norm of $M$ (which depends on the sparsity of the signal being reconstructed). A key tool driving our proofs is {\sl Mendelson's small-ball method} ({\em Learning without concentration}, J. ACM, Vol. $62$, $2015$).</description>

      <title>Measuring Information Distortion in Hierarchical Ultra long Novel Reconstruction:The Optimal Expansion Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two stage novel generation framework (outline -&gt; section outline -&gt; manuscript) is widely used in long novel generation,(e.g., \textsc{DOME}, \textsc{Plan\&amp;Write}, \textsc{Long Writer}), but study of such framework in ultra long novel(&gt;1M words) reconstruction is little. Building on recent text compression methods (\textsc{LLMZip}, \textsc{LLM2Vec}), we conduct an information-theoretic analysis to quantify semantic distortion under different compression-expansion ratios. We examine how outline length affects information preservation. Experiments on ultra-long novels show that the optimal compression-expansion ratio significantly reduces semantic distortion compared to other non-optimal compression-expansion ratio.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference Optimized Using the Curved Geometry of Coupled Free Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an optimization framework for variational inference based on the coupled free energy, extending variational inference techniques to account for the curved geometry of the coupled exponential family. This family includes important heavy-tailed distributions such as the generalized Pareto and the Student's t. By leveraging the coupled free energy, which is equal to the coupled evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the inverted probabilities, we improve the accuracy and robustness of the learned model. The coupled generalization of Fisher Information metric and the affine connection. The method is applied to the design of a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE). By using the coupling for both the distributions and cost functions, the reconstruction metric is derived to still be the mean-square average loss with modified constants. The novelty comes from sampling the heavy-tailed latent distribution with its associated coupled probability, which has faster decaying tails. The result is the ability to train a model robust against severe outliers, while assuring that the training process is stable. The Wasserstein-2 or Fr\'echet Inception Distance of the reconstructed CelebA images shows the CVAE has a 3\% improvement over the VAE after 5 epochs of training.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Quantum Packing Problems via An Operator Layer Cake Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By choosing the optimal input distribution, we recover the optimal error exponent (i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above the critical rate. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems, including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length coding.
  Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is pretty good.</description>
