      <title>Chiral pair density waves with residual Fermi arcs in RbV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral 2 by 2 charge order has been reported and confirmed in the kagome superconductor RbV3Sb5, while its interplay with superconductivity remains elusive owing to its lowest superconducting transition temperature Tc of about 0.85K among the AV3Sb5 family (A=K, Rb, Cs) that severely challenges electronic spectroscopic probes. Here, utilizing dilution-refrigerator-based scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) down to 30mK, we observe chiral 2 by 2 pair density waves with residual Fermi arcs in RbV3Sb5. We find a superconducting gap of 150{\mu}eV with substantial residual in-gap states. The spatial distribution of this gap exhibits chiral 2 by 2 modulations, signaling a chiral pair density wave (PDW). Our quasi-particle interference imaging of the zero-energy residual states further reveals arc-like patterns. We discuss the relation of the gap modulations with the residual Fermi arcs under the space-momentum correspondence between PDW and Bogoliubov Fermi states.</description>

      <title>Effect of Proton Irradiation in Thin-Film YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the effect of 0.6 MeV proton irradiation on the superconducting and normal state properties of thin-film $\text{YBa}_{2}\text{Cu}_{3}\text{O}_{7-\delta}$ superconductors. A thin-film YBCO superconductor ($\approx$ 567 nm thick) was subject to a series of proton irradiations with a total fluence of $7.6\times10^{16}$ $\text{p/cm}^2$. Upon irradiation, $T_c$ was drastically decreased from 89.3 K towards zero with a corresponding increase in its normal state resistivity above $T_c$. This increase in resistivity which indicates the increase of defects inside the thin-film sample can be converted to the dimensionless scattering rate. We found that the relation between $T_c$ and dimensionless scattering rate obtained during proton irradiation approximates the generalized d-wave Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory better than the previous results obtained from electron irradiations. This is an unexpected result since the electron irradiation is known to be most effective to suppress superconductivity over other heavier ion irradiations such as proton irradiation. It suggests that the type of defects created by proton irradiation evolves from cascade defects (in bulk single crystals) to point-like defects (in thin-film single crystals) as the thickness decreases.</description>

      <title>Doping evolution of the normal state magnetic excitations in pressurized La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doping evolution behaviors of the normal state magnetic excitations (MEs) of the nickelate La3Ni2O7 are theoretically studied in this paper. For a filling of n = 3.0 which corresponds roughly to the material which realizes the superconductivity of about 80 K under moderately high pressures above 14 GPa, the MEs exhibit a square-like pattern centered at (0,0) which originates from the intrapocket particle-hole scatterings. Furthermore, it was found that the MEs show very strong modulations on the interlayer momentum qz. With the increasing of qz, the patterns of the MEs change dramatically. In the large qz regime, they turn to be ruled by the interpocket excitation modes with significantly larger intensity which may play a vital role in the superconducting pairing. This hidden feature of the MEs was not revealed by previous studies. The established features of the MEs are found to be very robust against doping. They persist in the wide hole- or electron-doping regime around n = 3.0. However, in the heavily electron-doped regime, a Lifshitz transition will occur. Consequently, the behaviors of the MEs change qualitatively across this transition. With the absence of the hole pocket, we predict that a strong tendency toward the spin-density-wave (SDW) order will develop due to the perfect nesting between the electron and the hole pockets at n = 4.0. Thus, we have investigated the normal state behaviors of the MEs and their doping evolutions which may shed light on the mechanism of superconductivity in pressurized La3Ni2O7.</description>

      <title>Reply to "Comment on `Towards exact solutions of superconducting $T_c$ induced by electron-phonon interaction' "</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of papers, we have proposed a non-perturbative field-theoretic approach to deal with strong electron-phonon and strong Coulomb interactions. The key ingredient of such an approach is to determine the full fermion-boson vertex corrections by solving a number of self-consistent Ward-Takahashi identities. Palle (see Phys. Rev. B 110, 026501 (2024), arXiv:2404.02918) argued that our Ward-Takahashi identities failed to include some important additional terms and thus are incorrect. We agree that our Ward-Takahashi identities have ignored some potentially important contributions and here give some remarks on the role played by the additional terms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cooper Pairing via Random Matrix Phonons in Superconducting Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is rich experimental evidence that granular superconductors and superconducting films often exhibit a higher transition temperature, $T_{c}$, than that in bulk samples of the same material. This paper suggests that this enhancement hinges on random matrix phonons mediating Cooper pairing more efficiently than bulk phonons. We develop the Eliashberg theory of superconductivity in chaotic grains, calculate the random phonon spectrum and solve the Eliashberg equations numerically. Self-averaging of the effective electron-phonon coupling constant is noted, which allows us to fit the numerical data with analytical results based on a generalization of the Berry conjecture. The key insight is that the phonon density of states, and hence $T_{c}$, shows an enhancement proportional to the ratio of the perimeter and area of the grain - the Weyl law. We benchmark our results for aluminum films, and find an enhancement of $T_{c}$ of about $10\%$ for a randomly-generated shape. A larger enhancement of $T_{c}$ is readily possible by optimizing grain geometries. We conclude by noticing that mesoscopic shape fluctuations in realistic granular structures should give rise to a further enhancement of global $T_{c}$ due to the formation of a percolating Josephson network.</description>

      <title>Chirality in the Kagome Metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using x-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we study photoemission intensity changes related to changes in the geometric and electronic structure in the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ upon transition to an unconventional charge density wave (CDW) state. The XPD patterns reveal the presence of a chiral atomic structure in the CDW phase. Furthermore, using circularly polarized x-rays, we have found a pronounced non-trivial circular dichroism in the angular distribution of the valence band photoemission in the CDW phase, indicating a chirality of the electronic structure. This observation is consistent with the proposed orbital loop current order. In view of a negligible spontaneous Kerr signal in recent magneto-optical studies, the results suggest an antiferromagnetic coupling of the orbital magnetic moments along the $c$-axis. While the inherent structural chirality may also induce circular dichroism, the observed asymmetry values seem to be too large in the case of the weak structural distortions caused by the CDW.</description>

      <title>Superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. When it is cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, which triggers a superfluid transition. Previous works on neutron superfluidity are focused on the finite-temperature transition. Little attention is paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of nuclear density $\rho$. The density serves as a non-thermal parameter for superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, there is a strong coupling between the gapless neutrons and the quantum critical fluctuations of superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling by using perturbation theory and renormalization group method, and show that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the Fermi-liquid specific heat $c_{n}\propto T$ and also markedly alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge at a time much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire life of a neutron star. At a low $T$, such phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior, yet occupying different layers. We include superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and find that it obviously prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a variety of neutron stars. Our results indicate the existence of an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Electronic properties and surface states of RbNi$_2$Se$_2$</title>

Abstract: Iron-based superconductors, with the ThCr$_{2}$Si$_{2}$-type tetragonal structure (122 family), due to the iron arsenide/selenide layers exhibit several characteristic electronic properties. For example, multiband character mosty associated with the $d$-orbitals of iron and the quasi-two-dimensional (2D) cylindrical Fermi surface. Moreover, external hydrostatic pressure leads to the isostructural phase transition from the tetragonal to collapsed-tetragonal phase. In this paper, in relation to the iron-based superconductors, we discuss the electronic properties of novel 122-family member RbNi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ [Liu H. et al., Phys. Rev. B 106, 094511 (2022)]. We show that the two Fermi pockets exhibit quasi-2D character. Calculation of the surface spectral function for the (001) surface shows that the surface states are realized independently on the surface termination. Additionally, contrary to the iron-based 122 compounds, RbNi$_{2}$Se$_{2}$ exhibits extraordinary multiple isostructural phase transitions under pressure. Moreover, the Lifshizt transition occurs under external pressure, which results into a strong modification of the shapes of the Fermi pockets.</description>

      <title>Variational approach for the two-body problem in a multiband extended-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a spin-up and a spin-down fermion in a generic tight-binding lattice with a multi-site basis, we investigate the two-body problem using a multiband extended-Hubbard model with finite-ranged hopping and interaction parameters. We derive a linear eigenvalue problem for the entire two-body spectrum, alongside a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the bound states in the form of a self-consistency equation. Our results, based on an exact variational approach, suggest potential applications across various lattice geometries. As an illustration, we apply them to the linear-chain model and show that the resultant spin singlet and triplet bound states align well with the existing literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the optical activity induced by the orbital magnetic moment in metals and superconductors using Green's function formalization. We show that an apparent singularity of the optical activity vanishes in the normal state; however, it remains finite in the superconducting state and is related to the superconducting Edelstein effect, ensuring the missing area measurement. Finally, we calculate the optical activity in a model Hamiltonian mimicking doped transition metal dichalcogenides to investigate its characteristic spectrum, and we analyze the Kerr effect to discuss a possibility to observe the optical activity in experiments.</description>
