      <title>Vorticity Suppression by Particle Lag Effects in Shock-Driven Multiphase Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock-driven multiphase mixing occurs in many physical systems such as explosive dispersal of chemical or biological agents, in the evolution of supernova remnants, and in supersonic and detonative combustion engines. This mixing process is driven by the Shock Driven Multiphase Instability (SDMI), a derivative of the canonical Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability (RMI). The SDMI deviates from the RMI as particle lag effects become significant, where a higher momentum deficit leads to longer equilibration times and a reduction in hydrodynamic mixing. In this work, the effect of particle lag (rate of momentum transfer) on the SDMI evolution was isolated and investigated utilizing solid nondeforming and nonevaporating particles of differing sizes while holding the effective density ratio (mass of particles in the interface) constant. Three particle sizes were selected with increasing velocity relaxation times. Experiments were conducted by accelerating a cylindrical interface comprised of air and seeded particles surrounded by clean (particle-free) air with a Mach 1.35 shock wave. The development of the multiphase interface was measured using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). Circulation measurements showed a decrease in mixing with increasing particle size. Finally, a new model, derived from theory, is proposed to predict circulation deposition, mixing energy, in the SDMI based on shock strength, effective density ratio, and particle response times.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic phase based proper orthogonal decomposition (IPhaB POD): a method for physically interpretable modes in near-periodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid dynamics systems driven by dominant, nearly periodic large-scale dynamics are common across wakes, jets, rotating machinery, and high-speed flows. Traditional decomposition techniques such as proper orthogonal decomposition and dynamic mode decomposition have been used to gain insight into these flows, but can require many modes to represent physical processes. With the aim of generating modes that intuitively convey the underlying physical mechanisms, we propose an intrinsic phase-based proper orthogonal decomposition (IPhaB POD) method. IPhaB POD creates energetically ranked modes that evolve along a characteristic cycle of a driving near-periodic large scale. Our proposed formulation is set in the time domain, which is particularly useful in cases where the large-scale dynamics are imperfectly periodic. We formally derive IPhaB POD within a proper orthogonal decomposition framework, and it inherits the optimal representation inherent to POD. As part of this derivation, a dynamical systems representation of the large scale is utilized, facilitating a definition of phase relative to the large scale within the time domain. An expectation operator and inner product are also constructed relative to this definition of phase in a manner that allows for the various cycles within the data to demonstrate imperfect periodicity. The formulation is tested on two sample problems: a simple, low Reynolds number airfoil wake, and a complex, high-speed pulsating shock wave problem. The resulting modes are shown to better isolate the large-scale dynamics in the first mode than space-only proper orthogonal decomposition, and to highlight meaningful small-scale dynamics in higher modes for the shock flow problem.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Acoustic Liner Optimization: Balancing Drag and Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present pore-resolved Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of turbulent flows grazing over acoustic liners with aerodynamically and/or acoustically optimized orifice configurations. Our DNS explore a large parameter space, studying various families of orifice geometries, including the influence of orifice shape, orientation, and the number of orifices. All flow cases show an increase in drag compared to the smooth wall. However, the added drag can be reduced by as much as $\sim$55\% as compared to conventional acoustic liners by simply altering the shape of the orifice or its orientation, in the case of a non-circular orifice. Complementary acoustic simulations demonstrate that this reduced drag may be achieved while maintaining the same noise reduction properties over a wide range of frequencies.</description>

      <title>The origin of wall-shear stress fluctuations in wall-bounded turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of wall shear-stress fluctuations in wall turbulence was studied through energy dissipation at the wall. While confirming the universality in wall dissipation at small inner scales, the dissipation at larger scales is a consequence of near-wall scale interactions. In particular, the energy transport from the universal small to larger scale strengthens with Reynolds number due to the growing number of intermediate scales associated with the log layer. We anticipate that these insights broadly apply to all canonical wall-bounded turbulence for sufficiently high Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Stochastic fluids with transport noise: Approximating diffusion from data using SVD and ensemble forecast back-propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and test methods for the calibration of the diffusion term in Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) describing fluids. We take two approaches, one uses ideas from the singular value decomposition and the Biot-Savart law. The other backpropagates through an ensemble forecast, with respect to diffusion parameters, to minimise a probabilistic ensemble forecasting metric. We describe the approaches in the specific context of solutions to SPDEs describing the evolution of fluid particles, sometimes called inviscid vortex methods. The methods are tested in an idealised setting in which the reference data is a known realisation of the parameterised SPDE, and also using a forecast verification metric known as the Continuous Rank Probability Score (CRPS).</description>

      <title>Acoustic resolvent analysis of turbulent jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a resolvent analysis of a compressible turbulent jet, where the optimisation domain of the response modes is located in the acoustic field, excluding the hydrodynamic region, in order to promote acoustically efficient modes. We examine the properties of the acoustic resolvent and assess its potential for jet-noise modelling, focusing on the subsonic regime. Resolvent forcing modes, consistent with previous studies, are found to contain supersonic waves associated with Mach wave radiation in the response modes. This differs from the standard resolvent in which hydrodynamic instabilities dominate. We compare resolvent modes with SPOD modes educed from LES data. Acoustic resolvent response modes generally have better alignment with acoustic SPOD modes than standard resolvent response modes. For the optimal mode, the angle of the acoustic beam is close to that found in SPOD modes for moderate frequencies. However, there is no significant separation between the singular values of the leading and sub-optimal modes. Some suboptimal modes are furthermore shown to contain irrelevant structure for jet noise. Thus, even though it contains essential acoustic features absent from the standard resolvent approach, the SVD of the acoustic resolvent alone is insufficient to educe a low-rank model for jet noise. But because it identifies the prevailing mechanisms of jet noise, it provides valuable guidelines in the search of a forcing model (Karban \textit{et al.} An empirical model of noise sources in subsonic jets. \textit{Journal of Fluid Mechanics} (2023): A18).</description>

      <title>Zeitlin truncation of a Shallow Water Quasi-Geostrophic model for planetary flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a Shallow-Water Quasi Geostrophic equation on the sphere, as a model for global large-scale atmospheric dynamics. This equation, previously studied by Verkley (2009) and Schubert et al. (2009), possesses a rich geometric structure, called Lie-Poisson, and admits an infinite number of conserved quantities, called Casimirs. In this paper, we develop a Casimir preserving numerical method for long-time simulations of this equation. The method develops in two steps: firstly, we construct an N-dimensional Lie-Poisson system that converges to the continuous one in the limit $N \to \infty$; secondly, we integrate in time the finite-dimensional system using an isospectral time integrator, developed by Modin and Viviani (2020). We demonstrate the efficacy of this computational method by simulating a flow on the entire sphere for different values of the Lamb parameter. We particularly focus on rotation-induced effects, such as the formation of jets. In agreement with shallow water models of the atmosphere, we observe the formation of robust latitudinal jets and a decrease in the zonal wind amplitude with latitude. Furthermore, spectra of the kinetic energy are computed as a point of reference for future studies.</description>

      <title>The role of viscosity on drop impact forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a rigid substrate undergoes deformation and spreading due to normal reaction forces, which are counteracted by surface tension. On a non-wetting substrate, the drop subsequently retracts and takes off. Our recent work (Zhang et al., \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}, vol. 129, 2022, 104501) revealed two peaks in the temporal evolution of the normal force $F(t)$--one at impact and another at jump-off. The second peak coincides with a Worthington jet formation, which vanishes at high viscosities due to increased viscous dissipation affecting flow focusing. In this article, using experiments, direct numerical simulations, and scaling arguments, we characterize both the peak amplitude $F_1$ at impact and the one at take off ($F_2$) and elucidate their dependency on the control parameters: the Weber number $We$ (dimensionless impact velocity) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity). \VS{The first peak amplitude $F_1$ and the time $t_1$ to reach it depend on inertial timescales for low viscosity liquids, remaining nearly constant for viscosities up to 100 times that of water. For high viscosity liquids, we balance the rate of change in kinetic energy with viscous dissipation to obtain new scaling laws: $F_1/F_\rho \sim \sqrt{Oh}$ and $t_1/\tau_\rho \sim 1/\sqrt{Oh}$, where $F_\rho$ and $\tau_\rho$ are the inertial force and time scales, respectively, which are consistent with our data.} The time $t_2$ at which the amplitude $F_2$ appears is set by the inertio-capillary timescale $\tau_\gamma$, independent of both the viscosity and the impact velocity of the drop. However, these properties dictate the magnitude of this amplitude.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Limits of Energy Extraction in Active Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active materials form a class of far-from-equilibrium systems that are driven internally and exhibit self-organization which can be harnessed to perform mechanical work. Inspired by experiments on synthetic active networks we examine limits of work extraction from an active viscoelastic medium by analyzing the transport of a particle. The active viscoelastic material possesses an equilibrium density where the active and passive forces are balanced out. In one dimension, a gliding activation front (AF) that converts a passive to an active medium, provides active energy at a constant rate, which is injected into the system at one end and propagates to the other. We demonstrate that there exists a maximum velocity of the AF, above which the activated region fails to deliver the transport power. We hypothesize, and intuitively argue based on the limit cases, that the feasibility and the velocity of transport can be interpreted in terms of the velocity of an equilibration Domain Wall of the field, which is set by two parameters: a measure of activity, and the viscoelastic timescale. The phase diagram comprises Transport and No-Transport sectors, namely for any pair of the two parameters, there exists a threshold velocity of the AF above which the particle transport becomes impossible. Constructing the phase diagram we find that there are regions of the phase diagram for which the threshold velocity of the AF diverges. Larger viscoelastic timescale makes the transport region more accessible, and increases the transport velocity therein. Also, we find that increasing the velocity of AF results in larger extracted power but smaller transport coefficient; the ratio of the transport velocity and that of the AF. Our model provides a framework for understanding the energetics of transport phenomena in biology, and designing efficient mechanisms of transport in synthetic active materials.</description>
