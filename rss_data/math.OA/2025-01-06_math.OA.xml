      <title>Essential groupoid amenability and nuclearity of groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new construction of the essential $C^*$-algebra of an \'etale groupoid, along with an "amenability" notion for such groupoids that characterizes the nuclearity of this essential $C^*$-algebra. In order to do this we first introduce a maximal version of the essential $C^*$-algebra, and prove that every function with dense co-support can only be supported in the set of "dangerous" arrows. We then introduce an essential amenability condition for a groupoid, which is (strictly) weaker than its (topological) amenability, and still implies that the essential $C^*$-algebra is nuclear (and isomorphic to its maximal counterpart). As an application, we describe the Bruce-Li algebras arising from algebraic actions of cancellative semigroups as exotic essential $C^*$-algebras. Moreover, we characterize when these $C^*$-algebras are nuclear.</description>

      <title>Lie theoretic approach to unitary groups of $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following Robert's [26], we study the structure of unitary groups and groups of approximately inner automorphisms of unital $C^*$-algebras, taking advantage of the former being Banach-Lie groups. For a given unital $C^*$-algebra $A$, we provide a description of the closed normal subgroup structure of the connected component of the identity of the unitary group, denoted by $U_A$, resp. of the subgroup of approximately inner automorphisms induced by the connected component of the identity of the unitary group, denoted by $V_A$, in terms of perfect ideals, i.e. ideals admitting no characters. When the unital algebra is locally AF, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between closed normal subgroups of $V_A$ and perfect ideals of the algebra, which can be in the separable case conveniently described using Bratteli diagrams; in particular showing that every closed normal subgroup of $V_A$ is perfect. We also characterize unital $C^*$-algebras $A$ such that $U_A$, resp. $V_A$ are topologically simple, generalizing the main results from [26]. In the other way round, under certain conditions, we characterize simplicity of the algebra in terms of the structure of the unitary group. This in particular applies to reduced group $C^*$-algebras of discrete groups and we show that when $A$ is a reduced group $C^*$-algebra of a non-amenable countable discrete group, then $A$ is simple if and only if $U_A/\mathbb{T}$ is topologically simple.</description>
