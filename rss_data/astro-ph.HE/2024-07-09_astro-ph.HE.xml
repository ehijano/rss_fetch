      <title>High-energy neutrino signatures from pulsar remnants of binary neutron-star mergers: coincident detection prospects with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers are accompanied by multi-messenger emissions, including gravitational wave (GW), neutrino, and electromagnetic signals. Some fraction of BNS mergers may result in a rapidly spinning magnetar as a remnant, which can enhance both the EM and neutrino emissions. In this study, we model the neutrino emissions from such systems and discuss the prospects for detecting the neutrinos coincident with GW signatures. We consider a scenario where a magnetar remnant drives a pulsar wind using its spin energy. The wind interacts with the surrounding kilonova ejecta, forming a nebula filled with non-thermal photons. Ions and nuclei extracted from the magnetar's surface can be accelerated in the polar-cap and the termination-shock regions. We investigate the neutrino fluences resulting from photomeson interactions, where accelerated CR protons interact with the photons in the nebula. Our findings indicate that the peak neutrino fluence is $\sim 10^{-2}\rm GeV~cm^{-2}$ for a source at $40$ Mpc, which is reached approximately $\mathcal{O}( 1-10\ {\rm days})$ post merger. Finally, we examine the potential for GW-triggered stacking searches with IceCube-Gen2 using next-generation GW detectors such as the Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). We conclude that, assuming an optimistic neutrino emission model, a combination of CE+ET would offer a high probability of neutrino detection from these sources within an operational timescale of $\sim 20$ years. In case of non-detection, $2 \sigma$ level constraints on model parameters can be established within similar joint operation timescales.</description>

      <title>Neutrino quantum kinetics in two spatial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in the innermost regions of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers is mostly limited to spherically symmetric configurations that facilitate the numerical solution of the quantum kinetic equations. In this paper, we simulate neutrino quantum kinetics within a (2+1+1) dimensional setup: we model the flavor evolution during neutrino decoupling from matter in two spatial dimensions, one neutrino momentum variable, and time; taking into account non-forward neutral current and charged current collisions of neutrinos with the matter background, as well as neutrino advection. In order to mimic fluctuations in the neutrino emission and matter background, and explore their effect on the flavor evolution, we introduce perturbations in the collision term as well as in the vacuum term of the Hamiltonian. Because of such perturbations, the initial symmetry of the neutrino field across the simulation annulus is broken and flavor conversion is qualitatively affected, with regions of larger flavor conversion alternating across the simulation annulus. In addition, neutrino advection is responsible for spreading flavor waves across neighboring spatial regions. Although based on a simplified setup, our findings highlight the importance of modeling neutrino quantum kinetics in multi-dimensions to assess the impact of neutrinos on the physics of compact astrophysical sources and nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Spindown of Pulsars Interacting with Companion Winds: Impact of Magnetospheric Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a companion wind in neutron star binary systems can form a contact discontinuity well within the pulsar's light cylinder, effectively creating a waveguide that confines the pulsar's electromagnetic fields and significantly alters its spindown. We parametrize this confinement as the ratio between the equatorial position of the contact discontinuity (or standoff distance) $R_\mathrm{m}$ and the pulsar's light cylinder $R_\mathrm{LC}$. We quantify the pulsar spindown for relativistic wind envelopes with $R_\mathrm{m}/R_\mathrm{LC} = 1/3...1$ and varying inclination angles $\chi$ between magnetic and rotation axes using particle-in-cell simulations. Our strongly confined models ($R_\mathrm{m}/R_\mathrm{LC} = 1/3$) identify two distinct limits. For $\chi=0^\circ$, the spindown induced by the compressed pulsar magnetosphere is enhanced by approximately three times compared to an isolated pulsar due to an increased number of open magnetic field lines. Conversely, for $\chi=90^\circ$, the compressed system spins down at less than $40\%$ of the rate of an isolated reference pulsar due to the mismatch between the pulsar wind stripe wavelength and the waveguide size. We directly apply our analysis to the 2.77-second period oblique rotator ($\chi=60^\circ$) in the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039. With the numerically derived spindown estimate, we constrain its surface magnetic field to $B_* \approx (7.3 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{11}$ G. We discuss the time modulation of its period derivative, the effects of compression on its braking index, and implications for the radio eclipse in PSR J0737-3039.</description>

      <title>Science Using Single-Pulse Exploration with Combined Telescopes (SUSPECT) I. The mode-switching, flaring, and single-pulse morphology of PSR B1822-09</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to elucidate the pulsar radio emission by studying several single-pulse phenomena, how they relate to each other, and how they evolve with observing frequency. We intend to inspire models for the pulsar radio emission and fast radio bursts.
  Methods. We set up an observing programme called the SUSPECT project running at the Nancay Radio Observatory telescopes in France (10 - 85 MHz, 110 - 240 MHz, 1 - 3.5 GHz) and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India. In this first paper, we focus on high-sensitivity data obtained of PSR B1822-09 with the uGMRT between 550 and 750 MHz. The pulsar has precursor (PC), main pulse (MP), and interpulse (IP) emission, and exhibits mode-switching. We present its single-pulse stacks, investigate its mode-switching using a hidden Markov switching model, and analyse its single-pulse morphology.
  Results. PSR B1822-09's pulse profile decomposes into seven components. We show that its mode-switching is well described using a hidden Markov switching model. The pulsar exhibits at least three stable emission modes, one of which is a newly discovered bright flaring mode. We confirm that the PC and MP switch synchronously to each other, and both asynchronously to the IP, indicating information transfer between the polar caps. Additionally, we performed a fluctuation spectral analysis and discovered three fluctuation features in its quiescent Q-mode emission, one of which is well known. We conclude that it is longitude-stationary amplitude modulation. Finally, we visually classified the single-pulses into four categories. We found extensive 0.2 - 0.4 ms microstructure in the PC with a typical quasi-periodicity of 0.8 ms. There is low-level PC activity during the Q-mode, indicating mode mixing. We discovered low-intensity square-like pulses and extremely bright pulses in the MP, which suggest bursting.</description>

      <title>A timing view of the additional high-energy spectral component discovered in the black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an energy-dependent analysis for the type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613 using Insight-HXMT observations. We find that the QPO fractional rms at energies above 40 keV is significantly higher than that below 20 keV. This is the first report of a high energy (HE)-rms excess in the rms spectrum of a black hole X-ray binary. In the high energy band, an extra hard component is observed in additional to the standard thermal Comptonization component at similar energy band. The value of the QPO HE-rms excess is not only correlated with the disk parameters and the photon index of the standard Comptonization component, but also exhibits a moderate positive correlation with the flux of the additional hard spectral component. No features in the QPO phase-lag spectra are seen corresponding to the additional hard component. We propose that the additional hard component in the spectrum may originate from jet emission and the associated QPO HE-rms excess can be explained by the precession of the jet base.</description>

      <title>An activity transition in FRB 20201124A: methodological rigor, detection of frequency-dependent cessation, and a geometric magnetar model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report detections of fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the repeating source FRB 20201124A with Apertif/WSRT and GMRT, and measurements of basic burst properties, especially the dispersion measure (DM) and fluence. Based on comparisons of these properties with previously published larger samples, we argue that the excess DM reported earlier for pulses with integrated signal to noise ratio $\lesssim 1000$ is due to incompletely accounting for the so-called sad trombone effect, even when using structure-maximizing DM algorithms. Our investigations of fluence distributions next lead us to advise against formal power-law fitting, especially dissuading the use of the least-square method, and we demonstrate the large biases involved. A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) provides a much more accurate estimate of the power law and we provide accessible code for direct inclusion in future research. Our GMRT observations were fortuitously scheduled around the end of the activity cycle as recorded by FAST. We detected several bursts (one of them very strong) at 400/600 MHz, a few hours after sensitive FAST non-detections already showed the 1.3 GHz FRB emission to have ceased. After FRB 20180916B, this is a second example of a frequency-dependent activity window identified in a repeating FRB source. Since numerous efforts have so-far failed to determine a spin period for FRB 20201124A, we conjecture it to be an ultra-long period magnetar, with a period on the scale of months, and with a very wide, highly irregular duty cycle. Assuming the emission comes from closed field lines, we use radius-to-frequency mapping and polarization information from other studies to constrain the magnetospheric geometry and location of the emission region. Our initial findings are consistent with a possible connection between FRBs and crustal motion events.</description>

      <title>AstroSat Observations of the Dipping Low Mass X-ray Binary XB 1254-690</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XB 1254-690 is a neutron star low-mass X-ray binary with an orbital period of 3.88 hrs, and it exhibits energy-dependent intensity dips, thermonuclear bursts, and flares. We present the results of an analysis of a long observation of this source using the AstroSat satellite. The X-ray light curve gradually changed from a high-intensity flaring state to a low-intensity one with a few dips. The hardness intensity diagram showed that the source is in a high-intensity banana state with a gradually changing flux. Based on this, we divide the observation into four flux levels for a flux-resolved spectral study. The X-ray spectra can be explained by a model consisting of absorption, thermal emission from the disc and non-thermal emission from the corona. From our studies, we detect a correlation between the temperature of the thermal component and the flux and we examine the implications of our results for the accretion disc geometry of this source.</description>

      <title>The role of outflows in black-hole X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot inner flow in black-hole X-ray binaries is not just a static corona rotating around the black hole, but it must be partially outflowing. We have developed a model, in which Comptonization takes place in this outflowing corona. We are able to reproduce quantitatively five observed correlations: a) the time lag as a function of Fourier frequency, b) the time lag as a function of photon energy, c) the time lag as a function of $\Gamma$, d) the time lag as a function of the cut-off energy in the spectrum, and e) the long-standing radio - X-ray correlation. All of them with only two parameters (optical depth and width of the outflow), which vary in the same ranges for all the correlations. Our model does not require a compact, narrow relativistic jet, although its presence does not affect the results. The essential ingredient of our model is the parabolic shape of the Comptonizing corona. The outflow speed also plays a minor role. Furthermore, the bottom of the outflow, in the hard state, looks like a ``slab'' to the incoming soft photons from the disk, and this can explain the observed X-ray polarization, which is along the outflow.</description>

      <title>High-resolution imaging of the evolving bipolar outflows in symbiotic novae: the case of RSOphiuchi 2021 nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recurrent and symbiotic nova RS Ophiuchi (RSOph) underwent a new outburst phase during August 2021, about 15 years after the last event occurred in 2006. This represents the first nova event ever detected at very-high energies (VHE, E&gt;100\,GeV), and a whole set of coordinated multi-wavelength observations were triggered. The main goals of this work are to characterize the evolving morphology of the expanding bipolar ejecta with high accuracy and determine the physical conditions of the surrounding medium in which they propagate. By means of high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio observations, we monitored RSOph with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and e-MERLIN at 1.6 and 5\,GHz during multiple epochs from 14 to 65 days after the explosion. We reveal an evolving source structure, consisting of a central and compact core and two elongated bipolar outflows, expanding on opposite sides from the core in east-west direction. The ejecta angular separation with time is consistent with a linear expansion with an average speed of $\sim7000$ km s$^{-1}$. We find clear evidence of a radial dependence of the density along the density enhancement on the orbital plane (DEOP), going from 1.1$\times$10$^7$ ~cm$^{-3}$ close to the central binary to 3.8$\times$10$^5$~cm$^{-3}$ at $\sim175$~AU. Thanks to the accurate source astrometric position provided by Gaia DR3, in this work we draw a detailed scenario of the geometry and physics of the RSOph evolving source structure after the most recent nova event. We conclude that most of the mass lost by the red giant companion goes in the DEOP, for which we estimate a total mass of $4.3 \times 10^{-6} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and in the circumstellar region, while only a small fraction (about one-tenth) is accreted by the white dwarf.</description>

      <title>Diffusive shock acceleration in relativistic, oblique shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays are charged particles that are accelerated to relativistic speeds by astrophysical shocks. Numerical models have been successful in confirming the acceleration process for (quasi-)parallel shocks, which have the magnetic field aligned with the direction of the shock motion. However, the process is less clear when it comes to (quasi-)perpendicular shocks, where the field makes a large angle with the shock-normal. For such shocks, the angle between the magnetic field and flow ensures that only highly energetic particles can travel upstream at all, reducing the upstream current. This process is further inhibited for relativistic shocks, since the shock can become superluminal when the required particle velocity exceeds the speed of light, effectively inhibiting any upstream particle flow. In order to determine whether such shocks can accelerate particles, we use the particle-in-cell (PIC) method to determine what fraction of particles gets reflected initially at the shock. We then use this as input for a new simulation that combines the PIC method with grid-based magnetohydrodynamics to follow the acceleration (if any) of the particles over a larger time-period in a two-dimensional grid. We find that quasi-perpendicular, relativistic shocks are capable of accelerating particles through the DSA process, provided that the shock has a sufficiently high Alfvenic Mach number.</description>

      <title>INTEGRAL/IBIS polarization detection in the hard and soft intermediate states of Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft gamma-ray emission (100 keV -- 10 MeV) has previously been detected in the hard state of several microquasars. In some sources, this emission was found to be highly polarized and was suggested to be emitted at the base of the jet. Until now, no $\gamma$-ray polarization had been found in any other state. Using INTEGRAL/IBIS, we studied the soft gamma-ray spectral and polarization properties of Swift J1727.8-1613 throughout its outburst. We detect a highly polarized spectral component in both the hard intermediate state and the early stages of the soft intermediate state above 210 keV. In the hard intermediate state, the polarization angle significantly deviates from the compact jet angle projected onto the sky, whereas in the soft intermediate they are closely aligned. This constitutes the first detection of jet-aligned polarization in the soft gamma-ray for a microquasar. We attribute this polarized spectral component to synchrotron emission from the jet, which indicates that some of the jet might persist into the softer states.</description>

      <title>Fermi-LAT discovery of the GeV emission of the superluminous supernovae SN 2017egm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a new class of transients with luminosities $\sim10 -100$ times larger than the usual core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Their origin is still unclear and one widely discussed scenario involves a millisecond magnetar central engine. The GeV-TeV emission of SLSNe has been predicted in the literature but has not been convincingly detected yet. Here we report the search for the $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of SN 2017egm, one of the closest SLSNe detected so far, with the 15-year {\it Fermi}-LAT Pass 8 data. There is a transient $\gamma$-ray source appearing about 2 months after this event and lasting a few months. Both the peak time and the luminosity of the GeV emission are consistent with the magnetar model prediction, suggesting that such a GeV transient is the high-energy counterpart of SN 2017egm and the central engine of this SLSNe is a young magnetar.</description>

      <title>Distribution of the number of peaks within a long gamma-ray burst: The full Fermi/GBM catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The dissipation process responsible for the long gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission and the kind of dynamics that drives the release of energy as a function of time are still key open issues. We recently found that the distribution of the number of peaks per GRB is described by a mixture of two exponentials, suggesting the existence of two behaviours that turn up as peak-rich and peak-poor time profiles.
  Aims. Our aims are to study the distribution of the number of peaks per GRB of the entire catalogue of about 3000 GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and to make a comparison with previous results obtained from other catalogues.
  Methods. We identified GRB peaks using the MEPSA code and modelled the resulting distribution following the same procedure that was adopted in the previous analogous investigation.
  Results. We confirm that only a mixture of two exponentials can model the distribution satisfactorily, with model parameters that fully agree with those found from previous analyses. In particular, we confirm that (21 +- 4)% of the observed GRBs are peak-rich (8 +- 1 peaks per GRB on average), while the remaining 80% are peak-poor (2.12 +- 0.10 peaks per GRB on average).
  Conclusions. We confirm the existence of two different components, peak-poor and peak-rich GRBs, that make up the observed GRB populations. Together with previous analogous results from other GRB catalogues, these results provide compelling evidence that GRB prompt emission is governed by two distinct regimes.</description>

      <title>A Swift X-ray view of the SMS4 sample -- II: X-ray properties of 17 bright radio sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a proposal to observe 18 bright radio sources from the SMS4 catalog with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (hereafter Swift), we obtained X-ray observations of 17 targets (one target was not observed). Following up our first paper that discussed 31 sources (see Maselli et al. 2022; 20 sources detected as point sources and one very extended source), we present results for this final sample of 17 radio sources, that previously lacked dedicated, pointed narrow FOV X-ray observations. One of these 17 sources, undetected by Swift due to a very short exposure, was instead detected by eROSITA, and given in the Data Release 1 (DR1) Catalog. No 1eRASS source was found in the DR1 for the remaining source, unobserved by Swift. The new Swift observations led to eleven X-ray source detections in the 0.3-10 keV band and six upper limits. We investigated the extent of the X-ray emission, the hardness ratio, and when statistics allowed we carried out a spectral analysis. The X-ray emission of eight sources is consistent with point-like emission, while three sources show clear evidence of extent, each with peculiar properties. We used the X-ray determined positions and uncertainties of the twelve detected sources to establish associations with infrared and optical sources from the AllWISE and the GSC 2.4.2 catalogs. Requiring a detection in both the infrared and the optical bands to establish a candidate counterpart for our X-ray detections, we identify counterparts for all twelve sources. We discuss the interesting structure of MRC B0344-345 and PKS B2148-555, two of the six extended X-ray sources that we detected in both our Swift campaigns, and suggest they are very promising for further X-ray and radio investigations. For the 38 SMS4 sources that lack pointed, narrow FOV X-ray telescope observations, after our Swift campaigns, we list 18 likely counterparts from the eROSITA DR1 catalog.</description>

      <title>Black hole spin-down via cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings that are attached to rapidly spinning black holes can extract significant amounts of rotational energy and angular momentum. Here we study the effect on primordial black holes, which are expected to form with one or more cosmic strings attached. Although large primordial black holes are predicted to rapidly spin up due to accretion soon after forming, we argue that cosmic strings will spin them down again. As a result, the spins of primordial black holes should consequently be observed to be near zero. We also investigate the effect on a supermassive black hole of capturing a cosmic string and the possibility of observing the subsequent spin down by its effect on a pulsar orbiting the black hole.</description>

      <title>Effective-one-body waveform model for noncircularized, planar, coalescing black hole binaries II: high accuracy by improving logarithmic terms in resummations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective-one-body (EOB) models are based on analytical building blocks that, mathematically, are truncated Taylor series with logarithms. These polynomials are usually resummed using Pad\'e approximants obtained first assuming that the logarithms are constant, and then replacing them back into the resulting rational functions. A recent study pointed out that this procedure introduces spurious logarithmic terms when the resummed functions are reexpanded. We therefore explore analytically more consistent resummation schemes. Here we update the TEOBResumS-Dali waveform model for spin-aligned, noncircularized, coalescing black hole binaries by systematically implementing new (still Pad\'e based) resummations for all EOB functions. Once the model is informed by 51 Numerical Relativity simulations this new approach proves key in lowering the maximum EOB/NR unfaithfulness $\bar{F}_{\rm EOBNR}^{\rm max}$ for the $\ell=m=2$ mode (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range $10-200M_{\odot}$) over the whole Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog of 534 waveforms. A median mismatch of $3.418\times 10^{-4}$ is achieved, which is a marked improvement on the previous value, $1.06\times 10^{-3}$. The largest value, $\bar{\cal F}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR}\sim 10^{-2}$, is found for an equal-mass, equal-spin simulation with dimensionless spins $\sim +0.994$; only six configurations (all equal-mass, and with equal spins larger than $+0.97$) are above $5\times 10^{-3}$. Results for eccentric binaries are similarly excellent (well below $10^{-2}$ and mostly around $10^{-3}$). For scattering configurations, we find an unprecedented EOB/NR agreement ($&lt;1\%$) for relatively small values of the scattering angle, though differences progressively increase as the threshold of immediate capture is approached.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrinos From Millicharged Dark Matter Annihilation in the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millicharged dark matter particles can be efficiently captured by the Sun, where they annihilate into tau leptons, leading to the production of high-energy neutrinos. In contrast to the Earth, the high temperature of the Sun suppresses the fraction of millicharged particles that are bound to nuclei, allowing for potentially high annihilation rates. We recast existing constraints from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and use this information to place new limits on the fraction of the dark matter that is millicharged. This analysis excludes previously unexplored parameter space for masses of $m_\chi \sim (5-100) \ \text{GeV}$, charges of $q_\chi \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$, and fractional abundances as small as $f_{_\text{DM}} \sim 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Challenging the AGN scenario for JWST/NIRSpec broad H$\alpha$ emitters/Little Red Dots in light of non-detection of NIRCam photometric variability and X-ray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has uncovered a substantial population of high-$z$ ($z \gtrsim 4$) galaxies exhibiting broad H$\alpha$ emission line with a Full Width at Half Maximum exceeding $1,000$~km~s$^{-1}$. This population includes a subset known as 'Little Red Dots', characterized by their compact morphology and extremely red rest-frame optical colors. If all of these broad H$\alpha$ emitters were attributed to type $1-1.9$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of five JWST broad H$\alpha$ emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data ($\sim 400-500$~days$/(1+z)$) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of $\lambda_{\text{rest}} \sim 1,500-9,000$\AA\ has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep {\it Chandra} data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either ($a$) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, ($b$) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or ($c$) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, ($d$) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.</description>

      <title>Structural Implications of the Chameleon Mechanism on White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of the chameleon mechanism on the structure of white dwarfs. Using a shooting method of our design, we solve the corresponding scalar-tensor equilibrium equations for a Chandrasekhar equation of state, exploring various energy scales and couplings of the chameleon field to matter. We find the chameleon field to be in a thick-shell configuration, identifying for the first time in the literature a similarity relation for the radially normalised scalar field gradient. Our analysis reveals that the chameleon mechanism significantly alters the internal pressure of white dwarfs, leading to a notable reduction in the stellar radii and masses and shifting the mass-radius curves below those predicted by Newtonian gravity. Finally, we derive parametric expressions from our results to expedite future analyses of white dwarfs in scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Velocity-Resolved Ionization Mapping of Broad Line Region. I. Insights into Diverse Geometry and Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) originate from the broad-line region (BLR), consisting of dense gas clouds in orbit around an accreting supermassive black hole. Understanding the geometry and kinematics of the region is crucial for gaining insights into the physics and evolution of AGNs. Conventional velocity-resolved reverberation mapping may face challenges in disentangling the degeneracy between intricate motion and geometry of this region. To address this challenge, new key constraints are required. Here, we report the discovery of an asymmetric BLR using a novel technique: velocity-resolved ionization mapping, which can map the distance of emitting gas clouds by measuring Hydrogen line ratios at different velocities. By analyzing spectroscopic monitoring data, we find that the Balmer decrement is anticorrelated with the continuum and correlated with the lags across broad emission line velocities. Some line ratio profiles deviate from the expectations for a symmetrically virialized BLR, suggesting that the red-shifted and blue-shifted gas clouds may not be equidistant from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This asymmetric geometry might represent a formation imprint, provide new perspectives on the evolution of AGNs, and influence SMBH mass measurements.</description>

      <title>Surface and curvature tensions of cold dense quark matter: a term-by-term analysis within the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a thorough investigation of the surface and curvature tensions, $\sigma$ and $\gamma$, of three-flavor cold quark matter using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with vector interactions. Our approach ensures both local and global electric charge neutrality, as well as chemical equilibrium under weak interactions. By employing the multiple reflection expansion formalism to account for finite size effects, we explore the impact of specific input parameters, particularly the vector coupling constant ratio $\eta_V$, the radius $R$ of quark matter droplets, as well as charge-per-baryon ratio $\xi$ of the finite size configurations. We focus on the role of the contributions of each term of the NJL Lagrangian to the surface and curvature tensions in the mean field approximation. We find that the total surface tension exhibits two different density regimes: it remains roughly constant at around $100 \, \mathrm{MeV \, fm^{-2}}$ up to approximately $2-4$ times the nuclear saturation density, and beyond this point, it becomes a steeply increasing function of $n_B$. The total surface and curvature tensions are relatively insensitive to variations in $R$ but are affected by changes in $\xi$ and $\eta_V$. We observe that the largest contribution to $\sigma$ and $\gamma$ comes from the regularized divergent term, making these quantities significantly higher than those obtained within the MIT bag model.</description>

      <title>Common origin of black holes in high mass X-ray binaries and in gravitation-wave sources</title>

Abstract: BH HMXB systems are likely the progenitors of the BH-BH mergers detected in gravitational waves by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK). Yet merging BHs reach higher masses (~ $100 M_{\odot}$) than BHs in HMXBs ($\sim 20M_{\odot}$) and have typically lower spins ($a_{\rm BH}\lesssim 0.25$ with a larger values tail) than often claimed for BH in HMXBs ($a_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 0.9$). This could suggest that these two classes of systems belong to different populations, but we show here that this does not have to be the case. The difference in masses is easily explained as the known HMXB-BHs are in galaxies with relatively high metallicity, so their progenitor stars are subject to strong mass loss from winds, leading to relatively low mass BH at core collapse. But LVK can also detect BHs from low-metallicity galaxies that naturally produce more massive stellar-origin BHs. However, a difference in spin is more difficult to explain. Models with efficient angular momentum transport in stellar interiors produces slowly spinning progenitors of both LVK and HMXB BHs. Known HMXBs have orbital periods too long for efficient tidal spin-up, and are also unlikely to have undergone significant accretion spin-up. We show that the derived value of the BH spin depends strongly on how the HMXB accretion disc emission is modelled. We argue that since Cyg X-1 is never observed to be in a soft spectral state, the appropriate spectral models must take into account the Comptonization of the disc photosphere. We show that such models {are consistent with low spin values: $a_{\rm BH}\sim 0.1$.} This has been confirmed recently by other teams for both Cyg X-1 and LMC X-1, and we show this is also the case for M33 X-7. We conclude that all known HMXB BHs can have low spin, in accordance with the results of stellar evolution models. Hence, current observations are consistent with LVK BHs and HMXB BHs belonging to the same population.</description>

      <title>Magnetized tori with magnetic polarization around Kerr black holes: Variable angular momentum discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytical models of magnetized, geometrically thick disks are relevant to understand the physical conditions of plasma around compact objects and to explore its emitting properties. This has become increasingly important in recent years in the light of the Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A$^*$ and M87. Models of thick disks around black holes usually consider constant angular momentum distributions and do not take into account the magnetic response of the fluid to applied magnetic fields. We present a generalization of our previous work on stationary models of magnetized accretion disks with magnetic polarization (Pimentel et al. 2018). This extension is achieved by accounting for non-constant specific angular momentum profiles, done through a two-parameter ansatz for those distributions. We build a large number of new equilibrium solutions of thick disks with magnetic polarization around Kerr black holes, selecting suitable parameter values within the intrinsically substantial parameter space of the models. We study the morphology and the physical properties of those solutions, finding qualitative changes with respect to the constant angular momentum tori solutions (Pimentel et al. 2018). However, the dependences found on the angular momentum distribution or on the black hole spin do not seem to be strong. Some of the new solutions, however, exhibit a local maximum of the magnetization function, absent in standard magnetized tori. Due to the enhanced development of the magneto-rotational instability as a result of magnetic susceptibility, those models might be particularly well-suited to investigate jet formation through general-relativistic MHD simulations. The new equilibrium solutions reported here can be used as initial data in numerical codes to assess the impact of magnetic susceptibility in the dynamics and observational properties of black hole-thick disk systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observability of afterglows from binary neutron star mergers, occurring within AGN disks is investigated. We perform 3D GRMHD simulations of a post-merger system, and follow the jet launched from the compact object. We use semi-analytic techniques to study the propagation of the blast wave powered by the jet through an AGN disk-like external environment, extending to distances beyond the disk scale height. The synchrotron emission produced by the jet-driven forward shock is calculated to obtain the afterglow emission. The observability of this emission at different frequencies is assessed by comparing it to the quiescent AGN emission. In the scenarios where the afterglow could temporarily outshine the AGN, we find that detection will be more feasible at higher frequencies (&gt; 10^(14) Hz) and the electromagnetic counterpart could manifest as a fast variability in the AGN emission, on timescales less than a day.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observed $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) 221009A using very long baseline interferomety (VLBI) with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), over a period spanning from 40 to 262 days after the initial GRB. The high angular resolution (mas) of our observations allowed us, for the second time ever, after GRB 030329, to measure the projected size, $s$, of the relativistic shock caused by the expansion of the GRB ejecta into the surrounding medium. Our observations support the expansion of the shock with a $&gt;4\sigma$-equivalent significance, and confirm its relativistic nature by revealing an apparently superluminal expansion rate. Fitting a power law expansion model, $s\propto t^a$, to the observed size evolution, we find a slope $a=0.69^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$. Fitting the data at each frequency separately, we find different expansion rates, pointing to a frequency-dependent behaviour. We show that the observed size evolution can be reconciled with a reverse shock plus forward shock, provided that the two shocks dominate the emission at different frequencies and, possibly, at different times.</description>

      <title>Pulse frequency variations and timing noise of MXB 0656-072 during the 2007-2008 type I outbursts and implications for its magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to explore the properties of the Be/X-ray binary system MXB 0656-072 from a timing analysis perspective through an investigation of the RXTE/PCA and Fermi/GBM data during its 2007-2008 type I outbursts. We applied two new techniques, for the first time, along with the conventional Deeter method to produce higher-resolution power density spectra (PDS) of the torque fluctuations. We also investigated the spin frequency evolution of the source by utilising a pulse timing technique. The PDSs show a red noise pattern, with a steepness of $\Gamma \sim -2$ and a saturation timescale of $\sim$150 d, indicating that MXB 0656-072 is a disc-fed source. With the obtained long term spin frequency evolution, we reveal the torque-luminosity correlation of MXB 0656-072 for the first time. We also demonstrate that the frequency evolution is largely consistent with the Ghosh-Lamb model. In the RXTE/PCA observations, the pulsed emission disappears below $\sim$5$\times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, while the profiles remain stable above this value in our analysis time frame. We show that the magnetic field strength deduced from the torque model is compatible with the field strength of the pulsar derived from the cyclotron resonance scattering feature. Utilising the new distance of MXB 0656-072 measured by Gaia, we show that the spectral transition of MXB 0656-072 occurs at a luminosity that matches the expected theoretical transition from the subcritical to supercritical accretion regime.</description>

While central hot coronae are proposed as the primary neutrino production site, the exact coronal cosmic-ray energy budget has been loosely constrained. In this study, we propose a new stringent upper bound on the coronal cosmic-ray energy budget of Seyfert galaxies, considering both accretion dynamics and observed properties of radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies. Notably, even under the calorimetric condition where cosmic rays lose all their energies, our limit indicates that the coronal neutrino flux of NGC~1068 is about an order of magnitude fainter than the observed levels. This discrepancy suggests the need for further theoretical and observational investigations on the IceCube signals from Seyfert galaxies.</description>

      <title>Can we identify primordial black holes? Tidal tests for subsolar-mass gravitational-wave observations</title>

Abstract: The detection of a subsolar object in a compact binary merger is regarded as one of the smoking gun signatures of a population of primordial black holes~(PBHs). We critically assess whether these systems could be distinguished from stellar binaries, for example composed of white dwarfs or neutron stars, which could also populate the subsolar mass range. At variance with PBHs, the gravitational-wave signal from stellar binaries is affected by tidal effects, which dramatically grow for moderately compact stars as those expected in the subsolar range. We forecast the capability of constraining tidal effects of putative subsolar neutron star binaries with current and future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivities as well as next-generation experiments. We show that, should LVK O4 run observe subsolar neutron-star mergers, it could measure the (large) tidal effects with high significance. In particular, for subsolar neutron-star binaries, O4 and O5 projected sensitivities would allow measuring the effect of tidal disruption on the waveform in a large portion of the parameter space, also constraining the tidal deformability at ${\cal O}(10\%)$ level, thus excluding a primordial origin of the binary. Vice versa, for subsolar PBH binaries, model-agnostic upper bounds on the tidal deformability can rule out neutron stars or more exotic competitors. Assuming events similar to the subthreshold candidate SSM200308 reported in LVK O3b data are PBH binaries, O4 projected sensitivity would allow ruling out the presence of neutron-star tidal effects at $\approx 3 \sigma$ C.L., thus strengthening the PBH hypothesis. Future experiments would lead to even stronger ($&gt;5\sigma$) conclusions on potential discoveries of this kind.</description>

      <title>Impact of unmodeled eccentricity on the tidal deformability measurement and implications for gravitational wave physics inference</title>

Abstract: With the expected large number of binary neutron star (BNS) observations through gravitational waves (GWs), third-generation GW detectors, Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), will be able to constrain the tidal deformability, and hence the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star (NS) with exquisite precision. A subset of the detected BNS systems can retain residual eccentricity in the detector frequency band. We study the systematic errors due to unmodeled eccentricity in the tidal deformability measurement and its implications for NS EoS and redshift measurement via the Love siren method. We find that the systematic errors in the tidal deformability parameter exceed the statistical errors at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ ($\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$) at $10$Hz reference GW frequency for CE (ET). We show that these biases on tidal deformability parameter can significantly bias the NS EoS inference. Furthermore, the error on tidal deformability propagates to the source frame NS mass, which in turn biases the redshift inference. For CE, the redshift inference is significantly biased at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ (at a reference frequency of $10$Hz). We also study the implications of biased tidal deformability in testing the Kerr nature of black holes. Systematic error on the tidal deformability parameter leads to a non-zero value of tidal deformability for binary black holes, indicating a false deviation from the Kerr nature. Finally, we show that including eccentricity in the waveform model increases the statistical errors in tidal deformability measurement by a factor of $\lesssim 2$. Our study, therefore, highlights the importance of using accurate eccentric waveform models for GW parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Atmosphere-Skimming Cosmic-Ray Showers in High-Altitude Experiments</title>

Abstract: Atmosphere-skimming showers are initiated by cosmic rays with incoming directions such that the full development of the cascade occurs inside the atmosphere without ever reaching the ground. This new class of showers has been observed in balloon-borne experiments such as ANITA, but a characterisation of their properties is lacking. The interplay between the Earth's magnetic field, the long distances over which atmosphere-skimming showers develop, and the low density of the atmosphere they traverse gives rise to several effects that are not seen in downward-going cascades, and require detailed modeling. In this article, we used the latest version of the ZHAireS-RASPASS shower simulation program to tackle this problem, and dwell on the particular phenomena that arises from the peculiar environment on which these showers develop. We focus in particular on the properties of the longitudinal profile of the shower and its fluctuations as a function of cosmic-ray energy, direction and primary mass. We have also studied the phase-space of cosmic-ray arrival directions where detection in high-altitude experiments is more likely, and have found that only in a small range of directions the showers are sufficiently developed before reaching the altitude of the detector. Our results are relevant for the design of high-altitude and in particular balloon-borne experiments, and for the interpretation of the data they collect.</description>

      <title>Applying the starquake model to study the formation of elastic mountains on spinning neutron stars</title>

Abstract: When a neutron star is spun-up or spun-down, the changing strains in its solid elastic crust can give rise to sudden fractures known as starquakes. Early interest in starquakes focused on their possible connection to pulsar glitches. While modern glitch models rely on pinned superfluid vorticity rather than crustal fracture, starquakes may nevertheless play a role in the glitch mechanism. Recently, there has been interest in the issue of starquakes resulting in non-axisymmetric shape changes, potentially linking the quake phenomenon to the building of neutron star mountains, which would then produce continuous gravitational waves. Motivated by this issue, we present a simple model that extends the energy minimisation-based calculations, originally developed to model axisymmetric glitches, to also include non-axisymmetric shape changes. We show that the creation of a mountain in a quake necessarily requires a change in the axisymmetric shape too. We apply our model to the specific problem of the spin-up of an initially non-rotating star, and estimate the maximum mountain that can be built in such a process, subject only to the constraints of energy and angular momentum conservation.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrino-DM interactions with Milky Way dwarf spheroidals and supernova neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain the neutrino-dark matter cross section using properties of the dark matter density profiles of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The constraint arises from core-collapse supernova neutrinos scattering on dark matter as a form of energy injection, allowing the transformation of the dark matter density profile from a cusped profile to a flatter profile. We assume a standard cosmology of dark energy and cold, collisionless, and non-self-interacting dark matter. By requiring that the dark matter cores do not lose too much mass or overshoot constraints from stellar kinematics, we place an upper limit on the cross section of $\sigma_{\nu-\mathrm{DM}}(E_\nu=15 \, \mathrm{MeV}, m_\chi\lesssim130 \, \mathrm{GeV}) \approx 3.4 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{cm^2}$ and $\sigma_{\nu-\mathrm{DM}}(E_\nu=15 \, \mathrm{MeV}, m_\chi\gtrsim130 \, \mathrm{GeV}) \approx 3.2 \times 10^{-27} \left( \frac{m_\chi}{1\,\mathrm{GeV}}\right)^2\, \mathrm{cm^2}$, which is stronger than previous bounds for these energies. Consideration of baryonic feedback or host galaxy effects on the dark matter profile can strengthen this constraint.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Induced Low-Mass Gap Black Hole Echoing LVK Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves from a binary merger involving a potential low-mass gap black hole (LMBH) by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration motivates investigations into mechanisms beyond conventional stellar evolution theories to account for their existence. We study a mechanism in which dark matter (DM), through its capture and accumulation inside main sequence stars, induces the formation of black holes within the mass range of $[3, 5]M_\odot$. We examine the distribution of these LMBHs as a function of galaxy halo mass, particularly when paired with neutron stars. This gives a distinct signature that can be tested with future gravitational wave observations. We find that a viable portion of the DM parameter space predicts a merger rate of such binaries consistent with LVK observations.</description>

      <title>From Seeds to Supermassive Black Holes: Capture, Growth, Migration, and Pairing in Dense Proto-Bulge Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origins and mergers of supermassive black holes (BHs) remain a mystery. We describe a scenario from a novel multi-physics simulation featuring rapid ($\lesssim 1\,$Myr) hyper-Eddington gas capture by a $\sim 1000\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ ``seed'' BH up to supermassive ($\gtrsim 10^{6}\,M_{\odot}$) masses, in a massive, dense molecular cloud complex typical of high-redshift starbursts. Due to the high cloud density, stellar feedback is inefficient and most of the gas turns into stars in star clusters which rapidly merge hierarchically, creating deep potential wells. Relatively low-mass BH seeds at random positions can be ``captured'' by merging sub-clusters and migrate to the center in $\sim1$ free-fall time (vastly faster than dynamical friction). This also efficiently produces a paired BH binary with $\sim 0.1$\,pc separation. The centrally-concentrated stellar density profile (akin to a ``proto-bulge'') allows the cluster as a whole to capture and retain gas and build up a large (pc-scale) circum-binary accretion disk with gas coherently funnelled to the central BH (even when the BH radius of influence is small). The disk is ``hyper-magnetized'' and ``flux-frozen'': dominated by a toroidal magnetic field with plasma $\beta \sim 10^{-3}$, with the fields amplified by flux-freezing. This drives hyper-Eddington inflow rates $\gtrsim 1\,\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$, which also drive the two BHs to nearly-equal masses. The late-stage system appears remarkably similar to recently-observed high-redshift ``little red dots.'' This scenario can provide an explanation for rapid SMBH formation, growth and mergers in high-redshift galaxies.</description>
