      <title>Testing stimulated emission photon direction</title>

Abstract: While naively laser only causes excitation of external target, for example STED microscopy demonstrates it can also cause its deexitation, however, under uncommon condition of being prepared as excited. These two causalities are governed by stimulated emission-absorption pair of equations, and swap places in perspective of CPT symmetry, however, it means photon direction of stimulated emission should be opposite to usually assumed. This article discusses various arguments and proposes simple STED-like tests to experimentally determine stimulated emission photon direction(s) once for all, possibly both, to be performed in a near future, already having indirect experimental evidence, like lack of Rabi cycle for free electron laser, or recent "negative time evidence" experiment in the news. Depending on its result: it should lead to new applications like 2WQC more symmetric quantum computers, or macroscopic violation of CPT symmetry, so far probably tested only in microscopic settings. Also proposed forward/backward/bidirectional photon sources are discussed.</description>
