      <title>Diffusion Mechanism Design in Tree-Structured Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a fixed-price auction mechanism for a seller to sell multiple items in a tree-structured market. The buyers have independently drawn valuation from a uniform distribution, and the seller would like to incentivize buyers to invite more people to the auction. We prove that our mechanism is individual rational, and incentivize compatible with regard to the buyers' action. Furthermore, we show the approximation ratio of our mechanism to the optimal fixed-price auction in two ways, theoretically and via Monte-Carlo simulation, and show a high practical ratio. Finally, we discuss several factors affecting the behavior of our mechanism and its feasibility in reality.</description>

      <title>Decentralized and Uncoordinated Learning of Stable Matchings: A Game-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning stable matchings in a fully decentralized and uncoordinated manner. In this problem, there are $n$ men and $n$ women, each having preference over the other side. It is assumed that women know their preferences over men, but men are not aware of their preferences over women, and they only learn them if they propose and successfully get matched to women. A matching is called stable if no man and woman prefer each other over their current matches. When all the preferences are known a priori, the celebrated Deferred-Acceptance algorithm proposed by Gale and Shapley provides a decentralized and uncoordinated algorithm to obtain a stable matching. However, when the preferences are unknown, developing such an algorithm faces major challenges due to a lack of coordination. We achieve this goal by making a connection between stable matchings and learning Nash equilibria (NE) in noncooperative games. First, we provide a complete information game formulation for the stable matching problem with known preferences such that its set of pure NE coincides with the set of stable matchings, while its mixed NE can be rounded in a decentralized manner to a stable matching. Relying on such a game-theoretic formulation, we show that for hierarchical markets, adopting the exponential weight (EXP) learning algorithm for the stable matching game achieves logarithmic regret with polynomial dependence on the number of players, thus answering a question posed in previous literature. Moreover, we show that the same EXP learning algorithm converges locally and exponentially fast to a stable matching in general matching markets. We complement this result by introducing another decentralized and uncoordinated learning algorithm that globally converges to a stable matching with arbitrarily high probability, leveraging the weak acyclicity property of the stable matching game.</description>

      <title>Games in Public Announcement: How to Reduce System Losses in Optimistic Blockchain Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Announcement games, where information is disseminated by announcers and challenged by validators, are prevalent in real-world scenarios. Validators take effort to verify the validity of the announcements, gaining rewards for successfully challenging invalid ones, while receiving nothing for valid ones. Optimistic Rollup, a Layer 2 blockchain scaling solution, exemplifies such games, offering significant improvements in transaction throughput and cost efficiency. We present a game-theoretic model of announcement games to analyze the potential behaviors of announcers and validators. We identify all Nash equilibria and study the corresponding system losses for different Nash equilibria. Additionally, we analyze the impact of various system parameters on system loss under the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we provide suggestions for mechanism optimization to reduce system losses.</description>

      <title>Robust Restaking Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the risks of validator reuse across multiple services in a restaking protocol. We characterize the robust security of a restaking network as a function of the buffer between the costs and profits from attacks. For example, our results imply that if attack costs always exceed attack profits by 10\%, then a sudden loss of .1\% of the overall stake (e.g., due to a software error) cannot result in the ultimate loss of more than 1.1\% of the overall stake. We also provide local analogs of these overcollateralization conditions and robust security guarantees that apply specifically for a target service or coalition of services. All of our bounds on worst-case stake loss are the best possible. Finally, we bound the maximum-possible length of a cascade of attacks.
  Our results suggest measures of robustness that could be exposed to the participants in a restaking protocol. We also suggest polynomial-time computable sufficient conditions that can proxy for these measures.</description>

      <title>Lattice operations for the stable set in substitutable matching markets via re-equilibration dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the lattice operations for the (pairwise) stable set in two-sided matching markets where only substitutability on agents' choice functions is imposed. To do this, we use Tarski operators defined on the lattices of worker-quasi-stable and firm-quasi-stable matchings. These operators resemble lay-off and vacancy chain dynamics, respectively. First, we compute the lattice operations in the many-to-one model. Then, we extend these operations to a many-to-many model with substitutable choice functions on one side and responsive preferences on the other, via a morphism that relates many-to-one with many-to-many matchings in a natural way. Finally, we present the lattice operations in the many-to-many model with substitutable choice functions on both sides.</description>

      <title>Reward Schemes and Committee Sizes in Proof of Stake Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of reward schemes and committee sizes motivated by governance systems over blockchain communities. We introduce a model for elections with a binary outcome space where there is a ground truth (i.e., a "correct" outcome), and where stakeholders can only choose to delegate their voting power to a set of delegation representatives (DReps). Moreover, the effort (cost) invested by each DRep positively influences both (i) her ability to vote correctly and (ii) the total delegation that she attracts, thereby increasing her voting power. This model constitutes the natural counterpart of delegated proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, where delegated stakes are used to elect the block builders.
  As a way to motivate the representatives to exert effort, a reward scheme can be used based on the delegation attracted by each DRep. We analyze both the game-theoretic aspects and the optimization counterpart of this model. Our primary focus is on selecting a committee that maximizes the probability of reaching the correct outcome, given a fixed monetary budget allocated for rewarding the delegates. Our findings provide insights into the design of effective reward mechanisms and optimal committee structures (i.e., how many DReps are enough) in these PoS-like governance systems.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game selection creates cooperative environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of collective cooperation in competitive environments is a well-known phenomenon in biology, economics, and social systems. While most evolutionary game models focus on the evolution of strategies for a fixed game, how strategic decisions coevolve with the environment has so far mostly been overlooked. Here, we consider a game selection model where not only the strategies but also the game can change over time following evolutionary principles. Our results show that coevolutionary dynamics of games and strategies can induce novel collective phenomena, fostering the emergence of cooperative environments. When the model is taken on structured populations the architecture of the interaction network can significantly amplify pro-social behavior, with a critical role played by network heterogeneity and the presence of clustered groups of similar players, distinctive features observed in real-world populations. By unveiling the link between the evolution of strategies and games for different structured populations, our model sheds new light on the origin of social dilemmas ubiquitously observed in real-world social systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Concave-Utility Reinforcement Learning is Inverse Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider inverse reinforcement learning problems with concave utilities. Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning (CURL) is a generalisation of the standard RL objective, which employs a concave function of the state occupancy measure, rather than a linear function. CURL has garnered recent attention for its ability to represent instances of many important applications including the standard RL such as imitation learning, pure exploration, constrained MDPs, offline RL, human-regularized RL, and others. Inverse reinforcement learning is a powerful paradigm that focuses on recovering an unknown reward function that can rationalize the observed behaviour of an agent. There has been recent theoretical advances in inverse RL where the problem is formulated as identifying the set of feasible reward functions. However, inverse RL for CURL problems has not been considered previously. In this paper we show that most of the standard IRL results do not apply to CURL in general, since CURL invalidates the classical Bellman equations. This calls for a new theoretical framework for the inverse CURL problem. Using a recent equivalence result between CURL and Mean-field Games, we propose a new definition for the feasible rewards for I-CURL by proving that this problem is equivalent to an inverse game theory problem in a subclass of mean-field games. We present initial query and sample complexity results for the I-CURL problem under assumptions such as Lipschitz-continuity. Finally, we outline future directions and applications in human--AI collaboration enabled by our results.</description>
