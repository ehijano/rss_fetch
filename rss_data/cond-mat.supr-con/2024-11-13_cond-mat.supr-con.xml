      <title>Topological versus conventional superconductivity in a Weyl semimetal: A microscopic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic model for the particle-particle interactions in a Weyl semimetal, we analyzed the possibility for conventional as well as monopole Cooper pairing between quasiparticle excitations at the same (intra-nodal) or opposite (inter-nodal) Weyl nodes. We derived a coupled system of self-consistent BCS-like equations, where the angular dependence of the pairings is directly determined from the microscopic interaction symmetries. We studied the competition between conventional and monopole superconducting phases, thus obtaining explicitly the phase diagrams from the microscopic interaction model parameters. We determined the critical temperatures for both phases, and the low temperature critical behavior, including the specific heat, that we suggest as possible experimental probe for topological quantum criticality in Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Diverse Manifestations of Electron-Phonon Coupling in a Kagome Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments on a kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ revealed distinct multimodal dispersion kinks and nodeless superconducting gaps across multiple electron bands. The prominent photoemission kinks suggest a definitive coupling between electrons and certain collective modes, yet the precise nature of this interaction and its connection to superconductivity remain to be established. Here, employing the state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} many-body perturbation theory computation, we present direct evidence that electron-phonon ($e$-ph) coupling induces the multimodal photoemission kinks in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and profoundly, drives the nodeless $s$-wave superconductivity, showcasing the diverse manifestations of the $e$-ph coupling. Our calculations well capture the experimentally measured kinks and their fine structures, and reveal that vibrations from different atomic species dictate the multimodal behavior. Results from anisotropic $GW$-Eliashberg equations predict a phonon-mediated superconductivity with nodeless $s$-wave gaps, in excellent agreement with various ARPES and scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. Despite of the universal origin from the $e$-ph coupling, the contributions of several characteristic phonon vibrations vary in different phenomena, highlighting a versatile role of $e$-ph coupling in shaping the low-energy excitations of kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Ising superconductivity in the bulk incommensurate layered material (PbS)$_{1.13}$(TaS$_2$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting the spin-valley degree of freedom of electrons in materials is a promising avenue for energy-efficient information storage and quantum computing. A key challenge in utilizing spin-valley polarization is the realization of spin-valley locking in bulk systems. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the noncentrosymmetric bulk misfit compound (PbS)$_{1.13}$(TaS$_2$), showing a strong spin-valley locking. Our investigation reveals Ising superconductivity with a transition temperature of 3.14 K, closely matching that of a monolayer of TaS$_2$. Notably, the absence of charge density wave (CDW) signatures in transport measurements suggests that the PbS layers primarily act as spacers between the dichalcogenide monolayers.
  This is further supported by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which shows negligible interlayer coupling, a lack of dispersion along the $k_{\perp}$ direction and significant charge transfer from the PbS to the TaS$_2$ layers. Spin resolved ARPES shows strong spin-valley locking of the electronic bands.
  Muon spin rotation experiments conducted in the vortex phase reveal an isotropic superconducting gap. However, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field and low-temperature specific heat measurements suggest the possibility of multigap superconductivity.
  These findings underscore the potential of misfit compounds as robust platforms for both realizing and utilizing spin-valley locking in bulk materials, as well as exploring proximity effects in two-dimensional structures.</description>

      <title>Skin-topological effect in two-dimensional nonreciprocal topological superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and topological properties in two-dimensional topological superconductor. Two kinds of non-Hermiticity are considered. The first is the spin-independent non-reciprocal hopping, which respects particle-hole symmetry (PHS) and dictates the bulk as well as topological edge modes localize at opposite corners, manifested as the $Z_2$ NHSE protected by PHS. The direction of the localization can be conveniently characterized by the sign of the winding numbers. The other is the spin-dependent non-reciprocal hopping, where the NHSE is protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS). The Kramers doublets are localized at opposite corners, namely the TRS protected $Z_2$ NHSE. When apply an external magnetic field, its internal symmetry changes from the symplectic class into the orthogonal class, eliminating the NHSE for the states in the spectrum continuum. For the zero energy states which are isolated, the NHSE still has its effects despite the orthogonality. For the spin-independent case, edge states can be effectively tuned by the direction of Zeeman field, where at certain directions the zero-energy edge state can be free of NHSE and uniformly distributed. Our work paves the way for the study of the interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity in superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>High-temperature superconductivity from kinetic energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate a kinetic superconductor in a simple lattice model with only one term: the nearest neighbor hopping $t$. The hopping is projected into a constrained Hilbert space, in the same spirit as the usual t-J model with $J=0$, where kinetic magnetism has been proposed. The ground state in our model is demonstrated as a superconductor from density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation on the cylinder with $L_y$ up to 8. Both the pairing gap and the phase stiffness increase with the doping $x$, which is in contrast to high Tc cuprates where the pairing gap decreases with doping. We show that the pairing gap, measured from the spin gap or charge 1e gap, can be above $1.5 t$. Our model can be realized in the double Kondo lattice model relevant to the bilayer nickelate system in the limit of infinite inter-layer spin coupling $J_\perp/t \rightarrow +\infty$, with an inter-layer repulsion $V$ scaling alongside $J_\perp$ to offset the net attraction. In the double Kondo model, there is no fundamental constraint on $J_\perp/t$, allowing the reachable upper bound of $T_c/t$ to be a large number at the order of 0.5. We also argue that the kinetic superconductor discovered in this work can smoothly connect to the more realistic regime with $J_\perp \sim t$, though the pairing gap may be reduced to the order of $0.1 t$ instead of $t$. Given that $t\sim 10^3$K in typical solid state systems, the material realization of the model may be promising to achieve a $T_c$ at the order of hundreds Kelvin. We propose to search for bilayer material with a reduced z-axis lattice constant to closely approach our ideal model.</description>

      <title>Berry curvature and spin-one color superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Berry curvature and topological aspects of a spin-one color superconductor. In the ultra-relativistic limit, the ground state is the color-spin locking phase (CSL) with the pairing between quarks of opposite chirality. Li and Haldane show that for generic Cooper pairs formed by Weyl fermions that carry opposite chirality, the gap function must have topologically protected nodes. However, the CSL phase has been known as a fully gapped system and lacks any nodes within one-flavor Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We present a general formulation relating the total topological number associated with the nodal structure and the monopole charges of the Berry curvature, including the color structure of the pair quarks. In the CSL phase, the contribution from the chirality, which is assumed to lead to the nodes within the conventional argument, is canceled out by the novel color contribution. Moreover, this non-trivial color Berry structure is manifested through the presence of gapless quasi-particles that exhibit the "color" helicity $\pm 1$, resulting in total monopole charges of $\pm 3/2$ rather than $\pm 1/2$ of a single Weyl fermion.</description>

Abstract: We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by superconductors with a finite phase difference under non-Hermiticity, which naturally appears due to coupling to normal reservoirs. Depending on the structure of non-Hermiticity, captured in terms of retarded self-energies, the low-energy spectrum hosts topologically stable exceptional points either at zero or finite real energies as a function of the superconducting phase difference. Interestingly, the corresponding phase-biased supercurrents may acquire divergent profiles at such exceptional points. This instance is a natural and unique non-Hermitian effect that signals a possible way to enhance the sensitivity of Josephson junctions. Our work opens a way for realizing unique non-Hermitian phenomena due to the interplay between non-Hermitian topology and the Josephson effect.</description>

      <title>Strong local variational approach for superconductivity theory, and the principles of coherent interaction and action-counteraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the two-mode electron pairing, we propose a local stacking force pairing mechanism driven by strong local fluctuations, with two straight pairing orbits where the tying Cooper pairing $C_{-k\downarrow}C_{k\uparrow}e^{ik\cdot r}$ replaces the itinerant pairing. Based on coherent interaction and action-counteraction principles, the strong local variational theory is constructed, with the energy extremum and gap equations forming self-consistent pairs, involving the local variational parameter $\lambda$, energy gap $\Delta$, and the energy cut-off $\hbar \omega_0$. As $\hbar \omega_0(j)$ approaches its cut-off, $\lambda$ and $\Delta$ converge to fixed values. The theory predicts that the coupling strength $Vg(0)$ reduces to $\tilde{V}g(0)=e^{-\left(1-\alpha_{1}\right)^{2} k^{2} / 4 \lambda^{2}} Vg(0)$, and the Cooper pair reduces similarly. For weak coupling, $\alpha_1=1$, and when $Vg(0)=0.1$, $\Delta_{\mathrm{A \cdot C}}=108 \Delta_{\text{BCS}}$, but $\Delta_{\mathrm{A \cdot C}}$ decreases to $28 \Delta_{\text{BCS}}$ at $Vg(0)=0.2$. For strong coupling, $\alpha_1=0$, if $Vg(0)=1.4$, $\tilde{V} g(0)$ reduces to 0.2, and the smaller Cooper pair $\widetilde{C_{k \uparrow} C_{-k \downarrow}}$ reduces to $0.14 C_{k \uparrow} C_{-k \downarrow}$. Additionally, $\Delta_{\mathrm{A \cdot C}} = 0.5676~\text{eV} \gg \hbar \omega_{\text{D}}$, and the local stacking force is $\widetilde{V}_{\text{st}}=0.264 ~\text{eV}$. With $k^2/\lambda^2 =$ const, the local strength increases, causing the stacking force to grow significantly. Thus, $\hbar \omega_0$ and $\Delta$ yield a unique solution.</description>

      <title>Collective Pinning and Vortex Dynamics in type 2 superconducting thin films with Varying Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A perpendicular magnetic field penetrating a thin type-II superconductor slab produces vortices, with one vortex per flux quantum, h/2e. The vortices interact repulsively and form an ordered array (Abrikosov lattice) in clean systems, while strong disorder changes the lattice into a vortex glass. Here we investigate type-II superconducting films (PdBi2 and NbSe2) with surface acoustic waves (SAWs) at mK temperature. When sweeping the magnetic field at an extremely slow rate, we observe a series of spikes in the attenuation and velocity of the SAW, on average separated in field by approximately Hc1. We suspect the following scenario: The vortex-free region at the edges of the film produces an edge barrier across which the vortices can enter or leave. When the applied field changes, the induced supercurrents flowing along this edge region lowers this barrier until there is an instability. At that point, vortices avalanche into (or out of) the bulk and change the vortex crystal, suggested by the sharp jump in each such spike. The vortices then gradually relax to a new stable pinned configuration, leading to a ~30s relaxation after the jump. Our observation enriches the limited experimental evidence on the important topic of real-time vortex dynamics in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Fragmented superconductivity in the Hubbard model as solitons in Ginzburg-Landau theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and charge density waves are observed in close vicinity in many strongly correlated materials. Increasing evidence from experiments and numerical simulations suggests both phenomena can also occur in an intertwined manner, where the superconducting order parameter is coupled to the electronic density. Employing density matrix renormalization group simulations, we investigate the nature of such an intertwined state of matter stabilized in the phase diagram of the elementary $t$-$t^\prime$-$U$ Hubbard model in the strong coupling regime. Remarkably, the condensate of Cooper pairs is shown to be fragmented in the presence of a charge density wave where more than one pairing wave function is macroscopically occupied. Moreover, we provide conclusive evidence that the macroscopic wave functions of the superconducting fragments are well-described by soliton solutions of a Ginzburg-Landau equation in a periodic potential constituted by the charge density wave. In the presence of an orbital magnetic field, the order parameters are gauge invariant, and superconducting vortices are pinned between the stripes. This intertwined Ginzburg-Landau theory is proposed as an effective low-energy description of the stripe fragmented superconductor.</description>

      <title>"Quantum Geometric Nesting" and Solvable Model Flat-Band Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "quantum geometric nesting'' (QGN) to characterize the idealized ordering tendencies of certain flat-band systems implicit in the geometric structure of the flat-band subspace. Perfect QGN implies the existence of an infinite class of local interactions that can be explicitly constructed and give rise to solvable ground states with various forms of possible fermion bi-linear order, including flavor ferromagnetism, density waves, and superconductivity. For the ideal Hamiltonians constructed in this way, we show that certain aspects of the low-energy spectrum can also be exactly computed including, in the superconducting case, the phase stiffness. Examples of perfect QGN include flat bands with certain symmetries (e.g. chiral or time-reversal), and non-symmetry-related cases exemplified with an engineered model for pair-density-wave. Extending this approach, we obtain exact superconducting ground states with nontrivial pairing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Repulsive Casimir force from a Majorana zero-mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13862v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fu and Kane have taught us that a Majorana zero-mode appears on the quantum spin Hall edge at the interface with a superconductor. If a magnetic scatterer is placed on the edge, the zero-point energy of massless edge excitations exerts a force on the scatterer. This is the fermionic analogue of the electromagnetic Casimir effect. We show that the Majorana zero-mode produces a repulsive Casimir force, pushing the scatterer away from the superconductor. Unlike some other signatures of Majorana zero-modes, the repulsive Casimir force is directly tied to the topological invariant of the system (the sign of the determinant of the reflection matrix from the superconductor).</description>
