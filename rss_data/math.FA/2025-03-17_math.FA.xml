      <title>A noncommutative generalization of Hunter's positivity theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hunter proved that the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials of even degree are positive definite. We prove a noncommutative generalization of this result, in which the scalar variables are replaced with hermitian operators. We provide a sharp lower bound and a sum of hermitian squares representation that are novel even in the scalar case.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of positive operators via their powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new characterizations of normal and positive operators in terms of their powers. Among other things, we show that if $T^2$ is normal, $\mathcal{W}(T^{2k+1})$ lies on one side of a line passing through the origin (possibly including some points on the line) for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$, and $\mathrm{asc\,}(T)= 1$ (or $\mathrm{dsc\,}(T)=1$), then $T$ must be normal. This complements the previous result due to Putnam [28]. Furthermore, we prove that $T$ is normal (positive) if and only if $\mathrm{asc\,}(T)= 1$ and there exist coprime numbers $p,q\geq 2$ such that $T^p$ and $T^q$ are normal (positive). Finally, we also show that $T$ is positive if and only if $T^k$ is accretive for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$, which answers the question from [22] in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Kernels of Bounded Operators on the Classical Transfinite Banach Sequence Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every closed subspace of each of the Banach spaces $X = \ell_p(\Gamma)$ and $X=c_0(\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is a set and $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, is the kernel of a bounded operator $X\to X$.
  On the other hand, whenever $\Gamma$ is an uncountable set, $\ell_1(\Gamma)$ contains a closed subspace that is not the kernel of any bounded operator $\ell_1(\Gamma)\to\ell_1(\Gamma)$.</description>

      <title>Hyperinvariant subspaces of block-triangular operators on Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if a nonscalar operator on a separable Hilbert space has a nontrivial invariant subspace, then it has also a nontrivial hyperinvariant subspace. Thus the hyperinvariant subspace problem is equivalent to the invariant subspace problem. As a consequence we obtain that every bilateral weighted shift has a proper hyprinvariant subspace. Our proof is based on a recent structure theorem in \cite{HP}, originated in the approach to almost invariant half-spaces in \cite{APTT} (see also \cite{Tc}).
  The idea that such a result would be possible came from the paper \cite{Pearcy} by the second author which was submitted to Acta Szeged for publication. The manuscript contained the construction we use herein and also set forth the rank inequality that we use to obtain the contradiction that yields the desired theorem. The proof given in \cite{Pearcy} of that theorem was incorrect, however, and it's proof turned out to be rather difficult, and was eventually found by the first author of this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for the transfer of an uncertainty principle for the short-time Fourier transform or a Fourier pair to an uncertainty principle for a sesquilinear or quadratic metaplectic time-frequency representation. In particular, we derive Beurling-type and Hardy-type uncertainty principles for metaplectic time-frequency representations.</description>

      <title>On the cutoff phenomenon for fast diffusion and porous medium equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cutoff phenomenon, conceptualized at the origin for finite Markov chains, states that for a parametric family of evolution equations, started from a point, the distance towards a long time equilibrium may become more and more abrupt for certain choices of initial conditions, when the parameter tends to infinity. This threshold phenomenon can be seen as a critical competition between trend to equilibrium and worst initial condition. In this note, we investigate this phenomenon beyond stochastic processes, in the context of the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations, by proving cutoff for the fast diffusion and porous medium Fokker-Planck equations on the Euclidean space, when the dimension tends to infinity. We formulate the phenomenon using quadratic Wasserstein distance, as well as using specific relative entropy and Fisher information. Our high dimensional asymptotic analysis uses the exact solvability of the model involving Barenblatt profiles. It includes the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics as a special linear case.</description>

      <title>Integrating Product Coefficients for Improved 3D LiDAR Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the enhancement of classification accuracy for 3D point cloud Lidar data, an optical remote sensing technique that estimates the three-dimensional coordinates of a given terrain. Our approach introduces product coefficients, theoretical quantities derived from measure theory, as additional features in the classification process. We define and present the formulation of these product coefficients and conduct a comparative study, using them alongside principal component analysis (PCA) as feature inputs. Results demonstrate that incorporating product coefficients into the feature set significantly improves classification accuracy within this new framework.</description>

      <title>Localization of critical points in annular conical sets via the method of Nehari manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Nehari manifold method, we establish sufficient conditions such that a smooth functional attains a ground state within an annular domain of a closed cone. The localization we obtain immediately allows for multiplicity when applied to disjoint conical sets. To illustrate our results, we consider a two-point boundary value problem and obtain a solution within a shell of a closed cone, defined in terms of a Harnack inequality with respect to the energy norm. The conditions imposed on the nonlinear term naturally extend those from classical examples in the literature which were derived using the method of Nehari manifold on the entire domain.</description>

      <title>Parabolic noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce to spectral noncommutative geometry the notion of tangled spectral triple, which encompasses the anisotropies arising in parabolic geometry as well as the parabolic commutator bounds arising in so-called ``bad Kasparov products''. Tangled spectral triples incorporate anisotropy by replacing the unbounded operator in a spectral triple that mimics a Dirac operator with several unbounded operators mimicking directional Dirac operators. We allow for varying and dependent orders in different directions, controlled by using the tools of tropical combinatorics. We study the conformal equivariance of tangled spectral triples as well as how they fit into $K$-homology by means of producing higher order spectral triples. Our main examples are hypoelliptic spectral triples constructed from Rockland complexes on parabolic geometries; we also build spectral triples on nilpotent group $C^*$-algebras from the dual Dirac element and crossed product spectral triples for parabolic dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hellinger-Kantorovich distance can be expressed as the metric infimal convolution of the Hellinger and the Wasserstein distances, as conjectured by Liero, Mielke, and Savar\'e. To prove it, we study with the tools of Unbalanced Optimal Transport the so called Marginal Entropy-Transport problem that arises as a single minimization step in the definition of infimal convolution. Careful estimates and results when the number of minimization steps diverges are also provided, both in the specific case of the Hellinger-Kantorovich setting and in the general one of abstract distances.</description>

      <title>Compactness of Fourier concentration operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a sufficient condition on sets $E$ and $F$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to ensure compactness of Fourier concentration operators by introducing the notion of sets which are very thin at infinity. We are able to show that if the sets $E$ and $F$ are both very thin at infinity, then the associated Fourier concentration operator is compact on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. The proof relies on a combination of the Logvinenko-Sereda uncertainty principle together with an uncertainty principle due to Shubin, Vakilian and Wolff. This provides a partial answer to a question posed by Katsnelson and Machluf on truncated Fourier operators.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Suppression Functions and Functional Space Geometry in Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effects of a scale-dependent suppression function $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ on the functional space geometry in renormalization theory. By introducing a dynamical cutoff scale $\Lambda$, the suppression function smoothly regulates high-momentum contributions without requiring a hard cutoff. We show that $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ induces a modified metric on functional space, leading to a non-trivial Ricci curvature that becomes increasingly negative in the ultraviolet (UV) limit. This effect dynamically suppresses high-energy states, yielding a controlled deformation of the functional domain. Furthermore, we derive the renormalization group (RG) flow of $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ and demonstrate its role in controlling the curvature flow of the functional space. The suppression function leads to spectral modifications that suggest an effective dimensional reduction at high energies, a feature relevant to functional space deformations and integral convergence in renormalization theory. Our findings provide a mathematical framework for studying regularization techniques and their role in the UV behavior of function spaces.</description>

      <title>Construction of self-similar energy forms and singularity of Sobolev spaces on Laakso-type fractal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct self-similar $p$-energy forms as normalized limits of discretized $p$-energies on a rich class of Laakso-type fractal spaces. Collectively, we refer to them as IGS-fractals, where IGS stands for (edge-)iterated graph systems. We propose this framework as a rich source of "toy models" that can be consulted for tackling challenging questions that are not well understood on most other fractal spaces. Supporting this, our framework uncovers a novel analytic phenomenon, which we term as singularity of Sobolev spaces. This means that the associated Sobolev spaces $\mathscr{F}_{p_1}$ and $\mathscr{F}_{p_2}$ for distinct $p_1,p_2 \in (1,\infty)$ intersect only at constant functions. We provide the first example of a self-similar fractal on which this singularity phenomenon occurs for all pairs of distinct exponents. In particular, we show that the Laakso diamond space is one such example.</description>

      <title>Complex abstract Wiener spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real abstract Wiener spaces (AWS) were originally defined by Gross using measurable norms, as a generalisation of the theory of advanced integral calculus in infinite dimensions as introduced by Cameron and Martin. In this paper we present a rigorous, complete and self-contained general framework for $\mathbb{K}$-AWS, where $\mathbb{K} \in \{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$ using the language of characteristic functions instead of measurable norms. In particular, we will prove that $X$ is a centred resp. proper $H$-valued Gaussian field over $\mathbb{K}$ iff the covariance function can be written in terms of some non-negative, self-adjoint trace class operator, and that the existence and uniqueness of $X$ is equivalent to the $\mathbb{K}$-AWS. Finally we will relate the $\mathbb{C}$-AWS to the $\mathbb{R}$-AWS by way of a real structure, which is a real linear, complex anti-linear involution on a complex vector space. This allows for a commutative relation between the real and complex Gaussian fields and the real and complex abstract Wiener spaces. We will construct specific examples which fall under this framework like the complex Brownian motion, complex Feynman-Kac formula and complex fractional Gaussian fields.</description>

Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Space of Actions, Partition Metric and Combinatorial Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.2147</link>
      <description>arXiv:1108.2147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a natural pseudometric on the space of actions of d-generated groups. In this pseudometric, the zero classes correspond to the weak equivalence classes defined by Kechris, and the metric identification is compact. We achieve this by employing symbolic dynamics and an ultraproduct construction which also facilitates the extension of our results to unitary representations. As a byproduct, we show that the weak equivalence class of every free non-amenable action contains an action that satisfies the measurable von Neumann problem.</description>

      <title>Distinguished varieties and the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem on the symmetrized bidisk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.12392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting with a solvable Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem with the initial data coming from the symmetrized bidisk, this paper studies the corresponding uniqueness set, i.e., the largest set in the domain where all solutions to the problem coincide. It is shown that the uniqueness set coincides with an algebraic variety in the domain. The algebraic variety - canonically constructed from the interpolation data - is called the uniqueness variety. It was shown that the uniqueness variety contains a distinguished variety which by definition is the zero set of a two-variable polynomial that intersects the domain and exits through its distinguished boundary. A complete algebraic and geometric characterizations of distinguished varieties are obtained in this paper.</description>

      <title>On discretization of some extremal problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve two continuous extremal problems on the classes of monotone functions: in the first problem we find extremal values for a line integral of a coordinate-wise monotone function of two variables from a rearrange\-ment-invariant class of functions; in the second one we find extremal values for the expectation of a random process with monotone trajectories at a random time. In both cases we reduce the continuous problems to their discrete counterparts. The obtained discrete problems are on the one hand interesting on their own, and on the other hand give a natural explanation of the structure of the extremal functions for the continuous problems.</description>

Abstract: This paper is about the maximally monotone and quasidense subsets of the product of a real Banach space and its dual. We discuss eight subclasses of the maximally monotone sets that are equivalent to the quasidense ones. We define the Gossez extension to the dual of a maximally monotone set, and give seven equivalent characterizations of an element of this set in the quasidense case. We discuss maximally monotone sets of "type (NI)" (one of the eight classes referred to above) and we show that the "tail operator" is not of type (NI), but it is the Gossez extension of a maximally monotone set that is of type (NI). We generalize Rockafellar's surjectivity theorem for maximally monotone subsets of reflexive Banach spaces to maximally monotone subsets of type (NI) of general Banach spaces. We discuss a generalization of the Brezis-Browder theorem on monotone linear subspaces of reflexive spaces to the nonreflexive situation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of functions of self-adjoint operators under relatively bounded and relatively trace class perturbation We introduce and study the class of relatively operator Lipschitz functions. An essential role is played by double operator integrals. We also consider study the class of resolvent Lipschitz functions. Then we obtain a trace formula in the case of relatively trace class perturbations and show that the maximal class of function for which the trace formula holds in the case of relatively trace class perturbations coincides with the class of relatively operator Lipschitz functions. Our methods also gives us a new approach to the inequality $\int|\boldsymbol{\xi}(t)|(1+|t|)^{-1}\,{\rm d}t&lt;\infty$ for the spectral shift function $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ in the case of relatively trace class perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bessel potential spaces, introduced in the 1960s, are derived through complex interpolation between Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, making them intermediate spaces of fractional differentiability order. Bessel potential spaces have recently gained attention due to their identification with the Riesz fractional gradient. This paper explores Bessel potential spaces as complex interpolation spaces, providing original proofs of fundamental properties based on abstract interpolation theory. Main results include a direct proof of norm equivalence, continuous embeddings, and the relationship with Gagliardo spaces.</description>

Abstract: We present a formula for the interpolation of matrix weighted spaces of vector valued functions via interpolation functors. We apply our formula to the particular case of interpolation of matrix weighted $L^p$ spaces by the real and complex methods, and present consequences regarding the matrix Muckenhoupt classes and commutator estimates of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators with matrix $BMO$ functions. In particular, we characterize the logarithms of Muckenhoupt weights through higher order commutators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharp affine fractional Sobolev inequalities for functions on $\mathbb R^n$ are established. For each $0&lt;s&lt;1$, the new inequalities are significantly stronger than (and directly imply) the sharp fractional Sobolev inequalities of Almgren and Lieb. In the limit as $s\to 1^-$, the new inequalities imply the sharp affine Sobolev inequality of Gaoyong Zhang. As a consequence, fractional Petty projection inequalities are obtained that are stronger than the fractional Euclidean isoperimetric inequalities and a natural conjecture for radial mean bodies is proved.</description>

Abstract: The Lie-Trotter formula has been a fundamental tool in quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and quantum simulations. The error estimations for the Lie-Trotter product formula play a crucial role in achieving scalability and computational efficiency. In this note, we present two error estimates of Lie-Trotter product formulas, utilizing Jordan product within Banach algebras. Additionally, we introduce two generalized Lie-Trotter formula and provide two explicit estimation formulas. Consequently, the renowned Suzuki symmetrized approximation for the exponentiated sums follows directly from our main Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present an abstract approach to study asymptotic orders for adaptive approximations with respect to a monotone set function $\mathfrak{J}$ defined on dyadic cubes. We determine the exact upper order in terms of the critical value of the corresponding $\mathfrak{J}$-partition function, and we are able to provide upper and lower bounds in term of fractal-geometric quantities. With properly chosen $\mathfrak{J}$, our new approach has applications in many different areas of mathematics, including the spectral theory of Krein-Feller operators, quantization dimensions of compactly supported probability measures, and the exact asymptotic order for Kolmogorov, Gelfand and linear widths for Sobolev embeddings into $L_{\mu}^p$-spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a thin multi-domain of $\mathbb R^N$, with $N\geq 2$, consisting of a vertical rod upon a horizontal disk. In this thin multi-domain, we introduce a bulk energy density of the kind $W(D^2U)$, where $W$ is a continuous function with linear growth at $\infty$ and $D^2U$ denotes the Hessian tensor of a vector-valued function $U$ that represents a deformation of the multi-domain. Considering suitable boundary conditions on the admissible deformations and assuming that the two volumes tend to zero with same rate, we prove that the limit model is well posed in the union of the limit domains, with dimensions $1$ and $N-1$, respectively. Moreover, we show that the limit problem is uncoupled if $N\geq 3$, and ``partially" coupled if $N=2$.</description>

      <title>Sharp functional calculus for the Taibleson operator on non-archimedean local fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any non-Archimedean local field $\mathbb{K}$ and any integer $n \geq 1$, we show that the Taibleson operator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\theta)$ functional calculus on the Banach space $\mathrm{L}^p(\mathbb{K}^n)$ for any angle $\theta &gt; 0$, which is optimal, where $\Sigma_\theta=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt; \theta \}$ and $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. Moreover, we prove that it even admits a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus of order $\frac{3}{2}$, revealing a new phenomenon absent from the existing literature, as this order is independent of the dimension, unlike previous results in various settings. In our study, we explore harmonic analysis on locally compact Spector-Vilenkin groups establishing the $R$-boundedness of a family of convolution operators. Our results enhance the understanding of functional calculi of operators acting on $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces associated with totally disconnected spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the fundamental evolution equations associated to the Taibleson operator, relevant in various physical models.</description>

      <title>Multiresolution analysis on spectra of hermitian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a multiresolution analysis on the space $\text{Herm}(n)$ of $n\times n$ complex Hermitian matrices which is adapted to invariance under conjugation by the unitary group $U(n).$ The orbits under this action are parametrized by the possible ordered spectra of Hermitian matrices, which constitute a closed Weyl chamber of type $A_{n-1}$ in $\mathbb R^n.$ The space $L^2(\text{Herm}(n))^{U(n)}$ of radial, i.e. $U(n)$-invariant $L^2$-functions on $\text{Herm}(n)$ is naturally identified with a certain weighted $L^2$-space on this chamber.
  The scale spaces of our multiresolution analysis are obtained by usual dyadic dilations as well as generalized translations of a scaling function, where the generalized translation is a hypergroup translation which respects the radial geometry. We provide a concise criterion to characterize orthonormal wavelet bases and show that such bases always exist. They provide natural orthonormal bases of the space $L^2(\text{Herm}(n))^{U(n)}.$
  Furthermore, we show how to obtain radial scaling functions from classical scaling functions on $\mathbb R^{n}$. Finally, generalizations related to the Cartan decompositions for general compact Lie groups are indicated.</description>
