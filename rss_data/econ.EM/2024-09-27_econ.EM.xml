      <title>Model Averaging and Double Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses pairing double/debiased machine learning (DDML) with stacking, a model averaging method for combining multiple candidate learners, to estimate structural parameters. In addition to conventional stacking, we consider two stacking variants available for DDML: short-stacking exploits the cross-fitting step of DDML to substantially reduce the computational burden and pooled stacking enforces common stacking weights over cross-fitting folds. Using calibrated simulation studies and two applications estimating gender gaps in citations and wages, we show that DDML with stacking is more robust to partially unknown functional forms than common alternative approaches based on single pre-selected learners. We provide Stata and R software implementing our proposals.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Rolling Horizon Production Planning Through Stochastic Optimization Evaluated by Means of Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Production planning must account for uncertainty in a production system, arising from fluctuating demand forecasts. Therefore, this article focuses on the integration of updated customer demand into the rolling horizon planning cycle. We use scenario-based stochastic programming to solve capacitated lot sizing problems under stochastic demand in a rolling horizon environment. This environment is replicated using a discrete event simulation-optimization framework, where the optimization problem is periodically solved, leveraging the latest demand information to continually adjust the production plan. We evaluate the stochastic optimization approach and compare its performance to solving a deterministic lot sizing model, using expected demand figures as input, as well as to standard Material Requirements Planning (MRP). In the simulation study, we analyze three different customer behaviors related to forecasting, along with four levels of shop load, within a multi-item and multi-stage production system. We test a range of significant parameter values for the three planning methods and compute the overall costs to benchmark them. The results show that the production plans obtained by MRP are outperformed by deterministic and stochastic optimization. Particularly, when facing tight resource restrictions and rising uncertainty in customer demand, the use of stochastic optimization becomes preferable compared to deterministic optimization.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Markov-Switching Vector Autoregressive Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces marginal density functions of the general Bayesian Markov-Switching Vector Autoregressive (MS-VAR) process. In the case of the Bayesian MS-VAR process, we provide closed-form density functions and Monte-Carlo simulation algorithms, including the importance sampling method. The Monte-Carlo simulation method departs from the previous simulation methods because it removes the duplication in a regime vector.</description>

      <title>EM Estimation of Conditional Matrix Variate $t$ Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditional matrix variate student $t$ distribution was introduced by Battulga (2024a). In this paper, we propose a new version of the conditional matrix variate student $t$ distribution. The paper provides EM algorithms, which estimate parameters of the conditional matrix variate student $t$ distributions, including general cases and special cases with Minnesota prior.</description>

      <title>Inference with Many Weak Instruments and Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers inference in a linear instrumental variable regression model with many potentially weak instruments and heterogeneous treatment effects. I first show that existing test procedures, including those that are robust to only either weak instruments or heterogeneous treatment effects, can be arbitrarily oversized in this setup. Then, I propose a valid inference procedure based on a score statistic and a leave-three-out variance estimator. To establish this procedure's validity, this paper proves that the score statistic is asymptotically normal and the variance estimator is consistent. The power of the score test is also close to a power envelope in an empirical application.</description>
