      <title>Quantum mechanics provides the physical basis of teleological evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the quantum computational speedup of quantum algorithms is due to their teleological character, their being evolutions toward a goal (the solution of the problem) with an attractor in the very goal they will produce in the future (the solution of the problem again). Naturally, this is a destabilizing result: the teleological notion has long been rejected by science and even, for its finalistic character, viewed as a belief. We also show that, under the quantum cosmological assumption and for the Fine-tuned Universe version of the Anthropic Principle, the physical basis of the teleological character of quantum algorithms also applies to the evolutions of the living for which the teleological notion was conceived. This work should show that the discovery of the quantum computational speedup confers full scientific dignity to the holistic and finalistic view of physical reality traditionally opposed by science.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Structure and Three Fermion Generations in Clifford Algebra with S3 Family Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an explicit algebraic realisation of three fermion generations within a single Clifford algebra, transforming under the full Standard Model $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ gauge group, in which an intrinsic $S_3$ family symmetry permutes three algebraically distinguished but gauge-equivalent fermion sectors without replicating the gauge bosons. Fermionic states are represented by minimal left ideals of the complex Clifford algebra $\mathbb{C}\ell(10)$, while the three-generation structure arises from an embedded discrete $S_3$ symmetry acting on the space of algebraic spinors. The Standard Model gauge generators are identified as elements commuting with this $S_3$ action and act on physical states via the adjoint (commutator) action. The resulting spectrum reproduces the correct Standard Model quantum numbers for three linearly independent generations of fermions.</description>

      <title>Exceptional $\mathfrak{g}_2$ deformations and gauge symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformed $\mathfrak{g}_2$ exceptional applications are introduced via the Clifford algebra-parametrized formalism. Using the products between multivectors of $\cl_{0,7}$, the Clifford algebra over the metric vector space $\RR^{0,7}$, and octonions, resulting in an octonion, we generalize the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$ applications, also associated with the transformation rules for bosonic and fermionic fields on the 7-sphere $S^7$. The emergence of $SU(3)$-like subalgebras within the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$ provides an algebraic framework reminiscent of the $SU(3)$ gauge symmetry of QCD.</description>

      <title>Possible Vulnerability of Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Tests used for Quantum Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hidden variables (HVs) model is reported, which reproduces quantum predictions for Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) tests. The existence of such a model poses some limitations to quantum certifications that rely on Bell-CHSH inequality violations. The reported model does not prove wrong Bell's theorem. The latter assumes the factorability of the probability density $p_{AB}$, which rules the stochastic behavior of the HVs. The reported HVs model is based on an extended form of $p_{AB}$, which is suggested by Lebesgue's decomposition theorem for bounded functions. The considered $p_{AB}$ complies with locality and realism, and also with measurement independence, parameter independence and outcome independence.</description>

      <title>Zero-Point Energy of a Scalar Field in $q$-Deformed Euclidean Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the energy of a scalar field in its ground state within $q$-deformed Euclidean space. Specifically, we compute the total vacuum energy of the entire $q$-deformed Euclidean space, originating from the scalar field's ground-state energy. Our results show that, for a massless scalar field, the total vacuum energy vanishes. In contrast, when evaluating the average ground-state energy over finite, localized regions of the $q$-deformed Euclidean space, we find that the vacuum energy density can assume significant values.</description>

      <title>Irreducible Multi-Particle Representations of the Poincar\'e Group as a Basis for the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phenomenological description of the Stern--Gerlach experiment yields a mathematical structure equivalent to that of a spin-1/2 particle, described by an irreducible unitary representation of the Poincar\'e group. In the corresponding irreducible two-particle representation, two-particle states have the form of an integral over product states. They describe a correlation between the particles with the structure of the electromagnetic interaction and a coupling constant that numerically equals the electromagnetic coupling constant. This coupling constant is essentially the normalisation factor of these two-particle states. The Standard Model of particle physics describes the electromagnetic interaction by a perturbation algorithm, where the experimental value of the electromagnetic coupling constant is inserted by hand. It is argued that it does not make sense to insert a normalisation factor without checking the range of integration of the corresponding integral and adjusting it if necessary. This adjustment provides the perturbation algorithm with the mathematically consistent structure of a non-local, relativistic, two-particle quantum mechanics. Similarly, multi-particle representations determine a gravitational interaction that, in the quasi-classical limit, is described by the field equations of conformal gravity. A calculated, galaxy-specific value of the gravitational constant matches the experimental value.</description>

      <title>Comment on arXiv:2601.04248v1: Superposition of states in quantum theory (J.-M. Vigoureux)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vigoureux suggests replacing the usual linear superposition rule of quantum mechanics with a M"obius-type "composition law" $\oplus$, motivated by (i) bounded-domain composition laws in special relativity, (ii) familiar transfer-matrix formulas in multilayer optics, and (iii) an analogy with the inclusion-exclusion rule for classical probabilities. In this note we explain why the proposal does not work as a modification of quantum theory. For two components, the new rule differs from the ordinary sum only by an overall scalar factor, so after normalization it represents the same ray and cannot change any physical prediction. For three or more components, if one extends the two-term prescription in the natural recursive way, the result becomes bracket/order dependent and can even change the ray, so a "state" is no longer uniquely determined by a given preparation. We also clarify why the inclusion-exclusion argument and the optics analogy do not support a foundational change to Hilbert-space linearity.</description>

      <title>Anomalous particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15683v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides the fermions of Dirac, Weyl, and Majorana there is the different type of fermions referred to as anomalous. The Dirac wave equation describes conventional electron states studied in textbooks. It happens that this equation also have qualitatively different solutions corresponding to anomalous particles. They are autonomous constituting thus the different type of elementary particles. The link between anomalous electrons and strongly accelerating nuclei, in experiments on high voltage discharge in usual gases and liquids, is a matter of study. The concept of the Dirac material is more fundamental, compared to the previous standpoint, allowing positively charged particles in condensed matter.</description>
