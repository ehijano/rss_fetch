      <title>Analog Physical Systems Can Exhibit Double Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important component of the success of large AI models is double descent, in which networks avoid overfitting as they grow relative to the amount of training data, instead improving their performance on unseen data. Here we demonstrate double descent in a decentralized analog network of self-adjusting resistive elements. This system trains itself and performs tasks without a digital processor, offering potential gains in energy efficiency and speed -- but must endure component non-idealities. We find that standard training fails to yield double descent, but a modified protocol that accommodates this inherent imperfection succeeds. Our findings show that analog physical systems, if appropriately trained, can exhibit behaviors underlying the success of digital AI. Further, they suggest that biological systems might similarly benefit from over-parameterization.</description>

      <title>BBP Phase Transition for an Extensive Number of Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random-matrix theory helps disentangle signal from noise in large data sets. We analyze rectangular $p \times q$ matrices $W = W_0 + M$ in which the noise $M$ generates a Marchenko-Pastur bulk, whereas the signal $W_0$ injects an extensive set of degenerate singular values. Keeping $\mathrm{rank}$ $W_0/q$ finite as $p,q \to \infty$, we show that the singular value density obeys a quartic equation and derive explicit asymptotics in the strong-signal regime. The resulting generalized Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e phase diagram yields a scaling law for the critical signal strength and clarifies how a finite density of spikes reshapes the bulk edges. Numerical simulations validate the theory and illustrate its relevance for high-dimensional inference tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital computers are power-hungry and largely intolerant of damaged components, making them potentially difficult tools for energy-limited autonomous agents in uncertain environments. Recently developed Contrastive Local Learning Networks (CLLNs) - analog networks of self-adjusting nonlinear resistors - are inherently low-power and robust to physical damage, but were constructed to perform supervised learning. In this work we demonstrate success on two simple RL problems using Q-learning adapted for simulated CLLNs. Doing so makes explicit the components (beyond the network being trained) required to enact various tools in the RL toolbox, some of which (policy function and value function) are more natural in this system than others (replay buffer). We discuss assumptions such as the physical safety that digital hardware requires, CLLNs can forgo, and biological systems cannot rely on, and highlight secondary goals that are important in biology and trainable in CLLNs, but make little sense in digital computers.</description>

      <title>Brute-force positivization of $J_1-J_2$ model ground states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring sign structures of quantum wave functions attracts considerable attention due to the potential for advances in modeling complex phases of matter. This stimulates developing different optimization procedures for imitating and manipulating sign structures of quantum states. In this work, utilizing a brute force approach based on a set of single-qubit transformations we evaluate protocols enabling positivization of the one-dimensional $J_1 -J_2$ model ground states in the regime of strong frustration. Based on the obtained positivization results, we show the difference between the cases of periodic and open boundary conditions, and also establish the dependence of the sign structure on parity of the simulated spin chains.</description>

      <title>Multi-port programmable silicon photonics using low-loss phase change material Sb$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable photonic devices are rapidly emerging as a cornerstone of next generation optical technologies, with wide ranging applications in quantum simulation, neuromorphic computing, and large-scale photonic processors. A central challenge in this field is identifying an optimal platform to enable compact, efficient, and scalable reconfigurability. Optical phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a compelling solution by enabling non-volatile, reversible tuning of optical properties, compatible with a wide range of device platforms and current CMOS technologies. In particular, antimony tri-selenide ($\text{Sb}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$) stands out for its ultra low-loss characteristics at telecommunication wavelengths and its reversible switching. In this work, we present an experimental platform capable of encoding multi-port operations onto the transmission matrix of a compact multimode interferometer architecture on standard 220~nm silicon photonics using \textit{in-silico} designed digital patterns. The multi-port devices are clad with a thin film of $\text{Sb}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$, which can be optically addressed using direct laser writing to provide local perturbations to the refractive index. A range of multi-port geometries from 2$\times$2 up to 5$\times$5 couplers are demonstrated, achieving simultaneous control of up to 25 matrix elements with programming accuracy of 90% relative to simulated patterns. Patterned devices remain stable with consistent optical performance across the C-band wavelengths. Our work establishes a pathway towards the development of large scale PCM-based reconfigurable multi-port devices which will allow implementing matrix operations on three orders of magnitude smaller areas than interferometer meshes.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Framework for Glassy Polymer Viscoelasticity Across 20 Frequency Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glassy polymers are central to engineering applications, yet their viscoelastic response over broad frequency and temperature ranges remains difficult to characterize. We extend non-affine deformation theory by incorporating a time-dependent memory kernel within the Generalized Langevin Equation for atomistic non-affine motions, yielding frequency-dependent mechanical response. Applied to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), the method captures the shear modulus and relaxation spectrum across more than twenty decades in frequency, from hundreds of terahertz down to the millihertz regime, thus bridging polymer mechanics from ordinary to extreme scales. Our predictions show quantitative consistency with independent estimates from oscillatory-shear molecular dynamics, Brillouin scattering, ultrasonic spectroscopy, Split-Hopkinson testing, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), demonstrating a unified theoretical-computational route for multiscale characterization of polymer glasses.</description>

      <title>Neural network approximation of regularized density functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory is one of the most efficient and widely used computational methods of quantum mechanics, especially in fields such as solid state physics and quantum chemistry. From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation.</description>

      <title>Structure factor's realizability reveals the glass-dynamics onset temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When cooling liquids quickly enough, they bypass crystallization and instead enter a supercooled state and then a glass state. Previous studies have shown that the static structure factors of high-temperature liquids, supercooled liquids, and glasses exhibit only subtle differences, leading to the conclusion that the glass transition cannot be predicted solely from structure factor changes. Our research challenges this view. Specifically, we studied the difficulty of generating configurations corresponding to target structure factors using stochastic gradient descent optimizations. While such optimizations easily converge when targeting the structure factors of higher-temperature liquids, the difficulty significantly increases for lower temperature liquids and glasses. By quantifying this difficulty through the mean squared error achieved, we found a non-differentiable point at the onset temperature of glass dynamics. Our results suggest that the onset of glass dynamics can be explained by a fundamental change in the structure factor's realizability, even though the structure factor itself only changes slightly. Our results are currently based on computer simulations using original and modified Dzugutov interactions, and future work will determine whether our theory is applicable to other glass-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Kondo screening and random-singlet formation in highly disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model to capture the anomalous low-temperature thermodynamics of doped semiconductors, such as Si:P, across the metal-insulator transition. We consider pairs of local magnetic moments coupled to a highly disordered, non-interacting electronic bath that undergoes a metal-insulator transition with increasing doping. Using a large-$\mathcal{N}$ variational approach, we capture both the inhomogeneous local Fermi-liquid and the insulating random-singlet phase, and find that the local moment susceptibility exhibits a robust power-law behavior, $\chi(T) \propto T^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ evolving smoothly with doping before saturating in the metal. Our results highlight the competition between Kondo screening and random-singlet formation as the key ingredient in constructing a complete theory for the low-temperature behavior of strongly disordered interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin liquid instability of the Kitaev honeycomb model with crystallographic defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb gapless spin liquid in the presence of Stone-Wales-type local lattice defects with odd-sided plaquettes. While the clean Kitaev model has no finite-temperature phase transitions, we find that introducing a finite defect density $n_d\approx 10^{-4}$--$10^{-2}$ produces a true phase transition with a sizeable $T_c \approx 2 n_d$ in units of the Kitaev exchange. The resulting non-Abelian chiral quantum spin liquid exhibits scalar spin chirality and electron orbital magnetization which peak near lattice defects. This disorder-driven instability relies on an emergent long range ferromagnetic interaction $r^{-\gamma}$ ($\gamma \approx 2.7$) between defect chiralities, mediated by the nearly-gapless fermions, with implications for topology generation in Dirac cones with fluctuating mass terms.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions from linear to nonlinear information processing in neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a phase transition from linear to nonlinear information processing in echo state networks, a widely used framework in reservoir computing. The network consists of randomly connected recurrent nodes perturbed by a noise and the output is obtained through linear regression on the network states. By varying the standard deviation of the input weights, we systematically control the nonlinearity of the network. For small input standard deviations, the network operates in an approximately linear regime, resulting in limited information processing capacity. However, beyond a critical threshold, the capacity increases rapidly, and this increase becomes sharper as the network size grows. Our results indicate the presence of a discontinuous transition in the limit of infinitely many nodes. This transition is fundamentally different from the conventional order-to-chaos transition in neural networks, which typically leads to a loss of long-term predictability and a decline in the information processing capacity. Furthermore, we establish a scaling law relating the critical nonlinearity to the noise intensity, which implies that the critical nonlinearity vanishes in the absence of noise.</description>

      <title>False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16567v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</description>

      <title>Competing Localizations on Disordered Non-Hermitian Random Graph Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase transitions in one-dimensional lattice systems are well established and have been extensively studied within both Hermitian and non-Hermitian frameworks. In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight-binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\Delta$, on-site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that together define the underlying random graph structure. By varying $p$, $\Delta$, and the disorder strength, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show a strong competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations across parameter regimes. Notably, even in the presence of strong disorder, skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson-driven localization. We further discuss the relevance of these results to machine-learning architectures and information propagation in complex networks and other real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Calculating the Stability of Different Surfaces of GaAsxP1-x Mixed-Crystals using the Virtual Crystal Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical treatment of mixed-crystals is very demanding. A straight-forward approach to attack this problem is using a super cell method (SCM). Another one is the Virtual Crystal Approximation (VCA), which is a feature of the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). For comparison we use both methods to calculate the total energy (Etot) and the density of states (DOS) of bulk GaAsxP1-x. We then apply VCA to compute the stability of different surfaces using an extended version of the surface formation energy Omega. Our calculations show, on one hand, a working VCA implementation with its flaws (overestimation of Etot) and strengths (well modelling of DOS). On other hand, a further result is that bulk of the slab of a mixed-crystal has a minor influence on the configuration of the surface.</description>

Abstract: Crystalline symmetry can be used to predict bulk and surface properties of topological phases. For non-interacting cases, symmetry-eigenvalue analysis of Bloch states at high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone simplifies the calculation of topological quantities. However, when open boundaries are present, and only the point group part of the symmetry group remains, it is unclear how to utilize crystalline symmetries to diagnose band topology. In this work, we introduce topological crystalline markers to characterize bulk topology in $C_n$-symmetric ($n=2,3,4,6$) crystalline insulators and superconductors with and without translation symmetry. These markers are expressed using a crystalline symmetry operator and the ground state projector, and are defined locally in position space. First, we provide a general method to calculate topological markers in periodic systems with an arbitrary number of unit cells. This includes cases where momentum quantization does not span all necessary high-symmetry points for computing the topological quantities, which we address using twisted boundary conditions. Second, we map these markers to the Chern number, bulk polarization, and sector charge for two-dimensional $C_n$-symmetric insulators in symmetry classes A, AI, AII, and superconductors in class D. Finally, we show how to numerically calculate the markers in finite-size systems with translation-symmetry (and even rotation-symmetry) breaking defects, and how to diagnose the bulk topology from the marker. Our results demonstrate how to compute bulk topological crystalline invariants locally in position space, thereby providing broader scope to diagnosing bulk crystalline topology that works even in inhomogeneous systems where there is no global rotation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Exact Learning Dynamics of In-Context Learning in Linear Transformers and Its Application to Non-Linear Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure, leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops, including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.</description>

      <title>Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11411</link>

Abstract: Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.</description>

      <title>Mie-tronics supermodes and symmetry breaking in nonlocal metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03560</link>

Abstract: It is usually believed that symmetry breaking in photonic systems leads to weaker optical confinement, such as in the case of metasurfaces when bound states in the continuum are replaced by quasi-bound states with lower quality factors (Q factors). Here we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. We consider finite-size arrays of optical resonators supporting Mie resonances (a Mie-tronics platform) and employ diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses. We demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronics supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in their physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, and reversing the trends predicted by infinite-lattice theories. We reveal that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These novel findings establish a unified wave-physics platform linking both scattering and diffraction theories. Also, they outline the design principles for multi-functional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.</description>
