      <title>Scale-Dependent Multifractality in Bitcoin Realised Volatility: Implications for Rough Volatility Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the applicability of rough volatility models to Bitcoin realised volatility using the normalised p-variation framework of Cont and Das (2024). Applying this model free estimator to high-frequency Bitcoin data from 2017 to 2024 across multiple sampling resolutions, we find that the normalised statistic remains strictly negative throughout, precluding the estimation of a valid roughness index. Stationarity tests and robustness checks reveal no significant evidence of non-stationarity or structural breaks as explanatory factors. Instead, convergent evidence from three complementary diagnostics, namely multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, log-log moment scaling, and wavelet leaders, reveals a multifractal structure in Bitcoin volatility. This scale-dependent behaviour violates the homogeneity assumptions underlying rough volatility estimation and accounts for the estimator's systematic failure. These findings suggest that while rough volatility models perform well in traditional markets, they are structurally misaligned with the empirical features of Bitcoin volatility.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Factor-Augmented Models for Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate volatility forecasts are vital in modern finance for risk management, portfolio allocation, and strategic decision-making. However, existing methods face key limitations. Fully multivariate models, while comprehensive, are computationally infeasible for realistic portfolios. Factor models, though efficient, primarily use static factor loadings, failing to capture evolving volatility co-movements when they are most critical. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, model-agnostic Factor-Augmented Volatility Forecast framework. Our approach employs a time-varying factor model to extract a compact set of dynamic, cross-sectional factors from realized volatilities with minimal computational cost. These factors are then integrated into both statistical and AI-based forecasting models, enabling a unified system that jointly models asset-specific dynamics and evolving market-wide co-movements. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across two prominent asset classes-large-cap U.S. technology equities and major cryptocurrencies-over both short-term (1-day) and medium-term (7-day) horizons. Using a suite of linear and non-linear AI-driven models, we consistently observe substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and economic value. Notably, a practical pairs-trading strategy built on our forecasts delivers superior risk-adjusted returns and profitability, particularly under adverse market conditions.</description>

      <title>Navigating Uncertainty in ESG Investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread confusion among investors regarding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) rankings assigned by rating agencies has underscored a critical issue in sustainable investing. To address this uncertainty, our research has devised methods that not only recognize this ambiguity but also offer tailored investment strategies for different investor profiles. By developing ESG ensemble strategies and integrating ESG scores into a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model, we aim to optimize portfolios that cater to both financial returns and ESG-focused outcomes. Additionally, by proposing the Double-Mean-Variance model, we classify three types of investors based on their risk preferences. We also introduce ESG-adjusted Capital Asset Pricing Models (CAPMs) to assess the performance of these optimized portfolios. Ultimately, our comprehensive approach provides investors with tools to navigate the inherent ambiguities of ESG ratings, facilitating more informed investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Beta: A Causal Take on CAPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CAPM regression is typically interpreted as if the market return contemporaneously \emph{causes} individual returns, motivating beta-neutral portfolios and factor attribution. For realized equity returns, however, this interpretation is inconsistent: a same-period arrow $R_{m,t} \to R_{i,t}$ conflicts with the fact that $R_m$ is itself a value-weighted aggregate of its constituents, unless $R_m$ is lagged or leave-one-out -- the ``aggregator contradiction.'' We formalize CAPM as a structural causal model and analyze the admissible three-node graphs linking an external driver $Z$, the market $R_m$, and an asset $R_i$. The empirically plausible baseline is a \emph{fork}, $Z \to \{R_m, R_i\}$, not $R_m \to R_i$. In this setting, OLS beta reflects not a causal transmission, but an attenuated proxy for how well $R_m$ captures the underlying driver $Z$. Consequently, ``beta-neutral'' portfolios can remain exposed to macro or sectoral shocks, and hedging on $R_m$ can import index-specific noise. Using stylized models and large-cap U.S.\ equity data, we show that contemporaneous betas act like proxies rather than mechanisms; any genuine market-to-stock channel, if at all, appears only at a lag and with modest economic significance. The practical message is clear: CAPM should be read as associational. Risk management and attribution should shift from fixed factor menus to explicitly declared causal paths, with ``alpha'' reserved for what remains invariant once those causal paths are explicitly blocked.</description>
