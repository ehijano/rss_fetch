      <title>Exploring Uncertainty Visualization for Degenerate Tensors in 3D Symmetric Second-Order Tensor Field Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric second-order tensors are fundamental in various scientific and engineering domains, as they can represent properties such as material stresses or diffusion processes in brain tissue. In recent years, several approaches have been introduced and improved to analyze these fields using topological features, such as degenerate tensor locations, i.e., the tensor has repeated eigenvalues, or normal surfaces. Traditionally, the identification of such features has been limited to single tensor fields. However, it has become common to create ensembles to account for uncertainties and variability in simulations and measurements. In this work, we explore novel methods for describing and visualizing degenerate tensor locations in 3D symmetric second-order tensor field ensembles. We base our considerations on the tensor mode and analyze its practicality in characterizing the uncertainty of degenerate tensor locations before proposing a variety of visualization strategies to effectively communicate degenerate tensor information. We demonstrate our techniques for synthetic and simulation data sets. The results indicate that the interplay of different descriptions for uncertainty can effectively convey information on degenerate tensor locations.</description>

      <title>Learned Single-Pass Multitasking Perceptual Graphics for Immersive Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersive displays are advancing rapidly in terms of delivering perceptually realistic images by utilizing emerging perceptual graphics methods such as foveated rendering. In practice, multiple such methods need to be performed sequentially for enhanced perceived quality. However, the limited power and computational resources of the devices that drive immersive displays make it challenging to deploy multiple perceptual models simultaneously.
  We address this challenge by proposing a computationally-lightweight, text-guided, learned multitasking perceptual graphics model. Given RGB input images, our model outputs perceptually enhanced images by performing one or more perceptual tasks described by the provided text prompts. Our model supports a variety of perceptual tasks, including foveated rendering, dynamic range enhancement, image denoising, and chromostereopsis, through multitask learning. Uniquely, a single inference step of our model supports different permutations of these perceptual tasks at different prompted rates (i.e., mildly, lightly), eliminating the need for daisy-chaining multiple models to get the desired perceptual effect. We train our model on our new dataset of source and perceptually enhanced images, and their corresponding text prompts. We evaluate our model's performance on embedded platforms and validate the perceptual quality of our model through a user study. Our method achieves on-par quality with the state-of-the-art task-specific methods using a single inference step, while offering faster inference speeds and flexibility to blend effects at various intensities.</description>

      <title>Topological Simplifcation of Jacobi Sets for Piecewise-Linear Bivariate 2D Scalar Fields with Adjustment of the Underlying Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jacobi sets are an important tool to study the relationship between functions. Defined as the set of all points where the function's gradients are linearly dependent, Jacobi sets extend the notion of critical point to multifields. In practice, Jacobi sets for piecewise-linear approximations of smooth functions can become very complex and large due to noise and numerical errors. Existing methods that simplify Jacobi sets exist, but either do not address how the functions' values have to change in order to have simpler Jacobi sets or remain purely theoretical. In this paper, we present a method that modifies 2D bivariate scalar fields such that Jacobi set components that are due to noise are removed, while preserving the essential structures of the fields. The method uses the Jacobi set to decompose the domain, stores the and weighs the resulting regions in a neighborhood graph, which is then used to determine which regions to join by collapsing the image of the region's cells. We investigate the influence of different tie-breaks when building the neighborhood graphs and the treatment of collapsed cells. We apply our algorithm to a range of datasets, both analytical and real-world and compare its performance to simple data smoothing.</description>

      <title>Interactive Character Control with Auto-Regressive Motion Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time character control is an essential component for interactive experiences, with a broad range of applications, including physics simulations, video games, and virtual reality. The success of diffusion models for image synthesis has led to the use of these models for motion synthesis. However, the majority of these motion diffusion models are primarily designed for offline applications, where space-time models are used to synthesize an entire sequence of frames simultaneously with a pre-specified length. To enable real-time motion synthesis with diffusion model that allows time-varying controls, we propose A-MDM (Auto-regressive Motion Diffusion Model). Our conditional diffusion model takes an initial pose as input, and auto-regressively generates successive motion frames conditioned on the previous frame. Despite its streamlined network architecture, which uses simple MLPs, our framework is capable of generating diverse, long-horizon, and high-fidelity motion sequences. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of techniques for incorporating interactive controls into A-MDM, such as task-oriented sampling, in-painting, and hierarchical reinforcement learning. These techniques enable a pre-trained A-MDM to be efficiently adapted for a variety of new downstream tasks. We conduct a comprehensive suite of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of A-MDM, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art auto-regressive methods.</description>

      <title>Nearest Neighbor Classification for Classical Image Upsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a set of ordered pixel data in the form of an image, our goal is to perform upsampling on the data such that: the resulting resolution is improved by some factor, the final result passes the human test, having added new, believable, and realistic information and detail to the image, the time complexity for upscaling is relatively close to that of lossy upscaling implementations.</description>
