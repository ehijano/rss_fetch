      <title>MetamatBench: Integrating Heterogeneous Data, Computational Tools, and Visual Interface for Metamaterial Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials, engineered materials with architected structures across multiple length scales, offer unprecedented and tunable mechanical properties that surpass those of conventional materials. However, leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) for metamaterial discovery is hindered by three fundamental challenges: (C1) Data Heterogeneity Challenge arises from heterogeneous data sources, heterogeneous composition scales, and heterogeneous structure categories; (C2) Model Complexity Challenge stems from the intricate geometric constraints of ML models, which complicate their adaptation to metamaterial structures; and (C3) Human-AI Collaboration Challenge comes from the "dual black-box'' nature of sophisticated ML models and the need for intuitive user interfaces. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a unified framework, named MetamatBench, that operates on three levels. (1) At the data level, we integrate and standardize 5 heterogeneous, multi-modal metamaterial datasets. (2) The ML level provides a comprehensive toolkit that adapts 17 state-of-the-art ML methods for metamaterial discovery. It also includes a comprehensive evaluation suite with 12 novel performance metrics with finite element-based assessments to ensure accurate and reliable model validation. (3) The user level features a visual-interactive interface that bridges the gap between complex ML techniques and non-ML researchers, advancing property prediction and inverse design of metamaterials for research and applications. MetamatBench offers a unified platform deployed at http://zhoulab-1.cs.vt.edu:5550 that enables machine learning researchers and practitioners to develop and evaluate new methodologies in metamaterial discovery. For accessibility and reproducibility, we open-source our benchmark and the codebase at https://github.com/cjpcool/Metamaterial-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Measuring deviations from a perfectly circular cross-section of an optical nanofiber at the \r{A}ngstr\"om scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tapered optical fibers (TOFs) with sub-wavelength-diameter waists, known as optical nanofibers, are powerful tools for interfacing quantum emitters and nanophotonics. These applications demand stable polarization of the fiber-guided light field. However, the linear birefringence resulting from \r{A}ngstr\"om-scale deviations in the nanofiber's ideally circular cross-section can lead to significant polarization changes within millimeters of light propagation. Here, we experimentally investigate such deviations using two in-situ approaches. First, we measure the resonance frequencies of hundreds of flexural modes along the nanofiber, which exhibit splitting due to the non-circular cross section. By analyzing the mean resonance frequencies of each pair and the corresponding frequency splitting, we conclude that the nanofiber can be well described as having an elliptical cross-section with a mean radius of 255.6(9) nm, where the semi-axes differ by only about 2\r{A}. Second, we monitor the polarization of the guided light field by imaging the light scattered out of the nanofiber and observe a periodic polarization change along it. From the linear birefringence due to the elliptical cross-section, we infer a comparable difference in the semi-axes as the first method, and determine the orientation of the polarization eigenaxes. Our work is crucial for any fundamental or applied study that requires a well-controlled interaction between guided light and matter, in particular for quantum memories, frequency conversion, or lasing that require a large interaction length.</description>

      <title>High-precision laser spectrum analyzer via digital decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous advancement of laser technology, accurately evaluating the noise spectrum of high-performance lasers has become increasingly challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a high-precision laser spectrum analyzer based on the proposed digital decoherence method, which can precisely measure the frequency noise spectrum of sub-Hz linewidth lasers. In addition, it has broad wavelength compatibility, which enables convenient switching between lasers with different center wavelengths. Its performance is validated through measurements of ultra-stable lasers. Based on the measured frequency noise power spectral density, a beta-line linewidth is determined to be 570 mHz at 10-second observation time, and the minimum observable linewidth is calculated to be 133 mHz. The system's noise floor is evaluated to be 210 mHz beta-line linewidth at 25-second observation time, and a minimum observable linewidth of 39 mHz.</description>

      <title>Optical computation of the divergence of a vector field using a metal-dielectric multilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically describe the optical computation of the divergence of a two-dimensional vector field, which is composed by the transverse electric field components of an incident light beam. The divergence is computed in reflection at oblique incidence of light on a layered structure. We show that in the particular case of a linearly polarized incident beam, the layered structure implementing the divergence operator also allows one to compute the gradient and perform the isotropic differentiation. As an example of a layered structure computing the divergence, we propose a metal-dielectric multilayer consisting of two pairs of metal and dielectric layers on a metal substrate. The presented numerical simulation results of the designed multilayer confirm that the divergence operator is computed with high accuracy. We also demonstrate the possibility of using the designed structure for optical directional differentiation and computation of the gradient and Laplace operators.</description>

      <title>All-optical discrete illumination-based compressed ultrafast photography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snapshot ultrafast optical imaging (SUOI) plays a vital role in capturing complex transient events in real time, with significant implications for both fundamental science and practical applications. As an outstanding talent in SUOI, compressed ultrafast photography (CUP) has demonstrated remarkable frame rate reaching trillions of frames per second and hundreds of sequence depth. Nevertheless, as CUP relies on streak cameras, the system's imaging fidelity suffers from an inevitable limitation induced by the charge coupling artifacts in a streak camera. Moreover, although advanced image reconstruction algorithms have improved the recovered scenes, its high compression ratio still causes a compromise in image quality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach termed all-optical discrete illumination compressed ultrafast photography (AOD-CUP), which employs a free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay (FACED) technique to temporally stretch femtosecond pulses and achieves discrete illumination for dynamic scenes. With its distinctive system architecture, AOD-CUP features adjustable frame numbers and flexible inter-frame intervals ranging from picoseconds to nanoseconds, thereby achieving high-fidelity ultrafast imaging in a snapshot. Experimental results demonstrate the system's superior dynamic spatial resolution and its capability to visualize ultrafast phenomena with complex spatial details, such as stress wave propagation in LiF crystals and air plasma channel formation. These results highlight the potential of AOD-CUP for high-fidelity, real-time ultrafast imaging, which provides an unprecedented tool for advancing the frontiers of ultrafast science.</description>

      <title>Negative absolute temperature attractor in a dense photon gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics permits to connect the macroscopic properties of matter with the laws governing the evolution of its microscopic constituents. Such an approach has been very successful for systems of particles governed by either classical or quantum mechanics. In a classical gas, different thermodynamic laws apply to the weakly or strongly interacting particles of an ideal or real gas, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that a similar situation occurs for a gas of photons, which is contained in a finite-dimensional box such as a multimode waveguide. We use a few-mode system provided by a standard step-index fiber operated below cutoff, which permits to prepare a high-density gas of photons. We show that, owing to the attractive potential energy contribution to the photon energy induced by the nonlinear Kerr effect, the mode population exhibits a spontaneous inversion from the fundamental to the highest-order mode, as the input laser beam power grows larger. This inversion of the mode power distribution leads to a stable attractor for the output beam, and is associated with a progressive increase of the optical temperature until a flip of its sign leads to a new regime of negative absolute temperatures. Our work demonstrates the ability to all-optically control the shape of laser beams, which is a prerequisite for applications in high-power laser sources, nonlinear imaging, and optical communication systems.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Broadband plug-and-play photonic circuit packaging with sub-dB loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) offer transformative potential for computing systems, enabling high-bandwidth neuromorphic processors and facilitating low decoherence quantum computing on a chip scale platform. However, the development of robust and scalable optical packaging solutions remains a major challenge. Efficient fiber-to-chip coupling is essential for minimizing loss and enabling high optical bandwidth, key requirements for photonic computing. Here, we introduce a novel plug-and-play solution for fiber-to-PIC connections using female multi-fiber termination push-on cables and additively fabricate the alignment counterpart on the circuit via two-photon polymerization. We develop 3D out-of-plane couplers, offering a peak transmission of -0.41 dB and broadband performance with losses below 0.55 dB across the 1500-1600 nm range. Integration of the couplers with the plug-and-play solution adds in average only 0.37+-0.12 dB of loss, setting a record in passive out-of-plane packaging solution with losses of 0.78 dB, as well as -0.5 dB bandwidth greater than 100 nm. We characterize the reproducibility of this out-of-plane packaging solution in terms of losses, as well as bandwidth by interfacing a 17-port photonic circuit for incoherent photonic computing. The high bandwidth of the packaging is crucial to couple the full 100 nm bandwidth spectrum of a superluminescent light emitting diode, which consequently enables low noise computing at 17.6 GBaud. Our concept enables multiport, passive and reconfigurable photonic integrated circuit packaging providing reliability and versatility driving photonic packaging towards the scalability and robustness of electric chip packaging.</description>

      <title>Integrated angstrom-tunable polarization-resolved solid-state photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of high-quality solid-state photon sources is essential to nano optics, quantum photonics, and related fields. A key objective of this research area is to develop tunable photon sources that not only enhance the performance but also offer dynamic functionalities. However, the realization of compact and robust photon sources with precise and wide range tunability remains a long-standing challenge. Moreover, the lack of an effective approach to integrate nanoscale photon sources with dynamic systems has hindered tunability beyond mere spectral adjustments, such as simultaneous polarization control. Here we propose a platform based on quantum emitter (QE) embedded metasurfaces (QEMS) integrated with a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-positioned microcavity, enabling on-chip multi-degree control of solid-state photon sources. Taking advantages of MEMS-QEMS, we show that typically broadband room-temperature emission from nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy centres can be narrowed to 3.7 nm and dynamically tuned with angstrom resolution. Furthermore, we design a wavelength-polarization-multiplexed QEMS and demonstrate polarization-resolved control of the MEMS-QEMS emission in a wide wavelength range (650 nm to 700 nm) along with polarization switching at sub-millisecond timescales. We believe that the proposed MEMS-QEMS platform can be adapted for most existing QEs, significantly expanding their room-temperature capabilities and thereby enhancing their potential for advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Dual-Wavelength Brillouin Lasers as compact Opto-Terahertz References for Low-Noise Microwave Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact, ultra-low phase noise 10 GHz signals are essential for modern radar, coherent communications, and time-frequency metrology, especially with rising demands for additional spectral purity and portability. Optical frequency division (OFD) of ultra-stable optical references produce the lowest noise microwaves, but typically rely on ultra-low-expansion cavities, self-referenced frequency combs, pulse interleaving, and high-end photodetectors. In contrast, electro-optic frequency division (eOFD) offers a streamlined alternative in which an electro-optic (EO) comb is generated from a microwave source and stabilized to an optically carried terahertz (opto-terahertz) reference. eOFD has already demonstrated comparable phase noise to OFD at 10, 20, and 40 GHz when using division ratios from references spanning over 1 THz, requiring broad EO comb spectra to bridge between optical signals. Generating such broad spectra often demands complex techniques such as cascaded modulators, pulse compression, and nonlinear fiber. We demonstrate a compact, low-noise 300 GHz opto-terahertz reference utilizing a dual-wavelength Brillouin laser within a total system volume of 20 liters. The 300 GHz phase noise of this system is transferred to a 10 GHz dielectric resonant oscillator via eOFD using a simple architecture that could be miniaturized. The resulting microwave signal achieves phase noise levels of -130 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz, -150 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz, and -170 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz. This architecture drastically simplifies eOFD while maintaining state-of-the-art phase noise.</description>

      <title>Competition between heating and cooling effects in an optomechanical oscillator using a squeezed field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed light is a useful phenomenon that can be exploited to improve the sensitivity of specific classes of detectors based on optomechanical effects. Recently, there has been significant interest in the potential application of a squeezed field in the cooling of an optomechanical oscillator. It has been shown that this field could cool an oscillator below the standard limit of a coherent field. In this study, the effect of squeezed light was evaluated by explicitly examining the role of the squeezing parameters on the final effective temperature of the oscillator. The results show that the observed cooling and heating effects are strongly dependent on the squeezing parameters and the phase. Using an oscillator of 2$\pi\times$10.1 MHz driven by a 1064-nm laser, the lowest effective temperature and quantum number are three orders of magnitude smaller compared to the case of no squeezing; especially, these minimum values are obtained at the squeezing phase of about 0.8$\pi$. This study highlighted important insights for the optimization of cooling efficiency using squeezed light.</description>

      <title>Decoding Breast Cancer in X-ray Mammograms: A Multi-Parameter Approach Using Fractals, Multifractals, and Structural Disorder Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explored the fractal and multifractal characteristics of breast mammogram micrographs to identify quantitative biomarkers associated with breast cancer progression. In addition to conventional fractal and multifractal analyses, we employed a recently developed fractal-functional distribution method, which transforms fractal measures into Gaussian distributions for more robust statistical interpretation. Given the sparsity of mammogram intensity data, we also analyzed how variations in intensity thresholds, used for binary transformations of the fractal dimension, follow unique trajectories that may serve as novel indicators of disease progression. Our findings demonstrate that fractal, multifractal, and fractal-functional parameters effectively differentiate between benign and cancerous tissue. Furthermore, the threshold-dependent behavior of intensity-based fractal measures presents distinct patterns in cancer cases. To complement these analyses, we applied the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) light localization technique to quantify structural disorder at the microscopic level. This multi-parametric approach, integrating spatial complexity and structural disorder metrics, offers a promising framework for enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection.</description>

Abstract: Emerging two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer a promising platform for on-chip integrated photonics because of their unique optical and electronic properties. Their naturally passivated surfaces make them highly tolerant to lattice mismatch, enabling seamless heterogeneous integration by stacking different van der Waals materials, a crucial step in the development of advanced photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate the use of an inverse design wavelength demultiplexing waveguides for on-chip sorting and routing of distinct photoluminescence from the heterojunction formed by WS2 and WSe2 monolayers. The integrated nanophotonic chip splits and sorts excitonic emission into individual waveguides at room temperature. Our demonstration opens up new perspectives for integrating light sources in van der Waals materials with functional integrated photonics, offering a versatile platform for both fundamental research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Can 2D materials enable passively $Q$-switched lasers in the nanoscale?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving compact on-chip pulsed lasers with attractive performance metrics and compatibility with the silicon photonics platform is an important, yet elusive, goal in contemporary nanophotonics. Here, the fundamental question of whether 2D materials can be utilized as both gain and saturable absorption media to enable compact integrated passively Q-switched nanophotonic lasers is posed and addressed by examining a broad range of 2D material families. The study is conducted by developing a temporal coupled-mode theory framework involving semi-classical rate equations that is capable of rigorously handling gain and saturable absorption by 2D materials, allowing to perform stability and bifurcation analysis covering broad parameter spaces. The range of pulse-train metrics (repetition rate, pulse width, peak power) that can be obtained via different 2D materials is thoroughly assessed. Our work illustrates that nanophotonic cavities enhanced with 2D materials can enable passive Q-switching with repetition rates ranging up to 50~GHz, short pulse duration down to few picoseconds, and peak power exceeding several milliwatts. Such attractive metrics, along with the ultrathin nature of 2D materials and the ability to electrically tune their properties, demonstrate the potential of the proposed platform for compact and flexible integrated laser sources.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of a strange nonchaotic attractor in a Nd:YVO4 laser with saturable absorber</title>

Abstract: The diode-pumped Nd: Vanadate laser is one of the most widely used lasers in the near-infrared range. Using passive Q-switching with a Cr:YAG saturable absorber (SA), it generates nanosecond pulses at tens of kilohertz. This laser is known to exhibit low-dimensional deterministic chaos. In this letter, we present experimental evidence of a strange nonchaotic attractor (SNA). SNAs exhibit complex dynamical behavior that is neither periodic nor chaotic, making them difficult to detect in real-world systems. They are typically observed in systems modeled by equations and arise through a route to chaos. By experimentally obtaining time series of two laser variables, we reconstruct the underlying attractor. For a certain position of the SA, we find that all Lyapunov exponents are negative and that the energy spectra exhibit a broad frequency range, indicating that the attractor is nonchaotic and lacks periodicity. Using Higuchi's method, we estimate the fractal dimension df and find that 13% of the nonchaotic time series exhibit a well-defined non-integer df, confirming the presence of an SNA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental observation of a strange nonchaotic attractor in a complex optical system.</description>

      <title>Dissipative chaos and steady state of open Tavis-Cummings dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupled atom-photon system described by the Tavis-Cummings dimer (two coupled cavities) in the presence of photon loss and atomic pumping, to investigate the quantum signature of dissipative chaos. The appropriate classical limit of the model allows us to obtain a phase diagram identifying different dynamical phases, especially the onset of chaos. Both classically and quantum mechanically, we demonstrate the emergence of a steady state in the chaotic regime and analyze its properties. The interplay between quantum fluctuation and chaos leads to enhanced mixing dynamics and dephasing, resulting in the formation of an incoherent photonic fluid. The steady state exhibits an intriguing phenomenon of subsystem thermalization even outside the chaotic regime; however, its effective temperature increases with the degree of chaos. Moreover, the statistical properties of the steady state show a close connection with the random matrix theory. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Shift photocurrent vortices from topological polarization textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the recent interest in van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics, topologically nontrivial polar structures have been predicted to form in twisted bilayers. However, these structures have proven difficult to observe experimentally. We propose that these textures may be probed optically by showing that topological polarization textures result in exotic nonlinear optical responses. We derive this relationship analytically using non-Abelian Berry connections and a quantum-geometric framework, supported by tight-binding and first-principles calculations. For the case of moir\'e materials without centrosymmetry, which form networks of polar merons and antimerons, the shift photoconductivity forms a vortex-like structure in real space. For a range of frequencies where transitions between topologically trivial bands occur at the Brillouin zone edge, the shift photocurrents are antiparallel to the in-plane electronic polarization field. Our findings highlight the interplay between complex polarization textures and nonlinear optical responses in vdW materials and provide a sought-after strategy for their experimental detection.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Coherent States with Phase-Insensitive Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By combining multiple copies of noisy coherent states of light (or other bosonic systems), it is possible to obtain a single mode in a state with lesser noise, a process known as distillation or purification of coherent states. We investigate the distillation of coherent states from coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations, and find a distillation protocol that is optimal in the asymptotic regime, i.e., when the number of input copies is much greater than 1. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, the error -- as quantified by infidelity (one minus the fidelity) of the output state with the desired coherent state -- is proportional to the inverse of the purity of coherence of the input state, a quantity obtained from the Right-Logarithmic-Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric, hence revealing an operational interpretation of this quantity. The heart of this protocol is a phase-insensitive channel that optimally converts an input coherent thermal state with high amplitude, into an output with significantly lower amplitude and temperature. Under this channel, the purity of coherence remains asymptotically conserved. While both the input and desired output are Gaussian states, we find that the optimal protocol cannot be a Gaussian channel. Among Gaussian phase-insensitive channels, the optimal distillation protocol is a simple linear optical scheme that can be implemented with beam splitters.</description>

      <title>Separating orders of response in transient absorption and coherent multi-dimensional spectroscopy by intensity variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpretation of time-resolved spectroscopies such as transient absorption (TA) or two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy often relies on the perturbative description of light-matter interaction. In many cases the third order of nonlinear response is the leading and desired term. When pulse amplitudes are high, higher orders of light-matter interaction can both distort lineshapes and dynamics and provide valuable information. Here, we present a general procedure to separately measure the nonlinear response orders in both TA and 2D spectroscopies, using linear combinations of intensity-dependent spectra. We analyze the residual contamination and random errors and show how to choose optimal intensities to minimize the total error in the extracted orders. For an experimental demonstration, we separate the nonlinear orders in the 2D electronic spectroscopy of squaraine polymers up to 11$^{th}$ order.</description>
