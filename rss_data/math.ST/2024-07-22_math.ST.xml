      <title>On the Frequentist Coverage of Bayes Posteriors in Nonlinear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic frequentist coverage and Gaussian approximation of Bayes posterior credible sets in nonlinear inverse problems when a Gaussian prior is placed on the parameter of the PDE. The aim is to ensure valid frequentist coverage of Bayes credible intervals when estimating continuous linear functionals of the parameter. Our results show that Bayes credible intervals have conservative coverage under certain smoothness assumptions on the parameter and a compatibility condition between the likelihood and the prior, regardless of whether an efficient limit exists and/or Bernstein von-Mises theorem holds. In the latter case, our results yield a corollary with more relaxed sufficient conditions than previous works. We illustrate practical utility of the results through the example of estimating the conductivity coefficient of a second order elliptic PDE, where a near-$N^{-1/2}$ contraction rate and conservative coverage results are obtained for linear functionals that were shown not to be estimable efficiently.</description>

      <title>Regression Adjustment for Estimating Distributional Treatment Effects in Randomized Controlled Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the issue of estimating and inferring the distributional treatment effects in randomized experiments. The distributional treatment effect provides a more comprehensive understanding of treatment effects by characterizing heterogeneous effects across individual units, as opposed to relying solely on the average treatment effect. To enhance the precision of distributional treatment effect estimation, we propose a regression adjustment method that utilizes the distributional regression and pre-treatment information. Our method is designed to be free from restrictive distributional assumptions. We establish theoretical efficiency gains and develop a practical, statistically sound inferential framework. Through extensive simulation studies and empirical applications, we illustrate the substantial advantages of our method, equipping researchers with a powerful tool for capturing the full spectrum of treatment effects in experimental research.</description>

      <title>Learning Firmly Nonexpansive Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven approach for constructing firmly nonexpansive operators. We demonstrate its applicability in Plug-and-Play methods, where classical algorithms such as forward-backward splitting, Chambolle--Pock primal-dual iteration, Douglas--Rachford iteration or alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM), are modified by replacing one proximal map by a learned firmly nonexpansive operator. We provide sound mathematical background to the problem of learning such an operator via expected and empirical risk minimization. We prove that, as the number of training points increases, the empirical risk minimization problem converges (in the sense of Gamma-convergence) to the expected risk minimization problem. Further, we derive a solution strategy that ensures firmly nonexpansive and piecewise affine operators within the convex envelope of the training set. We show that this operator converges to the best empirical solution as the number of points in the envelope increases in an appropriate sense. Finally, the experimental section details practical implementations of the method and presents an application in image denoising.</description>

      <title>Time series on compact spaces, with an application to dynamic modeling of relative abundance data in Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the dynamic modeling of relative abundance data in ecology, we introduce a general approach to model stationary Markovian or non Markovian time series on (relatively) compact spaces such as a hypercube, the simplex or a sphere in the Euclidean space. Our approach is based on a general construction of infinite memory models, called chains with complete connections. The two main ingredients involved in our generic construction are a parametric family of probability distributions on the state space and a map from the state space to the parameter space. Our framework encompasses Markovian models, observation-driven models and more general infinite memory models. Simple conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of a stationary and ergodic path are given. We then study in more details statistical inference in two time series models on the simplex, based on either a Dirichlet or a multivariate logistic-normal conditional distribution. Usefulness of our models to analyze abundance data in ecosystems is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Posterior Concentration for Gaussian Process Priors under Rescaled and Hierarchical Mat\'ern and Confluent Hypergeometric Covariance Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nonparameteric Bayesian approaches, Gaussian stochastic processes can serve as priors on real-valued function spaces. Existing literature on the posterior convergence rates under Gaussian process priors shows that it is possible to achieve optimal or near-optimal posterior contraction rates if the smoothness of the Gaussian process matches that of the target function. Among those priors, Gaussian processes with a parametric Mat\'ern covariance function is particularly notable in that its degree of smoothness can be determined by a dedicated smoothness parameter. \citet{ma2022beyond} recently introduced a new family of covariance functions called the Confluent Hypergeometric (CH) class that simultaneously possess two parameters: one controls the tail index of the polynomially decaying covariance function, and the other parameter controls the degree of mean-squared smoothness analogous to the Mat\'ern class. In this paper, we show that with proper choice of rescaling parameters in the Mat\'ern and CH covariance functions, it is possible to obtain the minimax optimal posterior contraction rate for $\eta$-regular functions for nonparametric regression model with fixed design. Unlike the previous results for unrescaled cases, the smoothness parameter of the covariance function need not equal $\eta$ for achieving the optimal minimax rate, for either rescaled Mat\'ern or rescaled CH covariances, illustrating a key benefit for rescaling. We also consider a fully Bayesian treatment of the rescaling parameters and show the resulting posterior distributions still contract at the minimax-optimal rate. The resultant hierarchical Bayesian procedure is fully adaptive to the unknown true smoothness.</description>

      <title>Separation rates for the detection of synchronization of interacting point processes in a mean field frame. Application to neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and study a statistical test to detect synchrony in spike trains. Our test is based on the number of coincidences between two trains of spikes. The data are supplied in the form of \(n\) pairs (assumed to be independent) of spike trains. The aim is to assess whether the two trains in a pair are also independent. Our approach is based on previous results of Albert et al. (2015, 2019) and Kim et al. (2022) that we extend to our setting, focusing on the construction of a non-asymptotic criterion ensuring the detection of synchronization in the framework of permutation tests. Our criterion is constructed such that it ensures the control of the Type II error, while the Type I error is controlled by construction. We illustrate our results within two classical models of interacting neurons, the jittering Poisson model and Hawkes processes having \(M\) components interacting in a mean field frame and evolving in stationary regime. For this latter model, we obtain a lower bound of the size \(n\) of the sample necessary to detect the dependency between two neurons.</description>

      <title>Global optimality under amenable symmetry constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a convex function that is invariant under an group of transformations. If it has a minimizer, does it also have an invariant minimizer? Variants of this problem appear in nonparametric statistics and in a number of adjacent fields. The answer depends on the choice of function, and on what one may loosely call the geometry of the problem -- the interplay between convexity, the group, and the underlying vector space, which is typically infinite-dimensional. We observe that this geometry is completely encoded in the smallest closed convex invariant subsets of the space, and proceed to study these sets, for groups that are amenable but not necessarily compact. We then apply this toolkit to the invariant optimality problem. It yields new results on invariant kernel mean embeddings and risk-optimal invariant couplings, and clarifies relations between seemingly distinct ideas, such as the summation trick used in machine learning to construct equivariant neural networks and the classic Hunt-Stein theorem of statistics.</description>

      <title>Convex relaxation for the generalized maximum-entropy sampling problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized maximum-entropy sampling problem (GMESP) is to select an order-$s$ principal submatrix from an order-$n$ covariance matrix, to maximize the product of its $t$ greatest eigenvalues, $0&lt;t\leq s &lt;n$. Introduced more than 25 years ago, GMESP is a natural generalization of two fundamental problems in statistical design theory: (i) maximum-entropy sampling problem (MESP); (ii) binary D-optimality (D-Opt). In the general case, it can be motivated by a selection problem in the context of principal component analysis (PCA).
  We introduce the first convex-optimization based relaxation for GMESP, study its behavior, compare it to an earlier spectral bound, and demonstrate its use in a branch-and-bound scheme. We find that such an approach is practical when $s-t$ is very small.</description>

      <title>L\'evy Area Analysis and Parameter Estimation for fOU Processes via Non-Geometric Rough Path Theory</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation problem of an unknown drift parameter matrix for a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in a multi-dimensional setting. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach based on rough path theory that allows us to construct pathwise rough path estimators from both continuous and discrete observations of a single path. Our approach is particularly suitable for high-frequency data. To formulate the parameter estimators, we introduce a theory of pathwise It\^o integrals with respect to fractional Brownian motion. By establishing the regularity of fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and analyzing the long-term behavior of the associated L\'evy area processes, we demonstrate that our estimators are strongly consistent and pathwise stable. Our findings offer a new perspective on estimating the drift parameter matrix for fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in multi-dimensional settings, and may have practical implications for fields including finance, economics, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Conditional Generative Models are Provably Robust: Pointwise Guarantees for Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Conditional generative models became a very powerful tool to sample from Bayesian inverse problem posteriors. It is well-known in classical Bayesian literature that posterior measures are quite robust with respect to perturbations of both the prior measure and the negative log-likelihood, which includes perturbations of the observations. However, to the best of our knowledge, the robustness of conditional generative models with respect to perturbations of the observations has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we prove for the first time that appropriately learned conditional generative models provide robust results for single observations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for High-dimensional Time Series by Latent Process Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series data arising in many applications nowadays are high-dimensional. A large number of parameters describe features of these time series. We propose a novel approach to modeling a high-dimensional time series through several independent univariate time series, which are then orthogonally rotated and sparsely linearly transformed. With this approach, any specified intrinsic relations among component time series given by a graphical structure can be maintained at all time snapshots. We call the resulting process an Orthogonally-rotated Univariate Time series (OUT). Key structural properties of time series such as stationarity and causality can be easily accommodated in the OUT model. For Bayesian inference, we put suitable prior distributions on the spectral densities of the independent latent times series, the orthogonal rotation matrix, and the common precision matrix of the component times series at every time point. A likelihood is constructed using the Whittle approximation for univariate latent time series. An efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for posterior computation. We study the convergence of the pseudo-posterior distribution based on the Whittle likelihood for the model's parameters upon developing a new general posterior convergence theorem for pseudo-posteriors. We find that the posterior contraction rate for independent observations essentially prevails in the OUT model under very mild conditions on the temporal dependence described in terms of the smoothness of the corresponding spectral densities. Through a simulation study, we compare the accuracy of estimating the parameters and identifying the graphical structure with other approaches. We apply the proposed methodology to analyze a dataset on different industrial components of the US gross domestic product between 2010 and 2019 and predict future observations.</description>
