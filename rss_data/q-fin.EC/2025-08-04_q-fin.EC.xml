      <title>Channel Choice and Customer Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of digital shopping channels has prompted many traditional retailers to invest in e-commerce websites and mobile apps. While prior literature shows that multichannel customers tend to be more valuable, it overlooks how the reason for adopting a new channel may shape post-adoption behavior. Using transaction-level data from a major Brazilian pet supplies retailer, we examine how adoption of online shopping - by previously offline-only customers - affects post-adoption spend, profitability, and channel usage. We study four distinct adoption pathways: organic adoption, adoption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Black Friday promotions, and a newly launched loyalty program. We find that although all adopter groups increase their spending relative to offline-only customers, post-adoption behavior differs based on the reason for adoption. COVID-19 adopters behave similarly to organic adopters in terms of spending, but show greater offline stickiness consistent with consumer inertia and habit theory, yielding higher profits due to higher offline margins. In contrast, promotion-driven adopters spend less post-adoption due to forward buying and exhibit lower profitability. Our findings caution against treating all multichannel customers as equal and highlight the importance of incorporating behavioral theories into forecasting and targeting strategies. Firms should account for adoption motives when evaluating channel and promotional investments.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Macroeconomic Impacts of Disasters: an Updated Multi-Regional Impact Assessment (MRIA) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disasters often impact supply chains, leading to cascading effects across regions. While unaffected regions may attempt to compensate, their ability is constrained by their available production capacity and logistical constraints between regions. This study introduces a Multi-Regional Impact Assessment (MRIA) model to evaluate the regional and macroeconomic consequences of disasters, capturing regional post-disaster trade dynamics and logistical constraints. Our findings emphasize that enhancing production capacity alone is inadequate; regional trade flexibility must also be improved to mitigate disaster impacts. At the regional level, disaster-affected areas experience severe negative impacts, whereas larger, export-oriented regions benefit from increased production activity. Additionally, we propose a sectoral criticality assessment alongside the more common sensitivity and incremental disruption analysis, which effectively identifies sectors with low redundancy while accounting for the potential for regional substitution in a post-disaster scenario.</description>

      <title>Systemic Trade Risk Suppresses Comparative Advantage in Rare Earth Dependent Industries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical to a wide range of clean and high-tech applications, yet global trade dependencies expose countries to vulnerabilities across production networks. Here, we construct a multi-tiered input-output trade network spanning 168 REE-related product codes from 2007-2023 using a novel AI-augmented statistical framework. We identify significant differences between dependencies in upstream and intermediate (input) products, revealing that exposure and supplier concentration are systematically higher in input products, while systemic trade risk is lower, suggesting localized vulnerabilities. By computing network-based dependency indicators across countries and over time, we classify economies into five distinct clusters that capture structural differences in rare-earth reliance. China dominates the low-risk, high-influence cluster, while the EU and US remain vulnerable at intermediate tiers. Regression analyses show that high exposure across all products predicts future export strength, consistent with import substitution. However, high systemic trade risk in input products like magnets, advanced ceramics or phosphors, significantly impedes the development of comparative advantage. These results demonstrate that the structure of strategic dependencies is tier-specific, with critical implications for industrial resilience and policy design. Effective mitigation strategies must move beyond raw material access and directly address country-specific chokepoints in midstream processing and critical input production.</description>

      <title>Generative AI in Higher Education: Evidence from an Elite College</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is transforming higher education, yet systematic evidence on student adoption remains limited. Using novel survey data from a selective U.S. college, we document over 80 percent of students using AI academically within two years of ChatGPT's release. Adoption varies across disciplines, demographics, and achievement levels, highlighting AI's potential to reshape educational inequalities. Students predominantly use AI for augmenting learning (e.g., explanations, feedback), but also to automate tasks (e.g., essay generation). Positive perceptions of AI's educational benefits strongly predict adoption. Institutional policies can influence usage patterns but risk creating unintended disparate impacts across student groups due to uneven compliance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating COVID 19 Feature Contributions to Bitcoin Return Forecasting: Methodology Based on LightGBM and Genetic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel methodological framework integrating a LightGBM regression model and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization to systematically evaluate the contribution of COVID-19-related indicators to Bitcoin return prediction. The primary objective was not merely to forecast Bitcoin returns but rather to determine whether including pandemic-related health data significantly enhances prediction accuracy. A comprehensive dataset comprising daily Bitcoin returns and COVID-19 metrics (vaccination rates, hospitalizations, testing statistics) was constructed. Predictive models, trained with and without COVID-19 features, were optimized using GA over 31 independent runs, allowing robust statistical assessment. Performance metrics (R2, RMSE, MAE) were statistically compared through distribution overlaps and Mann-Whitney U tests. Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results indicate that COVID-19 indicators significantly improved model performance, particularly in capturing extreme market fluctuations (R2 increased by 40%, RMSE decreased by 2%, both highly significant statistically). Among COVID-19 features, vaccination metrics, especially the 75th percentile of fully vaccinated individuals, emerged as dominant predictors. The proposed methodology extends existing financial analytics tools by incorporating public health signals, providing investors and policymakers with refined indicators to navigate market uncertainty during systemic crises.</description>

      <title>Risk Premia in the Bitcoin Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the first and second moment risk premia in the Bitcoin market based on options and realized returns and contrast them to the premia embedded in the main US stock index market. First, Bitcoin is much more volatile and has a higher variance risk premium than the S&amp;P 500. By decomposing the return premium into different regions of the return state space, we find that while most of the S&amp;P 500 equity premium comes from mildly negative returns, the corresponding negative Bitcoin returns (between three and one standard deviations) account for only one-third of the total Bitcoin premium (BP). Further, applying a novel clustering algorithm to a collection of estimated Bitcoin option-implied risk-neutral densities, we find that risk premia vary over time as a function of two distinct market volatility regimes. The low-volatility regime implies a relatively high share of BP attributable to positive returns and a high Bitcoin Variance Risk Premium (BVRP). In high-volatility states, the BP attributable to positive and negative returns is more balanced, and the BVRP is lower. These results suggest Bitcoin investors are more concerned about variance and upside risk in a low-volatility regime.</description>
