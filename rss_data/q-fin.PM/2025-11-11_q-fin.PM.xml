      <title>Equilibrium Portfolio Selection under Utility-Variance Analysis of Log Returns in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a time-inconsistent portfolio selection problem in the incomplete mar ket model, integrating expected utility maximization with risk control. The objective functional
  balances the expected utility and variance on log returns, giving rise to time inconsistency and
  motivating the search of a time-consistent equilibrium strategy. We characterize the equilibrium
  via a coupled quadratic backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) system and establish
  the existence theory in two special cases: (i) two Brownian motions driven the price dynamics
  and the factor process are independent with $\rho = 0$; (ii) the trading strategy is constrained to
  be bounded. For the general case with correlation coefficient $\rho \neq 0$, we introduce the notion
  of an approximate time-consistent equilibrium. By employing the solution structure from the
  equilibrium in the case $\rho = 0$, we can construct an approximate time-consistent equilibrium in
  the general case with an error of order $O(\rho^2)$. Numerical examples and financial insights based
  on deep learning algorithms are also presented.</description>

      <title>Diffolio: A Diffusion Model for Multivariate Probabilistic Financial Time-Series Forecasting and Portfolio Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is crucial in multivariate financial time-series for constructing efficient portfolios that account for complex cross-sectional dependencies. In this paper, we propose Diffolio, a diffusion model designed for multivariate financial time-series forecasting and portfolio construction. Diffolio employs a denoising network with a hierarchical attention architecture, comprising both asset-level and market-level layers. Furthermore, to better reflect cross-sectional correlations, we introduce a correlation-guided regularizer informed by a stable estimate of the target correlation matrix. This structure effectively extracts salient features not only from historical returns but also from asset-specific and systematic covariates, significantly enhancing the performance of forecasts and portfolios. Experimental results on the daily excess returns of 12 industry portfolios show that Diffolio outperforms various probabilistic forecasting baselines in multivariate forecasting accuracy and portfolio performance. Moreover, in portfolio experiments, portfolios constructed from Diffolio's forecasts show consistently robust performance, thereby outperforming those from benchmarks by achieving higher Sharpe ratios for the mean-variance tangency portfolio and higher certainty equivalents for the growth-optimal portfolio. These results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed Diffolio in terms of not only statistical accuracy but also economic significance.</description>

      <title>Return Prediction for Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection: How Decision-Focused Learning Shapes Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09684v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markowitz laid the foundation of portfolio theory through the mean-variance optimization (MVO) framework. However, the effectiveness of MVO is contingent on the precise estimation of expected returns, variances, and covariances of asset returns, which are typically uncertain. Machine learning models are becoming useful in estimating uncertain parameters, and such models are trained to minimize prediction errors, such as mean squared errors (MSE), which treat prediction errors uniformly across assets. Recent studies have pointed out that this approach would lead to suboptimal decisions and proposed Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) as a solution, integrating prediction and optimization to improve decision-making outcomes. While studies have shown DFL's potential to enhance portfolio performance, the detailed mechanisms of how DFL modifies prediction models for MVO remain unexplored. This study investigates how DFL adjusts stock return prediction models to optimize decisions in MVO. Theoretically, we show that DFL's gradient can be interpreted as tilting the MSE-based prediction errors by the inverse covariance matrix, effectively incorporating inter-asset correlations into the learning process, while MSE treats each asset's error independently. This tilting mechanism leads to systematic prediction biases where DFL overestimates returns for assets included in portfolios while underestimating excluded assets. Our findings reveal why DFL achieves superior portfolio performance despite higher prediction errors. The strategic biases are features, not flaws.</description>
