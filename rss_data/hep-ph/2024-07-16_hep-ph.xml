      <title>A Nuclear Interferometer for Ultra-Light Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the nuclear interferometer - a single-photon interferometry experiment based upon the thorium-229 nuclear clock transition - as a novel detector for ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). Thanks to the enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the variation of fundamental constants, we find that possible realisations of such an experiment deploying either single ions or clouds of atoms have the potential to be complementary to advanced very-long-baseline terrestrial clock atom interferometers in the search for ultra-light dark matter with scalar couplings to photons. Nuclear interferometry may also offer an unparalleled window to new physics coupling to the QCD sector via quarks or gluons, with a discovery reach that could enhance existing and proposed experiments over a range of frequencies in the direction of well-motivated parameter space.</description>

      <title>Q-Balls in the Presence of Attractive Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons in field theories whose stability is typically guaranteed by the existence of a global conserved charge. A classic realization is the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin (FLS) Q-ball in a two-scalar system where a real scalar $\chi$ triggers the symmetry breaking and confining a complex scalar $\Phi$ with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. A quartic interaction $\kappa \chi^2|\Phi|^2$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ is usually considered to produce a nontrivial Q-ball configuration, and this repulsive force contributes to its stability. On the other hand, the attractive cubic interaction $\Lambda \chi |\Phi|^2$ is generally allowed in a renormalizable theory and could induce an instability. In this paper, we study the behavior of the Q-ball under the influence of this attractive force which has been overlooked. We find approximate Q-ball solutions in the limit of weak and moderate force couplings using the thin-wall and thick-wall approximations respectively. Our analytical results are consistent with numerical simulations and predict the parameter dependencies of the maximum charge. A crucial difference with the ordinary FLS Q-ball is the existence of the maximum charge beyond which the Q-ball solution is classically unstable. Such a limitation of the charge fundamentally affects Q-ball formation in the early Universe and could plausibly lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Model of Heavy Vector Singlets for the LHC and Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a simplified model of two colourless heavy vector resonances in the singlet representation of $SU(2)_{L}$, with zero and unit hypercharge. We discuss mixing with the Standard Model gauge bosons due to electroweak symmetry breaking, semi-analytic formulae for production at proton colliders, requirements to obey the narrow width approximation and selected low energy constraints. We show current LHC constraints and sensitivity projections for the HL-LHC, HE-LHC, SPPC and FCC-hh on the charged and neutral heavy vectors. The utility of the simplified model Lagrangian is demonstrated by matching these results onto three explicit models: a weakly coupled abelian extension of the Standard Model gauge group, a weakly coupled non-abelian extension and a strongly coupled minimal composite Higgs model. All our results are presented in terms of physical resonance masses, which are accurate even at vector masses near the electroweak scale due to a parameter inversion we derive. We discuss the importance of this inversion and point out that its effect, and the effects of electroweak symmetry breaking, can remain important up to resonance masses of several TeV. Finally, we clarify the relation between this simplified model and the Heavy Vector Triplet (HVT) model, a simplified model for heavy $SU(2)_{L}$ triplets with zero hypercharge, and provide exact and approximate matching relations.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole formation in the initial collapse of axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion dark matter thermalizes by gravitational self-interactions and forms a Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that the rethermalization of the axion fluid during the initial collapse of large scale overdensities near cosmic dawn transports angular momentum outward sufficientlly fast that black holes form with masses ranging from approximately $10^5$ to a few times $10^{10}~M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Axion-Photon Mixing in 3D: Classical Equations and Geometric Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light particle-photon mixing in magnetised plasmas plays a vital role in constraining the existence of new physics, especially axions, dark photons, and ultra-high-frequency gravitational waves. Recently, we derived an expression for the resonant conversion of axions to photons in inhomogeneous media using kinetic theory to derive photon transport equations. In this work, we show how the same expression for the conversion probability can be obtained from the classical wave equations of axion-electrodynamics by deriving an equivalent transport equation along the photon worldline. This result provides further corroboration of this expression for the resonant production of photons from light particles, which has also recently been supported by independent numerical simulations of full axion-electrodynamics. In addition, this new approach provides a more general expression that accounts for mixing away from resonance, which is integrated along the whole worldline of the photon in a way that naturally incorporates a curved photon trajectory relevant to refractive media where the photon and light-particle worldlines differ.</description>

      <title>Flavor and path-length dependence of jet quenching from inclusive jet and {\gamma}-jet suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the parametric approach to analyze jet suppression measured using the nuclear modification factor of inclusive jets, $b$-jets, and jets from $\gamma$-jet events. With minimum model assumptions, we quantify the magnitude of the average energy loss and its transverse momentum dependence. Then, we quantify the impact of fluctuations in the energy loss and nuclear PDFs on the measured jet suppression. Employing the Glauber model to infer the information about the collision geometry, we quantify the path-length dependence of the average energy loss, which is shown to be consistent with that expected for the radiative energy loss. Using the obtained parameterizations, we evaluate jet $v_2$, obtaining results consistent with measurements. We also provide model-independent predictions for the magnitude of energy loss expected in upcoming oxygen-oxygen collisions. Finally, we analyze intriguing features seen in the suppression of jets in the $\gamma$-jet system.</description>

      <title>Moment Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconvolving ("unfolding'') detector distortions is a critical step in the comparison of cross section measurements with theoretical predictions in particle and nuclear physics. However, most existing approaches require histogram binning while many theoretical predictions are at the level of statistical moments. We develop a new approach to directly unfold distribution moments as a function of another observable without having to first discretize the data. Our Moment Unfolding technique uses machine learning and is inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We demonstrate the performance of this approach using jet substructure measurements in collider physics. With this illustrative example, we find that our Moment Unfolding protocol is more precise than bin-based approaches and is as or more precise than completely unbinned methods.</description>

      <title>New physical processes for extracting GPDs with a better sensitivity to partonic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of exclusive processes for a better study of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), which we refer to as single-diffractive hard exclusive processes (SDHEPs). We advocate a two-stage framework for picturing SDHEPs based on the separation of scales, which gives a clear description both kinematically and dynamically. We examine the sensitivity of the SDHEP to the parton momentum fraction $x$-dependence of GPDs, and demonstrate it quantitatively with two specific processes that can be readily measured at J-PARC or AMBER using a pion beam and at JLab using a photon beam, respectively. Both processes are capable of providing enhanced sensitivity to the $x$-dependence, overcoming the problem of shadow GPDs, and disentangling different types of GPDs with various spin asymmetries.</description>

      <title>One-loop QCD amplitudes in the Feynman-Diagram gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes for the massless QCD process, $q\bar{q}\to q^\prime\bar{q}^\prime$, are calculated in the one-loop order in the Feynman-Diagram (FD) gauge, where gluons are quantized on the light cone with opposite direction of the three-momenta. We find non-decoupling of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts and non-conventional UV singularities in dimensional regularization. The known QCD amplitudes with asymptotic freedom are reproduced only after summing propagator and vertex corrections. By quantizing gluons in the Feynman gauge on the FD gauge background, we obtain the one-loop improved FD gauge amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) global QCD analysis of the proton's helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs), the first of its kind. To obtain the distributions, we use data for longitudinal spin asymmetries in inclusive and semi-inclusive lepton-nucleon scattering as well as in weak-boson and hadron or jet production in proton-proton scattering. We analyze the data using QCD perturbation theory at NNLO accuracy, employing approximations provided by the threshold resummation formalism in cases where full NNLO results for partonic hard-scattering functions are not readily available. Our numerical results suggest a remarkable perturbative stability of the extracted helicity PDFs.</description>

      <title>Particle Conversions Beyond the WKB Approximation and Solar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Dark Photon Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the conversion of kinetic mixing dark photon dark matter into gravitational waves within the magnetic field of the Sun. Our study reveals that the WKB approximation is invalid in this scenario. We derive an analytic solution for the conversion probability with unitary evolution feature. This solution aligns in form with previous studies on photon-gravitational wave conversion. Interestingly, it is applicable in situations where the WKB approximation fails. We extend the unitary evolution solution to other conversion processes, such as axion-photon and dark photon-photon conversions. When the WKB approximation conditions are met, this solution reduces to the WKB result. We compute the characteristic strain of gravitational waves resulting from dark photon conversion in the solar magnetic field, spanning frequencies from $10^{-5}$ Hz to $10^3$ Hz. Our findings indicate that the characteristic strain derived from the unitary evolution solution differs significantly from that of the WKB solution. The resulting strain signal is far below the sensitivity of current gravitational wave interferometers. Nevertheless, we have proposed an exotic gravitational wave source, especially at high frequencies, from the dark photon dark matter local conversion inside the Sun.</description>

      <title>Evolution of structure functions at NLO without PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution of the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) structure functions $F_2$ and $F_{\rm L}$ at next to leading order in $\alpha_s$ (NLO) directly in terms of the structure functions rather than parton distributions (PDFs). We call this the physical basis approach. In practice, we first express the NLO quark singlet and gluon PDFs in terms of the structure functions $F_2$ and $F_{\rm L}$ in momentum space. Employing these expressions in the DGLAP evolution, we arrive at the evolution equations for $F_2$ and $F_{\rm L}$ in the physical basis. We demonstrate how one is free from defining a factorization scale and scheme when using the physical basis evolution equations. We also discuss the process of applying the NLO physical basis to global analysis of LHC cross sections.</description>

      <title>Tying knots in particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lord Kelvin's pioneering hypothesis that the identity of atoms is knots of vortices of the aether had a profound impact on the fields of mathematics and physics despite being subsequently refuted by experiments. While knot-like excitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the fundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary particles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the appearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear as meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of particle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This result suggests that during the early Universe, a "knot dominated era" may have existed, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this scenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we propose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum tunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle physics and represent a modern version of Kelvin's hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that a measurement of the Higgs boson self-coupling becomes particularly meaningful when its sensitivity is within 40\% of its Standard Model value. This constitutes a target for a future impactful experimental achievement. It is derived from recently obtained results of how extreme the differences can be between effective field theory operator coefficients when their origins are from reasonable theories beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>A Generic Analysis of Nucleon Decay Branching Fractions in Flipped SU(5) Grand Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In flipped SU(5) grand unified theories, the partial decay lifetimes of certain nucleon decay channels depend generically on an unknown unitary matrix, which arises when left-handed lepton fields are embedded into anti-fundamental representations of SU(5). This dependency is particularly relevant when the neutrino mass matrix has a generic structure, introducing uncertainty in the prediction of nucleon decay branching fractions within flipped SU(5). In this paper, we demonstrate that this uncertainty can be parametrized using two parameters, which can be determined by measuring the partial lifetimes of $p \to \pi^0 e^+$, $p \to \pi^0 \mu^+$, and $n \to \pi^0 \bar{\nu}$. In addition, we establish upper limits on the ratios of the decay widths of these channels, offering a potential method to test flipped SU(5) in future nucleon decay experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a semi-empirical formula for calculating the nuclear matrix elements for two-neutrino double-beta decay. The proposed model (PM) dependence on the proton and neutron numbers, the pairing, isospin, and deformation properties of the initial and final nuclei is inspired by the insights offered by nuclear many-body methods. Compared with the previous phenomenological and nuclear models, the PM yields the best agreement with the experimental data. Its stability and predictive power are cross-validated, and predictions for nuclear systems of experimental interest are provided.</description>

      <title>A New Non-Renormalization Theorem from UV/IR Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a new non-renormalization theorem which arises from UV/IR mixing. This theorem and its corollaries are relevant for all four-dimensional tachyon-free closed string theories which can be realized from higher-dimensional theories via geometric compactifications. As such, they therefore apply regardless of the presence or absence of spacetime supersymmetry and regardless of the gauge symmetries or matter content involved. This theorem resolves a hidden clash between modular invariance and the process of decompactification, and enables us to uncover a number of surprising phenomenological properties of these theories. Chief among these is the fact that certain physical quantities within such theories cannot exhibit logarithmic or power-law running and instead enter an effective fixed-point regime above the compactification scale. This cessation of running occurs as the result of the UV/IR mixing inherent in the theory. These effects apply not only for gauge couplings but also for the Higgs mass and other quantities of phenomenological interest, thereby eliminating the logarithmic and/or power-law running that might have otherwise appeared for such quantities. These results illustrate the power of UV/IR mixing to tame divergences -- even without supersymmetry -- and reinforce the notion that UV/IR mixing may play a vital role in resolving hierarchy problems without supersymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of the false vacuum in the regime where the quantum field theory analysis is not valid, since gravitational effects become important. This happens when the height of the barrier separating the false and the true vacuum is large, and it has implications for the instability of de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua. We carry out the calculations for a scalar field with a potential coupled to gravity, and work within the thin-wall approximation, where the bubble wall is thin compared to the size of the bubble. We show that the false de Sitter vacuum is unstable, independently of the height of the potential and the relative depth of the true vacuum compared to the false vacuum. The false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua can be stable despite the existence of a lower energy true vacuum. However, when the relative depth of the true and false vacua exceeds a critical value, which depends on the potential of the false vacuum and the height of the barrier, then the false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua become unstable. We calculate the probability for the decay of the false de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua, as a function of the parameters characterizing the field potential.</description>

      <title>Fay identities for polylogarithms on higher-genus Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</description>

      <title>Holographic Lifshitz flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Without Lorentz symmetry, generic fixed points of the renormalization group (RG) are labelled by their dynamical (or `Lifshitz') exponent $z$. Hence, a rich variety of possible RG flows arises. The first example is already given by the standard non-relativistic limit, which can be viewed as the flow from a $z=1$ UV fixed point to a $z=2$ IR fixed point. In strongly coupled theories, there are good arguments suggesting that Lorentz invariance can emerge dynamically in the IR from a Lorentz violating UV. In this work, we perform a generic study of fixed points and the possible RG flows among them in a minimal bottom-up holographic model without Lorentz invariance, aiming to shed light on the possible options and the related phenomenology. We find: i) A minor generalization of previous models involving a massive vector field with allowed self-couplings leads to a much more efficient emergence of Lorentz invariance than in the previous attempts. Moreover, we find that generically the larger is the UV dynamical exponent $z_{UV}$ the faster is the recovery of Lorentz symmetry in the IR. ii) We construct explicitly a holographic model with a line of fixed points, realizing different Lifshitz scaling along the line. iii) We also confirm the monotonicity of a recently proposed a-function along all our Lorentz violating RG flows.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the branching fraction of $D^+_s\to \ell^+\nu_\ell$ via $e^+e^-\to D^{*+}_{s} D^{*-}_{s}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on $10.64~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data taken at center-of-mass energies between 4.237 and 4.699 GeV with the BESIII detector, we study the leptonic $D^+_s$ decays using the $e^+e^-\to D^{*+}_{s} D^{*-}_{s}$ process. The branching fractions of $D_s^+\to\ell^+\nu_{\ell}\,(\ell=\mu,\tau)$ are measured to be $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+\to\mu^+\nu_\mu)=(\bfmuv)\%$ and $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+\to\tau^+\nu_\tau)=(\bftauv)\%$, respectively. The product of the decay constant and Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ is determined to be $f_{D_s^+}|V_{cs}|=(\mufdsxvcsresult)_{\mu\nu}~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $f_{D_s^+}|V_{cs}|=(\taufdsxvcsresult))_{\tau \nu}~\mathrm{MeV}$, respectively. Taking the value of $|V_{cs}|$ from a global fit in the Standard Model, we obtain ${f_{D^+_s}}=(\mufdsresult)_{\mu\nu}$\,MeV and ${f_{D^+_s}}=(\taufdsresult)_{\tau \nu}$\,MeV, respectively. Conversely, taking the value for $f_{D_s^+}$ from the latest lattice quantum chromodynamics calculation, we obtain $|V_{cs}| =(\muvcsresult)_{\mu\nu}$ and $|V_{cs}| = (\tauvcsresult)_{\tau \nu}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>A $\sim 43$ GeV $\gamma$-ray line signature in the directions of a group of nearby massive galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe, galaxy clusters have provided the first piece of evidence for the presence of dark matter and may be suitable targets for indirect dark matter searches. Among various signals, the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray line has been taken as the smoking-gun signal of the dark matter annihilation/decay since no known astrophysical/physical process(es) could generate such a peculiar spectrum. With 15.5 years of Fermi-LAT P8R3 publicly available data, we search for the $\gamma$-ray line emission in the directions of a group of 13 nearby massive galaxy clusters with an unbinned likelihood analysis. A $\gamma$-ray line signal at $\sim 43.2$ GeV has a net TS value of $\approx 30$ if we only take into account the data in the directions of Virgo, Fornax and Ophiuchus clusters, three massive clusters with the highest J-factors expected to generate the dark matter annihilation signal. The signal still presents when the data of other 10 nearby massive clusters have also been included, though the TS value decreases to $\approx 21$ likely because of their lower signal-to-noise ratios. The absence of this signal in the inner Galaxy disfavors both the instrumental effect and the canonical dark matter annihilation interpretation, and a more sophisticated dark matter model or very peculiar astrophysical scenario might be needed. This $\gamma$-ray line signal, if intrinsic, could be unambiguously verified by the Very Large Area $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope in its first two years of performance.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of the knee in the cosmic ray spectrum across the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The all-particle spectrum of cosmic rays measured at Earth has a knee-like feature around 4 PeV. A priori, it is not clear if this is a local feature specific to the Solar neighbourhood in the Milky Way, or if it is a generic property of the galactic cosmic ray spectrum. We argue that combining gamma-ray and cosmic-ray data of LHAASO indicates that the knee is a local feature. In order to demonstrate this, we derive a model for the local cosmic-ray spectra and composition, consistent with the recent LHAASO measurements of the all-particle spectrum and the mean logarithmic mass in the knee region. We calculate the spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray emission based on this model and find that the expected spectral shape of the diffuse gamma-ray flux is not consistent with LHAASO measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the 10-100 TeV energy range.</description>

Abstract: The CONUS+ experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) of reactor antineutrinos on germanium nuclei in the fully coherent regime, continuing on this way the CONUS physics program started at the Brokdorf nuclear power plant, Germany. The CONUS+ setup is installed in the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland, at a distance of 20.7 m from the 3.6 GW thermal power reactor core. The CEvNS signature will be measured with the same four point-contact high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors produced for the former experiment, however refurbished and with optimized low energy thresholds. To suppress the background in the CONUS+ detectors, the passive and active layers of the original CONUS shield were modified such to fit better to the significantly changed background conditions at the new experimental location. New data acquisition and monitoring systems were developed. A direct network connection between the experiment and the Max-Planck-Institut fur Kernphysik (MPIK) makes it possible to control and monitor data acquisition in real time. The impact of all these modifications is discussed with particular emphasis on the resulting CEvNS signal prediction for the first data collection phase of CONUS+. Prospects of the planned upgrade in a second phase integrating new larger HPGe detectors are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD Running Coupling for Light Quarks in Strong Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider running coupling constant in holographic model with external magnetic field supported by Einstein-dilaton-three-Maxwell action. We obtain a significant dependence of the running coupling constant $\alpha$ on chemical potential, temperature and magnetic field. We use the boundary condition that ensures the agreement with lattice calculations of string tension between quarks at zero chemical potential. The location of the 1-st order phase transitions in $(\mu, T)$-plane does not depend on the dilaton boundary conditions. We observe that running coupling $\alpha$ decreases with increasing magnetic field for the fixed values of chemical potential and temperature. At the 1-st order phase transitions the functions $\alpha$ undergo jumps depending on temperature, chemical potential and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Regge trajectory relation for the universal description of the heavy-heavy systems: diquarks, mesons, baryons and tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By employing the nonlinear Regge trajectory relation $M=m_R+\beta_x(x+c_{0x})^{2/3}\,\,(x=l,\,n_r)$, we investigate the heavy-heavy systems, such as the doubly heavy diquarks, the doubly heavy mesons, the heavy-heavy baryons, and the heavy-heavy tetraquarks. The fitted Regge trajectories illustrate that these heavy-heavy systems satisfy the above formula and show the existence of an universal description of the heavy-heavy systems. The universality embodies not only the universal behavior $M{\sim}x^{2/3}$ but also the universal parameters. The values of $c_{fn_r}$ and $c_{fl}$ vary with different heavy-heavy systems, but they are close to one. There is an inequality $\beta_{n_r}&gt;\beta_{l}$, and it holds for all the discussed heavy-heavy systems. Moreover, the expression of $\beta_x$ [Eq. (11)] explains its variation with the change of the constituents' masses.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Positivity for Phenomenologists: Dark Gauge Boson in the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational positivity bound gives quantitative "swampland'' constraints on low-energy effective theories inside theories of quantum gravity. We give a comprehensive discussion of this bound for those interested in applications to phenomenological model building. We present a practical recipe for deriving the bound, and discuss subtleties relevant for realistic models. As an illustration, we study the positivity bound on the scattering of the massive gauge bosons in the Higgs/St\"{u}ckelberg mechanism. Under certain assumptions on gravitational amplitudes at high energy, we obtain a lower bound $m_{V} \gtrsim \Lambda_\mathrm{UV}^2 /g M_\mathrm{Pl}$ on the gauge boson mass $m_V$, where $g$ is the coupling constant of the gauge field, $M_\mathrm{Pl}$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda_\mathrm{UV}$ is the ultraviolet cutoff of the effective field theory. This bound can strongly constrain new physics models involving a massive gauge boson.</description>

      <title>Inflation and Higgs Phenomenology in a Model Unifying the DFSZ Axion with the Majoron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Two-Higgs-Doublet-Standard Model-Axion-Seesaw-Higgs-Portal inflation (2hdSMASH) model consisting of two Higgs doublets, a Standard Model (SM) singlet complex scalar and three SM singlet right-handed neutrinos can embed axion dark matter, neutrino masses and address inflation. We report on an investigation of the inflationary aspects of 2hdSMASH and its subsequent impact on low energy phenomenology. In particular, we identify inflationary directions for which the parameter values required for successful inflation do not violate perturbative unitarity and boundedness-from-below conditions. By analyzing the renormalization-group flow of the parameters we identify the necessary and sufficient constraints for running all parameters perturbatively and maintaining stability from the electroweak to the PLANCK scale. We observe that stringent constraints arise on the singlet scalar self coupling from inflationary constraints, i.e, $\lambda_S\sim 10^{-10}$. Further, we find that all theoretical and experimental constraints are satisfied if the portal couplings are typically in the range $(\frac{v}{v_S})$ and $(\frac{v}{v_S})^2$ (where $v, v_S$ refer to the electroweak and singlet scalar vacuum expectation value respectively). As a consequence, inflation is realized in a variety of field space directions in the effective single field regime. Finally we provide testable benchmark scenarios at colliders.</description>

      <title>Interplay of type-I and type-II seesaw in neutrinoless double beta decay in left-right symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The left-right symmetric models (LRSM) generally include type-I and type-II induced seesaw masses as a hybrid mass for the light-active neutrinos. Assuming a particular form of Dirac-type coupling,
  the Majorana-type coupling in the seesaw mass formula can be expressed in terms of
  low-energy neutrino oscillation observables and vacuum expectation values (vevs) of the scalar fields
  present in the model. The Majorana-type coupling thus admits eight different solutions by
  considering whether the type-I and type-II terms dominate the light neutrino mass.
  We study the role of all eight solutions in the lepton number violating neutrinoless double beta decay
  ($0\nu\beta\beta$) process. In LRSM, the right-handed neutrinos, triplet scalars, and gauge bosons
  of the left and right sectors mediate new contributions to the $0\nu\beta\beta$ process.
  As a result, the effective mass of electron neutrino appearing in the decay width would be a
  function of $v_R$ (vev of the Higgs triplet of the right sector) along with other
  model parameters, through the masses of the new contributions. The energy scale,
  $v_R$ can be considered as the new physics scale which allows exploring physics beyond the Standard Model.
  Considering the present and future sensitivity of searches of $0\nu\beta\beta$, we study the
  role of eight different solutions of the Majorana coupling matrix. In our study, the inverted
  hierarchy of light neutrino masses is disfavored for all solutions keeping future sensitivity of
  effective mass in the picture, if the lightest mass of active neutrinos is below $0.001$ eV.
  Also, our study shows a possibility of new physics contributions saturating
  the experimental bound on effective mass for $v_R$ in the range of $10$ TeV for two particular solutions
  of the Majorana coupling matrix and simultaneously provides the insights about parity breaking scale.</description>

      <title>Study of neutrinoless double beta decay in the Standard Model extended with sterile neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a model where the Standard Model is augmented with three sterile neutrinos. By adopting a particular parameterization of a $(6\times6)$ unitary matrix - in this context, light neutrino masses being generated via a type-I seesaw mechanism - we analytically derive the masses of the sterile states using an exact seesaw relation. The masses of the sterile states are derived in terms of the lightest mass of active neutrinos and active-active and active-sterile mixing angles and phases; they can be all light, all heavy, or a mixture of light and heavy compared to the active states. This can be attributed to the interplay of the $CP$ violating (CPV) phases of the mixing matrix. As both active and sterile states can mediate the neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) process, their contributions to the effective mass of the electron neutrino, $\lvert m_{ee}\lvert$, become a function of the mass of the lightest active state and active-active and active-sterile mixing angles and phases. We explore the parameter space of $\lvert m_{ee}\lvert$, keeping in mind, the present and future sensitivity of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay searches. By making use of constraints from charged lepton flavor violating (cLFV) processes and non-unitarity, we explore the role of additional CPV phases and active-sterile mixing angle values. The numerical values thus obtained for $\lvert m_{ee}\rvert$ can vary from as low as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ to saturating the present experimental limit. We check the reliability of our result by calculating the branching ratio of $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$, a prominent cLFV process, and non-unitarity in this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the jet quenching parameter $\hat q$ in a non-equilibrium plasma using the QCD effective kinetic theory. We discuss subleading terms at large jet momentum p, show that our expression for $\hat q$ reproduces thermal results at small and large transverse momentum cutoffs for infinite p and construct an interpolation between these limits to be used in phenomenological applications. Using simple non-equilibrium distributions that model pertinent features of the bottom-up thermalization scenario, we analytically assess how anisotropy, under- or overoccupation affect the jet quenching parameter. Our work provides more details on the $\hat q$ formula used in our preceding work [arXiv:2303.12595] and sets the stage for further numerical studies of jet momentum broadening in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions from QCD kinetic theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the neural network framework, we obtain empirical fits to the electron-scattering cross sections for carbon over a broad kinematic region, extending from the quasielastic peak through resonance excitation to the onset of deep-inelastic scattering. We consider two different methods of obtaining such model-independent parametrizations and the corresponding uncertainties: based on the bootstrap approach and the Monte Carlo dropout approach. In our analysis, the $\chi^2$ defines the loss function, including point-to-point and normalization uncertainties for each independent set of measurements. Our statistical approaches lead to fits of comparable quality and similar uncertainties of the order of $7$%. To test these models, we compare their predictions to test datasets excluded from the training process and theoretical predictions obtained within the spectral function approach. The predictions of both models agree with experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. We also perform a comparison to a dataset lying beyond the covered kinematic region, and find that the bootstrap approach shows better interpolation and extrapolation abilities than the one based on the dropout algorithm.</description>

      <title>Mixed QCD-EW corrections to $W$-pair production at electron-positron colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrepancy between the CDF measurement and the Standard Model theoretical prediction for the $W$-boson mass underscores the importance of conducting high-precision studies on the $W$ boson, which is one of the predominant objectives of proposed future $e^+e^-$ colliders. We investigate in detail the production of $W$-boson pairs at $e^+e^-$ colliders, and compute the next-to-next-to-leading order mixed QCD-EW corrections to both the integrated cross section and various kinematic distributions. By employing the method of differential equations, we analytically calculate the two-loop master integrals for the mixed QCD-EW virtual corrections to $e^+e^- \rightarrow W^+W^-$. Utilizing the Magnus transformation, we derive a set of canonical master integrals for each integral family. This canonical basis satisfies a system of differential equations in which the dependence on the dimensional regulator is linearly factorized from the kinematics. We then express all these canonical master integrals as Taylor series in $\epsilon$ up to $\epsilon^4$, with coefficients articulated in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms up to weight four. Upon applying our analytic expressions of these master integrals to the phenomenological analysis of $W$-pair production, we observe that the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha\alpha_s)$ corrections are significantly impactful in the $\alpha(0)$ scheme, particularly in certain phase-space regions. However, these mixed QCD-EW corrections can be heavily suppressed by adopting the $G_{\mu}$ scheme.</description>

      <title>Triplet scalar flavored leptogenesis with spontaneous CP violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inclusion of two triplet scalars in the Standard Model (SM) enables to accommodate neutrino mass generation as well as baryogenesis through leptogenesis. One of the essential ingredients of leptogenesis is the violation of charge conjugation and parity (CP) symmetry in lepton number-violating decays of the triplet scalars. We work on the promising sector of spontaneous CP violation (SCPV) which is manifested by the involvement of one scalar singlet and two scalar fields, added to the SM. The predictive aspect of the model is accomplished by imposing $A_4 \times Z_4$ symmetry which results in the traditional tribimaximal mixing pattern. With updated data on neutrino oscillation, we study the parameter space of the model. The phase of the complex vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the singlet scalar acts as the common source of CP violation in both low and high-energy sectors. Due to the flavor symmetry of the model, required baryon asymmetry cannot be accomplished via unflavored leptogenesis. In the temperature regime, $\left[ 10^{9}, 10^{12} \right]$ GeV when flavor effects become important in the study of leptogenesis, it is shown that baryogenesis is achievable. The rich flavor interplay is explored through the study of the density matrix equations. We also study the interplay of hierarchical branching ratios of the decay of the triplet scalars and SCPV phase to accommodate the required CP asymmetry to account for the final baryon asymmetry in the observational range. Considering all possible mass hierarchies among the triplet scalars, the flavor structure of the triplet Yukawa couplings results in different scales of leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: To shed light on the nature of the controversial and not yet fully understood exotic states, we are carrying out a systematic study of their electromagnetic properties. The magnetic moment of a hadron state is as fundamental a dynamical quantity as its mass and contains valuable information on the deep underlying structure. In this study, we use the QCD light-cone sum rule to extract the magnetic moments of the $\mathrm{P_{c}(4312)}$, $\mathrm{P_{c}(4380)}$, and $\mathrm{P_{c}(4440)}$ pentaquarks by considering them as the molecular picture with spin-parity $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{1}{2}^-}$, $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}$, and $\mathrm{J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}$, respectively. We define the isospin of the interpolating currents of these states, which is the key to solving the puzzle of the hidden-charm pentaquark states, to make these analyses more precise and reliable. We have compared our results with other theoretical predictions that could be a useful complementary tool for the interpretation of the hidden-charm pentaquark sector, and we observe that they are not in mutual agreement with each other. We have also calculated higher multipole moments for spin-3/2 $\bar D^{*} \Sigma_c$ and $\bar D \Sigma_c^{*}$ pentaquarks, indicating a non-spherical charge distribution.</description>

      <title>Model for bubble nucleation efficiency of low-energy nuclear recoils in bubble chambers for dark matter detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bubble chambers are promising technologies for detecting low-energy nuclear recoils from the elastic scattering of dark matter particle candidates. Bubble nucleation occurs when the energy deposition exceeds a specific threshold defined traditionally by the "heat-spike" Seitz threshold. In this paper, we report on a physical model that can account for observed discrepancies between the current Seitz model and the measured nucleation efficiency of low-energy nuclear recoils, which is necessary for interpreting dark matter signals. In our work, we combine molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations together with the Lindhard model to predict bubble nucleation efficiency and energy thresholds for C$_3$F$_8$, CF$_3$I, and xenon with enhanced accuracy over the Seitz model when compared to existing experimental data. We use our model to determine the effect on cross-section limits for spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions and compare it to the current PICO dark matter experiment. Our technique can also be applied to estimate the efficiency of future target fluids where no experimental data are available. As an example, we predict the nucleation efficiency, the energy threshold and the cross-section limits in the spin-independent channel for the Scintillating Bubble Chamber experiment filled with superheated liquid argon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the lattice simulation to estimate the axion dark matter abundance radiated from the global cosmic strings in the post-inflationary scenario. The independent numerical confirmation on the recently observed logarithmic growth in both the number of strings per Hubble patch and the spectral index of the power law scaling for the axion spectrum is reported. These logarithmic scalings are checked against two different prescriptions for generating initial random field configurations, namely fat-string type and thermal phase transition. We discuss a possible strong correlation between the axion spectrum and the string evolutions with different initial conditions to support the insensitivity of scaling behaviors against different initial data and we provide a qualitative understanding of it. The impact of various combinations of the power law of the axion spectrum, nonlinearities around the QCD scale, and average inter-string distances on the axion abundance is discussed. Additionally, we introduce a new novel string identification method, based on the tetrahedralization of the space, which guarantees the connectedness of the strings and provides a convenient way of assigning the core location. Finally we derive the lower bound on the axion mass.</description>

      <title>Higgs Boson Precision Analysis of the Full LHC Run 1 and Run 2 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform global fits of the Higgs boson couplings to the full Higgs datasets collected at the LHC with the integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5/fb at 7 TeV, 20/fb at 8 TeV, and up to 139/fb at 13 TeV. Our combined analysis based on the experimental signal strengths used in this work and the theoretical ones elaborated for our analysis reliably reproduce the results in the literature. We reveal that the LHC Higgs precision data are no longer best described by the SM Higgs boson taking account of extensive and comprehensive CP-conserving and CP-violating scenarios found in several well-motivated models beyond the SM. Especially, in most of the fits considered in this work, we observe that the best-fitted values of the normalized Yukawa couplings are about $2\sigma$ below the corresponding SM ones with the $1\sigma$ errors of 3%-5%. On the other hand, the gauge-Higgs couplings are consistent with the SM with the $1\sigma$ errors of 2%-3%. Incidentally, the reduced Yukawa couplings help to explain the excess of the $H\to Z\gamma$ signal strength of $2.2\pm 0.7$ recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.</description>

Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving formulation of a vector$\,\times\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) and treating the proton as a quark + interacting-diquark bound state, whose structure is obtained by solving a Poincar\'e-covariant Faddeev equation, we provide a comprehensive, coherent set of predictions for unpolarised and polarised proton parton distribution functions (DFs): valence, glue, and four-flavour separated sea. The results enable many themes to be addressed, including: the asymmetry of antimatter in the proton; the neutron:proton structure function ratio; helicity retention in hard scattering processes; the charm quark momentum fraction; the sign and size of the polarised gluon DF; and the origin of the proton spin. In all cases where sound analyses of data are available, SCI predictions are semiquantitatively in agreement with the results. Those mismatches which exist are typically attributable to the momentum-independence of the underlying interaction. Judiciously interpreted, the SCI delivers a sound and insightful explanation of proton structure as expressed in DFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous advancement of experimental techniques and investigations has led to observations of various exotic states in particle physics. Each addition to this family of states not only raises expectations for future discoveries but also focuses attention on such potential new states. Building upon this motivation and inspired by recent observations of various traditional and exotic particles containing an increased number of heavy quarks, our study provides a spectroscopic search for potential pentaquark states with spin-parity $\frac{3}{2}^-$ and composed entirely of charm or bottom quarks. We predict the masses for full-charm and full-bottom pentaquark states as $m = 7628 \pm 112$~MeV and $m = 21982 \pm 144$~MeV, respectively. We also compute the current couplings of these states to vacuum, which are main inputs in investigations of their various possible decays.</description>

      <title>Complete NLO corrections to top-quark pair production with isolated photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute for the first time the so-called complete NLO corrections to top-quark pair production with one and two isolated photons in the di-lepton top-quark decay channel. The Narrow Width Approximation is used for the modeling of unstable top quarks and $W$ bosons. Higher-order QCD and EW effects as well as photon bremsstrahlung are consistently included at all stages: in production and top-quark decays. We present results at the integrated and differential fiducial cross-section level for both processes for the LHC Run II center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. In addition, we investigate the scale choice in photonic observables. Finally, the individual size of each subleading contribution is discussed in detail and the origin of the main subleading corrections is scrutinised. For the latter case, alternative calculations are performed in which the subleading NLO corrections are included only in the production of $t\bar{t}\gamma$ and $t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma$.</description>

Abstract: Thermal properties of quantum fields at finite temperature are crucial to understanding strongly interacting matter and recent development in quantum computing has provided an alternative and promising avenue of study. In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.</description>

      <title>Light tetraquark states with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the masses of light tetraquark states $ud\bar{u}\bar{d}$ , $us\bar{u}\bar{s}$ and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$ using the method of QCD sum rules. It is found that there is no tetraquark operator with two Lorentz indices coupling to the $2^{+-}$ quantum numbers. To investigate such tetraquark states, we construct the interpolating tetraquark currents with three Lorentz indices and without derivative operator. We calculate the correlation functions up to dimension 10 condensates, and extract the $2^{+-}$ invariant functions via the projector operator. Our results show that the masses of the $ud\bar{u}\bar{d}$, $us\bar{u}\bar{s}$ and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$ are about $3.3-3.5 ~\mathrm{GeV}$, $3.5-3.7 ~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $3.67 ~\mathrm{GeV}$, respectively. We further discuss the strong decays of these light tetraquarks into the two-meson and baryon-antibaryon final states, and suggest to search for them in the $\rho\pi, \omega\pi, \phi\pi$, $b_{1}\pi$, $h_{1}\pi$, $K\bar K^\ast, K\bar{K}_{1}$, $\Delta\bar{\Delta}$, $\Sigma^{\ast} \bar{\Sigma }^{\ast}$, $\Xi^{\ast} \bar{\Xi }^{\ast}$, $\Omega\bar{\Omega }$ channels in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering the one loop background field method for a quark-antiquark interaction, mediated by one (non perturbative) gluon exchange, sixth order quark effective interactions are derived and investigated in the limit of zero momentum transfer for large quark and/or gluon effective masses. They extend fourth order quark interactions worked out in previous works of the author. These interactions break $U_A(1)$ symmetry and may be either momentum independent or dependent. Part of these interactions vanish in the limit of massless quarks, and several other -- involving vector and/or axial quark currents -- survive. In the local limit of the resulting interactions, some phenomenological implications are presented, which correspond to corrections to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.By means of the auxiliary field method, the local interactions give rise to three meson interactions whose values are compared to phenomenological values found in the literature. Contributions for meson-mixing parameters are calculated and compared to available results.</description>

      <title>Testing neutrino mass hierarchy under type-II seesaw scenario in $U(1)_X$ from colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of tiny neutrino mass is a long standing unsolved puzzle of the Standard Model (SM), which allows us to consider scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) in a variety of ways. One of them being a gauge extension of the SM may be realized as in the form of an anomaly free, general $U(1)_X$ extension of the SM, where an $SU(2)_L$ triplet scalar with a $U(1)_X$ charge is introduced to have Dirac Yukawa couplings with the SM lepton doublets. Once the triplet scalar developes a Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV), light neutrinos acquire their tiny Majorana masses. Hence, the decay modes of the triplet scalar has a direct connection to the neutrino oscillation data for different neutrino mass hierarchies. After the breaking of the $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, a neutral $U(1)_X$ gauge boson $(Z^\prime)$ acquires mass, which interacts differently with the left and right handed SM fermions. Satisfying the recent LHC bounds on the triplet scalar and $Z^\prime$ boson productions, we study the pair production of the triplet scalar at LHC, 100 TeV proton proton collider FCC, $e^-e^+$ and $\mu^-\mu^+$ colliders followed by its decay into dominant dilepton modes whose flavor structure depend on the neutrino mass hierarchy. Generating the SM backgrounds, we study the possible signal significance of four lepton final states from the triplet scalar pair production. We also compare our results with the purely SM gauge mediated triplet scalar pair production followed by four lepton final states, which could be significant only in $\mu^- \mu^+$ collider.</description>

      <title>Particle Multi-Axis Transformer for Jet Tagging</title>

Abstract: Jet tagging is an essential categorization problem in high energy physics. In recent times, Deep Learning has not only risen to the challenge of jet tagging but also significantly improved its performance. In this article, we proposed an idea of a new architecture, Particle Multi-Axis transformer (ParMAT) which is a modified version of Particle transformer (ParT). ParMAT contains local and global spatial interactions within a single unit which improves its ability to handle various input lengths. We trained our model on JETCLASS, a publicly available large dataset that contains 100M jets of 10 different classes of particles. By integrating a parallel attention mechanism and pairwise interactions of particles in the attention mechanism, ParMAT achieves robustness and higher accuracy over the ParT and ParticleNet. The scalability of the model to huge datasets and its ability to automatically extract essential features demonstrate its potential for enhancing jet tagging.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations originate from virtual excitation of Z bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To account for neutrino oscillations, it is postulated that the neutrino has nonvanishing mass and each flavor eigenstate is formed by three distinct mass eigenstates, whose probability amplitudes interfere with each other during its propagation. However, I find that the energy conservation law requires these mass eigenstates, if they exist, to be entangled with distinct joint energy eigenstates of the other particles produced by the same weak interaction as the neutrino. This entanglement destroys the quantum coherence among the neutrino's mass eigenstates, which is responsible for flavor oscillations under the aforementioned postulation. I reveal that the neutrino oscillations actually originate from virtual excitation of the Z bosonic field diffusing over the space. During the propagation, the neutrino can continually excite and then immediately re-absorb a virtual Z boson. This virtual bosonic excitation produces a backaction on the neutrino, enabling it to oscillate among three flavors. When the neutrino propagates in matter, its behavior is determined by the competition between the coherent flavor transformation and decoherence effect resulting from scatterings.</description>

Abstract: Since its inception, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has significantly advanced particle physics and will continue to do so in the context of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) program to collect $3000$ fb$^{-1}$ by the end of 2041. The particle physics community worldwide is discussing which future collider could follow in the footsteps of the LHC and uncover yet inaccessible phenomena.
  To foster the discussion on this important topic among the young particle physicist community, the Early-Career Researchers (ECR) panel of the European Committee for Future Colliders (ECFA) has organized the Future Colliders for Early-Career Researchers workshop at CERN in September 2023. This document aims to summarise this event and present the ECR perspective, outline the key questions that came up during the discussions, and explore how ECRs can influence the decision process of future colliders community and beyond.</description>

Abstract: The Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field sourced by a static spherically symmetric background is an interesting second-order differential equation with applications in particle physics, astrophysics, and elsewhere. Here we present static solutions for generic source density profiles in the case where the scalar field has no interactions or a mass term. For a $\lambda\phi^4$ self-interaction term, we develop the techniques that are necessary numerical computation. We also provide code to perform the numerical calculations that can be adapted for arbitrary density profiles.</description>

      <title>Reexamining charm versus bottom quark energy loss inside a color-deconfined medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The general intuition that heavier partons suffer weaker energy loss inside a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium is critically re-examined. Within a linear Boltzmann transport model that includes both Yukawa and string types of interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP, we find that while the radiative energy loss is suppressed by the parton mass, heavier partons can experience stronger string potential scatterings with the medium. Their competition may result in less energy loss of bottom quarks than charm quarks at low transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) but an inverse order at high $p_\mathrm{T}$. Our model calculation shows a weaker nuclear modification on bottom particles than charm particles at low $p_\mathrm{T}$, as observed by both RHIC and LHC experiments, but predicts an opposite hierarchy at high $p_\mathrm{T}$. A larger momentum space transport coefficient ($\hat{q}$) and a smaller spatial diffusion coefficient ($D_\mathrm{s}$) are found for bottom quarks than for charm quarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of statistical tools for evaluating tensions in cosmological parameter estimates arising from distinct datasets. Focusing on the unresolved Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, we explore the Pantheon Plus + SH0ES (PPS) compilation, which includes low-redshift Cepheid data from the SH0ES collaboration, along with the latest release of CMB data from the Planck collaboration, Cosmic Chronometers (CC) dataset and the most recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) datasets. Employing various tension metrics, we quantitatively assess the inconsistencies in parameter estimates, emphasizing the importance of capturing multidimensional tensions. Our results reveal substantial tension between PPS and Planck 2018 datasets and moderate tension between the BAO data sets and all other datasets. We highlight the importance of adopting these metrics to enhance the precision of future cosmological analyses and facilitate the resolution of existing tensions.</description>

      <title>Modeling the core-halo mass relation in fuzzy dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is an intriguing candidate alternative to the standard cold dark matter (CDM). The FDM model predicts that dark halos have characteristic core structures generated by the effect of quantum pressure, which is different from the structure of CDM halos. We devise a semi-analytic model of a FDM halo density profile by assuming that the density distribution results from the redistribution of mass in a halo with the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We calculate the mass redistribution radius by considering dynamical relaxation within the FDM halo. We adopt a concentration-halo mass relation with lower concentration compared to that in the CDM model below the half mode mass, which originates from the suppressed matter density fluctuations at small length scales. Our model reproduces the core-halo mass relation (CHMR) found in the numerical simulation of \citet{2014NatPh..10..496S} at $z&lt;1$. We show that the CHMR is well described by a double power law, unlike previous studies that approximate it by a single power law. Our model predictions are in reasonable agreement with the results of the largest FDM simulation of \citet{2021MNRAS.506.2603M} at $z=3$. We find that the core mass for a given halo mass follows the log-normal distribution, both in our model and in the simulation results for the first time, and quantitatively compare the variance of the distribution among them. Although our model does not fully explain the scatter of the CHMR, we show the scatter of the concentration-halo mass relation sizably contributes to them.</description>

Abstract: Advancements in cosmology through next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories will bring in a paradigm shift. We explore the pivotal role that gravitational-wave standard sirens will play in inferring cosmological parameters with next-generation observatories, not only achieving exquisite precision but also opening up unprecedented redshifts. We examine the merits and the systematic biases involved in gravitational-wave standard sirens utilizing binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole mergers. Further, we estimate the precision of bright sirens, golden dark sirens, and spectral sirens for these binary coalescences and compare the abilities of various next-generation observatories (A^sharp, Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope, and their possible networks). When combining different sirens, we find sub-percent precision over more than 10 billion years of cosmic evolution for the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$. This work presents a broad view of opportunities to precisely measure the cosmic expansion rate, decipher the elusive dark energy and dark matter, and potentially discover new physics in the uncharted Universe with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>The Disruption of Dark Matter Minihalos by Successive Stellar Encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scenarios such as the QCD axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry broken after inflation predict an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales. These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a superfluid dark star model consisting of relativistic dark bosons with two-body self-interaction. The obtained masses, radii, and tidal deformability depend in a simple way on the boson mass and interaction strength. We report first results on binary mergers: the distinctive amplitude and frequency of the emitted gravitational waves are well within reach of terrestrial interferometers.</description>

      <title>Qu8its for Quantum Simulations of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of $d=8$ qudits, qu8its, for quantum simulations of the dynamics of 1+1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping for arbitrary numbers of flavors and lattice size and a re-organization of the Hamiltonian for efficient time-evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Electron scattering cross sections for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei within the unified electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study employs the multipole expansion within the unified electroweak theory to investigate the electron scattering cross sections for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei. The multipole form factors presented in the expressions of the cross sections are directly calculated based on the many-particle shell model and fractional parentage coefficients without using any approximations. The results obtained indicate that the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the electron-nucleus scattering only when the energy of incident electrons does not exceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross section of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited state and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently treated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The calculated scattering cross sections using the V-A structure agree reasonably well with the available experimental data at low (MeV) energies and provide predictive information at high (GeV) energies. The scattering cross sections are found to rapidly decrease in all cases with increasing the incident electron energy and scattering angle. In particular, at the energies of hundreds of GeV and higher, there are only the forward scattering processes. Furthermore, by comparing the elastic cross sections of three investigated nuclei at a certain energy and scattering angle, the rule that the nuclear size is proportional to the number of nucleons is clearly shown.</description>
