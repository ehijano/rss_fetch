      <title>Advanced System Engineering Approaches to Emerging Challenges in Planetary and Deep-Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents innovative solutions to critical challenges in planetary and deep-space exploration electronics. We synthesize findings across diverse mission profiles, highlighting advances in: (1) MARTIAN positioning systems with dual-frequency transmission to achieve $\pm$1m horizontal accuracy; (2) artificial reef platforms for Titan's hydrocarbon seas utilizing specialized sensor arrays and multi-stage communication chains; (3) precision orbital rendezvous techniques demonstrating novel thermal protection solutions; (4) miniaturized CubeSat architectures for asteroid exploration with optimized power-to-mass ratios; and (5) next-generation power management systems for MARS rovers addressing dust accumulation challenges. These innovations represent promising directions for future space exploration technologies, particularly in environments where traditional Earth-based electronic solutions prove inadequate. The interdisciplinary nature of these developments highlights the critical intersection of aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, and planetary science in advancing human exploration capabilities beyond Earth orbit.</description>

      <title>A Demonstration of Interstellar Navigation Using New Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As NASA's New Horizons spacecraft exits the Solar System bound for interstellar space, it has traveled so far that the nearest stars have shifted markedly from their positions seen from Earth. We demonstrated this by imaging the Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 fields from Earth and New Horizons on 2020 April 23, when the spacecraft was 47.1 au distant. The observed parallaxes for Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359 are $32.4''$ and $15.7'',$ respectively. These measurements are not of research grade, but directly seeing large stellar parallaxes between two widely separated simultaneous observers is vividly educational. Using the New Horizons positions of the two stars alone, referenced to the three-dimensional model of the solar neighborhood constructed from Gaia DR3 astrometry, further provides the spacecraft spatial position relative to nearby stars with 0.44 au accuracy. The range to New Horizons from the Solar System barycenter is recovered to 0.27 au accuracy, and its angular direction to $0.4^\circ$ accuracy, when compared to the precise values from NASA Deep Space Network tracking. This is the first time optical stellar astrometry has been used to determine the three-dimensional location of a spacecraft with respect to nearby stars, and the first time any method of interstellar navigation has been demonstrated for a spacecraft on an interstellar trajectory. We conclude that the best astrometric approach to navigating spacecraft on their departures to interstellar space is to use a single pair of the closest stars as references, rather than a large sample of more distant stars.</description>

      <title>Filters for NIR astronomical photometry: comparison of commercial IRWG filters and designs using OpenFilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photometric accuracy in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range (0.9 -2.6 microns) is strongly affected by the variability of atmospheric transmission. The Infrared Working Group (IRWG) has recommended filters that help alleviate this issue and provide a common standard of NIR filtersets across different observatories. However, accurate implementation of these filters are yet to be available to astronomers. In the meantime, InGaAs based detectors have emerged as a viable option for small and medium telescopes. The present work explores the combination of IRWG filtersets with InGaAs detectors. A few commercially available filtersets that approximate the IRWG profile are compared. Design of more accurate IRWG filtersets suitable for the InGaAs sensitivity range is undertaken using an open-source filter design software - OpeFilters. Along with the photometric filters iZ, iJ and iH, design of a few useful narrow band filters is also presented. These filters present opportunities for small and medium telescopes for dedicated long-term observation of interesting infrared sources.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XVIII: Detecting strongly lensed SNe Ia from time series of multi-band LSST-like imaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe), though rare, are exceptionally valuable probes for cosmology and astrophysics. Upcoming time-domain surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) offer a major opportunity to discover them in large numbers. Early identification is crucial for timely follow-up observations. We develop a deep learning pipeline to detect LSNe using multi-band, multi-epoch image cutouts. Our model is based on a 2D convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM2D) architecture, designed to capture both spatial and temporal correlations in time-series imaging data. Predictions are made after each observation in the time series, with accuracy improving as more data arrive. We train the model on realistic simulations derived from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data, which closely matches LSST in depth and filters. This work focuses exclusively on Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). LSNe Ia are injected onto HSC luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at various phases of evolution to create positive examples. Negative examples include variable sources from HSC Transient Survey (including unclassified transients), and simulated unlensed SNe Ia in LRG and spiral galaxies. Our multi-band model shows rapid classification improvements during the initial few observations and quickly reaches high detection efficiency: at a fixed false-positive rate (FPR) of $0.01\%$, the true-positive rate (TPR) reaches $\gtrsim 60\%$ by the 7th observation and exceeds $\gtrsim 70\%$ by the 9th. Among the negative examples, SNe in LRGs remain the primary source of FPR, as they can resemble their lensed counterparts under certain conditions. The model detects quads more effectively than doubles and performs better on systems with larger image separations. Although trained and tested on HSC-like data, our approach applies to any cadenced imaging survey, particularly LSST.</description>

      <title>Cost Effective Designs For Next-Generation Radio Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio astronomy has entered its golden era, with many revolutionary facilities such as SKA, ngVLA, and LOFAR2.0 coming online in the next decade. These facilities are certain to redefine radio astronomy. However, on smaller scales-such as at institutional or amateur levels-radio astronomy is still mostly practiced for educational or personal interest. The primary reason small-scale radio astronomical experiments rarely produce cutting-edge scientific results is the limitation of funding available for procuring or developing components similar to those used in professional-grade facilities. A second major reason is the lack of tools and skills required for simulating components for a complete telescope. In this work, we address the first of these challenges and suggest novel ideas and designs for cost-effective, next-generation radio telescopes that can be built at small scales. We also describe the observational strategies required to produce cutting-edge scientific results with these telescopes-results comparable to those from professional facilities.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Accelerations of Provisional Targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be the first space telescope capable of directly imaging Earth-like planets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars to probe their atmospheres for signs of life. Now in its early stages of design, a list of the 164 most promising targets for HWO has been released to the community to carry out precursor science. Massive companions in these systems--stars, brown dwarfs, or giant planets--could preclude the existence of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone by impacting their long-term dynamical stability. Here, we use astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 to identify stars in the HWO preliminary target list that exhibit astrometric accelerations and determine joint constraints on the expected mass and separation of these companions. We find that 54 HWO targets have significant astrometric accelerations, 37 of which are accounted for by known giant planets and stellar companions. Follow-up efforts are required to clarify the specific nature of the suspected companions around the remaining 17 accelerating stars. Stars without significant accelerations are used to rule out large regions of companion mass and separation down to planetary masses. We find that with Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 we are $\sim$85$\%$ sensitive to 2 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ planets between 4 and 10 AU. Future Gaia releases will provide sensitivity to sub-Jovian mass planets on Solar System scales for provisional HWO targets. Finally, using analytical estimates of dynamical stability, we find that 13 HWO targets have known stellar or planetary companions that are likely to disrupt habitable-zone planets.</description>

      <title>Glitches far from transient gravitational-wave events do not bias inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detectors, known as "glitches," can bias the inferred parameters of transient signals when they occur nearby in time and frequency. These biases are addressed with a variety of methods that remove or otherwise mitigate the impact of the glitch. Given the computational cost and human effort required for glitch mitigation, we study the conditions under which it is strictly necessary. We consider simulated glitches and gravitational-wave signals in various configurations that probe their proximity both in time and in frequency. We determine that glitches located outside the time-frequency space spanned by the gravitational-wave model prior and with a signal-to-noise ratio, conservatively, below 50 do not impact estimation of the signal parameters.</description>

      <title>Constraint on the Deviation of Kerr Metric via Bumpy Parameterization and Particle Swarm Optimization in Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of deviations in the Kerr metric using gravitational wave (GW) observations will provide a clear signal of new Physics. Previous studies have developed multiple parameterizations (e.g. ``bumpy" spacetime) to characterize such deviations in extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI) and employed analyses based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) formalism to quantify the constraining power of space-borne GW detectors like LISA and Tianqin, e.g., achieving a constraint sensitivity levels of $10^{-4} \sim 10^{-2}$ on the dimensionless bumpy parameter $\delta \tilde{Q}$ under varying source configurations in analytical kluge waveform for LISA. In this paper, we advance prior analyses by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) with matched filtering under a restricted parameter search range to enforce a high probability of convergence for PSO. Our results reveal a significant number of degenerate peaks in the likelihood function over the signal parameter space with values that exceed the injected one. This extreme level of degeneracy arises from the involvement of the additional bumpy parameter $\delta \tilde{Q}$ in the parameter space and introduces systematic errors in parameter estimation. We show that these systematic errors can be mitigated using information contained in the ensemble of degenerate peaks, thereby restoring the reliability of astrophysical inferences about EMRI systems from GW observations. This study highlights the critical importance of accounting for such degeneracies, which are absent in FIM-based analyses, and points out future directions for improving EMRI data analysis.</description>

      <title>Requirements on bandpass resolution and measurement precision for LiteBIRD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the impact of an imperfect knowledge of the instrument bandpasses on the estimate of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in the context of the next-generation LiteBIRD satellite. We develop a pipeline to include bandpass integration in both the time-ordered data (TOD) and the map-making processing steps. We introduce the systematic effect by having a mismatch between the ``real'', high resolution bandpass $\tau$, entering the TOD, and the estimated one $\tau_s$, used in the map-making. We focus on two aspects: the effect of degrading the $\tau_s$ resolution, and the addition of a Gaussian error $\sigma$ to $\tau_s$. To reduce the computational load of the analysis, the two effects are explored separately, for three representative LiteBIRD channels (40 GHz, 140 GHz and 402 GHz) and for three bandpass shapes. Computing the amount of bias on $r$, $\Delta r$, caused by these effects on a single channel, we find that a resolution $\lesssim 1.5$ GHz and $\sigma \lesssim 0.0089$ do not exceed the LiteBIRD budget allocation per systematic effect, $\Delta r &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. We then check that propagating separately the uncertainties due to a resolution of 1 GHz and a measurement error with $\sigma = 0.0089$ in all LiteBIRD frequency channels, for the most pessimistic bandpass shape of the three considered, still produces a $\Delta r &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-6}$. This is done both with the simple deprojection approach and with a blind component separation technique, the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC). Due to the effectiveness of NILC in cleaning the systematic residuals, we have tested that the requirement on $\sigma$ can be relaxed to $\sigma \lesssim 0.05$. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Deep source separation of overlapping gravitational-wave signals and non-stationary noise artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, detecting signals from a vast number of astrophysical sources embedded in instrumental noise. Extracting individual signals from these overlapping contributions is a fundamental challenge in LISA data analysis and is traditionally addressed using computationally expensive stochastic Bayesian techniques. In this work, we present a deep learning-based framework for blind source separation in LISA data, employing an encoder-decoder architecture commonly used in digital audio processing to isolate individual signals within complex mixtures. Our approach enables signals from massive black-hole binaries, Galactic binaries, and instrumental glitches to be disentangled directly in a single step, circumventing the need for sequential source identification and subtraction. By learning clustered latent space representations, the framework provides a scalable alternative to conventional methods, with applications in both low-latency event detection and full-scale global-fit analyses. As a proof of concept, we assess the model's performance using simulated LISA data in a controlled setting with a limited number of overlapping sources. The results highlight deep source separation as a promising tool for LISA, paving the way for future extensions to more complex datasets.</description>

Abstract: This article discusses strong nuggets (SNs) which means strong interaction condensed matter with a mass of about $10^6\,$g. They may originate from the early universe, supernova, pulsar merger event, and so on. Depending on the equation of state, the SNs could be stable and even be one of the candidates for dark matter. In order to detect SNs which hitting the Earth or the Moon at a non-relativistic velocity, a new messenger, the acoustic array, is analysed. The results of the calculations show that the impact signal of an SN can be detected at a distance of about 30 kilometers from the nugget's trajectory. By using microphone boxes, hydrophones or seismographs to construct an array in the bedrock, ocean or on the Moon, it is possible to reconstruct the velocity, mass, and interacting cross section of SNs, and then constrain also the nature of supra-nuclear matter. The acoustic array can also be used for distributed acoustic sensing of meteorites or earthquakes. The sonar localisation system on the proposed High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT) is suggested as a pathfinder for acoustic array detection.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference and comparison of gravitational-wave population models with neural variational posteriors</title>

Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog has been analyzed with an abundance of different population models due to theoretical uncertainty in the formation of gravitational-wave sources. To expedite model exploration, we introduce an efficient and accurate variational Bayesian approach that learns the population posterior with a normalizing flow and serves as a drop-in replacement for existing samplers. With hardware acceleration, inference takes just seconds for the current set of black-hole mergers and readily scales to larger catalogs. The trained posteriors provide an arbitrary number of independent samples with exact probability densities, unlike established stochastic sampling algorithms, while requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer likelihood evaluations and as few as $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. Provided the posterior support is covered, discrepancies can be addressed with smoothed importance sampling, which quantifies a goodness-of-fit metric for the variational approximation while also estimating the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Neural variational inference thus enables interactive development, analysis, and comparison of population models, making it a useful tool for astrophysical interpretation of current and future gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Systematic Biases from ARM-Based Sensitivity and Imaging in Compton Cameras</title>

Abstract: The angular resolution measure (ARM) is widely used in Compton camera analyses to characterize angular uncertainty and to define event selection criteria. However, the ARM distribution is fundamentally different from the point spread function (PSF), which represents the true spatial imaging response of the system on the celestial sphere. In this study, motivated by applications in gamma-ray astrophysics, we investigated the consequences of using ARM-based definitions in sensitivity estimation and image reconstruction. Through Monte Carlo simulations of 662 keV gamma-rays, we demonstrated that the background rejection power of ARM-based region-of-interest selections with the ARM resolution of 7.0$^{\circ}$ is equivalent to that of a PSF resolution of 33$^{\circ}$. As a result, treating the ARM resolution as a surrogate for the PSF resolution leads to significant overestimation of the signal-to-noise ratio, particularly in analyses assuming isotropic backgrounds. We further show that image reconstructions at pixel scales finer than the PSF resolution introduce substantial statistical uncertainties, reducing the effective number of independent spatial degrees of freedom. These findings underscore the necessity of PSF-based analysis for accurate sensitivity evaluation and statistically robust imaging in Compton cameras, particularly in applications where the background discrimination is critical.</description>

      <title>Null Stream Based Third-generation-ready Glitch Mitigation for Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors routinely encounter transient noise bursts, known as glitches, which are caused by either instrumental or environmental factors. Due to their high occurrence rate, glitches can overlap with GW signals, as in the notable case of GW170817, the first detection of a binary neutron star merger. Accurate reconstruction and subtraction of these glitches is a challenging problem that must be addressed to ensure that scientific conclusions drawn from the data are reliable. This problem will intensify with third-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope (ET) due to their higher detection rates of GWs and the longer duration of signals within the sensitivity band of the detectors. Robust glitch mitigation algorithms are, therefore, crucial for maximizing the scientific output of next-generation GW observatories. For the first time, we demonstrate how the null stream inherent in ET's unique triangular configuration can be leveraged by state-of-the-art glitch characterization methodology to essentially undo the effect of glitches for the purpose of estimating the parameters of the source. The null stream based approach enables characterization and subtraction of glitches that occur arbitrarily close to the peak of the signal without any significant effect on the quality of parameter measurements, and achieves an order of magnitude computational speed-up compared to when the null stream is not available. By contrast, without the null stream, significant biases can occur in the glitch reconstruction, which deteriorate the quality of subsequent measurements of the source parameters. This demonstrates a clear edge which the null stream can offer for precision GW science in the ET era.</description>
