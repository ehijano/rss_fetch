      <title>Periodic patterns in simple biological differential delay models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic patterns in dynamical behaviours of biological models described by simple form differential delay equations are studied. Mathematical models are given by a class of scalar delay differential equations with a multiplicative time periodic mixed coefficient and a nonlinear delayed negative feedback. The dynamics is studied analytically with supportive numerical simulation and justification of the theoretical outcomes. The principal nonlinearity involving the state variable is of the negative feedback type, the periodic multiplicative coefficient can change its sign, leading to equations with mixed positive-negative feedback. The existence of slowly oscillating periodic solutions of two different types is established. The theoretical analysis and derivation are based on the reduction of dynamics in the delay equations to that of interval maps. The theoretical outcomes are verified and supported by comprehensive numerical computations. The differential delay equations considered are generalisations of some well-known autonomous models from biological applications.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Emergent Linearity in Complex Dynamical Systems: The Role of Spatial Averaging and Vanishing Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, have been described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. Despite their vast differences, these systems are often similar in being comprised of numerous microscopic subsystems with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions that give rise to diverse emergent macroscopic behaviors. As such, a long-standing question across various fields has been to understand why and how various forms of macroscopic behavior emerge from underlying microscopic dynamics. Motivated by a growing body of empirical observations, in this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics, and develop a general theoretical framework for the interplay between spatial averaging, decaying microscopic correlations, and emergent macroscopic linearity. Using and extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that (in addition to technical assumptions) pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Weak Gibbs measures for the natural extension of $(1/\beta, \beta)$-shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25621v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the weak Gibbs measures for $(\alpha, \beta)$-shifts. In the case of $\alpha=0$, Pfister and Sullivan have given a necessary and sufficient condition on $\beta$ such that any equilibrium measure for a function of bounded total oscillations is a weak Gibbs measure in the natural extension of a $\beta$-shift. So it is natural to ask what happens when $\alpha&gt;0$. However, their proof cannot be applied to general $(\alpha, \beta)$-shifts in a similar way. In this paper we consider the case of $\alpha=1/\beta$ and give a criterion for the weak Gibbs property of equilibrium measures for $(1/\beta, \beta)$-shifts.</description>

      <title>Sierpinski carpet hyperbolic components of disjoint type are bounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish certain uniform a priori bounds for hyperbolic components of disjoint type. As an application, we will prove that Sierpinski carpet hyperbolic components of disjoint type are bounded. Furthermore, we show that for each map $f$ on the closure of such a hyperbolic component, there exists a quadratic-like restriction around every non-repelling periodic point. Extensions of these results to non-Sierpinski configurations are underway. As a prototype example, we describe the post-critical set of any map on the boundary of the hyperbolic component of $z^2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of simple dimension groups in which the cyclic subgroup generated by the order unit is replaced by a copy of $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ satisfying some strict conditions. Our main results are necessary and sufficient conditions on a Bratteli diagram which provides inductive limit structures for such groups. This result has an important application in constructing a version of the Bratteli-Vershik model for minimal actions of $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ on the Cantor set which will be the subject of a subsequent paper.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Write Mathematics Papers? A Case Study in Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI capabilities continue to grow exponentially on economically relevant human expert tasks, with task completion horizons doubling every 7 months according to the Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR), we are interested in how this applies to the task of mathematics research. To explore this, we evaluated the capability of four frontier large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT 5, Claude 4.1 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 4, at the task of creating a mini-paper on reservoir computing. All models produced engaging papers with some apparent understanding of various techniques, but were sometimes lead to mistakes by surface level understanding of key ideas. That said, the capabilities on LLMs on this task was likely as good or greater than that predicted by METR.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Framework for Epidemic Dynamics: Optimal Control and Global Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops and analyzes an extended Susceptible, Infected, Hospitalized and Recovered (SIHR) model incorporating time dependent control functions to capture preventive measures (e.g., distancing, mask use) and resource limited therapeutic interventions. This formulation provides a realistic mathematical framework for modeling public health responses beyond classical uncontrolled epidemic models. The control design is integrated into the model via an optimal control framework, solved numerically using the Forward Backward Sweep method, enabling the exploration of intervention strategies on epidemic dynamics, including infection prevalence, hospitalization burden, and the effective reproduction number. To assess the robustness of these strategies under uncertainty, we employ Polynomial Chaos Expansion combined with Sobol sensitivity indices, quantifying the influence of key epidemiological parameters (transmission, recovery, hospitalization rates) on model outcomes. Numerical simulations, calibrated to Djiboutian COVID 19 data, show that combined preventive and therapeutic interventions substantially mitigate epidemic burden, though their effectiveness depends critically on transmission related uncertainties. The originality of this work lies in combining optimal control theory with global sensitivity analysis, thus bridging numerical methods, optimization, and epidemic modeling. This integrated approach offers a general mathematical framework for designing and evaluating control strategies in infectious disease outbreaks, with applications to low resource settings and beyond.</description>

      <title>Fundamental groups of strata of abelian differentials of low codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for a stratum of projectivized abelian differentials with sufficiently many simple zeroes, the inclusion into the appropriate moduli space of pointed curves induces an injection at the level of orbifold fundamental group, thereby confirming part of a 1997 conjecture of Kontsevich-Zorich. Combined with previous work of the author with Calderon, this describes the orbifold fundamental groups of these strata as framed mapping class groups. Our approach is algebro-geometric in nature, and is based on Shimada's techniques for computing fundamental groups via morphisms of varieties that behave like fiber bundles away from loci of high codimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under weaker regularity and compactness assumptions, we find the mountain-pass essential point, which is a novel extension of the classical Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz mountain pass theorem. We study the reversible superquadratic autonomous Hamiltonian systems whose Hamiltonian $H(p,q)$ is strictly convex in the position $q\in\mathbf{R}^n$ and prove that for every $T&gt;0$, the system has a $T$-periodic brake solution $\bar x$ with minimal period $T$, provided the Hessian $H_{pp}(\bar x(t))\in\mathbf{R}^{n\times n}$ is semi-positive definite for $t\in\mathbf{R}$ or $n=1$. For brake subharmonics of general reversible nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems, we also get some new results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the structure of translational tilings has captivated mathematicians, scientists, and the general public for centuries and continues to thrive at the crossroads of analysis, combinatorics, dynamics, logic, number theory, and geometry. This vibrant field seeks to uncover the delicate divide between rigid structures and unpredictable, ``wild'' behaviors that arise when sets fill space by translations without gaps or overlaps. We provide an overview of this study and recent developments, highlighting its multidisciplinary nature and offering a glimpse into the process behind the results.</description>

      <title>What does the tree of life look like as it grows? Evolution and the multifractality of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By unifying three foundational principles of modern biology, we develop a mathematical framework to analyze the growing tree of life. Contrary to the static case, where the analogy between phylogenetic trees and the tree that grows in soil is drawn, our framework shows that the living tree of life is analogous to a Cantor dust where each branch is a distinct fractal curve. The system as a whole is therefore multifractal in the sense that it consists of many unique fractals. The three foundational principles for the mathematical framework are that phylogeny is nested, phylogeny is dualistic (i.e., transitive between singularities and populations), and phylogeny is stochastic. Integrating these three principles, we model the dynamic (i.e., living) tree of life as a random iterated function system that generates unique convexly related sequences of branching random variables (visualized in Animation 1). The multifractal nature of this dynamic tree of life implies that, for any two living entities, the time interval from their last common ancestor to the present moment is a distinct fractal curve for each. Thus, the length of a time interval along each distinct branch is unique, so that time is also multifractal and not an ultrametric on the tree of life.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of a stochastic process obtained by random switching between a finite collection of vector fields. Such processes have recently been the focus of much attention in the case where the switching times are exponentially distributed, i.e., Markovian switching. In this contribution, we admit any distribution on $\mathbb{R}_+$ as a law for the switching times. We show that whenever this law is not singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, the stochastic process obtained from the random switching is Feller. More importantly, we give conditions on the switching and on the vector fields ensuring that the Lie bracket condition considered in the Markovian case in Bakhtin and Hurth (2012) and Bena\"im, Le Borgne, Malrieu and Zitt (2015) still imply ergodicity of the process.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the space of subgroups of non-amenable generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS groups) of rank $d$, that is, groups acting cocompactly on an oriented tree with vertex and edge stabilizers isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Our results generalize the study of Baumslag-Solitar groups, and of GBS groups of rank $1$. We give an explicit description of the perfect kernel of a non-amenable GBS group $G$ of rank $d$ and show the existence of a partition of the perfect kernel into a countably infinite set of pieces which are invariant under the action by conjugation of $G$, and such that each piece contains a dense orbit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand the dictionary between the action of a torus homeomorphism on the fine curve graph and its rotation set. More precisely, we show that the fixed points at infinity of a loxodromic element determine the rotation set up to scale. A key ingredient is a metric version of the classical WPD property from geometric group theory. As a consequence we find new stable criteria for positive scl, and for two homeomorphisms to generate a free group.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of nonlinear systems with unknown delays via delay-adaptive neural operator approximate predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes the first rigorous stability guarantees for approximate predictors in delay-adaptive control of nonlinear systems, addressing a key challenge in practical implementations where exact predictors are unavailable. We analyze two scenarios: (i) when the actuated input is directly measurable, and (ii) when it is estimated online. For the measurable input case, we prove semi-global practical asymptotic stability with an explicit bound proportional to the approximation error $\epsilon$. For the unmeasured input case, we demonstrate local practical asymptotic stability, with the region of attraction explicitly dependent on both the initial delay estimate and the predictor approximation error. To bridge theory and practice, we show that neural operators-a flexible class of neural network-based approximators-can achieve arbitrarily small approximation errors, thus satisfying the conditions of our stability theorems. Numerical experiments on two nonlinear benchmark systems-a biological protein activator/repressor model and a micro-organism growth Chemostat model-validate our theoretical results. In particular, our numerical simulations confirm stability under approximate predictors, highlight the strong generalization capabilities of neural operators, and demonstrate a substantial computational speedup of up to 15x compared to a baseline fixed-point method.</description>

      <title>$C^1$ invariant, stable and inertial manifolds for non-autonomous dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the version of the Lyapunov--Perron method operating on individual solutions to investigate the existence of invariant manifolds for non-autonomous dynamical systems, focusing in particular on inertial and stable manifolds. We establish a characterization of both types of manifolds in terms of solutions exhibiting a common growth behavior, analogous to the classical characterization involving hyperbolicity. Furthermore, we introduce a unified formulation of the gap condition, from which known sharp versions are derived. Finally, we show that the constructed inertial manifolds have $C^1$ regularity.</description>

      <title>On the verification of a Nicolas inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11182v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nicolas inequality we deal can be written as \begin{equation}\label{Nicineq} e^\gamma \log\log N_x &lt; \dfrac{N_x}{\varphi(N_x)}\,, \end{equation} where $x\ge 2$, $N_x$ denotes the product of the primes less or equal than $x$, $\gamma$ is the Euler constant and $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. We see that verification of such an inequality depends on the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that. Then we analyze the sign of such an error term.</description>

      <title>Robot Conga: A Leader-Follower Walking Approach to Sequential Path Following in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.</description>
