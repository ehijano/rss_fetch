      <title>QC-OT: Optimal Transport with Quasiconformal Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal transport (OT) map offers the most economical way to transfer one probability measure distribution to another. Classical OT theory does not involve a discussion of preserving topological connections and orientations in transmission results and processes. Existing numerical and geometric methods for computing OT seldom pays specific attention on this aspect. Especially, when dealing with the triangular mesh data, the known semi-discrete geometric OT (sd-OT) method employs critical operation of Delaunay triangulation (DT) to adapt topology to ensure the convexity of the energy function and the existence of the solution. This change in topology hampers the applicability of OT in modeling non-flip physical deformations in real-world tasks such as shape registration and editing problems in computer vision and medical imaging fields. This work introduces the topology structure-preserving optimal transport (QC-OT) map for the triangular mesh input. The computational strategy focuses on the two components: relaxing DT and convexity check in sd-OT and integrating quasiconformal (QC) correction. Here, quasiconformal mapping is employed to correct the regions unexpected distortions, and guarantee the topological preserving property of the transport. Furthermore, the spatial-temporal topology-preserving OT map is presented based t-OT to study the dynamics of the transportation. Multiple experiments have validated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrated its potential in the applications of mesh parameterization and image editing.</description>

      <title>Not OCA and products of Frechet spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the investigation of the question of whether the product of two countable Fr\'echet spaces must be M-separable. We are especially interested in this question in the presence of Martin's Axiom. The question has been shown to be independent of Martin's Axiom but only in models in which $\mathfrak c\leq\omega_2$. In fact, OCA implies an affirmative answer.</description>

      <title>Regularity Conditions for Critical Point Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on a sequence of functions $\{f_n\}$, defined on a compact manifold with boundary $S$, converging in the $C^k$ metric to a limit $f$. A common assumption implicitly made in the empirical sciences is that when such functions represent random processes derived from data, the topological features of $f_n$ will eventually resemble those of $f$. In this work, we investigate the validity of this claim under various regularity assumptions, with the goal of finding conditions sufficient for the number of local maxima, minima and saddle of such functions to converge. In the $C^1$ setting, we do so by employing lesser-known variants of the Poincar\'{e}-Hopf and mountain pass theorems, and in the $C^2$ setting we pursue an approach inspired by the homotopy-based proof of the Morse Lemma. To aid practical use, we end by reformulating our central theorems in the language of the empirical processes.</description>

      <title>Burnside rings for racks and quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We restructure and advance the classification theory of finite racks and quandles by employing powerful methods from transformation groups and representation theory, especially Burnside rings. These rings serve as universal receptacles for those invariants of racks and quandles that are additive with respect to decompositions. We present several fundamental results regarding their structure, including additive bases and multiplicative generators. We also develop a theory of marks, which is analogous to counting fixed points of group actions and computing traces in character theory, and which is comprehensive enough to distinguish different elements in the Burnside rings. The new structures not only offer a fresh framework for the classification theory of finite racks and quandles but also equip us with tools to develop these ideas and create interfaces that strengthen connections with related areas of algebra. For example, they extend the Dress--Siebeneicher theory of the Burnside ring of the infinite cyclic group beyond the realm of permutation racks.</description>

      <title>Permuting the roots of univariate polynomials whose coefficients depend on parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.14235v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address two interrelated problems concerning permutation of roots of univariate polynomials whose coefficients depend on parameters. First, we compute the Galois group of polynomials $\varphi(x)\in\mathbb{C}[t_1,\cdots,t_k][x]$ over $\mathbb{C}(t_1,\cdots,t_k)$. Provided that the corresponding multivariate polynomial $\varphi(x,t_1,\cdots,t_k)$ is generic with respect to its support $A\subset \mathbb{Z}^{k+1}$, we determine the Galois group associated to any $A$. Second, we determine the Galois group of systems of polynomial equations of the form $p(x,t)=q(t)=0$ where $p$ and $q$ have fixed supports $A_1\subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ and $A_2\subset \{0\}\times \mathbb{Z}$, respectively. For each problem, we determine the image of an appropriate braid monodromy map in order to compute the sought Galois group. Among the applications, we determine the Galois group of any rational function that is generic with respect to its support. We also provide general obstructions on the Galois group of enumerative problems over algebraic groups.</description>

      <title>Generic properties of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study generic properties of topological groups in the sense of Baire category. First we investigate countably infinite (discrete) groups. We extend a classical result of B. H. Neumann, H. Simmons and A. Macintyre on algebraically closed groups and the word problem. I. Goldbring, S. E. Kunnawalkam and Y. Lodha proved that every isomorphism class is meager among countably infinite (discrete) groups. In contrast, we show that there is a comeager isomorphism class among countably infinite (discrete) abelian groups. Then we turn to compact metrizable abelian groups. We use Pontryagin duality to show that there is a comeager isomorphism class among compact metrizable abelian groups. We discuss its connections to the countably infinite (discrete) case. Finally, we study compact metrizable groups. We prove that the generic compact metrizable group is neither connected nor totally disconnected; also it is neither torsion-free nor a torsion group.</description>

      <title>Generic isomorphism classes of abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the universal solenoid is the generic (in the sense of Baire category) connected compact metrizable abelian group. We also settle the dual problem in the sense of Pontryagin duality: $(\mathbb{Q},+)$, which is the dual of the universal solenoid, is the generic countably infinite torsion-free abelian group.</description>
