      <title>Computing the Volume of Polytropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply an algorithm for measuring the volume of polytopes described by Jim Lawrence to polytropes. By using a tropical form of Cramer's rule, we found an efficient way to find all pseudovertices which are necessary for computing the volume. Due to the limited possibilities for hyperplanes of polytropes, this led to a simplification of the algorithm, decreasing the time complexity significantly.</description>

      <title>Between burning and cooling: liminal burning on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liminal burning generalizes both the burning and cooling processes in graphs. In $k$-liminal burning, a Saboteur reveals $k$-sets of vertices in each round, with the goal of extending the length of the game, and the Arsonist must choose sources only within these sets, with the goal of ending the game as soon as possible. The result is a two-player game with the corresponding optimization parameter called the $k$-liminal burning number. For $k = |V(G)|$, liminal burning is identical to burning, and for $k = 1$, liminal burning is identical to cooling.
  Using a variant of Sperner sets, $k$-liminal burning numbers of hypercubes are studied along with bounds and exact values for various values of $k$. In particular, we determine the exact cooling number of the $n$-dimensional hypercube to be $n.$ We analyze liminal burning for several graph families, such as Cartesian grids and products, paths, and graphs whose vertex sets can be decomposed into many components of small diameter. We consider the complexity of liminal burning and show that liminal burning a graph is PSPACE-complete for $k\geq 2,$ using a reduction from $3$-QBF. We also prove, through a reduction from burning, that even in some cases when liminal burning is likely not PSPACE-complete, it is co-NP-hard. We finish with several open problems.</description>

      <title>Prefix-bounded matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By unifying various earlier extensions of alternating sign matrices (ASMs), we introduce the notion of prefix-bounded matrices (PBMs). It is shown that the convex hull of these matrices forms the intersection of two special (called laminar) g-polymatroids. This implies (in a more general form) that the linear inequality system given by Behrend and Knight and by Striker for describing the polytope of alternating sign matrices is TDI, confirming a recent conjecture of Edmonds. By relying on the polymatroidal approach, we derive a characterization for the existence of prefix-bounded matrices meeting upper and lower bound requirements on their entries.
  Furthermore, we point out that the constraint matrix of the linear system describing the convex hull of PBMs (in particular, ASMs) is a network matrix. This implies that (a) standard network flow techniques can be used to manage algorithmically optimization and structural results on PBMs obtained via g-polymatroids, (b) the linear system is actually box-TDI, and (c) the convex hull of PBMs has (a sharpened form of) the integer Carath\'eodory property, in particular, the integer decomposition property. This latter feature makes it possible to confirm (in an extended form) an elegant conjecture of Brualdi and Dahl on the decomposability of a so-called $k$-regular alternating sign matrix as the sum of $k$ pattern-disjoint ASMs.</description>

      <title>Odd Shifted Parking Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stanley recently introduced the shifted parking function symmetric function $SH_n$, which is the shiftification of Haiman's parking function symmetric function $PF_n$. The function $SH_n$ lives in the subalgebra of symmetric functions generated by odd power sums. Stanley showed how to expand $SH_n$ into the $V-$basis of this algebra, which is indexed by partitions with all parts odd and is analogous to the complete homogeneous (or elementary) basis of symmetric functions. We introduce odd shifted parking functions to give combinatorial and representation-theoretic realizations of the $V-$expansion of $SH_n$, resolving the main open problem in his paper. Further, we present two representation-theoretic realizations of shiftification allowing us to interpret $SH_n$ as the spin character of a projective representation. We conclude with further directions, including a relationship between $SH_n$ and Haglund's $(q,t)-$Schr\"oder theorem.</description>

      <title>A local framework for proving combinatorial matrix inversion theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial transition matrices arise frequently in the theory of symmetric functions and their generalizations. The entries of such matrices often count signed, weighted combinatorial structures such as semistandard tableaux, rim-hook tableaux, or brick tabloids. Bijective proofs that two such matrices are inverses of each other may be difficult to find. This paper presents a general framework for proving such inversion results in the case where the combinatorial objects are built up recursively by successively adding some incremental structure such as a single horizontal strip or rim-hook. In this setting, we show that a sequence of matrix inversion results $A_nB_n=I$ can be reduced to a certain ``local'' identity involving the incremental structures. Here, $A_n$ and $B_n$ are matrices that might be non-square, and the columns of $A_n$ and the rows of $B_n$ indexed by compositions of $n$. We illustrate the general theory with four classical applications involving the Kostka matrices, the character tables of the symmetric group, incidence matrices for composition posets, and matrices counting brick tabloids. We obtain a new, canonical bijective proof of an inversion result for rectangular Kostka matrices, which complements the proof for the square case due to E\u{g}ecio\u{g}lu and Remmel. We also give a new bijective proof of the orthogonality result for the irreducible $S_n$-characters that is shorter than the original version due to White.</description>

      <title>Connected dom-forcing sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a graph G, a dominating set Df subset of V (G) is called a dom-forcing set if the sub-graph induced by Df must form a zero forcing set. The minimum cardinality of such a set is known as the dom-forcing number of the graph G, denoted by Fd(G). A connected dom-forcing forcing set of a graph G, is a dom-forcing set of G that induces a sub graph of G which is connected. The connected dom-forcing number of G, Fcd(G), is the minimum size of a connected dom-forcing set. This study delves into the concept of the connected dom-forcing number Fcd(G), examining its properties and characteristics. Furthermore, it seeks to accurately determine Fcd(G) for several well-known graphs and their graph products.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for $t$-tough graphs to be Hamiltonian and pancyclic or bipartite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The toughness of graph $G$, denoted by $\tau(G)$, is $\tau(G)=\min\{\frac{|S|}{c(G-S)}:S\subseteq V(G),c(G-S)\geq2\}$ for every vertex cut $S$ of $V(G)$ and the number of components of $G$ is denoted by $c(G)$. Bondy in 1973, suggested the ``metaconjecture" that almost any nontrivial condition on a graph which implies that the graph is Hamiltonian also implies that the graph is pancyclic. Recently, Benediktovich [Discrete Applied Mathematics. 365 (2025) 130--137] confirmed the Bondy's metaconjecture for $t$-tough graphs in the case when $t\in\{1;2;3\}$ in terms of the size, the spectral radius and the signless Laplacian spectral radius of the graph. In this paper, we will confirm the Bondy's metaconjecture for $t$-tough graphs in the case when $t\geq4$ in terms of the size, the spectral radius, the signless Laplacian spectral radius, the distance spectral radius and the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius of graphs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $t$-fan is the graph on $2t+1$ vertices consisting of $t$ triangles which intersect at exactly one common vertex. For a given graph $F$, the $r$-expansion $F^r$ of $F$ is the $r$-uniform hypergraph obtained from $F$ by adding $r-2$ distinct new vertices to each edge of $F$. We determine the Tur\'an number of the 3-expansion of the $t$-fan for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Separability Properties of Monadically Dependent Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph class $\mathcal C$ is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored graphs from $\mathcal C$ using a fixed first-order interpretation. We prove that monadically dependent classes can be exactly characterized by the following property, which we call flip-separability: for every $r\in \mathbb{N}$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and every graph $G\in \mathcal{C}$ equipped with a weight function on vertices, one can apply a bounded (in terms of $\mathcal{C},r,\varepsilon$) number of flips (complementations of the adjacency relation on a subset of vertices) to $G$ so that in the resulting graph, every radius-$r$ ball contains at most an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the total weight. On the way to this result, we introduce a robust toolbox for working with various notions of local separations in monadically dependent classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chao and Yu \cite{Chao24} introduced an entropy method for hypergraph Tur\'an problems, and used it to show that the family of $\lfloor k/2\rfloor$ $k$-uniform tents have Tur\'an density $k!/k^k$. Il'kovi\v{c} and Yan \cite{ilkovivc25} improved this by reducing to a subfamily of $\lceil k/e\rceil$ tents. In this note, enhancing Il'kovi\v{c}-Yan's result, we give a significantly shorter entropy proof, with optimal bounds within this framework.</description>

      <title>Trees with proper thinness 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper thinness of a graph is an invariant that generalizes the concept of a proper interval graph. Every graph has a numerical value of proper thinness and the graphs with proper thinness~1 are exactly the proper interval graphs. A graph is proper $k$-thin if its vertices can be ordered in such a way that there is a partition of the vertices into $k$ classes satisfying that for each triple of vertices $r &lt; s &lt; t$, such that there is an edge between $r$ and $t$, it is true that if $r$ and $s$ belong to the same class, then there is an edge between $s$ and $t$, and if $s$ and $t$ belong to the same class, then there is an edge between $r$ and $s$. The proper thinness is the smallest value of $k$ such that the graph is proper $k$-thin. In this work we focus on the calculation of proper thinness for trees. We characterize trees of proper thinness~2, both structurally and by their minimal forbidden induced subgraphs. The characterizations obtained lead to a polynomial-time recognition algorithm. We furthermore show why the structural results obtained for trees of proper thinness~2 cannot be straightforwardly generalized to trees of proper thinness~3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $k \geq 3$ and $1 \leq \ell \leq k-1$ we give an asymptotically best possible minimum positive codegree condition for the existence of a Hamilton $\ell$-cycle in a $k$-uniform hypergraph. This result exhibits an interesting duality with its analogue under a minimum codegree condition. The special case $\ell = k-1$ of our result establishes an asymptotic version of a recent conjecture of Illingworth, Lang, M\"uyesser, Parczyk and Sgueglia on tight Hamilton cycles in hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Novel Constructions of Words with Strong Avoidance Properties and their Combinatorial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper begins with a comprehensive overview of combinatorics on words and symbolic dynamics, covering their historical origins, fundamental concepts, and interconnections. Building upon this foundation, we introduce novel mathematical constructions related to pattern avoidance in infinite words. Specifically, we define Strongly $(k, \delta)$-Free Words generated via cyclic shift morphisms and present a theorem establishing specific avoidance properties for these words, along with a detailed proof. Furthermore, we propose a conjecture regarding their factor complexity. These original results contribute to the theoretical understanding of word structures and their combinatorial properties, opening avenues for further research in discrete mathematics.</description>

Abstract: We consider the $d$-neighbor bootstrap percolation process on the $d$-dimensional torus, with vertex set $V=\{1,\cdots,n\}^d$ and edge set $\{xy:\sum_{i=1}^d|x_i-y_i (\text{mod} \; n)|=1\}$. We determine the percolation time up to a constant factor with high probability when the initial infection probability is in a certain range and the infection threshold is $d$, extending one of the two main theorems from Balister,Bollob{\'a}s, and Smith (2016) about the percolation time with the infection threshold equal to $2$ on the two-dimensional torus.</description>

      <title>A Multigraph Characterization of Permutiple Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A permutiple is a natural number whose representation in some base is an integer multiple of a number whose representation has the same collection of digits. A previous paper utilizes a finite-state-machine construction and its state graph to recognize permutiples and to generate new examples. Permutiples are associated with walks on the state graph which necessarily satisfy certain conditions. However, the above effort does not provide conditions sufficient for the existence of permutiples. In this paper, we provide such a condition, which we will state using the language of multigraphs.</description>

      <title>On the properties of alternating invariant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functions satisfying the functional equation \begin{align*} \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} (-1)^r f(x+ry, ny) = f(x,y), \text{ where } n \text{ is an odd integer}, \end{align*} are named the alternating invariant functions. Examples of such functions include Euler polynomials, alternating Hurwitz zeta functions and their associated Gamma functions. In this paper, we shall systematically investigate the fundamental properties of alternating invariant functions, proving that the set of alternating invariant functions is closed under the operation translation, reflection, and differentiation. In particular, we construct the following convolution for alternating invariant functions: \begin{align*} g * h(x,y) = \int_0^x g(t,y)h(x-t,y)dt - \int_x^y g(t,y)h(x+y-t,y)dt, \end{align*} and prove that its closed under convolution. Furthermore, we derive explicit convolution formulas for Euler polynomials: \begin{align*} \frac{y^mE_m\left( \frac{x}{y}\right) }{2m!}\ast \frac{y^nE_n\left( \frac{x}{y}\right) }{2n!}=\frac{y^{m+n+1}E_{m+n+1}\left( \frac{x}{y}\right) }{2(m+n+1)!} \end{align*} and for alternating Hurwitz zeta functions: \begin{align*} \frac{y^{\alpha-1}\zeta_E\left( 1-\alpha,\frac{x}{y}\right) }{\Gamma(\alpha)}\ast \frac{y^{\beta-1}\zeta_E\left( 1-\beta,\frac{x}{y}\right) }{\Gamma(\beta)}=\frac{y^{\alpha+\beta-1}\zeta_E\left( 1-\alpha-\beta,\frac{x}{y}\right) }{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}. \end{align*} Finally, based on the distributional relations, we construct further examples of alternating invariant functions, including suitable combinations of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show some expressions of certain $q$-multiple zeta-star values at roots of unity. These explicit formulas are expressed by using the determinants or Bell polynomials. Explicit formulas for other types of values can be found from recurrence relations obtained using generating functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short note answers a question raised by Nathanson \cite{Nath25} about "races" between iterated sumsets. We prove that for any integer $n$, there are finite sets of integers $A$ and $B$ with same diameter such that the signs of the elements of the sequence $(|hA|-|hB|)_h$ changes at least $n$ times. Kravitz proved in \cite{Kravitz} a much better result. This brief and modest note may serve as a stepping stone towards his work.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for a generalization of the Ewens measure to random tuples of commuting permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the number of joint orbits of random tuples of commuting permutations. In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruzsa asked whether there exist Fourier-uniform subsets of $\mathbb Z/N\mathbb Z$ with density $\alpha$ and 4-term arithmetic progression (4-AP) density at most $\alpha^C$, for arbitrarily large $C$. Gowers constructed Fourier uniform sets with density $\alpha$ and 4-AP density at most $\alpha^{4+c}$ for some small constant $c&gt;0$. We show that an affirmative answer to Ruzsa's question would follow from the existence of an $N^{o(1)}$-coloring of $[N]$ without symmetrically colored 4-APs. For a broad and natural class of constructions of Fourier-uniform subsets of $\mathbb Z/N\mathbb Z$, we show that Ruzsa's question is equivalent to our arithmetic Ramsey question.
  We prove analogous results for all even-length APs. For each odd $k\geq 5$, we show that there exist $U^{k-2}$-uniform subsets of $\mathbb Z/N\mathbb Z$ with density $\alpha$ and $k$-AP density at most $\alpha^{c_k \log(1/\alpha)}$. We also prove generalizations to arbitrary one-dimensional patterns.</description>

Abstract: We prove best-possible edge density conditions sufficient to guarantee traceability, Hamiltonicity, chorded pancyclicity, Hamiltonian-connectedness, $k$-path Hamiltonicity, $k$-Hamiltonicity, $k$-Hamiltonian-connectedness, and $k$-connectedness in $K_{r+1}$-free graphs. We characterize the extremal graphs. Then we extend these edge density conditions to clique density conditions. Equivalently, we introduce variants of the extremal number ex$(n,F)$ and the generalized extremal number ex$(n,H,F)$ -- that is, the maximum numbers of edges and copies of $H$, respectively, in $n$-vertex, $F$-free graphs -- in which we require that these graphs not be traceable, Hamiltonian, chorded pancyclic, Hamiltonian-connected, $k$-path Hamiltonian, $k$-Hamiltonian, $k$-Hamiltonian-connected, or $k$-connected, and we determine their values for $F=K_{r+1}$ and $H=K_t$.</description>

      <title>On $\mathbb N$-Coefficient Binomial Polynomiality of Hurwitz Numbers and Generalized Dessin Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a certain type of Hurwitz numbers which count branched covers over the Riemann sphere admitting several branch points with fixed ramification types, one branch point with a fixed number of preimages, and one branch point with an arbitrary ramification type. We prove that the dependence of this kind of Hurwitz numbers on parts of the ramification type over the last point is a polynomial. Moreover, when expanding this polynomial in terms of products of binomial coefficients, we show that the coefficients are always non-negative integers via a pure combinatorial method. Our result generalizes the polynomiality in several models, including the one-part double Hurwitz numbers studied by Goulden-Jackson-Vakil, the one-part double Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles studied by Shadrin-Spitz-Zvonkine, and the generalized dessin counting.</description>

Abstract: The Lonely Runner Conjecture originated in Diophantine approximation will turn 60 in 2028. Even if the conjecture is still widely open, the flow of partial results, innovative tools and connections to different problems and applications has been steady on its long life.

      <title>Term Coding for Extremal Combinatorics: Dispersion and Complexity Dichotomies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{Term Coding}, a novel framework for analysing extremal problems in discrete mathematics by encoding them as finite systems of \emph{term equations} (and, optionally, \emph{non-equality constraints}). In its basic form, all variables range over a single domain, and we seek an interpretation of the function symbols that \emph{maximises} the number of solutions to these constraints. This perspective unifies classical questions in extremal combinatorics, network/index coding, and finite model theory.
  We further develop \emph{multi-sorted Term Coding}, a more general approach in which variables may be of different sorts (e.g., points, lines, blocks, colours, labels), possibly supplemented by variable-inequality constraints to enforce distinctness. This extension captures sophisticated structures such as block designs, finite geometries, and mixed coding scenarios within a single logical formalism.
  Our main result shows how to determine (up to a constant) the maximum number of solutions \(\max_{\mathcal{I}}(\Gamma,n)\) for any system of term equations (possibly including non-equality constraints) by relating it to \emph{graph guessing numbers} and \emph{entropy measures}.
  Finally, we focus on \emph{dispersion problems}, an expressive subclass of these constraints. We discover a striking complexity dichotomy: deciding whether, for a given integer \(r\), the maximum code size that reaches \(n^{r}\) is \emph{undecidable}, while deciding whether it exceeds \(n^{r}\) is \emph{polynomial-time decidable}.</description>

      <title>Faithful universal graphs for minor-closed classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was proved by Huynh, Mohar, \v{S}\'amal, Thomassen and Wood in 2021 that any countable graph containing every countable planar graph as a subgraph has an infinite clique minor. We prove a finite, quantitative version of this result: for fixed $t$, if a graph $G$ is $K_t$-minor-free and contains every $n$-vertex planar graph as a subgraph, then $G$ has $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$ vertices. If $G$ contains every $n$-vertex toroidal graph instead, then $G$ has $2^{\Omega(n)}$ vertices. On the other hand, we construct a polynomial size $K_4$-minor-free graph containing every $n$-vertex tree as an induced subgraph, and a polynomial size $K_7$-minor-free graph containing every $n$-vertex $K_4$-minor-free graph as induced subgraph. This answers several problems raised recently by Bergold, Ir\v{s}i\v{c}, Lauff, Orthaber, Scheucher and Wesolek.
  We study more generally the order of universal graphs for various classes (of graphs of bounded degree, treedepth, pathwidth, or treewidth), if the universal graphs retain some of the structure of the original class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fulton's matrix Schubert varieties are affine varieties that arise in the study of Schubert calculus in the complete flag variety. Weigandt showed that arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties, now called ASM varieties, are indexed by alternating sign matrices (ASMs), objects with a long history in enumerative combinatorics. It is very difficult to assess Cohen-Macaulayness of ASM varieties or to compute their codimension, though these properties are well understood for matrix Schubert varieties due to work of Fulton. In this paper we study these properties of ASM varieties with a focus on the relationship between a pair of ASMs and their direct sum. We also consider ASM pattern avoidance from an algebro-geometric perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The central object of study in this paper are infinite banded Hessenberg matrices admitting factorisations as products of bidiagonal matrices. In the two main novel results of this paper, we show that these Hessenberg matrices are associated with the decomposition of $(r+1)$-fold symmetric $r$-orthogonal polynomials and are the production matrices of the generating polynomials of $r$-Dyck paths.
  We combine the aforementioned bidiagonal matrix factorisations and the recently found connection of multiple orthogonal polynomials with lattice paths and branched continued fractions to study $(r+1)$-fold symmetric $r$-orthogonal polynomials on a star-like set of the complex plane and their decomposition via multiple orthogonal polynomials on the positive real line. As an explicit example, we give formulas as terminating hypergeometric series for the Appell sequences of $(r+1)$-fold symmetric $r$-orthogonal polynomials on a star-like set and show that the densities of their orthogonality measures can be expressed via Meijer G-functions on the positive real line.</description>

      <title>Eight-Partitioning Points in 3D, and Efficiently Too</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02627v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An {\em eight-partition} of a finite set of points (respectively, of a continuous mass distribution) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ consists of three planes that divide the space into $8$ octants, such that each open octant contains at most $1/8$ of the points (respectively, of the mass). In 1966, Hadwiger showed that any mass distribution in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition; moreover, one can prescribe the normal direction of one of the three planes. The analogous result for finite point sets follows by a standard limit argument.
  We prove the following variant of this result: Any mass distribution (or point set) in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an eight-partition for which the intersection of two of the planes is a line with a prescribed direction.
  Moreover, we present an efficient algorithm for calculating an eight-partition of a set of $n$ points in~$\mathbb{R}^3$ (with prescribed normal direction of one of the planes) in time $O^{*}(n^{7/3})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequalities among symmetric functions are fundamental in various branches of mathematics, thus motivating a systematic study of their structure. Majorization has been shown to characterize inequalities among commonly used symmetric functions, except for complete homogeneous symmetric functions (shortened as CHs). In 2011, Cuttler, Greene, and Skandera posed a natural question: Can majorization also characterize inequalities among CHs? Their work demonstrated that majorization characterizes inequalities among CHs up to degree 7 and suggested exploring its validity for higher degrees. In this paper, we show that, for every degree greater than 7, majorization does not characterize inequalities among CHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A superpermutation is a sequence that contains every permutation of $n$ distinct symbols as a contiguous substring. For instance, a valid example for three symbols is a sequence that contains all six permutations. This paper introduces a new algorithm that constructs such sequences more efficiently than existing recursive and graph-theoretic methods. Unlike traditional techniques that suffer from scalability and factorial memory demands, the proposed approach builds superpermutations directly and compactly.
