      <title>Quasi-continuum approximations for nonlinear dispersive waves in general discrete conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a non-integrable discrete lattice model which is a variant of an integrable discretization of the standard Hopf equation. Interestingly, a direct numerical simulation of the Riemann problem associated with such a discrete lattice shows the emergence of both the dispersive shock wave (DSW) and rarefaction wave (RW). We propose two quasi-continuum models which are represented by partial differential equations (PDEs) in order to both analytically and numerically capture the features of the DSW and RW of the lattice. Accordingly, we apply the DSW fitting method to gain important insights and provide theoretical predictions on various edge features of the DSW including the edge speed and wavenumber. Meanwhile, we analytically compute the self-similar solutions of the quasi-continuum models, which serve as the approximation of the RW of the lattice. We then conduct comparisons between these numerical and analytical results to examine the performance of the approximation of the quasi-continuum models to the discrete lattice.</description>

      <title>Ferrodark soliton collisions: breather formation, pair reproduction and spin-mass separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study collisions between a ferrodark soliton (FDS) and an antiFDS ($Z_2$ kinks in the spin order) in the easy-plane phase of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). For a type-I pair (type-I FDS-antiFDS pair) at low incoming velocities, the pair annihilates followed by the formation of an extremely long-lived dissipative breather on a stable background, a spatially localized wave packet with out-of-phase oscillating magnetization and number densities. Periodic emissions of spin and density waves cause breather energy dissipation and we find that the breather energy decays logarithmically in time. When the incoming velocity is larger than a critical velocity at which a stationary FDS-anti FDS pair forms, a pair with finite separating velocity is reproduced. When approaching the critical velocity from below, we find that the lifetime of the stationary type-I pair shows a power-law divergence, resembling a critical behavior. In contrast, a type-II pair (type-II FDS-antiFDS pair)never annihilates and only exhibits reflection. For collisions of a mixed type FDS-antiFDS pair, as $Z_2$ kinks in the spin order, reflection occurs in the topological structure of the magnetization while the mass superfluid density profiles pass through each other, manifesting spin-mass separation.</description>

      <title>The effect of self-induced Marangoni flow on polar-nematic waves in active-matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of propagating large-scale density waves of mixed polar-nematic symmetry in a colony of self-propelled agents that are bound to move along the planar surface of a thin viscous film. The agents act as an insoluble surfactant, i.e. the surface tension of the liquid depends on their density. Therefore, density gradients generate a Marangoni flow. We demonstrate that for active matter in the form of self-propelled surfactants with local (nematic) aligning interactions such a Marangoni flow nontrivially influences the propagation of the density waves. Upon gradually increasing the Marangoni parameter, which characterises the relative strength of the Marangoni flow as compared to the self-propulsion speed, the density waves broaden while their speed may either increase or decrease depending on wavelength and overall mean density. A further increase of the Marangoni parameter eventually results in the disappearance of the density waves. This may occur either discontinuously at finite wave amplitude via a saddle-node bifurcation or continuously with vanishing wave amplitude at a wave bifurcation, i.e. a finite-wavelength Hopf bifurcation.</description>
