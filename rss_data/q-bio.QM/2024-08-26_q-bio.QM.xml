      <title>Consistent diffusion matrix estimation from population time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress on modern scientific questions regularly depends on using large-scale datasets to understand complex dynamical systems. An especially challenging case that has grown to prominence with advances in single-cell sequencing technologies is learning the behavior of individuals from population snapshots. In the absence of individual-level time series, standard stochastic differential equation models are often nonidentifiable because intrinsic diffusion cannot be distinguished from measurement noise. Despite the difficulty, accurately recovering diffusion terms is required to answer even basic questions about the system's behavior. We show how to combine population-level time series with velocity measurements to build a provably consistent estimator of the diffusion matrix.</description>

      <title>DrugAgent: Explainable Drug Repurposing Agent with Large Language Model-based Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug repurposing offers a promising avenue for accelerating drug development by identifying new therapeutic potentials of existing drugs. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework to enhance the drug repurposing process using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and knowledge integration. Our framework comprises several specialized agents: an AI Agent trains robust drug-target interaction (DTI) models; a Knowledge Graph Agent utilizes the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb), DrugBank, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) to systematically extract DTIs; and a Search Agent interacts with biomedical literature to annotate and verify computational predictions. By integrating outputs from these agents, our system effectively harnesses diverse data sources, including external databases, to propose viable repurposing candidates. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our approach in not only predicting drug-disease interactions but also in reducing the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery methods. This paper highlights the scalability of multi-agent systems in biomedical research and their role in driving innovation in drug repurposing. Our approach not only outperforms existing methods in predicting drug repurposing potential but also provides interpretable results, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective drug discovery processes.</description>

      <title>Reactzyme: A Benchmark for Enzyme-Reaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enzymes, with their specific catalyzed reactions, are necessary for all aspects of life, enabling diverse biological processes and adaptations. Predicting enzyme functions is essential for understanding biological pathways, guiding drug development, enhancing bioproduct yields, and facilitating evolutionary studies. Addressing the inherent complexities, we introduce a new approach to annotating enzymes based on their catalyzed reactions. This method provides detailed insights into specific reactions and is adaptable to newly discovered reactions, diverging from traditional classifications by protein family or expert-derived reaction classes. We employ machine learning algorithms to analyze enzyme reaction datasets, delivering a much more refined view on the functionality of enzymes. Our evaluation leverages the largest enzyme-reaction dataset to date, derived from the SwissProt and Rhea databases with entries up to January 8, 2024. We frame the enzyme-reaction prediction as a retrieval problem, aiming to rank enzymes by their catalytic ability for specific reactions. With our model, we can recruit proteins for novel reactions and predict reactions in novel proteins, facilitating enzyme discovery and function annotation.</description>

      <title>HyperSBINN: A Hypernetwork-Enhanced Systems Biology-Informed Neural Network for Efficient Drug Cardiosafety Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling in systems toxicology enables a comprehensive understanding of the effects of pharmaceutical substances on cardiac health. However, the complexity of these models limits their widespread application in early drug discovery. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to solving parameterized models of cardiac action potentials by combining meta-learning techniques with Systems Biology-Informed Neural Networks (SBINNs). The proposed method, HyperSBINN, effectively addresses the challenge of predicting the effects of various compounds at different concentrations on cardiac action potentials, outperforming traditional differential equation solvers in speed. Our model efficiently handles scenarios with limited data and complex parameterized differential equations. The HyperSBINN model demonstrates robust performance in predicting APD90 values, indicating its potential as a reliable tool for modeling cardiac electrophysiology and aiding in preclinical drug development. This framework represents an advancement in computational modeling, offering a scalable and efficient solution for simulating and understanding complex biological systems.</description>

      <title>A Brief Analysis of the Iterative Next Boundary Detection Network for Tree Rings Delineation in Images of Pinus taeda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the INBD network proposed by Gillert et al. in CVPR-2023 and studies its application for delineating tree rings in RGB images of Pinus taeda cross sections captured by a smartphone (UruDendro dataset), which are images with different characteristics from the ones used to train the method. The INBD network operates in two stages: first, it segments the background, pith, and ring boundaries. In the second stage, the image is transformed into polar coordinates, and ring boundaries are iteratively segmented from the pith to the bark. Both stages are based on the U-Net architecture. The method achieves an F-Score of 77.5, a mAR of 0.540, and an ARAND of 0.205 on the evaluation set. The code for the experiments is available at https://github.com/hmarichal93/mlbrief_inbd.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Risk of Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation using Heterogeneous Drug-protein-disease Network-based Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a deep learning model, ABioSPATH, to predict the one-year risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. The model integrates drug-protein-disease pathways and real-world clinical data of AF patients to generate the IS risk and potential pathways for each patient. The model uses a multilayer network to identify the mechanism of drug action and disease comorbidity propagation pathways. The model is tested on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) data of 7859 AF patients from 43 hospitals in Hong Kong. The model outperforms all baselines across all metrics and provides valuable molecular-level insights for clinical use. The model also highlights key proteins in common pathways and potential IS risks tied to less-studied drugs. The model only requires routinely collected data, without requiring expensive biomarkers to be tested.</description>

      <title>VASARI-auto: equitable, efficient, and economical featurisation of glioma MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The VASARI MRI feature set is a quantitative system designed to standardise glioma imaging descriptions. Though effective, deriving VASARI is time-consuming and seldom used in clinical practice. This is a problem that machine learning could plausibly automate. Using glioma data from 1172 patients, we developed VASARI-auto, an automated labelling software applied to both open-source lesion masks and our openly available tumour segmentation model. In parallel, two consultant neuroradiologists independently quantified VASARI features in a subsample of 100 glioblastoma cases. We quantified: 1) agreement across neuroradiologists and VASARI-auto; 2) calibration of performance equity; 3) an economic workforce analysis; and 4) fidelity in predicting patient survival. Tumour segmentation was compatible with the current state of the art and equally performant regardless of age or sex. A modest inter-rater variability between in-house neuroradiologists was comparable to between neuroradiologists and VASARI-auto, with far higher agreement between VASARI-auto methods. The time taken for neuroradiologists to derive VASARI was substantially higher than VASARI-auto (mean time per case 317 vs. 3 seconds). A UK hospital workforce analysis forecast that three years of VASARI featurisation would demand 29,777 consultant neuroradiologist workforce hours ({\pounds}1,574,935), reducible to 332 hours of computing time (and {\pounds}146 of power) with VASARI-auto. The best-performing survival model utilised VASARI-auto features as opposed to those derived by neuroradiologists. VASARI-auto is a highly efficient automated labelling system with equitable performance across patient age or sex, a favourable economic profile if used as a decision support tool, and with non-inferior fidelity in downstream patient survival prediction. Future work should iterate upon and integrate such tools to enhance patient care.</description>
