      <title>On the origin of mixed morphology supernova remnants: Linking their properties to the evolution of a red supergiant progenitor star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-morphology supernova remnants (MMSNRs) are characterized by a shell-like morphology in the radio and centrally-peaked thermal emission in the X-ray band. The nature of this peculiar class of supernova remnants (SNRs) remains a controversial issue. In this work, by pairing the predictions of stellar evolution theory with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations we show that the mixed morphology properties of a SNR can arise by the interaction of the SNR with the circumstellar medium shaped by a red supergiant progenitor star, embedded in a dense environment. As a study case, we model the circumstellar medium formation and the subsequent interaction of the SNR with it of a $15~\rm M_{\odot}$ progenitor star. The reflected shock, formed by the collision of the SNR with the density walls of the surrounding circumstellar cavity, accumulates and re-shocks the supernova ejecta at the center of the remnant, increasing its temperature so that the gas becomes X-ray bright. Such a formation mechanism may naturally explain the nature of MMSNRs resulted from Type II supernovae without the demand of additional physical mechanisms and/or ambient medium inhomogeneities. We discuss alternative evolutionary paths that potentially could be ascribed for the MMSNR formation within the framework of the reflected shock model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been accepted that the cosmos determine our personalities, relationships, and even our fate. Unlike our condensed matter colleagues - who regularly use quantum mechanics to determine the healing properties of crystals - astrology techniques have been unchanged since the 19th century. In this paper, we discuss how astrophysical messengers beyond starlight can be used to predict the future and excuse an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ fraction of our negative personality traits.</description>

      <title>Why FLAMINGO is the perfect name for an array of Cherenkov telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper argues why FLAMINGO (Fast Light Atmospheric Monitoring and Imaging Novel Gamma-ray Observatory) is the perfect name for an array of very-high-energy Cherenkov telescopes. Studies which indicate pink is the most suitable pigment for the structures of Cherenkov telescopes have passed with flying colors. Pink optimizes the absorption and reflectivity properties of the telescopes with respect to the characteristic blue color of the Cherenkov radiation emitted by high-energy particles in the atmosphere. In addition to giving the sensitivity a big leg up, a pink color scheme also adds a unique and visually appealing aspect to the project's branding and outreach efforts. FLAMINGO has a fun and memorable quality that can help to increase public engagement and interest in astrophysics and also help to promote diversity in the field with its colorful nature. In an era of increasingly unpronounceable scientific acronyms, we are putting our foot down. FLAMINGO is particularly fitting, as flamingos have eyesight optimized to detect small particles, aligning with the primary purpose of Cherenkov telescopes to detect faint signals from air showers. We should not wait in the wings just wishing for new name to come along: in FLAMINGO we have an acronym that both accurately reflects the science behind Cherenkov telescopes and provides a visually striking identity for the project. While such a sea change will be no easy feet, we are glad to stick our necks out and try: FLAMINGO captures the essence of what an array of Cherenkov telescopes represents and can help to promote the science to a wider audience. We aim to create an experiment and brand that people from all walks of life will flock to.</description>

      <title>Stripe 82X Data Release 3: Multiwavelength Catalog with New Spectroscopic Redshifts and Black Hole Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the third catalog release of the wide-area (31.3 deg$^2$) Stripe 82 X-ray survey. This catalog combines previously published X-ray source properties with multiwavelength counterparts and photometric redshifts, presents 343 new spectroscopic redshifts, and provides black hole masses for 1396 Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). With spectroscopic redshifts for 3457 out of 6181 Stripe 82X sources, the survey has a spectroscopic completeness of 56%. This completeness rises to 90% when considering the contiguous portions of the Stripe 82X survey with homogeneous X-ray coverage at an optical magnitude limit of $r&lt;22$. Within that portion of the survey, 23% of AGN can be considered obscured by being either a Type 2 AGN, reddened ($R-K &gt; 4$, Vega), or X-ray obscured with a column density $N_{\rm H} &gt; 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Unlike other surveys, there is only a 18% overlap between Type 2 and X-ray obscured AGN. We calculated black hole masses for Type 1 AGN that have SDSS spectra using virial mass estimators calibrated on the H$\beta$, MgII, H$\alpha$, and CIV emission lines. We find systematic differences in these black hole mass estimates, indicating that statiscal analyses should use black hole masses calculated from the same formula to minimize systematic bias. We find that the highest luminosity AGN are accreting at the highest Eddington ratios, consistent with the picture that most mass accretion happens in the phase when the AGN is luminous ($L_{\rm 2-10 keV} &gt; 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$).</description>

      <title>Stupendously Large Black Hole Coalescence and Hubble Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local and distant measurements of the Hubble constant are in significant tension: local measurements of the Hubble constant appear to show a Universe that is significantly contracted when compared to distant measurements. From the point of view of an observer, a passing gravitational wave could cause the Universe to appear locally contracted and expanded in a quadrupolar pattern. The inspiral of a pair of stupendously large black holes (SLABs) with a chirp mass of $\sim10^{21}~\rm{M}_\odot$ may produce gravitational radiation with sufficiently large amplitude and wavelength to increase $H_0$ in one direction, and decrease it by the same amount in the other. These tensions would then oscillate with a period corresponding to half the orbital period of the binary. If such a gravitational wave were aligned with the plane of the Milky Way, most readily visible galaxies would appear closer than they actually are, thereby causing the apparent Hubble tension. Due to the long binary period, we would be in the same phase of the gravitational wave for the complete history of astronomical observation. The opposite tension would be visible in the orthogonal directions, thus giving the opportunity to falsify the existence of inspiraling SLAB binaries. As a corollary, the Hubble tension may place an upper limit on the maximum mass of inspiraling black holes in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Probing solar modulation analytic models with cosmic ray periodic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AMS02 experiment has published the periodic spectra of proton, helium and helium isotopes across the majority of the 24 solar cycle. These precise data exhibit temporal structures that correlate with solar modulation. In this study, we utilize these data to probe three analytic solar modulation models, including the force-field approximation, the convection-diffusion model and the extended force-field approximation with a drift effect. We adopt a method that eliminates the influence of interstellar cosmic ray spectra, and use the Earth-observed spectra at time $t_1$ to predict those at time $t_2$. In order to explore the rigidity-dependence of solar modulation models, we substitute the conventional potential parameter $\phi$ with a modified parameter $\phi'=\frac{R}{ k_2(R)}\phi$ for our analysis. Combining with the $\chi^2$ minimization method, the best-fit modulation parameter $\phi'$ can be evaluated. First, we test the validity of a rigidity-independent $\phi'$ and find that both the force-field approximation (FFA) and the extended force-field approximation (EFFA) agree well with data near the solar minimum period. However, all models significantly deviate from the data during the solar maximum. Consequently, we assume a constant $\phi'(t_1)$ at solar minimum and calculate $\Delta\phi'=\phi'(t_2)-\phi'(t_1)$ for each rigidity bin at time $t_2$. It is found that $\Delta\phi'$ generally adheres to a linear-logarithm relationship with rigidity at any given time. By adopting a linear-logarithm formula of $\Delta\phi'$, we further discover that both the modified FFA and EFFA can reconcile the observations during solar maxima. This suggests that at solar maximum, the parameter $\phi'$, which correlates with the diffusion pattern in the heliospheric magnetic fields, exhibits a rigidity dependence.</description>

      <title>Deriving Neutron Star Equation of State from AdS/QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars are among the main targets for gravitational wave observatories, however, their equation of state is still not well established. Mainly phenomenological models with many parameters are widely used by far, while theoretical models are not so practical. In arXiv:1902.08477, a theoretical equation of state with only one parameter is derived from Sakai-Sugimoto model, as an application of AdS/QCD, where pointlike instanton case is taken into consideration. When the tidal deformability constraint from gravitational wave event is satisfied, the maximum mass is about 1.7 solar masses. Now we upgrade this model to instanton gas, with one more variable, the instanton width. This is not naively a free parameter, but a function of the chemical potential. Thus we end up with a more complicated and accurate model, but still with only one adjustable parameter. In this case, we find the maximum mass becomes 1.85 solar masses. This is an encouraging and exiting result, as a theoretically derived model.</description>

Abstract: We present a new standard acronym for Active Galactic Nuclei, finally settling the argument of AGN vs. AGNs. Our new standard is not only etymologically superior (following the consensus set by SNe), but also boasts other linguistic opportunities, connecting strongly with relevant theology and streamlining descriptions of AGN properties.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamics of Magneto-Inertial, Differentially Rotating Laboratory Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed characterization of the structure and evolution of differentially rotating plasmas driven on the MAGPIE pulsed-power generator (1.4 MA peak current, 240 ns rise-time). The experiments were designed to simulate physics relevant to accretion discs and jets on laboratory scales. A cylindrical aluminium wire array Z pinch enclosed by return posts with an overall azimuthal off-set angle was driven to produce ablation plasma flows that propagate inwards in a slightly off-radial trajectory, injecting mass, angular momentum, and confining ram pressure to a rotating plasma column on the axis. However, the plasma is free to expand axially, forming a collimated, differentially rotating axial jet that propagates at $\approx 100$ km/s. The density profile of the jet corresponds to a dense shell surrounding a low-density core, which is consistent with the centrifugal barrier effect being sustained along the jet's propagation. We show analytically that, as the rotating plasma accretes mass, conservation of mass and momentum implies plasma radial growth scaling as $r \propto t^{1/3}$. As the characteristic moment of inertia increases, the rotation velocity is predicted to decrease and settle on a characteristic value $\approx 20$ km/s. We find that both predictions are in agreement with Thomson scattering and optical self-emission imaging measurements.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cousins: Identification of a Subpopulation of Binary Black Holes Consistent with Isolated Binary Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact binaries have become a regular occurrence. The continued advancement of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration detectors have now produced a catalog of over 90 such mergers, from which we can begin to uncover the formation history of merging compact binaries. In this work, we search for subpopulations in the LVK's third gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) by incorporating discrete latent variables in the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to probabilistically assign each BBH observation into separate categories associated with distinctly different population distributions. By incorporating formation channel knowledge within the mass and spin correlations found in each category, we find an over density of mergers with a primary mass of $\sim10 M_\odot$, consistent with isolated binary formation. This low-mass subpopulation has a spin magnitude distribution peaking at $a_\mathrm{peak}=0.16^{0.19}_{-0.16}$, exhibits spins preferentially aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum, is constrained by $15^{+0.0}_{-1.0}$ of our observations, and contributes $82\%^{+8.0\%}_{-16\%}$ to the overall population of BBHs. Additionally, we find that the component of the mass distribution containing the previously identified $35M_\odot$ peak has spins consistent with the $10M_\odot$ events, with $99\%$ of primary masses less than $m_{1,99\%} = 49^{+25}_{-8.1} M_\odot$, providing an estimate of the lower edge of the theorized pair instability mass gap. This work is a first step in gaining a deeper understanding of compact binary formation and evolution, and will provide more robust conclusions as the catalog of observations becomes larger.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Spectral Inverse Modelling with Simulation-Based Inference: An Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kilonovae represent a category of astrophysical transients, identifiable as the electromagnetic observable counterparts associated with the coalescence events of binary systems comprising neutron stars and neutron star-black hole pairs. They act as probes for heavy-element nucleosynthesis in astrophysical environments. These studies rely on inference of the physical parameters (e.g., ejecta mass, velocity, composition) that describe kilonovae based on electromagnetic observations. This is a complex inverse problem typically addressed with sampling-based methods such as Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or nested sampling algorithms. However, repeated inferences can be computationally expensive due to the sequential nature of these methods. This poses a significant challenge to ensuring the reliability and statistical validity of the posterior approximations and, thus, the inferred kilonova parameters themselves. We present a novel approach: Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) using simulations produced by KilonovaNet. Our method employs an ensemble of Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation (ANPE) with an embedding network to directly predict posterior distributions from simulated spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We take advantage of the quasi-instantaneous inference time of ANPE to demonstrate the reliability of our posterior approximations using diagnostics tools, including coverage diagnostic and posterior predictive checks. We further test our model with real observations from AT2017gfo, the only kilonova with multi-messenger data, demonstrating agreement with previous likelihood-based methods while reducing inference time down to a few seconds. The inference results produced by ANPE appear to be conservative and reliable, paving the way for testable and more efficient kilonova parameter inference.</description>

Abstract: The KM3NeT/ARCA neutrino detector is currently under construction at 3500 m depth offshore Capo Passero, Sicily, in the Mediterranean Sea. The main science objectives are the detection of high-energy cosmic neutrinos and the discovery of their sources. Simulations were conducted for the full KM3NeT/ARCA detector, instrumenting a volume of 1 km$^3$, to estimate the sensitivity and discovery potential to point-like neutrino sources and an all-sky diffuse neutrino flux. This paper covers the reconstruction of track- and shower-like signatures, as well as the criteria employed for neutrino event selection. By leveraging both the track and shower observation channels, the KM3NeT/ARCA detector demonstrates the capability to detect the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux within half a year of operation, achieving a 5$\sigma$ statistical significance. With an angular resolution below 0.1$^\circ$ for tracks and under 2$^\circ$ for showers, the sensitivity to point-like neutrino sources surpasses existing observed limits across the entire sky.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric muons measured with the KM3NeT detectors in comparison with updated numeric predictions</title>

Abstract: The measurement of the flux of muons produced in cosmic ray air showers is essential for the study of primary cosmic rays. Such measurements are important in extensive air shower detectors to assess the energy spectrum and the chemical composition of the cosmic ray flux, complementary to the information provided by fluorescence detectors. Detailed simulations of the cosmic ray air showers are carried out, using codes such as CORSIKA, to estimate the muon flux at sea level. These simulations are based on the choice of hadronic interaction models, for which improvements have been implemented in the post-LHC era. In this work, a deficit in simulations that use state-of-the-art QCD models with respect to the measurement deep underwater with the KM3NeT neutrino detectors is reported. The KM3NeT/ARCA and KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescopes are sensitive to TeV muons originating mostly from primary cosmic rays with energies around 10 TeV. The predictions of state-of-the-art QCD models show that the deficit with respect to the data is constant in zenith angle; no dependency on the water overburden is observed. The observed deficit at a depth of several kilometres is compatible with the deficit seen in the comparison of the simulations and measurements at sea level.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic waveforms for extreme mass-ratio inspirals via multivoice decomposition in time and frequency</title>

Abstract: We compute adiabatic waveforms for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) by "stitching" together a long inspiral waveform from a sequence of waveform snapshots, each of which corresponds to a particular geodesic orbit. We show that the complicated total waveform can be regarded as a sum of "voices." Each voice evolves in a simple way on long timescales, a property which can be exploited to efficiently produce waveform models that faithfully encode the properties of EMRI systems. We look at examples for a range of different orbital geometries: spherical orbits, equatorial eccentric orbits, and one example of generic (inclined and eccentric) orbits. To our knowledge, this is the first calculation of a generic EMRI waveform that uses strong-field radiation reaction. We examine waveforms in both the time and frequency domains. Although EMRIs evolve slowly enough that the stationary phase approximation (SPA) to the Fourier transform is valid, the SPA calculation must be done to higher order for some voices, since their instantaneous frequency can change from chirping forward ($\dot f &gt; 0$) to chirping backward ($\dot f &lt; 0$). The approach we develop can eventually be extended to more complete EMRI waveform models, for example to include effects neglected by the adiabatic approximation such as the conservative self force and spin-curvature coupling.</description>

      <title>The Photon Content of the Neutron</title>

Abstract: In this work, we complete our CT18qed study with the neutron's photon parton distribution function (PDF), which is essential for the nucleus scattering phenomenology. Two methods, CT18lux and CT18qed, based on the LUXqed formalism and the DGLAP evolution, respectively, to determine the neutron's photon PDF have been presented. Various low-$Q^2$ non-perturbative variations have been carefully examined, which are treated as additional uncertainties on top of those induced by quark and gluon PDFs. The impacts of the momentum sum rule as well as isospin symmetry violation have been explored, and turn out to be negligible. A detailed comparison with other neutron's photon PDF sets has been performed, which shows a great improvement in the precision and a reasonable uncertainty estimation in our results. Finally, two phenomenological implications are demonstrated with photon-initiated processes: neutrino-nucleus $W$-boson production, which is important for the near-future TeV--PeV neutrino observations, and the axion-like particle production at a high-energy muon beam-dump experiment.</description>

      <title>Superfluid extension of the self-consistent time-dependent band theory for neutron star matter: Anti-entrainment versus superfluid effects in the slab phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03327</link>

Abstract: Background: The inner crust of neutron stars consists of a Coulomb lattice of neutron-rich nuclei, immersed in a sea of superfluid neutrons with background relativistic electron gas. A proper quantum mechanical treatment for such a system under a periodic potential is the band theory of solids. The effect of band structure on the effective mass of dripped neutrons, the so-called \textit{entrainment effect}, is currently in a debatable situation, and it has been highly desired to develop a nuclear band theory taking into account neutron superfluidity in a fully self-consistent manner.
  Purpose: The main purpose of the present work is twofold: 1) to develop a formalism of the time-dependent self-consistent band theory, taking full account of nuclear superfluidity, based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) extended for superfluid systems, and 2) to quantify the effects of band structure and superfluidity on crustal properties, applying the formalism to the slab phase of nuclear matter in the $\beta$ equilibrium.
  Results: Static calculations have been performed for a range of baryon (nucleon) number density ($n_b=0.04-0.07$ fm$^{-3}$) under the $\beta$-equilibrium condition with and without superfluidity, for various inter-slab spacings. From a dynamic response to an external potential, we extract the collective mass of a slab and that of protons immersed in neutron superfluid. From the results, we find that the collective mass of a slab is substantially reduced by 57.5--82.5\% for $n_b=0.04-0.07$ fm$^{-3}$, which corresponds to an enhancement of conduction neutron number density and, thus, to a reduction of the neutron effective mass, which we call the anti-entrainment effect. We discuss novel phenomena associated with superfluidity, quasiparticle resonances in the inner crust, which are absent in normal systems.

      <title>X-ray-inferred kinematics of the core ICM in Perseus-like clusters: Insights from the TNG-Cluster simulation</title>

Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters encodes the impact of the physical processes that shape these massive halos, including feedback from central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In this study, we examine the gas thermodynamics, kinematics, and the effects of SMBH feedback on the core of Perseus-like galaxy clusters with a new simulation suite: TNG-Cluster. We first make a selection of simulated clusters similar to Perseus based on the total mass and inner ICM properties, such as their cool-core nature. We identify 30 Perseus-like systems among the 352 TNG-Cluster halos at $z=0$. Many exhibit thermodynamical profiles and X-ray morphologies with disturbed features such as ripples, bubbles, and shock fronts that are qualitatively similar to X-ray observations of Perseus. To study observable gas motions, we generate XRISM mock X-ray observations and conduct a spectral analysis of the synthetic data. In agreement with existing Hitomi measurements, TNG-Cluster predicts subsonic gas turbulence in the central regions of Perseus-like clusters, with a typical line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 200 km/s. This implies that turbulent pressure contributes $&lt; 10\%$ to the dominant thermal pressure. In TNG-Cluster, such low (inferred) values of ICM velocity dispersion coexist with high-velocity outflows and bulk motions of relatively small amounts of super-virial hot gas, moving up to thousands of km/s. However, detecting these outflows in observations may prove challenging due to their anisotropic nature and projection effects. Driven by SMBH feedback, such outflows are responsible for many morphological disturbances in the X-ray maps of cluster cores. They also increase both the inferred and intrinsic ICM velocity dispersion. This effect is somewhat stronger when velocity dispersion is measured from higher-energy lines.</description>

      <title>Unmasking noise transients masquerading as intermediate-mass black hole binaries</title>

Abstract: In the first three observation runs, ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors have observed close to 100 compact binary coalescence (CBC) events. The GW detection rates for CBCs are expected to increase with improvements in the sensitivity of the International Gravitational-Wave Observatory Network (IGWN). However, with improved sensitivity, non-Gaussian instrumental transients or ``glitches'' are expected to adversely affect GW searches and characterisation algorithms. The most detrimental effect is due to short-duration glitches, which mimic the morphology of short-duration GW transients, in particular Intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) binaries. They can be easily misidentified as astrophysical signals by current searches, and if included in astrophysical analyses, glitches mislabelled as IMBH binaries can affect IMBH population studies. In this work, we introduce a new similarity metric that quantifies the consistency of astrophysical parameters across the detector network and helps to distinguish between IMBH binaries and short-duration, loud glitches which mimic such binaries. We develop this method using a simulated set of IMBH binary signals and a collection of noise transients identified during the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors.</description>
