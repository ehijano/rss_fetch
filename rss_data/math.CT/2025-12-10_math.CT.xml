      <title>Realization of relational presheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relational presheaves generalize traditional presheaves by going to the category of sets and relations (as opposed to sets and functions) and by allowing functors which are lax. This added generality is useful because it intuitively allows one to encode situations where we have representables without boundaries or with multiple boundaries at once. In particular, the relational generalization of precubical sets has natural application to modeling concurrency. In this article, we study categories of relational presheaves, and construct realization functors for those. We begin by observing that they form the category of set-based models of a cartesian theory, which implies in particular that they are locally finitely presentable categories. By using general results from categorical logic, we then show that the realization of such presheaves in a cocomplete category is a model of the theory in the opposite category, which allows characterizing situations in which we have a realization functor. Finally, we explain that our work has applications in the semantics of concurrency theory. The realization namely allows one to compare syntactic constructions on relational presheaves and geometric ones. Thanks to it, we are able to provide a syntactic counterpart of the blowup operation, which was recently introduced by Haucourt on directed geometric semantics, as way of turning a directed space into a manifold.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of Group Algebras as a Direct Sum of Projective Indecomposable Modules and of Blocks in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dissertation focuses on decomposing a group algebra $kG$ over a field of positive characteristic into a direct sum of projective indecomposable modules. Such a decomposition is obtained together with the Artin--Wedderburn Theorem. The main goal of the dissertation is to explicitly decompose given group algebras as a direct sum of their projective indecomposable modules.
  To achieve this, we determine the radical series of each projective indecomposable module of the given group algebras. For a group algebra over characteristic $p$, each projective indecomposable module has a simple head that is isomorphic to its socle. Projective covers and injective envelopes are used to construct these modules. A cyclic group algebra is uniserial, and a $p$-group algebra over characteristic $p$ is itself a projective indecomposable module. Using these properties, we explicitly find all projective indecomposable modules for the following group algebras over characteristic $2$: the Klein four-group, the alternating group $A_4$, and the alternating group $A_5$. Their relationships play an important role in this process.
  Since $p$-group algebras have trivial head and trivial socle, the Klein four-group algebra has a corresponding radical series. Its decomposition into a direct sum of projective indecomposable modules is described explicitly, and the Cartan matrix of a group algebra is obtained by calculating the multiplicities of simples in its projective indecomposable modules.
  The topic is then extended slightly by considering the unique decomposition of a group algebra into a direct sum of particular modules known as blocks. For $kA_4$, the primitive orthogonal idempotents are calculated, and since $kA_4$ has one block, it is equal to its block decomposition. For $kA_5$, we show that there are two blocks, determined by checking the nonzero entries in its Cartan matrix.</description>

      <title>Haagerup Symmetry in $(E_8)_1$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest that the chiral $(\mathfrak{e}_8)_1$ theory -- in many senses the simplest VOA -- may have Haagerup symmetry $\mathcal{H}_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.</description>

      <title>Fock Space Tensor Product Categorifications and Multiplicities in Complex Rank Parabolic Category O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake the study of complex rank analogues of parabolic category O defined using Deligne categories. We regard these categories as a family over an affine space, introduce a stratification on this parameter space, and formulate conjectures on the structural constancy of fibers on each stratum. Using the theory of $\mathfrak{sl}_{\mathbb{Z}}$-categorification, we prove these conjectures for admissible strata. Namely, we axiomatize the notion of multi-Fock tensor product categorifications (MFTPCs), which are interval finite highest weight categories equipped with a compatible action of commuting copies of $\mathfrak{sl}_{\mathbb{Z}}$, categorifying an external tensor product of tensor products of highest and lowest weight Fock space representations. We prove a uniqueness theorem for admissible MFTPCs and show that complex rank parabolic categories O have the structure of MFTPCs. In turn, for suitable choices of parameters, we produce an equivalence of complex rank category O with a stable limit of classical parabolic categories O, resolving our conjecture in the admissible case. These equivalences yield multiplicities of simple objects in Verma modules in terms of stable parabolic Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials, answering a question posed by Etingof. In particular, for the case of two Levi blocks of non-integral size, we completely describe the structure of the corresponding category O in terms of stable representation theory. As an application, we obtain multiplicities for parabolic analogs of hyperalgebra Verma modules introduced by Haboush in the large rank and large characteristic limit.</description>

      <title>A Generalisation of the Munn Semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To each meet-semilattice $E$ is associated an inverse semigroup $T_{E}$ called the Munn semigroup of $E$. We generalise this construction by replacing the meet-semilattice $E$ by a presheaf of sets $X$ over a meet-semilattice. The inverse semigroup $T_{X}$ that results is called the generalised Munn semigroup. Our construction can be viewed as a generalisation of one due to Zhitomirskiy as well as a restriction of one due to Reilly. We prove that idempotent-separating representations in to the generalised Munn semigroup characterise \'etale actions of inverse semigroups.</description>

      <title>The Sierpinski Carpet as a Final Coalgebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We advance the program of connections between final coalgebras as sources of circularity in mathematics and fractal sets of real numbers. In particular, we are interested in the Sierpinski carpet, taking it as a fractal subset of the unit square. We construct a category of square sets and an endofunctor on it which corresponds to the operation of gluing copies of a square set along segments. We show that the initial algebra and final coalgebra exist for our functor, and that the final coalgebra is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the Sierpinski carpet. Along the way, we make connections to topics such as the iterative construction of initial algebras as colimits, corecursive algebras, and the classic treatment of fractal sets due to Hutchinson.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of Small Cartesian Closed Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the isomorphism between the Quillen cohomology and the Baues-Wirsching cohomology of a cartesian closed category (CCC). This is an extension of the results of Dwyer-Kan for small categories and Jibladze-Pirashvili for small categories with finite products. These results implies that The Quillen cohomology of a CCC C coincides with that of C as a category with finite products, and also that of C as a small category</description>

      <title>Twisted Graded Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ and an $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-monoid $M$, we introduce and classify twisted graded categories, which generalize the Day convolution structure on $\mathrm{Fun}(M, \mathcal{C})$. These are characterized by a braiding encoded in symmetric group actions on tensor powers, whose character we show depends only on the $\mathbb{T}$-equivariant monoidal dimension. We analyze the $\mathbb{T}$-action on the dimension of invertible objects and identify it with the $\mathbb{T}$-transfer map. Finally, we compute braiding characters in examples arising from higher cyclotomic extensions, such as the $(\mathbb{S}, n+1)$-oriented extension of $\mathrm{Mod}_{En}^{\wedge}$ at all primes and heights, and of the cyclotomic closure of $\mathrm{Vect}^n$ at low heights.</description>
