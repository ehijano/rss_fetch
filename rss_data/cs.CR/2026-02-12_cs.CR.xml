      <title>Reverse-Engineering Model Editing on Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are pretrained on corpora containing trillions of tokens and, therefore, inevitably memorize sensitive information. Locate-then-edit methods, as a mainstream paradigm of model editing, offer a promising solution by modifying model parameters without retraining. However, in this work, we reveal a critical vulnerability of this paradigm: the parameter updates inadvertently serve as a side channel, enabling attackers to recover the edited data. We propose a two-stage reverse-engineering attack named \textit{KSTER} (\textbf{K}ey\textbf{S}paceRecons\textbf{T}ruction-then-\textbf{E}ntropy\textbf{R}eduction) that leverages the low-rank structure of these updates. First, we theoretically show that the row space of the update matrix encodes a ``fingerprint" of the edited subjects, enabling accurate subject recovery via spectral analysis. Second, we introduce an entropy-based prompt recovery attack that reconstructs the semantic context of the edit. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our attacks can recover edited data with high success rates. Furthermore, we propose \textit{subspace camouflage}, a defense strategy that obfuscates the update fingerprint with semantic decoys. This approach effectively mitigates reconstruction risks without compromising editing utility. Our code is available at https://github.com/reanatom/EditingAtk.git.</description>

      <title>Anonymization-Enhanced Privacy Protection for Mobile GUI Agents: Available but Invisible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automating complex smartphone tasks by leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and system-level control interfaces. However, this paradigm introduces significant privacy risks, as agents typically capture and process entire screen contents, thereby exposing sensitive personal data such as phone numbers, addresses, messages, and financial information. Existing defenses either reduce UI exposure, obfuscate only task-irrelevant content, or rely on user authorization, but none can protect task-critical sensitive information while preserving seamless agent usability.
  We propose an anonymization-based privacy protection framework that enforces the principle of available-but-invisible access to sensitive data: sensitive information remains usable for task execution but is never directly visible to the cloud-based agent. Our system detects sensitive UI content using a PII-aware recognition model and replaces it with deterministic, type-preserving placeholders (e.g., PHONE_NUMBER#a1b2c) that retain semantic categories while removing identifying details. A layered architecture comprising a PII Detector, UI Transformer, Secure Interaction Proxy, and Privacy Gatekeeper ensures consistent anonymization across user instructions, XML hierarchies, and screenshots, mediates all agent actions over anonymized interfaces, and supports narrowly scoped local computations when reasoning over raw values is necessary.
  Extensive experiments on the AndroidLab and PrivScreen benchmarks show that our framework substantially reduces privacy leakage across multiple models while incurring only modest utility degradation, achieving the best observed privacy-utility trade-off among existing methods.</description>

      <title>Privacy by Voice: Modeling Youth Privacy-Protective Behavior in Smart Voice Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart Voice Assistants (SVAs) are deeply embedded in the lives of youth, yet the mechanisms driving the privacy-protective behaviors among young users remain poorly understood. This study investigates how Canadian youth (aged 16-24) negotiate privacy with SVAs by developing and testing a structural model grounded in five key constructs: perceived privacy risks (PPR), perceived benefits (PPBf), algorithmic transparency and trust (ATT), privacy self-efficacy (PSE), and privacy-protective behaviors (PPB). A cross-sectional survey of N=469 youth was analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results reveal that PSE is the strongest predictor of PPB, while the effect of ATT on PPB is fully mediated by PSE. This identifies a critical efficacy gap, where youth's confidence must first be built up for them to act. The model confirms that PPBf directly discourages protective action, yet also indirectly fosters it by slightly boosting self-efficacy. These findings empirically validate and extend earlier qualitative work, quantifying how policy overload and hidden controls erode the self-efficacy necessary for protective action. This study contributes an evidence-based pathway from perception to action and translates it into design imperatives that empower young digital citizens without sacrificing the utility of SVAs.</description>

      <title>Red-teaming the Multimodal Reasoning: Jailbreaking Vision-Language Models via Cross-modal Entanglement Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with multimodal reasoning capabilities are high-value attack targets, given their potential for handling complex multimodal harmful tasks. Mainstream black-box jailbreak attacks on VLMs work by distributing malicious clues across modalities to disperse model attention and bypass safety alignment mechanisms. However, these adversarial attacks rely on simple and fixed image-text combinations that lack attack complexity scalability, limiting their effectiveness for red-teaming VLMs' continuously evolving reasoning capabilities. We propose \textbf{CrossTALK} (\textbf{\underline{Cross}}-modal en\textbf{\underline{TA}}ng\textbf{\underline{L}}ement attac\textbf{\underline{K}}), which is a scalable approach that extends and entangles information clues across modalities to exceed VLMs' trained and generalized safety alignment patterns for jailbreak. Specifically, {knowledge-scalable reframing} extends harmful tasks into multi-hop chain instructions, {cross-modal clue entangling} migrates visualizable entities into images to build multimodal reasoning links, and {cross-modal scenario nesting} uses multimodal contextual instructions to steer VLMs toward detailed harmful outputs. Experiments show our COMET achieves state-of-the-art attack success rate.</description>

      <title>Exploring Semantic Labeling Strategies for Third-Party Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Questionnaires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third-Party Risk Assessment (TPRA) is a core cybersecurity practice for evaluating suppliers against standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST. TPRA questionnaires are typically drawn from large repositories of security and compliance questions, yet tailoring assessments to organizational needs remains a largely manual process. Existing retrieval approaches rely on keyword or surface-level similarity, which often fails to capture implicit assessment scope and control semantics.
  This paper explores strategies for organizing and retrieving TPRA cybersecurity questions using semantic labels that describe both control domains and assessment scope. We compare direct question-level labeling with a Large Language Model (LLM) against a hybrid semi-supervised semantic labeling (SSSL) pipeline that clusters questions in embedding space, labels a small representative subset using an LLM, and propagates labels to remaining questions using k-Nearest Neighbors; we also compare downstream retrieval based on direct question similarity versus retrieval in the label space. We find that semantic labels can improve retrieval alignment when labels are discriminative and consistent, and that SSSL can generalize labels from a small labeled subset to large repositories while substantially reducing LLM usage and cost.</description>

      <title>Basic Legibility Protocols Improve Trusted Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI Control research agenda aims to develop control protocols: safety techniques that prevent untrusted AI systems from taking harmful actions during deployment. Because human oversight is expensive, one approach is trusted monitoring, where weaker, trusted models oversee stronger, untrusted models$\unicode{x2013}$but this often fails when the untrusted model's actions exceed the monitor's comprehension. We introduce legibility protocols, which encourage the untrusted model to take actions that are easier for a monitor to evaluate.
  We perform control evaluations in the APPS coding setting, where an adversarial agent attempts to write backdoored code without detection. We study legibility protocols that allow the untrusted model to thoroughly document its code with comments$\unicode{x2013}$in contrast to prior work, which removed comments to prevent deceptive ones. We find that: (i) commenting protocols improve safety without sacrificing task performance relative to comment-removal baselines; (ii) commenting disproportionately benefits honest code, which typically has a natural explanation that resolves monitor suspicion, whereas backdoored code frequently lacks an easy justification; (iii) gains from commenting increase with monitor strength, as stronger monitors better distinguish genuine justifications from only superficially plausible ones.</description>

      <title>PRISM-XR: Empowering Privacy-Aware XR Collaboration with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enhance collaboration in Extended Reality (XR) environments by enabling flexible object and animation creation through the combination of natural language and visual inputs. However, visual data captured by XR headsets includes real-world backgrounds that may contain irrelevant or sensitive user information, such as credit cards left on the table or facial identities of other users. Uploading those frames to cloud-based MLLMs poses serious privacy risks, particularly when such data is processed without explicit user consent. Additionally, existing colocation and synchronization mechanisms in commercial XR APIs rely on time-consuming, privacy-invasive environment scanning and struggle to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of MLLM-integrated XR environments. In this paper, we propose PRISM-XR, a novel framework that facilitates multi-user collaboration in XR by providing privacy-aware MLLM integration. PRISM-XR employs intelligent frame preprocessing on the edge server to filter sensitive data and remove irrelevant context before communicating with cloud generative AI models. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight registration process and a fully customizable content-sharing mechanism to enable efficient, accurate, and privacy-preserving content synchronization among users. Our numerical evaluation results indicate that the proposed platform achieves nearly 90% accuracy in fulfilling user requests and less than 0.27 seconds registration time while maintaining spatial inconsistencies of less than 3.5 cm. Furthermore, we conducted an IRB-approved user study with 28 participants, demonstrating that our system could automatically filter highly sensitive objects in over 90% of scenarios while maintaining strong overall usability.</description>

      <title>MalMoE: Mixture-of-Experts Enhanced Encrypted Malicious Traffic Detection Under Graph Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encryption has been commonly used in network traffic to secure transmission, but it also brings challenges for malicious traffic detection, due to the invisibility of the packet payload. Graph-based methods are emerging as promising solutions by leveraging multi-host interactions to promote detection accuracy. But most of them face a critical problem: Graph Drift, where the flow statistics or topological information of a graph change over time. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a graph-assisted encrypted traffic detection system, MalMoE, which applies Mixture of Experts (MoE) to select the best expert model for drift-aware classification. Particularly, we design 1-hop-GNN-like expert models that handle different graph drifts by analyzing graphs with different features. Then, the redesigned gate model conducts expert selection according to the actual drift. MalMoE is trained with a stable two-stage training strategy with data augmentation, which effectively guides the gate on how to perform routing. Experiments on open-source, synthetic, and real-world datasets show that MalMoE can perform precise and real-time detection.</description>

      <title>Omni-Safety under Cross-Modality Conflict: Vulnerabilities, Dynamics Mechanisms and Efficient Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) greatly expand LLMs' multimodal capabilities but also introduce cross-modal safety risks. However, a systematic understanding of vulnerabilities in omni-modal interactions remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we establish a modality-semantics decoupling principle and construct the AdvBench-Omni dataset, which reveals a significant vulnerability in OLLMs. Mechanistic analysis uncovers a Mid-layer Dissolution phenomenon driven by refusal vector magnitude shrinkage, alongside the existence of a modal-invariant pure refusal direction. Inspired by these insights, we extract a golden refusal vector using Singular Value Decomposition and propose OmniSteer, which utilizes lightweight adapters to modulate intervention intensity adaptively. Extensive experiments show that our method not only increases the Refusal Success Rate against harmful inputs from 69.9% to 91.2%, but also effectively preserves the general capabilities across all modalities. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhrli324/omni-safety-research.</description>

      <title>Limits of Residual-Based Detection for Physically Consistent False Data Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: False data injection attacks (FDIAs) pose a persistent challenge to AC power system state estimation. In current practice, detection relies primarily on topology-aware residual-based tests that assume malicious measurements can be distinguished from normal operation through physical inconsistency reflected in abnormal residual behavior. This paper shows that this assumption does not always hold: when FDIA scenarios produce manipulated measurements that remain on the measurement manifold induced by AC power flow relations and measurement redundancy, residual-based detectors may fail to distinguish them from nominal data. The resulting detectability limitation is a property of the measurement manifold itself and does not depend on the attacker's detailed knowledge of the physical system model. To make this limitation observable in practice, we present a data-driven constructive mechanism that incorporates the generic functional structure of AC power flow to generate physically consistent, manifold-constrained perturbations, providing a concrete witness of how residual-based detectors can be bypassed. Numerical studies on multiple AC test systems characterize the conditions under which detection becomes challenging and illustrate its failure modes. The results highlight fundamental limits of residual-based detection in AC state estimation and motivate the need for complementary defenses beyond measurement consistency tests.</description>

      <title>MerkleSpeech: Public-Key Verifiable, Chunk-Localised Speech Provenance via Perceptual Fingerprints and Merkle Commitments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech provenance goes beyond detecting whether a watermark is present. Real workflows involve splicing, quoting, trimming, and platform-level transforms that may preserve some regions while altering others. Neural watermarking systems have made strides in robustness and localised detection, but most deployments produce outputs with no third-party verifiable cryptographic proof tying a time segment to an issuer-signed original. Provenance standards like C2PA adopt signed manifests and Merkle-based fragment validation, yet their bindings target encoded assets and break under re-encoding or routine processing.
  We propose MerkleSpeech, a system for public-key verifiable, chunk-localised speech provenance offering two tiers of assurance. The first, a robust watermark attribution layer (WM-only), survives common distribution transforms and answers "was this chunk issued by a known party?". The second, a strict cryptographic integrity layer (MSv1), verifies Merkle inclusion of the chunk's fingerprint under an issuer signature. The system computes perceptual fingerprints over short speech chunks, commits them in a Merkle tree whose root is signed with an issuer key, and embeds a compact in-band watermark payload carrying a random content identifier and chunk metadata sufficient to retrieve Merkle inclusion proofs from a repository. Once the payload is extracted, all subsequent verification steps (signature check, fingerprint recomputation, Merkle inclusion) use only public information. The result is a splice-aware timeline indicating which regions pass each tier and why any given region fails. We describe the protocol, provide pseudocode, and present experiments targeting very low false positive rates under resampling, bandpass filtering, and additive noise, informed by recent audits identifying neural codecs as a major stressor for post-hoc audio watermarks.</description>

      <title>Non-Fungible Blockchain Tokens for Traceable Online-Quality Assurance of Milled Workpieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a concept and implementation for the secure storage and transfer of quality-relevant data of milled workpieces from online-quality assurance processes enabled by real-time simulation models. It utilises Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) to securely and interoperably store quality data in the form of an Asset Administration Shell (AAS) on a public Ethereum blockchain. Minted by a custom smart contract, the NFTs reference the metadata saved in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), allowing new data from additional processing steps to be added in a flexible yet secure manner. The concept enables automated traceability throughout the value chain, minimising the need for time-consuming and costly repetitive manual quality checks.</description>

      <title>Breaking 5G on The Lower Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 3GPP systems have strengthened security at the upper layers of the cellular stack, plaintext PHY and MAC layers have remained relatively understudied, though interest in them is growing. In this work, we explore lower-layer exploitation in modern 5G, where recent releases have increased the number of lower-layer control messages and procedures, creating new opportunities for practical attacks. We present two practical attacks and evaluate them in a controlled lab testbed. First, we reproduce a SIB1 spoofing attack to study manipulations of unprotected broadcast fields. By repeatedly changing a key parameter, the UE is forced to refresh and reacquire system information, keeping the radio interface active longer than necessary and increasing battery consumption. Second, we demonstrate a new Timing Advance (TA) manipulation attack during the random access procedure. By injecting an attacker-chosen TA offset in the random access response, the victim applies incorrect uplink timing, which leads to uplink desynchronization, radio link failures, and repeated reconnection loops that effectively cause denial of service. Our experiments use commercial smartphones and open-source 5G network software. Experimental results in our testbed demonstrate that TA offsets exceeding a small tolerance reliably trigger radio link failures in our testbed and can keep devices stuck in repeated re-establishment attempts as long as the rogue base station remains present. Overall, our findings highlight that compact lower-layer control messages can have a significant impact on availability and power, and they motivate placing defenses for initial access and broadcast procedures.</description>

      <title>5Gone: Uplink Overshadowing Attacks in 5G-SA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G presents numerous advantages compared to previous generations: improved throughput, lower latency, and improved privacy protection for subscribers. Attacks against 5G standalone (SA) commonly use fake base stations (FBS), which need to operate at a very high output power level to lure victim phones to connect to them and are thus highly detectable. In this paper, we introduce 5Gone, a powerful software-defined radio (SDR)-based uplink overshadowing attack method against 5G-SA. 5Gone exploits deficiencies in the 3GPP standard to perform surgical, covert denial-of-service, privacy, and downgrade attacks. Uplink overshadowing means that an attacker is transmitting at exactly the same time and frequency as the victim UE, but with a slightly higher output power. 5Gone runs on a COTS x86 computer without any need for dedicated hardware acceleration and can overshadow commercial 100 MHz cells with an E2E latency of less than 500$\mu$s, which up to now has not been possible with any software-based UE implementation. We demonstrate that 5Gone is highly scalable, even when many UEs are connecting in parallel, and finally evaluate the attacks end-to-end against 7 phone models and three different chipset vendors both in our lab and in the real-world on public gNodeBs.</description>

      <title>The Role of Learning in Attacking Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on network attacks have demonstrated that ML-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) can be evaded with adversarial perturbations. However, these attacks rely on complex optimizations that have large computational overheads, making them impractical in many real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight adversarial agent that implements strategies (policies) trained via reinforcement learning (RL) that learn to evade ML-based NIDS without requiring online optimization. This attack proceeds by (1) offline training, where the agent learns to evade a surrogate ML model by perturbing malicious flows using network traffic data assumed to be collected via reconnaissance, then (2) deployment, where the trained agent is used in a compromised device controlled by an attacker to evade ML-based NIDS using learned attack strategies. We evaluate our approach across diverse NIDS and several white-, gray-, and black-box threat models. We demonstrate that attacks using these lightweight agents can be highly effective (reaching up to 48.9% attack success rate), extremely fast (requiring as little as 5.72ms to craft an attack), and require negligible resources (e.g., 0.52MB of memory). Through this work, we demonstrate that future botnets driven by lightweight learning-based agents can be highly effective and widely deployable in diverse environments of compromised devices.</description>

      <title>SecCodePRM: A Process Reward Model for Code Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models are rapidly becoming core components of modern software development workflows, yet ensuring code security remains challenging. Existing vulnerability detection pipelines either rely on static analyzers or use LLM/GNN-based detectors trained with coarse program-level supervision. Both families often require complete context, provide sparse end-of-completion feedback, and can degrade as code length grows, making them ill-suited for real-time, prefix-level assessment during interactive coding and streaming generation. We propose SecCodePRM, a security-oriented process reward model that assigns a context-aware, step-level security score along a code trajectory. To train the model, we derive step-level supervision labels from static analyzers and expert annotations, allowing the model to attend more precisely to fine-grained regions associated with inter-procedural vulnerabilities. SecCodePRM has three applications: full-code vulnerability detection (VD), partial-code VD, and secure code generation (CG). For VD, SecCodePRM uses risk-sensitive aggregation that emphasizes high-risk steps; for CG, SecCodePRM supports inference-time scaling by ranking candidate continuations and favoring higher cumulative reward. This design yields dense, real-time feedback that scales to long-horizon generation. Empirically, SecCodePRM outperforms prior approaches in all three settings, while preserving code functional correctness, suggesting improved security without a safety-utility tradeoff.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Prompt Injection Threats in LLM Agents: From Taxonomy to Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has resulted in a paradigm shift towards autonomous agents, necessitating robust security against Prompt Injection (PI) vulnerabilities where untrusted inputs hijack agent behaviors. This SoK presents a comprehensive overview of the PI landscape, covering attacks, defenses, and their evaluation practices. Through a systematic literature review and quantitative analysis, we establish taxonomies that categorize PI attacks by payload generation strategies (heuristic vs. optimization) and defenses by intervention stages (text, model, and execution levels). Our analysis reveals a key limitation shared by many existing defenses and benchmarks: they largely overlook context-dependent tasks, in which agents are authorized to rely on runtime environmental observations to determine actions. To address this gap, we introduce AgentPI, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate agent behavior under context-dependent interaction settings. Using AgentPI, we empirically evaluate representative defenses and show that no single approach can simultaneously achieve high trustworthiness, high utility, and low latency. Moreover, we show that many defenses appear effective under existing benchmarks by suppressing contextual inputs, yet fail to generalize to realistic agent settings where context-dependent reasoning is essential. This SoK distills key takeaways and open research problems, offering structured guidance for future research and practical deployment of secure LLM agents.</description>

      <title>Authenticated Workflows: A Systems Approach to Protecting Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems automate enterprise workflows but existing defenses--guardrails, semantic filters--are probabilistic and routinely bypassed. We introduce authenticated workflows, the first complete trust layer for enterprise agentic AI. Security reduces to protecting four fundamental boundaries: prompts, tools, data, and context. We enforce intent (operations satisfy organizational policies) and integrity (operations are cryptographically authentic) at every boundary crossing, combining cryptographic elimination of attack classes with runtime policy enforcement. This delivers deterministic security--operations either carry valid cryptographic proof or are rejected. We introduce MAPL, an AI-native policy language that expresses agentic constraints dynamically as agents evolve and invocation context changes, scaling as O(log M + N) policies versus O(M x N) rules through hierarchical composition with cryptographic attestations for workflow dependencies. We prove practicality through a universal security runtime integrating nine leading frameworks (MCP, A2A, OpenAI, Claude, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Haystack) through thin adapters requiring zero protocol modifications. Formal proofs establish completeness and soundness. Empirical validation shows 100% recall with zero false positives across 174 test cases, protection against 9 of 10 OWASP Top 10 risks, and complete mitigation of two high impact production CVEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GPU memory errors are a critical threat to deep learning (DL) frameworks, leading to crashes or even security issues. We introduce GPU-Fuzz, a fuzzer locating these issues efficiently by modeling operator parameters as formal constraints. GPU-Fuzz utilizes a constraint solver to generate test cases that systematically probe error-prone boundary conditions in GPU kernels. Applied to PyTorch, TensorFlow, and PaddlePaddle, we uncovered 13 unknown bugs, demonstrating the effectiveness of GPU-Fuzz in finding memory errors.</description>

      <title>Protecting Context and Prompts: Deterministic Security for Non-Deterministic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) applications are vulnerable to prompt injection and context manipulation attacks that traditional security models cannot prevent. We introduce two novel primitives--authenticated prompts and authenticated context--that provide cryptographically verifiable provenance across LLM workflows. Authenticated prompts enable self-contained lineage verification, while authenticated context uses tamper-evident hash chains to ensure integrity of dynamic inputs. Building on these primitives, we formalize a policy algebra with four proven theorems providing protocol-level Byzantine resistance--even adversarial agents cannot violate organizational policies. Five complementary defenses--from lightweight resource controls to LLM-based semantic validation--deliver layered, preventative security with formal guarantees. Evaluation against representative attacks spanning 6 exhaustive categories achieves 100% detection with zero false positives and nominal overhead. We demonstrate the first approach combining cryptographically enforced prompt lineage, tamper-evident context, and provable policy reasoning--shifting LLM security from reactive detection to preventative guarantees.</description>

      <title>Following Dragons: Code Review-Guided Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern fuzzers scale to large, real-world software but often fail to exercise the program states developers consider most fragile or security-critical. Such states are typically deep in the execution space, gated by preconditions, or overshadowed by lower-value paths that consume limited fuzzing budgets. Meanwhile, developers routinely surface risk-relevant insights during code review, yet this information is largely ignored by automated testing tools. We present EyeQ, a system that leverages developer intelligence from code reviews to guide fuzzing. EyeQ extracts security-relevant signals from review discussions, localizes the implicated program regions, and translates these insights into annotation-based guidance for fuzzing. The approach operates atop existing annotation-aware fuzzing, requiring no changes to program semantics or developer workflows. We first validate EyeQ through a human-guided feasibility study on a security-focused dataset of PHP code reviews, establishing a strong baseline for review-guided fuzzing. We then automate the workflow using a large language model with carefully designed prompts. EyeQ significantly improves vulnerability discovery over standard fuzzing configurations, uncovering more than 40 previously unknown bugs in the security-critical PHP codebase.</description>

      <title>When Skills Lie: Hidden-Comment Injection in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM agents often rely on Skills to describe available tools and recommended procedures. We study a hidden-comment prompt injection risk in this documentation layer: when a Markdown Skill is rendered to HTML, HTML comment blocks can become invisible to human reviewers, yet the raw text may still be supplied verbatim to the model. In experiments, we find that DeepSeek-V3.2 and GLM-4.5-Air can be influenced by malicious instructions embedded in a hidden comment appended to an otherwise legitimate Skill, yielding outputs that contain sensitive tool intentions. A short defensive system prompt that treats Skills as untrusted and forbids sensitive actions prevents these malicious tool calls and instead surfaces the suspicious hidden instructions.</description>

Abstract: Cryptomining poses significant security risks, yet traditional detection methods like blacklists and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) are often ineffective against encrypted mining traffic and suffer from high false positive rates. In this paper, we propose a practical encrypted cryptomining traffic detection mechanism. It consists of a two-stage detection framework, which can effectively provide fine-grained detection results by machine learning and reduce false positives from classifiers through active probing. Our system achieves an F1-score of 0.99 and identifies specific cryptocurrencies with a 99.39\% accuracy rate. Extensive testing across various mining pools confirms the effectiveness of our approach, offering a more precise and reliable solution for identifying cryptomining activities.</description>

      <title>Invisible Trails? An Identity Alignment Scheme based on Online Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many tracking companies collect user data and sell it to data markets and advertisers. While they claim to protect user privacy by anonymizing the data, our research reveals that significant privacy risks persist even with anonymized data. Attackers can exploit this data to identify users' accounts on other websites and perform targeted identity alignment. In this paper, we propose an effective identity alignment scheme for accurately identifying targeted users. We develop a data collector to obtain the necessary datasets, an algorithm for identity alignment, and, based on this, construct two types of de-anonymization attacks: the \textit{passive attack}, which analyzes tracker data to align identities, and the \textit{active attack}, which induces users to interact online, leading to higher success rates. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, a novel evaluation framework for online tracking-based identity alignment. We investigate the key factors influencing the effectiveness of identity alignment. Additionally, we provide an independent assessment of our generated dataset and present a fully functional system prototype applied to a cryptocurrency use case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing sophistication of modern malware and phishing campaigns has diminished the effectiveness of traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems. This work presents SecureScan, an AI-driven, triple-layer detection framework that integrates logistic regression-based classification, heuristic analysis, and external threat intelligence via the VirusTotal API for comprehensive triage of URLs, file hashes, and binaries. The proposed architecture prioritizes efficiency by filtering known threats through heuristics, classifying uncertain samples using machine learning, and validating borderline cases with third-party intelligence. On benchmark datasets, SecureScan achieves 93.1 percent accuracy with balanced precision (0.87) and recall (0.92), demonstrating strong generalization and reduced overfitting through threshold-based decision calibration. A calibrated threshold and gray-zone logic (0.45-0.55) were introduced to minimize false positives and enhance real-world stability. Experimental results indicate that a lightweight statistical model, when augmented with calibrated verification and external intelligence, can achieve reliability and performance comparable to more complex deep learning systems.</description>

      <title>Architecting Trust: A Framework for Secure IoT Systems Through Trusted Execution and Semantic Middleware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) security landscape requires the architectural solutions that can address the technical and operational challenges across the heterogeneous environments. The IoT systems operate in different conditions, and security issues continue to increase. This paper presents the comprehensive security framework for IoT that should integrate the Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with the semantic middleware and blockchain technologies. The work provides a systematic analysis of the architectural patterns based on more than twenty recent research works and the existing standards, and it proposes a layered security architecture. The architecture includes the hardware rooted trust at peripheral level, the zero trust principles at network level, and the semantic security mechanisms at application level. The framework focuses on practical implementation aspects such as the performance overhead, interoperability requirements, and the compliance with new regulations, which are very important for the real IoT deployments. The paper reports quantitative metrics which include the cryptographic performance on Cortex-M class microcontrollers with the detection accuracy rates and the energy consumption values. The proposed architecture shows that cross-layer security integration can provide defense in depth while it still satisfies the constraints of resource-limited IoT environments. The discussion highlights open challenges and the future research directions for the IoT security architectures that include the post-quantum migration, secure federated model exchange and the automated compliance verification.</description>

      <title>GoodVibe: Security-by-Vibe for LLM-Based Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation in fast, informal development workflows, often referred to as vibe coding, where speed and convenience are prioritized, and security requirements are rarely made explicit. In this setting, models frequently produce functionally correct but insecure code, creating a growing security risk. Existing approaches to improving code security rely on full-parameter fine-tuning or parameter-efficient adaptations, which are either costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting or operate at coarse granularity with limited interpretability and control.
  We present GoodVibe, a neuron-level framework for improving the security of code language models by default. GoodVibe is based on the key insight that security-relevant reasoning is localized to a small subset of neurons. We identify these neurons using gradient-based attribution from a supervised security task and perform neuron-selective fine-tuning that updates only this security-critical subspace. To further reduce training cost, we introduce activation-driven neuron clustering, enabling structured updates with minimal overhead. We evaluate GoodVibe on six LLMs across security-critical programming languages, including C++, Java, Swift, and Go. GoodVibe substantially improves the security of generated code while preserving general model utility, achieving up to a 2.5x improvement over base models, matching or exceeding full fine-tuning with over 4,700x fewer trainable parameters, and reducing training computation by more than 3.6x compared to the parameter-efficient baseline (LoRA). Our results demonstrate that neuron-level optimization offers an effective and scalable approach to securing code generation without sacrificing efficiency or generality.</description>

      <title>Agentic Knowledge Distillation: Autonomous Training of Small Language Models for SMS Threat Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SMS-based phishing (smishing) attacks have surged, yet training effective on-device detectors requires labelled threat data that quickly becomes outdated. To deal with this issue, we present Agentic Knowledge Distillation, which consists of a powerful LLM acts as an autonomous teacher that fine-tunes a smaller student SLM, deployable for security tasks without human intervention. The teacher LLM autonomously generates synthetic data and iteratively refines a smaller on-device student model until performance plateaus. We compare four LLMs in this teacher role (Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2 Codex, Gemini 3 Pro, and DeepSeek V3.2) on SMS spam/smishing detection with two student SLMs (Qwen2.5-0.5B and SmolLM2-135M). Our results show that performance varies substantially depending on the teacher LLM, with the best configuration achieving 94.31% accuracy and 96.25% recall. We also compare against a Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) baseline that uses the same synthetic knowledge and LoRA setup but without iterative feedback or targeted refinement; agentic knowledge distillation substantially outperforms it (e.g. 86-94% vs 50-80% accuracy), showing that closed-loop feedback and targeted refinement are critical. These findings demonstrate that agentic knowledge distillation can rapidly yield effective security classifiers for edge deployment, but outcomes depend strongly on which teacher LLM is used.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile gaming applications (apps) have become increasingly pervasive, including a growing number of games designed for children. Despite their popularity, these apps often integrate complex analytics, advertising, and attribution infrastructures that may introduce privacy and security risks. Existing research has primarily focused on tracking behaviors or monetization models, leaving configuration-level privacy exposure and children-oriented apps underexplored. In this study, we conducted a comparative static analysis of Android mobile games to investigate privacy and security risks beyond permission usage. The analysis follows a three-phase methodology comprising (i) designing study protocol, (ii) Android Package Kit (APK) collection and static inspection, and (iii) data analysis. We examined permissions, manifest-level configuration properties (e.g., backup settings, cleartext network traffic, and exported components), and embedded third-party Software Development Kit (SDK) ecosystems across children-oriented and general-audience mobile games. The extracted indicators are synthesized into qualitative privacy-risk categories to support comparative reporting. The results showed that while children-oriented games often request fewer permissions, they frequently exhibit configuration-level risks and embed third-party tracking SDKs similar to general-audience games. Architectural and configuration decisions play a critical role in shaping privacy risks, particularly for apps targeting children. This study contributes a holistic static assessment of privacy exposure in mobile games and provides actionable insights for developers, platform providers, and researchers seeking to improve privacy-by-design practices in mobile applications.</description>

      <title>Resilient Alerting Protocols for Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart contracts are stateful programs deployed on blockchains; they secure over a trillion dollars in transaction value per year. High-stakes smart contracts often rely on timely alerts about external events, but prior work has not analyzed their resilience to an attacker suppressing alerts via bribery. We formalize this challenge in a cryptoeconomic setting as the \emph{alerting problem}, giving rise to a game between a bribing adversary and~$n$ rational participants, who pay a penalty if they are caught deviating from the protocol. We establish a quadratic, i.e.,~$O(n^2)$, upper bound, whereas a straightforward alerting protocol only achieves~$O(n)$ bribery cost.
  We present a \emph{simultaneous game} that asymptotically achieves the quadratic upper bound and thus asymptotically-optimal bribery resistance. We then present two protocols that implement our simultaneous game: The first leverages a strong network synchrony assumption. The second relaxes this strong assumption and instead takes advantage of trusted hardware and blockchain proof-of-publication to establish a timed commitment scheme. These two protocols are constant-time but incur a linear storage overhead on the blockchain. We analyze a third, \emph{sequential alerting} protocol that optimistically incurs no on-chain storage overhead, at the expense of~$O(n)$ worst-case execution time. All three protocols achieve asymptotically-optimal bribery costs, but with different resource and performance tradeoffs. Together, they illuminate a rich design space for practical solutions to the alerting problem.</description>

      <title>Blind Gods and Broken Screens: Architecting a Secure, Intent-Centric Mobile Agent Operating System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted mobile computing from App-centric interactions to system-level autonomous agents. Current implementations predominantly rely on a "Screen-as-Interface" paradigm, which inherits structural vulnerabilities and conflicts with the mobile ecosystem's economic foundations. In this paper, we conduct a systematic security analysis of state-of-the-art mobile agents using Doubao Mobile Assistant as a representative case. We decompose the threat landscape into four dimensions - Agent Identity, External Interface, Internal Reasoning, and Action Execution - revealing critical flaws such as fake App identity, visual spoofing, indirect prompt injection, and unauthorized privilege escalation stemming from a reliance on unstructured visual data.
  To address these challenges, we propose Aura, an Agent Universal Runtime Architecture for a clean-slate secure agent OS. Aura replaces brittle GUI scraping with a structured, agent-native interaction model. It adopts a Hub-and-Spoke topology where a privileged System Agent orchestrates intent, sandboxed App Agents execute domain-specific tasks, and the Agent Kernel mediates all communication. The Agent Kernel enforces four defense pillars: (i) cryptographic identity binding via a Global Agent Registry; (ii) semantic input sanitization through a multilayer Semantic Firewall; (iii) cognitive integrity via taint-aware memory and plan-trajectory alignment; and (iv) granular access control with non-deniable auditing. Evaluation on MobileSafetyBench shows that, compared to Doubao, Aura improves low-risk Task Success Rate from roughly 75% to 94.3%, reduces high-risk Attack Success Rate from roughly 40% to 4.4%, and achieves near-order-of-magnitude latency gains. These results demonstrate Aura as a viable, secure alternative to the "Screen-as-Interface" paradigm.</description>

      <title>CVPL: A Geometric Framework for Post-Hoc Linkage Risk Assessment in Protected Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal privacy metrics provide compliance-oriented guarantees but often fail to quantify actual linkability in released datasets. We introduce CVPL (Cluster-Vector-Projection Linkage), a geometric framework for post-hoc assessment of linkage risk between original and protected tabular data. CVPL represents linkage analysis as an operator pipeline comprising blocking, vectorization, latent projection, and similarity evaluation, yielding continuous, scenario-dependent risk estimates rather than binary compliance verdicts. We formally define CVPL under an explicit threat model and introduce threshold-aware risk surfaces, R(lambda, tau), that capture the joint effects of protection strength and attacker strictness. We establish a progressive blocking strategy with monotonicity guarantees, enabling anytime risk estimation with valid lower bounds. We demonstrate that the classical Fellegi-Sunter linkage emerges as a special case of CVPL under restrictive assumptions, and that violations of these assumptions can lead to systematic over-linking bias. Empirical validation on 10,000 records across 19 protection configurations demonstrates that formal k-anonymity compliance may coexist with substantial empirical linkability, with a significant portion arising from non-quasi-identifier behavioral patterns. CVPL provides interpretable diagnostics identifying which features drive linkage feasibility, supporting privacy impact assessment, protection mechanism comparison, and utility-risk trade-off analysis.</description>

      <title>Mask-Based Window-Level Insider Threat Detection for Campaign Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) systems commonly detect insider threats by scoring fixed time windows of user activity for anomalous behavior. While this window-level paradigm has proven effective for identifying sharp behavioral deviations, it remains unclear how much information about longer-running attack campaigns is already present within individual windows, and how such information can be leveraged for campaign discovery. In this work, we study unsupervised window-level insider threat detection on the CERT r4.2 dataset and show that explicitly separating activity presence from activity magnitude yields substantial performance gains. We introduce a dual-channel convolutional autoencoder that reconstructs both a binary activity mask and corresponding activity values, allowing the model to focus representational capacity on sparse behavioral structure rather than dense inactive baselines. Across multiday attack campaigns lasting between one and seven days, the proposed approach achieves a window-level precision-recall AUC of 0.71, substantially exceeding standard unsupervised autoencoder baselines and enabling high-precision operating points with zero false alarms.</description>

      <title>IU-GUARD: Privacy-Preserving Spectrum Coordination for Incumbent Users under Dynamic Spectrum Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for wireless spectrum, dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) frameworks such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) have emerged as practical solutions to improve utilization while protecting incumbent users (IUs) such as military radars. However, current incumbent protection mechanisms face critical limitations. The Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) requires costly sensor deployments and remains vulnerable to interference and security risks. Alternatively, the Incumbent Informing Capability (IIC) requires IUs to disclose their identities and operational parameters to the Spectrum Coordination System (SCS), creating linkable records that compromise operational privacy and mission secrecy. We propose IU-GUARD, a privacy-preserving spectrum sharing framework that enables IUs to access spectrum without revealing their identities. Leveraging verifiable credentials (VCs) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), IU-GUARD allows IUs to prove their authorization to the SCS while disclosing only essential operational parameters. This decouples IU identity from spectrum access, prevents cross-request linkage, and mitigates the risk of centralized SCS data leakage. We implement a prototype, and our evaluation shows that IU-GUARD achieves strong privacy guarantees with practical computation and communication overhead, making it suitable for real-time DSS deployment.</description>

      <title>Vulnerabilities in Partial TEE-Shielded LLM Inference with Precomputed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) on third-party devices requires new ways to protect model intellectual property. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer a promising solution, their performance limits can lead to a critical compromise: using a precomputed, static secret basis to accelerate cryptographic operations. We demonstrate that this mainstream design pattern introduces a classic cryptographic flaw, the reuse of secret keying material, into the system's protocol. We prove its vulnerability with two distinct attacks: First, our attack on a model confidentiality system achieves a full confidentiality break by recovering its secret permutations and model weights. Second, our integrity attack completely bypasses the integrity checks of systems like Soter and TSQP. We demonstrate the practicality of our attacks against state-of-the-art LLMs, recovering a layer's secrets from a LLaMA-3 8B model in about 6 minutes and showing the attack scales to compromise 405B-parameter LLMs across a variety of configurations.</description>

      <title>"Humans welcome to observe": A First Look at the Agent Social Network Moltbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) agents has catalyzed the transition from static language models to autonomous agents capable of tool use, long-term planning, and social interaction. $\textbf{Moltbook}$, the first social network designed exclusively for AI agents, has experienced viral growth in early 2026. To understand the behavior of AI agents in the agent-native community, in this paper, we present a large-scale empirical analysis of Moltbook leveraging a dataset of 44,411 posts and 12,209 sub-communities ("submolts") collected prior to February 1, 2026. Leveraging a topic taxonomy with nine content categories and a five-level toxicity scale, we systematically analyze the topics and risks of agent discussions. Our analysis answers three questions: what topics do agents discuss (RQ1), how risk varies by topic (RQ2), and how topics and toxicity evolve over time (RQ3). We find that Moltbook exhibits explosive growth and rapid diversification, moving beyond early social interaction into viewpoint, incentive-driven, promotional, and political discourse. The attention of agents increasingly concentrates in centralized hubs and around polarizing, platform-native narratives. Toxicity is strongly topic-dependent: incentive- and governance-centric categories contribute a disproportionate share of risky content, including religion-like coordination rhetoric and anti-humanity ideology. Moreover, bursty automation by a small number of agents can produce flooding at sub-minute intervals, distorting discourse and stressing platform stability. Overall, our study underscores the need for topic-sensitive monitoring and platform-level safeguards in agent social networks.</description>

      <title>Actions Speak Louder Than Chats: Investigating AI Chatbot Age Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI chatbots are widely used by children and teens today, but they pose significant risks to youth's privacy and safety due to both increasingly personal conversations and potential exposure to unsafe content. While children under 13 are protected by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), chatbot providers' own privacy policies may also provide protections, since they typically prohibit children from accessing their platforms. Age gating is often employed to restrict children online, but chatbot age gating in particular has not been studied. In this paper, we investigate whether popular consumer chatbots are (i) able to estimate users' ages based solely on their conversations, and (ii) whether they take action upon identifying children. To that end, we develop an auditing framework in which we programmatically interact with chatbots and conduct 1050 experiments using our comprehensive library of age-indicative prompts, including implicit and explicit age disclosures, to analyze the chatbots' responses and actions. We find that while chatbots are capable of estimating age, they do not take any action when children are identified, contradicting their own policies. Our methodology and findings provide insights for platform design, demonstrated by our proof-of-concept chatbot age gating implementation, and regulation to protect children online.</description>

      <title>Skirting Additive Error Barriers for Private Turnstile Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study differentially private continual release of the number of distinct items in a turnstile stream, where items may be both inserted and deleted. A recent work of Jain, Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova, Sivakumar, and Smith (NeurIPS '23) shows that for streams of length $T$, polynomial additive error of $\Omega(T^{1/4})$ is necessary, even without any space restrictions. We show that this additive error lower bound can be circumvented if the algorithm is allowed to output estimates with both additive \emph{and multiplicative} error. We give an algorithm for the continual release of the number of distinct elements with $\text{polylog} (T)$ multiplicative and $\text{polylog}(T)$ additive error. We also show a qualitatively similar phenomenon for estimating the $F_2$ moment of a turnstile stream, where we can obtain $1+o(1)$ multiplicative and $\text{polylog} (T)$ additive error. Both results can be achieved using polylogarithmic space whereas prior approaches use polynomial space. In the sublinear space regime, some multiplicative error is necessary even if privacy is not a consideration. We raise several open questions aimed at better understanding trade-offs between multiplicative and additive error in private continual release.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs in Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When sensitive information is encoded in data, it is important to ensure the privacy of information when attempting to learn useful information from the data. There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $\Theta((\varepsilon \beta)^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $\beta$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks.</description>

      <title>VideoSTF: Stress-Testing Output Repetition in Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems. Our evaluation code and scripts are available at: https://github.com/yuxincao22/VideoSTF_benchmark.</description>

      <title>Kill it with FIRE: On Leveraging Latent Space Directions for Runtime Backdoor Mitigation in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly present in our everyday lives; as a result, they become targets of adversarial attackers seeking to manipulate the systems we interact with. A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures.</description>

      <title>VulReaD: Knowledge-Graph-guided Software Vulnerability Reasoning and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software vulnerability detection (SVD) is a critical challenge in modern systems. Large language models (LLMs) offer natural-language explanations alongside predictions, but most work focuses on binary evaluation, and explanations often lack semantic consistency with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations. Students are fine-tuned with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to encourage taxonomy-aligned reasoning while suppressing unsupported explanations. Across three real-world datasets, VulReaD improves binary F1 by 8-10% and multi-class classification by 30% Macro-F1 and 18% Micro-F1 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that LLMs outperform deep learning baselines in binary detection and that KG-guided reasoning enhances CWE coverage and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Token-Efficient Change Detection in LLM APIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote change detection in LLMs is a difficult problem. Existing methods are either too expensive for deployment at scale, or require initial white-box access to model weights or grey-box access to log probabilities. We aim to achieve both low cost and strict black-box operation, observing only output tokens.
  Our approach hinges on specific inputs we call Border Inputs, for which there exists more than one output top token. From a statistical perspective, optimal change detection depends on the model's Jacobian and the Fisher information of the output distribution. Analyzing these quantities in low-temperature regimes shows that border inputs enable powerful change detection tests.
  Building on this insight, we propose the Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro experiments show that border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints, and achieve performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches. B3IT reduces costs by $30\times$ compared to existing methods, while operating in a strict black-box setting.</description>

      <title>End to End Collaborative Synthetic Data Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of AI is based on the availability of data to train models. While in some cases a single data custodian may have sufficient data to enable AI, often multiple custodians need to collaborate to reach a cumulative size required for meaningful AI research. The latter is, for example, often the case for rare diseases, with each clinical site having data for only a small number of patients. Recent algorithms for federated synthetic data generation are an important step towards collaborative, privacy-preserving data sharing. Existing techniques, however, focus exclusively on synthesizer training, assuming that the training data is already preprocessed and that the desired synthetic data can be delivered in one shot, without any hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end collaborative framework for publishing of synthetic data that accounts for privacy-preserving preprocessing as well as evaluation. We instantiate this framework with Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocols and evaluate it in a use case for privacy-preserving publishing of synthetic genomic data for leukemia.</description>

      <title>Efficient IoT Intrusion Detection with an Improved Attention-Based CNN-BiLSTM Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ever-increasing security vulnerabilities in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems require improved threat detection approaches. This paper presents a compact and efficient approach to detect botnet attacks by employing an integrated approach that consists of traffic pattern analysis, temporal support learning, and focused feature extraction. The proposed attention-based model benefits from a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM architecture and achieves 99% classification accuracy in detecting botnet attacks utilizing the N-BaIoT dataset, while maintaining high precision and recall across various scenarios. The proposed model's performance is further validated by key parameters, such as Mathews Correlation Coefficient and Cohen's kappa Correlation Coefficient. The close-to-ideal results for these parameters demonstrate the proposed model's ability to detect botnet attacks accurately and efficiently in practical settings and on unseen data. The proposed model proved to be a powerful defense mechanism for IoT networks to face emerging security challenges.</description>

      <title>QUT-DV25: A Dataset for Dynamic Analysis of Next-Gen Software Supply Chain Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Securing software supply chains is a growing challenge due to the inadequacy of existing datasets in capturing the complexity of next-gen attacks, such as multiphase malware execution, remote access activation, and dynamic payload generation. Existing datasets, which rely on metadata inspection and static code analysis, are inadequate for detecting such attacks. This creates a critical gap because these datasets do not capture what happens during and after a package is installed. To address this gap, we present QUT-DV25, a dynamic analysis dataset specifically designed to support and advance research on detecting and mitigating supply chain attacks within the Python Package Index (PyPI) ecosystem. This dataset captures install and post-install-time traces from 14,271 Python packages, of which 7,127 are malicious. The packages are executed in an isolated sandbox environment using an extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) kernel and user-level probes. It captures 36 real-time features, that includes system calls, network traffic, resource usages, directory access patterns, dependency logs, and installation behaviors, enabling the study of next-gen attack vectors. ML analysis using the QUT-DV25 dataset identified four malicious PyPI packages previously labeled as benign, each with thousands of downloads. These packages deployed covert remote access and multi-phase payloads, were reported to PyPI maintainers, and subsequently removed. This highlights the practical value of QUT-DV25, as it outperforms reactive, metadata, and static datasets, offering a robust foundation for developing and benchmarking advanced threat detection within the evolving software supply chain ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Integrating Network and Attack Graphs for Service-Centric Impact Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for modelling, visualising, and analysing cyber threats, attack paths, as well as their impact on user services in enterprise or infrastructure networks of digital devices and services they provide. Using probabilistic methods to track the propagation of an attack through attack graphs, via the service or application layers, and on physical communication networks, our model enables us to analyse cyber attacks at different levels of detail. Understanding the propagation of an attack within a service among microservices and its spread between different services or application servers could help detect and mitigate it early. We demonstrate that this network-based influence spreading modelling approach enables the evaluation of diverse attack scenarios and the development of protection and mitigation measures, taking into account the criticality of services from the user's perspective. This methodology could also aid security specialists and system administrators in making well-informed decisions regarding risk mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>AI Agentic Vulnerability Injection And Transformation with Optimized Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of cyber-attacks have underscored the need for reliable automated software vulnerability detection. Data-driven approaches using deep learning models show promise but critically depend on the availability of large, accurately labeled datasets. Yet existing datasets either suffer from noisy labels, limited vulnerability coverage, or fail to reflect vulnerabilities as they occur in real-world software. This also limits large-scale benchmarking of such solutions. Automated vulnerability injection provides a way to address these limitations, but existing techniques remain limited in coverage, contextual fidelity, or injection success. In this paper, we present AVIATOR, the first AI-agentic vulnerability injection framework. AVIATOR decomposes vulnerability injection into a coordinated workflow of specialized AI agents, tool-based analysis, and iterative self-correction, explicitly mirroring expert reasoning. It integrates RAG and lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning to produce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities without relying on handcrafted patterns. Across three benchmarks, AVIATOR achieves high injection fidelity (91-95%) surpassing existing injection techniques in both accuracy and vulnerability coverage. When used for data augmentation to train deep learning-based vulnerability detection (DLVD) models, AVIATOR provides the strongest downstream gains in vulnerability detection. Across models and base datasets, AVIATOR improves average F1 scores by +22% over no augmentation, +25% over VGX, holding the prior best injection success rate, and +3% over VulScribeR, the prior state-of-the-art LLM-based injection model, with +7% higher recall and no precision loss. Its augmented data exhibits the lowest distributional distortion and scales efficiently with &lt;2% syntax rejection at 4.3x lower cost than VulScribeR.</description>

      <title>Data Provenance Auditing of Fine-Tuned Large Language Models with a Text-Preserving Technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a system for marking sensitive or copyrighted texts to detect their use in fine-tuning large language models under black-box access with statistical guarantees. Our method builds digital ``marks'' using invisible Unicode characters organized into (``cue'', ``reply'') pairs. During an audit, prompts containing only ``cue'' fragments are issued to trigger regurgitation of the corresponding ``reply'', indicating document usage. To control false positives, we compare against held-out counterfactual marks and apply a ranking test, yielding a verifiable bound on the false positive rate. The approach is minimally invasive, scalable across many sources, robust to standard processing pipelines, and achieves high detection power even when marked data is a small fraction of the fine-tuning corpus.</description>

      <title>Constructing and Benchmarking: a Labeled Email Dataset for Text-Based Phishing and Spam Detection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21448v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phishing and spam emails remain a major cybersecurity threat, with attackers increasingly leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to craft highly deceptive content. This study presents a comprehensive email dataset containing phishing, spam, and legitimate messages, explicitly distinguishing between human- and LLM-generated content. Each email is annotated with its category, emotional appeal (e.g., urgency, fear, authority), and underlying motivation (e.g., link-following, credential theft, financial fraud). We benchmark multiple LLMs on their ability to identify these emotional and motivational cues and select the most reliable model to annotate the full dataset. To evaluate classification robustness, emails were also rephrased using several LLMs while preserving meaning and intent. A state-of-the-art LLM was then assessed on its performance across both original and rephrased emails using expert-labeled ground truth. The results highlight strong phishing detection capabilities but reveal persistent challenges in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails. Our dataset and evaluation framework contribute to improving AI-assisted email security systems. To support open science, all code, templates, and resources are available on our project site.</description>

      <title>AgentCrypt: Advancing Privacy and (Secure) Computation in AI Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI agents increasingly operate in complex environments, ensuring reliable, context-aware privacy is critical for regulatory compliance. Traditional access controls are insufficient because privacy risks often arise after access is granted; agents may inadvertently compromise privacy during reasoning by messaging humans, leaking context to peers, or executing unsafe tool calls. Existing approaches typically treat privacy as a binary constraint, overlooking nuanced, computation-dependent requirements. Furthermore, Large Language Model (LLM) agents are inherently probabilistic, lacking formal guarantees for security-critical operations. To address this, we introduce AgentCrypt, a three-tiered framework for secure agent communication that adds a deterministic protection layer atop any AI platform. AgentCrypt spans the full spectrum of privacy needs: from unrestricted data exchange (Level 1), to context-aware masking (Level 2), up to fully encrypted computation using Homomorphic Encryption (Level 3). Unlike prompt-based defenses, our approach guarantees that tagged data privacy is strictly preserved even when the underlying model errs. Security is decoupled from the agent's probabilistic reasoning, ensuring sensitive data remains protected throughout the computational lifecycle. AgentCrypt enables collaborative computation on otherwise inaccessible data, overcoming barriers like data silos. We implemented and validated it using LangGraph and Google ADK, demonstrating versatility across architectures. Finally, we introduce a benchmark dataset simulating privacy-critical tasks to enable systematic evaluation and foster the development of trustworthy, regulatable machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>SecureCode: A Production-Grade Multi-Turn Dataset for Training Security-Aware Code Generation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI coding assistants produce vulnerable code in 45\% of security-relevant scenarios~\cite{veracode2025}, yet no public training dataset teaches both traditional web security and AI/ML-specific defenses in a format suitable for instruction tuning.
  We present SecureCode, a production-grade dataset of 2,185 multi-turn security training examples spanning two domains: web application security (1,435 examples covering the OWASP Top 10 2021 across 11 languages and 9 frameworks, 100\% grounded in documented CVEs and security incidents) and AI/ML security (750 examples covering all 10 OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 categories across more than 40 frameworks, including LangChain, OpenAI, and Hugging Face). Every example follows a 4-turn conversational structure -- feature request; vulnerable and secure implementations with attack demonstrations; advanced probing; and defense-in-depth operational guidance -- designed for direct use in instruction tuning pipelines.
  Quality assurance combines automated structural validation with multi-agent review from seven specialist AI perspectives (more than 10{,}500 assessments) and an 8-phase remediation pipeline, producing a rubric-calibrated mean quality score of 93.8/100 ($\sigma = 0.93$) for the AI/ML component. Each example provides SIEM integration strategies, infrastructure hardening recommendations, and testing approaches using production frameworks.
  We release the unified dataset on Hugging Face with domain-specific loading configurations (web, aiml, default), alongside eight fine-tuned open-source models (3B--20B parameters, QLoRA), and an evaluation framework with four security-specific metrics. To our knowledge, SecureCode is the first public dataset that jointly provides OWASP Top 10 2021 web coverage and OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 AI/ML coverage in a unified conversational schema suitable for instruction tuning.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Automated Adversarial Red-Teaming for Robustness Evaluation of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical applications raises fundamental challenges in systematically evaluating robustness against adversarial behaviors. Existing red-teaming practices are largely manual and expert-driven, which limits scalability, reproducibility, and coverage in high-dimensional prompt spaces. We formulate automated LLM red-teaming as a structured adversarial search problem and propose a learning-driven framework for scalable vulnerability discovery. The approach combines meta-prompt-guided adversarial prompt generation with a hierarchical execution and detection pipeline, enabling standardized evaluation across six representative threat categories, including reward hacking, deceptive alignment, data exfiltration, sandbagging, inappropriate tool use, and chain-of-thought manipulation. Extensive experiments on GPT-OSS-20B identify 47 vulnerabilities, including 21 high-severity failures and 12 previously undocumented attack patterns. Compared with manual red-teaming under matched query budgets, our method achieves a 3.9$\times$ higher discovery rate with 89\% detection accuracy, demonstrating superior coverage, efficiency, and reproducibility for large-scale robustness evaluation.</description>

      <title>Certifying the Right to Be Forgotten: Primal-Dual Optimization for Sample and Label Unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated unlearning has become an attractive approach to address privacy concerns in collaborative machine learning, for situations when sensitive data is remembered by AI models during the machine learning process. It enables the removal of specific data influences from trained models, aligning with the growing emphasis on the "right to be forgotten." While extensively studied in horizontal federated learning, unlearning in vertical federated learning (VFL) remains challenging due to the distributed feature architecture. VFL unlearning includes sample unlearning that removes specific data points' influence and label unlearning that removes entire classes. Since different parties hold complementary features of the same samples, unlearning tasks require cross-party coordination, creating computational overhead and complexities from feature interdependencies. To address such challenges, we propose FedORA (Federated Optimization for data Removal via primal-dual Algorithm), designed for sample and label unlearning in VFL. FedORA formulates the removal of certain samples or labels as a constrained optimization problem solved using a primal-dual framework. Our approach introduces a new unlearning loss function that promotes classification uncertainty rather than misclassification. An adaptive step size enhances stability, while an asymmetric batch design, considering the prior influence of the remaining data on the model, handles unlearning and retained data differently to efficiently reduce computational costs. We provide theoretical analysis proving that the model difference between FedORA and Train-from-scratch is bounded, establishing guarantees for unlearning effectiveness. Experiments on tabular and image datasets demonstrate that FedORA achieves unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation comparable to Train-from-scratch with reduced computation and communication overhead.</description>

      <title>CIC-Trap4Phish: A Unified Multi-Format Dataset for Phishing and Quishing Attachment Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phishing attacks represents one of the primary attack methods which is used by cyber attackers. In many cases, attackers use deceptive emails along with malicious attachments to trick users into giving away sensitive information or installing malware while compromising entire systems. The flexibility of malicious email attachments makes them stand out as a preferred vector for attackers as they can embed harmful content such as malware or malicious URLs inside standard document formats. Although phishing email defenses have improved a lot, attackers continue to abuse attachments, enabling malicious content to bypass security measures. Moreover, another challenge that researches face in training advance models, is lack of an unified and comprehensive dataset that covers the most prevalent data types. To address this gap, we generated CIC-Trap4Phish, a multi-format dataset containing both malicious and benign samples across five categories commonly used in phishing campaigns: Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, HTML pages, and QR code images. For the first four file types, a set of execution-free static feature pipeline was proposed, designed to capture structural, lexical, and metadata-based indicators without the need to open or execute files. Feature selection was performed using a combination of SHAP analysis and feature importance, yielding compact, discriminative feature subsets for each file type. The selected features were evaluated by using lightweight machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. All models demonstrate high detection accuracy across formats. For QR code-based phishing (quishing), two complementary methods were implemented: image-based detection by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and lexical analysis of decoded URLs using recent lightweight language models.</description>

      <title>Spinel: A Post-Quantum Signature Scheme Based on $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_p)$ Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computation compels the cryptographic community to design digital signature schemes whose security extends beyond the classical hardness assumptions. In this work, we introduce Spinel, a post-quantum digital signature scheme that combines the proven security of SPHINCS+ (CCS 2019) with a new family of algebraic hash functions (Adv. Math. Commun. 2025) derived from the Tillich-Zemor paradigm (Eurocrypt 2008) with security rooted in the hardness of navigating expander graphs over $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{F}_p)$, a problem believed to be hard even for quantum adversaries. We first provide empirical evidence of the security of this hash function, complementing the original theoretical analysis. We then show how the hash function can be integrated within the SPHINCS+ framework to give a secure signature scheme. We then model and analyze the security degradation of the proposed scheme, which informs the parameter selection we discuss next. Finally, we provide an implementation of the hash function and the proposed signature scheme Spinel as well as detailed empirical results for the performance of Spinel showing its feasibility in practice. Our approach lays the foundations for the design of algebraic hash-based signature schemes, expanding the toolkit of post-quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Towards Privacy-Guaranteed Label Unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning: Few-Shot Forgetting without Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), a setting that has received far less attention than its horizontal counterpart. Specifically, we propose the first method tailored to \textit{label unlearning} in VFL, where labels play a dual role as both essential inputs and sensitive information. To this end, we employ a representation-level manifold mixup mechanism to generate synthetic embeddings for both unlearned and retained samples. This is to provide richer signals for the subsequent gradient-based label forgetting and recovery steps. These augmented embeddings are then subjected to gradient-based label forgetting, effectively removing the associated label information from the model. To recover performance on the retained data, we introduce a recovery-phase optimization step that refines the remaining embeddings. This design achieves effective label unlearning while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate our method through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ModelNet, Brain Tumor MRI, COVID-19 Radiography, and Yahoo Answers demonstrate strong efficacy and scalability. Overall, this work establishes a new direction for unlearning in VFL, showing that re-imagining mixup as an efficient mechanism can unlock practical and utility-preserving unlearning.

      <title>When Speculation Spills Secrets: Side Channels via Speculative Decoding In LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deployed large language models (LLMs) often rely on speculative decoding, a technique that generates and verifies multiple candidate tokens in parallel, to improve throughput and latency. In this work, we reveal a new side-channel whereby input-dependent patterns of correct and incorrect speculations can be inferred by monitoring per-iteration token counts or packet sizes. In evaluations using research prototypes and production-grade vLLM serving frameworks, we show that an adversary monitoring these patterns can fingerprint user queries (from a set of 50 prompts) with over 75% accuracy across four speculative-decoding schemes at temperature 0.3: REST (100%), LADE (91.6%), BiLD (95.2%), and EAGLE (77.6%). Even at temperature 1.0, accuracy remains far above the 2% random baseline - REST (99.6%), LADE (61.2%), BiLD (63.6%), and EAGLE (24%). We also show the capability of the attacker to leak confidential datastore contents used for prediction at rates exceeding 25 tokens/sec. To defend against these, we propose and evaluate a suite of mitigations, including packet padding and iteration-wise token aggregation.</description>

      <title>Advancing Brainwave-Based Biometrics: A Large-Scale, Multi-Session Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of brainwave-based biometrics has gained attention for its potential to revolutionize user authentication through hands-free interaction, resistance to shoulder surfing, continuous authentication, and revocability. However, current research often relies on single-session or limited-session datasets with fewer than 55 subjects, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale study using a public brainwave dataset comprising 345 subjects and over 6,007 sessions (an average of 17 per subject) recorded over five years using three headsets. Our results reveal that deep learning approaches significantly outperform hand-crafted feature extraction methods. We also observe Equal Error Rates (EER) increases over time (e.g., from 6.7% after 1 day to 14.3% after a year). Therefore, it is necessary to reinforce the enrollment set after successful login attempts. Moreover, we demonstrate that fewer brainwave measurement sensors can be used, with an acceptable increase in EER, which is necessary for transitioning from medical-grade to affordable consumer-grade devices. Finally, we compared our results to prior work and existing biometric standards. While our performance is on par with or exceeds previous approaches, it still falls short of industrial benchmarks. Based on the results, we hypothesize that further improvements are possible with larger training sets. To support future research, we have open-sourced our analysis code.</description>

      <title>from Benign import Toxic: Jailbreaking the Language Model via Adversarial Metaphors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00038v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current studies have exposed the risk of Large Language Models (LLMs) generating harmful content by jailbreak attacks. However, they overlook that the direct generation of harmful content from scratch is more difficult than inducing LLM to calibrate benign content into harmful forms. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR) to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking. Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed. Then, driven by these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferable jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs.</description>
