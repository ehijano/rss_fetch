      <title>Weighing neutrinos with 21cm Intensity Mapping at the SKAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the constraining power of future 21cm intensity mapping (IM) observations at the SKAO, focusing primarily on the sum of neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu$. We forecast observations of the 21cm IM auto-power spectrum as well as the 21cm IM and galaxy surveys cross-correlation power spectrum. We construct different synthetic data sets of observations for the 21cm IM observables. For galaxy clustering, we consider two stage-IV surveys to mimic a DESI-like and Euclid-like cross-correlation signal. We study the impact of assuming three different fiducial values for the sum of neutrino masses, i.e. $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.06, 0.1, 0.4$ eV, in the synthetic data sets. To investigate the constraining power of the forecasted 21cm observations, we build a likelihood code. We find that the 21cm auto-power spectrum alone could provide an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses of $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 0.287$ eV, at $95\%$ confidence level, for the case of the lowest fiducial value of $\Sigma m_\nu$. This result is comparable to the upper limits provided by cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations alone. When combining the 21cm auto-power spectrum synthetic data set with Planck 2018 CMB measurements, we find a tighter upper limit of $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 0.105$ eV, which improves on the constraints from Planck alone. We obtain a similar result with 21cm and galaxy clustering cross-correlation power spectrum, whose detection is more easily achieved as they are less affected by systematic effects. Combining with Planck 2018 data, we find the upper limits of $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 0.116$ eV and $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 0.117$ eV for the 21cm signal in cross-correlation with the DESI-like and Euclid-like surveys, respectively. These constraints are comparable to those obtained by combining Planck data with the 21cm auto-power spectrum synthetic data sets, thus supporting the case for 21cm cross-correlation detections.</description>

      <title>Forecasts and Simulations for Relativistic Corrections to the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect is a window into the astrophysical processes of galaxy clusters, and relativistic corrections (the "rSZ") promise to provide a global census of the gas feedback within clusters. Upcoming wide-field millimeter-wave surveys such as the Simons Observatory (SO), Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope, and CMB-S4 will make increasingly precise measurements of the SZ effect and its relativistic corrections. We present simulated full-sky maps of the rSZ effect and a fast code to generate it, for use in the development of analysis techniques and pipelines. As part of the websky simulation suite, our mock observations have semi-realistic cross-correlations with other large-scale structure tracers, offering insights into the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters and large-scale structure. As a demonstration of this, we examine what an SO-like experiment can learn from the rSZ effect. We find that high significance detections will be possible, provided that the instrumental systematics are under control, and that the evolution of cluster temperatures with mass and redshift can be probed in a manner complementary to X-ray measurements.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamical simulations-based model that connects the FRB DM--redshift relation to suppression of the matter power spectrum via feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of baryonic feedback on the small-scale ($k \gtrsim 1\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$) matter power spectrum is a key astrophysical challenge, and essential for interpreting data from upcoming weak-lensing surveys, which require percent-level accuracy to fully harness their potential. Astrophysical probes, such as the kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, have been used to constrain feedback at large scales ($k \lesssim 5\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$). The sightline-to-sightline variance in the fast radio bursts (FRBs) dispersion measure (DM) correlates with the strength of baryonic feedback and offers unique sensitivity at scales upto $k \sim 10\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$. We develop a new simulation-based formalism in which we parameterize the distribution of DM at a given redshift, $p(\mathrm{DM}|z)$, as a log-normal with its first two moments computed analytically in terms of cosmological parameters and the feedback-dependent electron power spectrum $P_\mathrm{ee}(k, z)$. We find that the log-normal parameterization provides an improved description of the $p(\mathrm{DM}|z)$ distribution observed in hydrodynamical simulations as compared to the standard $F$-parameterization. Our model robustly captures the baryonic feedback effects across a wide range of baryonic feedback prescriptions in hydrodynamical simulations, including IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Astrid. Leveraging simulations incorporates the redshift evolution of the DM variance by construction and facilitates the translation of constrained feedback parameters to the suppression of matter power spectrum relative to gravity-only simulations. We show that with $10^4$ FRBs, the suppression can be constrained to percent-level precision at large scales and $\sim 10$\% precision at scales $k \gtrsim 10\,h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ with prior-to-posterior $1\sigma$ constraint width ratio $\gtrsim 20$.</description>

      <title>Superradiant dark matter production from primordial black holes: Impact of multiple modes and gravitational wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can emit particles through superradiance, a process particularly efficient when the particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the PBH's gravitational radius. Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Chiral Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a (non-)Abelian gauge field acquires an isotropic background configuration during inflation, strong gravitational waves (GWs) with parity-violating polarization, known as chiral GWs, can be produced in addition to the intrinsic unpolarized GWs. However, previous studies have analyzed individual models, leaving the generality of this phenomenon unclear. To perform a model-independent analysis, we construct an effective field theory (EFT) of chiral GWs by extending the EFT of inflation and incorporating gauge fields. The resulting action unifies inflationary models with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, such as chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation, and ones with a triplet of $U(1)$ gauge fields, systematically encompassing all possible GW production mechanisms consistent with the symmetry breaking induced by the gauge field background. We find that chiral GWs are generically and inevitably produced, provided that the effective energy density of the background gauge field is positive and the gauge kinetic function is not fine-tuned to a specific time dependence. This EFT offers a useful foundation for future phenomenological studies as well as for deepening our theoretical understanding of chiral GWs.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Substructures with Free-Form Modelling: A Case Study of the `Jackpot' Strong Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterising the population and internal structure of sub-galactic halos is critical for constraining the nature of dark matter. These halos can be detected near galaxies that act as strong gravitational lenses with extended arcs, as they perturb the shapes of the arcs. However, this method is subject to false-positive detections and systematic uncertainties: particularly degeneracies between an individual halo and larger-scale asymmetries in the distribution of lens mass. We present a new free-form lens modelling code, developed within the framework of the open-source software \texttt{PyAutoLens}, to address these challenges. Our method models mass perturbations that cannot be captured by parametric models as pixelized potential corrections and suppresses unphysical solutions via a Mat\'ern regularisation scheme that is inspired by Gaussian process regression. This approach enables the recovery of diverse mass perturbations, including subhalos, line-of-sight halos, external shear, and multipole components that represent the complex angular mass distribution of the lens galaxy, such as boxiness/diskiness. Additionally, our fully Bayesian framework objectively infers hyperparameters associated with the regularisation of pixelized sources and potential corrections, eliminating the need for manual fine-tuning. By applying our code to the well-known `Jackpot' lens system, SLACS0946+1006, we robustly detect a highly concentrated subhalo that challenges the standard cold dark matter model. This study represents the first attempt to independently reveal the mass distribution of a subhalo using a fully free-form approach.</description>

      <title>Probing the Bounce Energy Scale in Bouncing Cosmologies with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we constrain the bounce energy scale $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$ in a generic framework of bouncing cosmologies using the nanohertz stochastic gravitational-wave background recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav 15-yr, EPTA DR2, PPTA DR3, IPTA DR2). A full Bayesian fit of the analytic SGWB spectrum for this bounce scenario reveals, for the first time, two distinct posterior branches in $(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4},w_1)$: one near $w_1\approx0.3$ and one at $w_1\gg1$, where $w_1$ is the contraction phase equation of state. We find that the bouncing model attains larger Bayes factors against each of six conventional SGWB sources (SMBHBs, inflationary GWs, cosmic strings, domain walls, first order phase transitions, scalar induced GWs), demonstrating strong preference of current PTA data for the bounce hypothesis. Compared to the more generic dual inflation bounce scenario, the concrete bounce realization yields smaller Bayes factors, indicating that PTA measurements impose tighter constraints when the bounce scale is explicit. Moreover, the two posterior branches illuminate distinct theoretical frontiers. The right branch ($w_1\gg1$) violates the dominant energy condition (DEC), thereby providing direct empirical impetus for models with novel early Universe physics, e.g. ghost condensates, higher-derivative or modified gravity operators, and extra dimensional effects. Independently, both branches infer $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$ above the Planck scale $M_\mathrm{pl}$, demonstrating that current PTAs already probe trans-Planckian regimes. Together, these findings offer a rare observational window into UV completions of cosmology. We further describe how normalizing flow based machine learning can accelerate such Bayesian analyses as PTA data volumes increase.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the galaxy formation models during epoch of reionization with high redshift observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use high resolution N-body dark matter simulations and L-Galaxies semi-analytical galaxy formation models to explore the high-$z$ galaxy properties and estimate the budget of ionizing photons. The parameters within L-Galaxies are obtained using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with high-$z$ galaxy observations from JWST and other telescopes. We consider two versions of L-Galaxies with and without dust correction on galaxy UV luminosities. With the best-fit parameters, both L-Galaxies 2015 and L-Galaxies 2020 reproduce well observations of UV luminosity functions, stellar mass functions, star formation rate densities and ionizing photon emission efficiency. With the assumption of escape fraction of $20\%$, all models produce more ionizing photons than the number of Hydrogen atoms in the Universe at $z&gt;6$. The inclusion of dust correction within MCMC results in higher star formation efficiency, which predicts $\sim 50\%$ more ionizing photons, with better consistency between the predicted stellar mass functions and observations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Parameter Transitions in Cosmological Calibrators: A Resolution to the Hubble Tension from SH0ES Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension, characterized by discrepant measurements of the Hubble constant from early and late universe probes, remains one of the most significant challenges in cosmology. Building upon our previous analysis of individual parameter transitions in SH0ES data, we investigate the impact of simultaneous transitions in multiple Cepheid and SNIa calibration parameters at specific cosmic distances. We allow various combinations of transitions in Cepheid absolute magnitude ($M^W_H$), period-luminosity relation slope ($b_W$), metallicity coefficient ($Z_W$), and SNIa absolute magnitude ($M_B$). Our comprehensive analysis reveals a consistent preferred transition distance of approximately 23 Mpc across different parameter combinations. The most statistically favored model allows simultaneous transitions in $b_W$, $Z_W$, and $M_B$, yielding $\Delta \text{AIC} \simeq -9.2$ and $\Delta \text{BIC} \simeq -3.0$ compared to the baseline SH0ES model. This provides strong evidence for inhomogeneities in standard candle calibrations. We demonstrate that the post-transition SNIa absolute magnitude aligns more closely with CMB-based constraints, resulting in a reduced Hubble constant value that alleviates the tension. Our findings suggest that the Hubble tension might be resolved through proper modeling of calibration parameter inhomogeneities rather than requiring new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analysis of stacked samples of asymmetric, non-static, self-gravitating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to explore biases that arise in dynamical estimates of the mean mass profile for a collection of galaxy clusters that have been stacked to make a composite. There are three types of bias. One arises from anisotropy of the kinematic pressure tensor and has been already well studied; a second arises from departures from equilibrium; and a third arises because of heterogeneity of the clusters used, from their individual non-sphericity, and because velocities used are measured with respect to centres that are, in general, accelerating. Here we focus on the latter two. We stack clusters to measure the pressure tensor and density profiles and then estimate the dynamical mass profile using the Jeans equation, and compare to the actual mean mass profile. The main result of this paper is an estimate of the bias, that can be used to correct the dynamical mass estimate, and we show how it depends on the cluster sample selection. We find that Jeans equation typically overestimates the true mass by about 20\% at the virial radius.</description>

      <title>Local primordial non-Gaussianity from 'zero-bias' 21cm radiation during reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the potential of 21cm radiation fluctuations, during the epoch of reionization, in constraining the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. There generically exists an epoch at which the linear bias of the 21cm field crosses zero, independent of the precise astrophysics of reionization. This epoch implies the 21cm radiation is a natural "zero-bias tracer" in the sense of Castorina et al (2018). We identify new noise-like contributions which directly compete with the zero-bias effect, but which should be mitigated through sophisticated analysis techniques such as field-level reconstruction. These noise-like terms act to hinder the constraining power on local PNG of the brightness temperature fluctuations, making $\sigma (f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}) \leq 1$ unachievable even in simplified forecasts. We show that analyses which can reach the 'sampling noise' floor for this tracer and harness its full power can potentially unlock a 10-fold reduction in error bars, even in the presence of large-scale cuts from foregrounds. The potential of this epoch motivates searching for it in future 21cm surveys, along with developing analysis techniques that can reach the noise floor required for the zero-bias epoch to saturate Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Unified and consistent structure growth measurements from joint ACT, SPT and \textit{Planck} CMB lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the tightest cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing constraints to date on the growth of structure by combining CMB lensing measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and \textit{Planck}. Each of these surveys individually provides lensing measurements with similarly high statistical power, achieving signal-to-noise ratios of approximately 40. The combined lensing bandpowers represent the most precise CMB lensing power spectrum measurement to date with a signal-to-noise ratio of 61 and an amplitude of $A_\mathrm{lens}^\mathrm{recon} = 1.025 \pm 0.017$ with respect to the theory prediction from the best-fit CMB \textit{Planck}-ACT cosmology. The bandpowers from all three lensing datasets, analyzed jointly, yield a $1.6\%$ measurement of the parameter combination $S_8^\mathrm{CMBL} \equiv \sigma_8\,(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.25} = 0.825^{+0.015}_{-0.013}$. Including Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data improves the constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations to $\sigma_8 = 0.829 \pm 0.009$ (a $1.1\%$ determination). When combining with uncalibrated supernovae from \texttt{Pantheon+}, we present a $4\%$ sound-horizon-independent estimate of $H_0=66.4\pm2.5\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}} $. The joint lensing constraints on structure growth and present-day Hubble rate are fully consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM model fit to the primary CMB data from \textit{Planck} and ACT. While the precise upper limit is sensitive to the choice of data and underlying model assumptions, when varying the neutrino mass sum within the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological model, the combination of primary CMB, BAO and CMB lensing drives the probable upper limit for the mass sum towards lower values, comparable to the minimum mass prior required by neutrino oscillation experiments.</description>

      <title>Starlight from JWST: Implications for star formation and dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at $z\simeq10$ and that beyond $z=10-15$ the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at $z\simeq25$ the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass $&gt; 4.5 \times 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$ and the warm DM mass $&gt; 1.5\, {\rm keV}$ at the 95\% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be $&gt; 27\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at the 95\% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for $m_a &lt; 7.5 \times 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction $f_{\rm PBH}$ of DM in the range $10^{-4} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4 \,M_{\odot})^{-0.09} &lt; f_{\rm PBH} &lt; 8.7\times 10^{-3} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4\, M_{\odot})^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>On the Properties of Cosmological Ionization Fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of cosmological ionization fronts during the Epoch of Reionization using the CROC simulations. By analyzing reionization timing maps, we characterize ionization front velocities and curvatures and their dependence on the density structure of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The velocity distribution of ionization fronts in the simulations indicates that while the barrier-crossing analytical model captures the overall shape in high-velocity regions, it fails to reproduce the low-velocity tail, highlighting the non-Gaussian nature of the IGM's density field. Ionization front velocities are inversely correlated with local density, propagating faster in underdense regions and more slowly in overdense environments. Faster ionization fronts also lead to higher post-ionization temperatures, reaching a plateau at $\sim 2 \times 10^4$ K for velocities exceeding 3000 km/s. Examining curvature statistics further establishes a connection between ionization front structure and the normalized density contrast $\nu$, with trends in overdense regions aligning well with barrier-crossing model predictions, while deviations appear in underdense environments due to model limitations. These results provide a detailed characterization of ionization front dynamics and their interaction with the underlying density field, bridging small-scale reionization physics with large-scale observables such as the 21 cm signal and the IGM's thermal history.</description>

      <title>Explosive production of Higgs particles and implications for heavy dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely believed that the parameter space for Higgs-portal dark matter that achieves the relic abundance through thermal freeze-out has already been tightly constrained, typically at masses on the order of ${\cal O}(10-100)$ GeV. We point out the possibility that the multiple Higgs production due to its self-interaction dramatically changes this picture. We show that the multiplicity can be as large as ${\cal O}(200)$ for the parameters of the Standard Model Higgs, independently of the kinematics of the particle production process. Consequently, heavy Higgs-portal dark matter of $m_\chi\gtrsim{\cal O}(1)$ TeV can achieve the required relic abundance in the same mechanism with that for canonical weakly interacting massive particle models.</description>

      <title>Constraining Population III stellar demographics with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave observatories will reach farther into the universe than currently possible, revealing black-hole mergers from early stellar binary systems such as Population III stars, whose properties are currently poorly constrained. We develop a method to infer the properties of their progenitor populations from gravitational-wave catalogs. Using Bayesian deep learning, we train an emulator for population-synthesis predictions of black-hole merger properties across redshift as a function of the initial stellar mass function, crucially accounting for systematic uncertainty due to the finite number of training simulations. Combined with a nonparametric model for star formation history, we analyze catalogs containing both Population I/II and III sources simulated with full Bayesian parameter estimation for a detector network of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope with one year of observing time. We demonstrate our ability to separate these two populations at high redshifts where both make comparable contributions to the black-hole merger rate, excluding a Population III merger rate of zero at nearly 100% credibility. Moreover, we can place meaningful constraints on the Population III progenitor distributions; in particular, we constrain the spectral index of the initial mass function to within roughly +/-0.5 of the true value and the log of the star formation rate density to within ~25% over redshifts 10 to 20. By leveraging astrophysics-informed and astrophysics-agnostic models, we demonstrate the discriminative power of our combined inference approach and highlight the potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to uncover the details of high-redshift stellar populations.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM is still not broken: empirical constraints on the star formation efficiency at $z \sim 12-30$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope continues to push back the redshift frontier to ever earlier cosmic epochs, with recent announcements of galaxy candidates at redshifts of $15 \lesssim z \lesssim 30$. We leverage the recent GUREFT suite of dissipationless $N$-body simulations, which were designed for interpreting observations in the high redshift Universe, and provide predictions of dark matter halo mass functions and halo growth rates for a state-of-the-art cosmology over a wide range of halo masses from $6 &lt; z&lt; 30$. We combine these results with an empirical framework that maps halo growth rate to galaxy star formation rate and then to rest-frame UV luminosity. We find that even if all of the photometrically selected $15 \lesssim z \lesssim 30$ galaxy candidates are real and actually at these extreme redshifts, there is no fundamental tension with $\Lambda$CDM, nor are exotic explanations required. With stellar light-to-mass ratios similar to those in well-studied lower redshift galaxies, our simple model can account for the observed extreme ultra-high redshift populations with star formation efficiencies that peak at values of 20-65 percent. Bursty star formation, or higher light-to-mass ratios such as are expected for lower metallicity stellar populations or a top-heavy Initial Mass Function, would result in even lower required star formation efficiencies, comparable to values predicted by high resolution numerical simulations of high-surface density star forming clouds.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction for circular orbits in self-interacting ultralight dark matter and Fornax globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of repulsive self-interaction in ultralight dark matter (ULDM) on dynamical friction in circular orbits in ULDM halos and its implications for the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globular clusters. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, we derive the dynamical friction force considering soliton density profiles for both non-interacting and strongly self-interacting ULDM. Our results show that self-interactions reduce the dynamical friction effect further than both the non-interacting ULDM and standard cold dark matter models. Furthermore, we derive the low Mach number approximation to simplify the analysis in the subsonic motion, where the tangential component of dynamical friction dominates. Applying these findings to the Fornax dSph, we calculate the infall timescales of globular clusters, demonstrating that strong self-interaction can address the timing problem more effectively. We constrain the parameter space for ULDM particle mass and self-coupling constant, which are consistent with other constraints from astronomical and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of dilaton-inspired scalar field within the geometrical trinity of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the dilaton-inspired scalar field, formally rewritten by means of a Brans-Dicke Lagrangian, within the framework of \emph{geometrical trinity of gravity}. In this respect, we perform a stability analysis by adopting a non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric and considering the well-established exponential potential in three distinct gravitational frameworks: general relativity, teleparallel gravity, and symmetric-teleparallel gravity. By comparing the scalar field behaviors across these theories, we highlight the role of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity in shaping cosmic evolution. Our analysis reveals that, both in general relativity and teleparallel gravity, the dilaton-inspired field can drive the accelerated expansion of the universe, effectively behaving as cosmological constant at late times. In contrast, within the symmetric teleparallel gravity scenario, performing a complete linear stability analysis is prevented by the use of the non-coincident gauge. Nevertheless, the latter paradigm introduces complexity into the autonomous system, resulting in a structurally different analysis. For general relativity and teleparallel scenarios, we remark the regions of attractor solutions and unphysical domains in which we do not expect the viability of our dilaton-inspired Lagrangian. However, within the framework of symmetric-teleparallel gravity, the stability analysis reveals no attractor points for the chosen set of free parameters. In support of these findings, physical conclusions, kinematical studies, and consequences on Friedmann dynamics are thus explored.</description>

      <title>Latest developments in wide-field VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) combines the signals of telescopes distributed across thousands of kilometres to provide some of the highest angular resolution images of astrophysical phenomena. Due to computational expense, typical VLBI observations are restricted to a single target and a small (few arcseconds) field-of-view per pointing. The technique of wide-field VLBI was born to enable the targeting of multiple sources and has been successful in providing new insights into Active Galactic Nuclei, the interstellar medium, supernovae, gravitational lenses and much more. However, this technique is still only employed in a few experiments, restricting the scientific potential of VLBI observations. In this conference proceeding, we outline new developments in wide-field VLBI, including an end-to-end correlation and calibration workflow, distributed correlation, and new calibration routines. These developments aim to enable wide-field VLBI to be a standard observing mode on all major VLBI arrays.</description>

      <title>On the unique evolutionary mechanisms of massive quiescent galaxies in the epoch of reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolutionary histories of a population of high mass, high redshift, quiescent galaxies in the cosmohydrodynamical simulation Thesan; studying the characteristic properties of their haloes and environments over the epoch of reionisation. Thesan employs a modified version of the Arepo moving-mesh code utilised in IllustrisTNG, whose explicit handling of ionising radiation couples haloes and galaxies with cosmic reionisation. This results in a regime of rapid growth and quenching, producing nine massive quiescent galaxies at $z = 5.5$, in a $95.5\text{cMpc}^3$ volume, with no counterpart in IllustrisTNG. We find that the rapid assembly of stellar mass is attributed to smooth accretion of mass onto their haloes in dense environments, particularly from massive neighbouring structures; while these galaxies exhibit fast-growing potential wells hosting massive central black holes. With insignificant merger activity, we find AGN feedback to be the primary source of quenching. We find megaparsec-scale densities and halo masses to continue growing after quenching, suggesting that massive quiescent galaxies will be found in some of the largest haloes and densest regions of space by observations. With an unprecedented plethora of massive quiescent galaxies found in JWST data, these reionisation simulations may provide the paradigm for the evolutionary histories of these galaxies, while constraining the relatively unknown physics of reionisation. Despite the rarity of simulated massive quiescent galaxies, their identification in Thesan enables identification of halo and environmental properties most conducive to their quenching, hopefully guiding future efforts into the study of analogous systems in deep observational surveys and large-volume N-body simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmic strings in the complex symmetron model, a scalar-tensor theory with a spontaneously broken local $U(1)$ symmetry in low matter density regions. Using numerical simulations, we show that these strings preferentially attach to matter halos, leading to the stabilization of string loops. While the requirement for screening of fifth-force interactions in the solar system limits observable signatures in theories with universal coupling to matter, analogous topological defects in the dark sector may still influence cosmic structure formation, offering a novel avenue to constrain dark-sector interactions.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Ultra-faint Radio Frequency Interference in Deep 21~cm Epoch of Reionization Power Spectra with the Murchison Widefield Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present deep upper limits from the 2014 Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase I observing season, with a particular emphasis on identifying the spectral fingerprints of extremely faint radio frequency interference (RFI) contamination in the 21~cm power spectra (PS). After meticulous RFI excision involving a combination of the \textsc{SSINS} RFI flagger and a series of PS-based jackknife tests, our lowest upper limit on the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21~cm PS signal is $\Delta^2 \leq 1.61\cdot10^4 \text{ mK}^2$ at $k=0.258\text{ h Mpc}^{-1}$ at a redshift of 6.5 using 14.7 hours of data. By leveraging our understanding of how even fainter RFI is likely to contaminate the EoR PS, we are able to identify ultra-faint RFI signals in the cylindrical PS. Surprisingly this signature is most obvious in PS formed with less than an hour of data, but is potentially subdominant to other systematics in multiple-hour integrations. Since the total RFI budget in a PS detection is quite strict, this nontrivial integration behavior suggests a need to more realistically model coherently integrated ultra-faint RFI in PS measurements so that its potential contribution to a future detection can be diagnosed.</description>

      <title>Detecting dark matter oscillations with gravitational waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the phase shift in the gravitational wave signal induced by fast oscillations of scalar dark matter surrounding binary systems, which could be probed by the future experiments LISA and DECIGO. This effect depends on the local matter density and the mass of the dark matter particle. We compare it to the phase shift due to a standard dynamical friction term, which should generically be present. We find that the effect associated with the oscillations only dominates over the dynamical friction for dark matter masses below $10^{-21}$ eV, with masses below $10^{-23}$ eV implying cloud sizes that are too large to be realistic. Moreover, for masses of the order of $10^{-21}$ eV, LISA and DECIGO would only detect this effect for dark matter densities greater than that in the solar system by a factor $10^5$ or $10^4$ respectively. We conclude that this signal can be ignored for most dark matter scenarios unless very dense clouds of very light dark matter are created early in the Universe at a redshift $z\sim 10^4$.</description>

      <title>Too Hot to Handle: Searching for Inflationary Particle Production in Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic production of massive particles is a generic feature of many inflationary mechanisms. If sufficiently massive, these particles can leave features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) that are not well-captured by traditional correlation function analyses. We consider a scenario in which particle production occurs only in a narrow time-interval during inflation, eventually leading to CMB hot- or coldspots with characteristic shapes and sizes. Searching for such features in CMB data is analogous to searching for late-Universe hot- or coldspots, such as those due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. Exploiting this data-analysis parallel, we perform a search for particle-production hotspots in the Planck PR4 temperature dataset, which we implement via a matched-filter analysis. Our pipeline is validated on synthetic observations and found to yield unbiased constraints on sufficiently large hotspots across $\approx 60\%$ of the sky. After removing point sources and tSZ clusters, we find no evidence for new physics and place novel bounds on the coupling between the inflaton and massive particles. These bounds are strongest for larger hotspots, produced early in inflation, whilst sensitivity to smaller hotspots is limited by noise and beam effects. Through such methods we can constrain particles with masses $\mathcal{O}(100)$ times larger than the inflationary Hubble scale, which represents possibly the highest energies ever directly probed with observational data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for flux scale errors in Galactic synchrotron maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 408 MHz Haslam map is widely used as a low-frequency anchor for the intensity and morphology of Galactic synchrotron emission. Multi-frequency, multi-experiment fits show evidence of spatial variation and curvature in the synchrotron frequency spectrum, but there are also poorly-understood multiplicative flux scale disagreements between experiments. We perform a Bayesian model comparison across a range of scenarios, using fits that include recent spectroscopic observations at $\sim 1$ GHz by MeerKAT as well as a reference map from the OVRO-LWA at 73 MHz. In the few square degrees that we analyzed, a large uncorrected flux scale factor potentially as large as 1.6 in the Haslam data is preferred, indicating a 60\% overestimation of the brightness. This partly undermines its use as a reference map. We also find that models with nonzero spectral curvature are statistically disfavored. Given the limited sky coverage here, we suggest a similar analysis across many more regions of the sky to determine the extent and variation of flux scale errors, and whether they should be treated as random or systematic errors in analyses that use the Haslam map as a template.</description>

      <title>Challenges to a sharp change in $G$ as a solution to the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the gravitational constant $G$ abruptly decreased around 130 Myr ago, making Type Ia supernovae (SNe) in the Hubble flow intrinsically brighter than those in host galaxies with Cepheid distances. This would make Hubble flow SNe more distant, causing redshifts to rise slower with distance, potentially solving the Hubble tension. We explore a wide range of unattractive consequences of this ``$G$ step model'' (GSM). We find that since the luminosities of Sun-like stars scale as approximately $G^{5.6}$, the Solar luminosity would have dropped substantially 130 Myr ago in this scenario, likely pushing Earth into a planetary glaciation. However, there was no Snowball Earth episode in the last 500 Myr. The GSM also implies that the length of a year would have abruptly increased by about 10%, but the number of days per year has evolved broadly continuously according to geochronometry and cyclostratigraphy. The GSM would considerably alter stellar evolution, causing the Sun to have exhausted about 2/3 of its fuel supply rather than 1/2. This would make the Sun's helioseismic age exceed that of the oldest meteorite samples, but these agree excellently in practice. The expected age of the Universe also agrees well with that of the oldest Galactic stars assuming constant $G$. The GSM however implies these stars are younger, creating a lack of stars from the first 3 Gyr of cosmic history. These arguments pose significant challenges to models seeking to resolve the Hubble tension through a transition in $G$.</description>

      <title>Bumblebee cosmology: Tests using distance- and time-redshift probes</title>

Abstract: In modern cosmology, the discovery of the universe's accelerated expansion has significantly transformed our understanding of cosmic evolution and expansion history. The unknown properties of dark energy, the driver of this acceleration, have not only prompted extensive studies on its nature but also spurred interest in modified gravity theories that might serve as alternatives. In this paper, we adopt a bumblebee vector-tensor modified gravity theory to model the cosmic expansion history and derive predictions for the Hubble parameter. We constrain the bumblebee model parameters using observational data from established probes, including the Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae calibrated via the SH0ES (Supernova $H_0$ for the Equation of State) Cepheid distance ladder analysis and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), as well as recently included cosmic chronometers (CC) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the Bayesian posterior distribution enables us to rigorously constrain the bumblebee models and compare them with the standard $\Lambda \text{CDM}$ cosmology. We find that the bumblebee theory on its own can provide sufficiently good fits to the current observational data of distance- and time-redshift relations, suggesting its potential to explain the cosmic background dynamics. However, when compared to $\Lambda \text{CDM}$, the latter still outperforms the former according to the information criteria. We propose that further constraints from cosmological perturbation tests could impose more stringent constraints on bumblebee cosmology.</description>

      <title>Probing massive neutrinos and modified gravity with redshift-space morphologies and anisotropies of large-scale structure</title>

Abstract: Strong degeneracy exists between some modified gravity (MG) models and massive neutrinos because the enhanced structure growth produced by modified gravity can be suppressed due to the free-streaming massive neutrinos. Previous works showed this degeneracy can be broken with non-Gaussian or velocity information. Therefore in this work, we focus on the large-scale structure (LSS) in redshift space and investigate for the first time the possibility of using the non-Gaussian information and velocity information captured by the 3D scalar Minkowski functionals (MFs) and the 3D Minkowski tensors (MTs) to break this degeneracy. Based on the Quijote and Quijote-MG simulations, we find the imprints on redshift space LSS left by the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity can be discriminated from those left by massive neutrinos with these statistics. With the Fisher information formalism, we first show how the MTs extract information with their perpendicular and parallel elements for both low- and high-density regions; then we compare constraints from the power spectrum monopole and MFs in real space with those in redshift space, and investigate how the constraining power is further improved with anisotropies captured by the quadrupole and hexadecapole of the power spectrum and the MTs; finally, we combine the power spectrum multipoles with MFs plus MTs and find the constraints from the power spectrum multipoles on $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}, h, \sigma_8$, $M_\nu$, and $f_{R_0}$ can be improved, because they are complemented with non-Gaussian information, by a factor of 3.4, 3.0, 3.3, 3.3, and 1.9 on small scales ($k_{\rm{max}}=0.5~h\rm{Mpc}^{-1},\ R_G=5~h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$), and 2.8, 2.2, 3.4, 3.4, and 1.5 on large scales ($k_{\rm{max}}=0.25~h\rm{Mpc}^{-1},\ R_G=10~h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$).</description>

      <title>Testing $\gamma\delta$CDM Model in the Redshift Bins</title>

Abstract: The Hubble crisis is the discrepancy in the values of the Hubble constant inferred from diverse observations in the late and early Universe, being of the order 5$\sigma$. Instead of resolution, the conflict is getting larger with further late-time observations. A fundamental constant should be and remain constant throughout the cosmological history and thus at all redshifts. The fact that it turns out to be a function of redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model points out that either there is a problem with the current cosmological model, indicating unknown new physics, or there are unknown systematics in some of the observations. In this work, we investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble constant in the $\gamma\delta$CDM cosmological model, which is a new cosmological model based on $f(R)$ gravity in an anisotropic background. Through data analysis with the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, the cosmic chronometers Hubble, and both the old and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation data, we establish that the Hubble constant in our model does not evolve with redshift. We also confirm that our model fits the aforementioned data better than the $\Lambda$CDM model by checking various information criteria. The value of the Hubble constant obtained in the $\gamma\delta$CDM model is in the 1$\sigma$ bound of the late Universe observations.</description>

Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

      <title>Tomographic halo model of the unWISE-Blue galaxies using cross-correlations with BOSS CMASS galaxies</title>

Abstract: The halo model offers a framework for investigating galaxy clustering, and for understanding the growth of galaxies and the distribution of galaxies of different types. Here, we use the halo model to study the small-scale clustering and halo occupation distribution (HOD) of the unWISE-Blue galaxy sample, an infrared-selected sample of $\sim$100 million galaxies across the entire extragalactic sky at $z\sim 0.5$ $-$ similar redshifts to the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS sample. Although the photometric unWISE galaxies cannot be easily split in redshift, we use their cross-correlation with the BOSS CMASS sample to tomographically probe the HOD of the unWISE galaxies at $0.45 &lt; z &lt; 0.75$. To do so, we develop a new method for applying the halo model to cross-correlations between a photometric sample and a spectroscopic sample in narrow redshift bins, incorporating halo exclusion, post-Limber corrections, and redshift-space distortions. We reveal strong evolution in the CMASS HOD, and modest evolution in the unWISE-Blue HOD. For unWISE-Blue, we find that the average bias and mean halo mass drop from $b = 1.6$ and $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{h}}/M_{\odot}) \sim 13.4$ at $z \sim 0.5$ to $b = 1.4$ and $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{h}}/M_{\odot}) \sim 13.1$ at $z \sim 0.7$, and that the satellite fraction drops modestly from $\sim$20% to $\sim$10% in the same range. These results are useful for creating mock samples of the unWISE-Blue galaxies. Furthermore, the techniques developed to obtain these results are applicable to other tomographic cross-correlations between photometric samples and narrowly-binned spectroscopic samples, such as clustering redshifts.</description>

      <title>Abundance and properties of dark radiation from the cosmic microwave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cosmological signatures of new light relics that are collisionless like standard neutrinos or are strongly interacting. We provide a simple and succinct rephrasing of their physical effects in the cosmic microwave background, as well as the resulting parameter degeneracies with other cosmological parameters, in terms of the total radiation abundance and the fraction thereof that freely streams. In these more general terms, interacting and noninteracting light relics are differentiated by their respective decrease and increase of the free-streaming fraction, and, moreover, the scale-dependent interplay thereof with a common, correlated reduction of the fraction of matter in baryons. We then derive updated constraints on various dark-radiation scenarios with the latest cosmological observations, employing this language to identify the physical origin of the impact of each dataset. The "PR4" reanalyses of Planck CMB data prefer a larger primordial helium yield and therefore also slightly more radiation than the 2018 analysis; we investigate the differences between the two releases that drives these shifts. Smaller free-streaming fractions are disfavored by the excess lensing of the CMB measured in lensing reconstruction data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. On the other hand, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument drive marginal detections of new, strongly interacting light relics due to that data's preference for lower matter fractions. Finally, we forecast measurements from the CMB-S4 experiment.</description>

      <title>Constraining the z $\sim$ 1 Initial Mass Function with {\it HST} and {\it JWST} Lensed Stars in MACS J0416.1-2403</title>

Abstract: Our understanding of galaxy properties and evolution is contingent on knowing the initial mass function (IMF), and yet to date, the IMF is constrained only to local galaxies. Individual stars are now becoming routinely detected at cosmological distances, where luminous stars such as supergiants in background galaxies strongly lensed by galaxy clusters are temporarily further magnified by huge factors (up to $10^{4}$) by intracluster stars, thus being detected as transients. The detection rate of these events depends on the abundance of luminous stars in the background galaxy and is thus sensitive to the IMF and the star-formation history (SFH), especially for the blue supergiants detected as transients in the rest-frame ultraviolet/optical filters. As a proof of concept, we use simple SFH and IMF models constrained by spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to see how well we can predict the {\it HST} and {\it JWST} transient detection rate in a lensed arc dubbed ``Spock'' (redshift $z = 1.0054$). We find that demanding a simultaneous fit of the SED and the rest-frame ultraviolet/optical transient detection rate places constraints on the IMF, independent of the assumed simple SFH model. We conclude our Bayesian likelihood analysis indicates that the data definitively prefers the ``Spock'' galaxy to have a Salpeter IMF ($\alpha = 2.35$) rather than a Top-heavy IMF ($\alpha = 1$) -- which is thought to be the case in the early universe -- with no clear excess of supergiants above the standard IMF.</description>

      <title>Microlensing at Cosmological Distances: Event Rate Predictions in the Warhol Arc of MACS 0416</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly magnified stars ($\mu$ $&gt;$ 100) are now outinely identified as transient events at cosmological distances thanks to microlensing by intra-cluster stars near the critical curves of galaxy clusters. Using the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with the {\it Hubble} Space Telescope (HST), we outline here an analytical framework that is applied to the Warhol arc (at $z=0.94$) in the MACS 0416 galaxy cluster (at $z=0.396)$ where over a dozen microlensed stars have been detected to date. This method is general and can be applied to other lensed arcs. Within this lensed galaxy we fit the spatially resolved SED spanned by eight JWST-NIRCam filters combined with three ACS filters, for accurate lensed star predictions in 2D. With this tool we can generate 2D maps of microlensed stars for well resolved arcs in general, including dependence on wavelength and limiting apparent magnitude, for comparison with with planned cadenced campaigns for JWST and Hubble, for constraining directly the IMF and the level of dark matter substructure.</description>

      <title>Purely gravitational dark matter production in warm inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an appealing scenario for the production of purely gravitational dark matter in the background of warm inflation, a mechanism that maintains stable thermal bath during inflation. Through systematic investigation of various gravitational production channels, we reveal distinctive features compared to the standard inflation scenario. Notably, the inflaton annihilation channel in warm inflation exhibits markedly different thermodynamics from the standard inflation paradigm, leading to a suppression on the production of sub-inflaton-mass dark matter. For the production channel of inflationary vacuum fluctuations, we find an abundance-mass correlation of $\rho_\chi\propto m_\chi^{1/2}(m_\chi^{5/2})$ for the sub-Hubble-mass dark matter with minimal(conformal) coupling. Our results also indicate that a minimum temperature threshold of $10^{-6}M_P$ is necessary for warm inflation, which allows adequate dark matter production. With observational constraints, our results provide stringent limits on the mass range of purely gravitational dark matter with sufficient density: $10^{-8}-10^{-2}M_P$ for minimal coupling and $10^{-14}-10^{-2}M_P$ for conformal coupling.</description>

      <title>Free Cosmic Density Bispectrum on Small Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the free, cold-dark matter density fluctuation bispectrum in the limit of small scales. From an initially Gaussian random field, we draw phase-space positions of test particles which then propagate along Zel'dovich trajectories. A suitable expansion of the initial momentum auto-correlations of these particles leads to an asymptotic series whose lower-order power-law exponents we calculate. The dominant contribution has an exponent of $-11/2$. For triangle configurations with zero surface area, this exponent is even enhanced to $-9/2$. These power laws can only be revealed by a non-perturbative calculation with respect to the initial power spectrum. They are valid for a general class of initial power spectra with a cut-off function, required to enforce convergence of its moments. We then confirm our analytic results numerically. Finally, we use this asymptotic behaviour to investigate the shape dependence of the bispectrum in the small-scale limit, and to show how different shapes grow over cosmic time. These confirm the usual model of gravitational collapse within the Zel'dovich picture.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian statistics of de Sitter spectators: A perturbative derivation of stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields interacting with the primordial curvature perturbation during inflation may communicate their statistics to the latter. This situation motivates the study of how the probability density function (PDF) of a light spectator field $\varphi$ in a pure de Sitter space-time, becomes non-Gaussian under the influence of a scalar potential ${\mathcal V(\varphi)}$. One approach to this problem is offered by the stochastic formalism introduced by Starobinsky and Yokoyama. It results in a Fokker-Planck equation for the time-dependent PDF $\rho (\varphi , t)$ describing the statistics of $\varphi$ which, in the limit of equilibrium gives one back the solution $\rho (\varphi) \propto \exp \big[ - \frac{8 \pi^2}{3 H^4} {\mathcal V(\varphi)} \big]$. We study the derivation of $\rho (\varphi , t)$ using quantum field theory tools. Our approach yields an almost Gaussian distribution function, distorted by minor corrections comprised of terms proportional to powers of $\Delta N \times \mathcal O(\partial_\varphi) {\mathcal V(\varphi)}$, where $\Delta N$ is the number of $e$-folds succeeding the Hubble-horizon crossing of $\varphi$'s wavelengths, and $\mathcal O(\partial_\varphi)$ stands for a derivative operator acting on ${\mathcal V(\varphi)}$. This general form is obtained perturbatively and remains valid even with loop corrections. Our solution satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation that receives corrections with respect to the one found within the stochastic approach, allowing us to comment on the validity of the standard equilibrium solution for generic potentials. We posit that higher order corrections to the Fokker-Planck equation may become important towards the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Identifying Neutrino Mass Ordering with Cosmic Gravitational Focusing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) of relic neutrinos can provide an independent measurement of the absolute neutrino masses $m_i$ with fourth-power dependence ($m^4_i$). We demonstrate in this paper for the first time how this can help identifying the neutrino mass ordering, using the fact that total mass falling below the inverted ordering threshold allows the discrimination of the inverted ordering. Upon incorporating the projected CGF sensitivity at DESI, the preference for the normal ordering with a prior $\sum m_i &gt; 0.059\,{\rm eV}$ would increase from the original 89.9\% of the existing matter clustering method with the DESI analysis to 98.2\% while the inverted ordering is further disfavored from 10.1\% to 1.8\%. We also show how this can affect the prospects of the neutrinoless double beta decay and single beta decay measurements.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>Dust Battery: A Novel Mechanism for Seed Magnetic Field Generation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel dust battery mechanism for generating seed magnetic fields in the early universe, in which charged dust grains are radiatively accelerated, inducing strong electric currents that subsequently generate magnetic fields. Our analysis demonstrates that this process is effective even at very low metallicities (approximately $ \sim 10^{-5} Z_\odot$), and capable of producing seed fields with significant amplitudes of $B \sim \rm \mu G$ around luminous sources over timescales of years to Myr and across spatial scales ranging from au to kpc. Crucially, we find that this mechanism is generically $\sim10^8$ times more effective than the radiatively-driven electron battery or Biermann battery in relatively cool gas ($\ll 10^{5}\,$K), including both neutral and ionized gas. Furthermore, our results suggest that, to first order, dissipation effects do not appear to significantly impede this process, and that it can feasibly generate coherent seed fields on macroscopically large ISM scales (much larger than turbulent dissipation scales or electron mean-free-paths in the ISM). These seed fields could then be amplified by subsequent dynamo actions to the observed magnetic fields in galaxies. Additionally, we propose a sub-grid model for integration into cosmological simulations, and the required electric-field expressions for magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-a-cell (MHD-PIC) simulations that explicitly model dust dynamics. Finally, we explore the broad applicability of this mechanism across different scales and conditions, emphasizing its robustness compared to other known battery mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Electroweak Phase Transition with a Real Scalar Singlet at a Muon Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) is essential for explaining baryogenesis and for potentially generating observable gravitational waves. This study investigates the potential of a high-energy muon collider to examine the occurrence of SFOEWPT within the context of a Standard Model extended by a real scalar singlet (xSM). We analyzed all possible decay modes of the singlet to constrain the valid parameter space of SFOEWPT, which was extracted numerically at different renormalization scales to account for theoretical uncertainties, thereby determining the sensitivity of a muon collider to the production and decay channels of novel heavy scalar particles that emerge in the xSM. The findings demonstrate that a 3 TeV muon collider can directly examine the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking by efficiently detecting novel scalar particles associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition through jet-rich final states, thus complementing the indirect constraints from gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Divergent Energy-Momentum Fluxes In Nonlocal Gravity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the second order perturbations of the Deser-Woodard II (DWII), Vardanyan-Akrami-Amendola-Silvestri (VAAS) and Amendola-Burzilla-Nersisyan (ABN) nonlocal gravity models in an attempt to extract their associated gravitational wave energy-momentum fluxes. In Minkowski spacetime, the gravitational spatial momentum density is supposed to scale at most as $1/r^{2}$, in the $r \rightarrow \infty$ limit, where $r$ is the observer-source spatial distance. The DWII model has a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $1/r$; though this can be avoided when we set to zero the first derivative of its distortion function at the origin. Meanwhile, the ABN model also suffers from a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $r^{2}$. The momentum density from the VAAS model was computed on a cosmological background expressed in a Fermi-Normal-Coordinate system, and was found to scale as $r$. For generic parameters, therefore, none of these three Dark Energy models appear to yield well-defined gravitational wave energies, as a result of their nonlocal gravitational self-interactions.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic ab initio study of the low-lying states in beryllium isotopes from 7Be to 12Be using nuclear lattice effective field theory with the N3LO interaction. Our calculations achieve good agreement with experimental data for energies, radii, and electromagnetic properties. We introduce a novel, model-independent method to quantify nuclear shapes, uncovering a distinct pattern in the interplay between positive and negative parity states across the isotopic chain. By combining Monte Carlo sampling of the many-body density operator with a novel nucleon-grouping algorithm, the prominent two-center cluster structures, the emergence of one-neutron halo, complex nuclear molecular dynamics such as {\pi} orbital and {\sigma} orbital, emerge naturally.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Rule Out Heavy Tachyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present direct observational constraints on tachyons; particles with group velocity greater than $c$ in vacuum in a Lorentz invariant theory. Since tachyons may have no direct couplings to Standard Model particles, the most robust and model independent constraints come from gravitational effects, especially black holes. We compute the Hawking radiation of tachyons from black holes, finding it to be significantly enhanced in the presence of heavy tachyons. For a black hole of mass $M$ and tachyons of mass $m$ with $g$ degrees of freedom, the black hole lifetime is found to be $t_{bh} \approx 192 \pi \hbar M/(g c^2 m^2)$ (or doubled for fermions). This implies that the observation of black holes of a few solar masses, with lifetime of several billion years, rules out tachyons of mass $m &gt; 3 \times 10^9$ GeV. This means there cannot exist any tachyons associated with unification scales or quantum gravity. So while there already exists theoretical reasons to be skeptical of tachyons, our work provides a complementary direct observational constraint.</description>

      <title>Single versus multifield scalar potentials from string theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of string effective theories with scalar field(s) and a scalar potential. We first claim that in most examples known, such theories are multifield, with at least 2 non-compact field directions; the few counter-examples appear to be very specific and isolated. Such a systematic multifield situation has important implications for cosmology. Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more delicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string effective theories with $V&gt;0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat direction along an off-shell field trajectory: in other words, there exists a limit $\varphi \rightarrow \infty$ for which $\frac{|\partial_{\varphi} V|}{V} \rightarrow 0$. It is thus meaningless to look for a lower bound to this single field quantity in a multifield setting; the complete gradient $\nabla V$ is then better suited. Restricting to on-shell trajectories, this question remains open, especially when following the steepest descent or more generally a gradient flow evolution. Interestingly, single field statements in multifield theories seem less problematic for $V&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Zooming In On The Multi-Phase Structure of Magnetically-Dominated Quasar Disks: Radiation From Torus to ISCO Across Accretion Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent radiation-thermochemical-magnetohydrodynamic simulations resolved formation of quasar accretion disks from cosmological scales down to ~300 gravitational radii $R_{g}$, arguing they were 'hyper-magnetized' (plasma $\beta\ll1$ supported by toroidal magnetic fields) and distinct from traditional $\alpha$-disks. We extend these, refining to $\approx 3\,R_{g}$ around a $10^{7}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ BH with multi-channel radiation and thermochemistry, and exploring a factor of 1000 range of accretion rates ($\dot{m}\sim0.01-20$). At smaller scales, we see the disks maintain steady accretion, thermalize and self-ionize, and radiation pressure grows in importance, but large deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium and single-phase equations of state are always present. Trans-Alfvenic and highly-supersonic turbulence persists in all cases, and leads to efficient vertical mixing, so radiation pressure saturates at levels comparable to fluctuating magnetic and turbulent pressures even for $\dot{m}\gg1$. The disks also become radiatively inefficient in the inner regions at high $\dot{m}$. The midplane magnetic field remains primarily toroidal at large radii, but at super-Eddington $\dot{m}$ we see occasional transitions to a poloidal-field dominated state associated with outflows and flares. Large-scale magnetocentrifugal and continuum radiation-pressure-driven outflows are weak at $\dot{m}&lt;1$, but can be strong at $\dot{m}\gtrsim1$. In all cases there is a scattering photosphere above the disk extending to $\gtrsim 1000\,R_{g}$ at large $\dot{m}$, and the disk is thick and flared owing to magnetic support (with $H/R$ nearly independent of $\dot{m}$), so the outer disk is strongly illuminated by the inner disk and most of the inner disk continuum scatters or is reprocessed at larger scales, giving apparent emission region sizes as large as $\gtrsim 10^{16}\,{\rm cm}$.</description>
