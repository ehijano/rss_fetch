      <title>Landau levels and optical conductivity in the mixed state of a generic Weyl superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy quasiparticle states in the mixed state of most superconductors remain Bloch waves due to the presence of supercurrent around vortex cores. In contrast, the Weyl superconductor (WSC) may display Dirac-Landau levels in the presence of a vortex lattice. Here, we investigate the Landau level (LL) structure and optical conductivity in the mixed state of a generic WSC using a heterostructure model, where the tilt of the Bogoliubov-Weyl (BW) cones can be tuned, yielding either type-I (undertilted) or type-II (overtilted) cones. We find that, in a magnetic field, the tilted type-I BW cone in the mixed state may exhibit squeezed LLs with reduced spacings. On the other hand, the spectrum of type-II cones shows a dependence on the angle between the magnetic field and the tilt direction; LL quantization is only possible if the angle is below a critical value. For zero tilt, the optical conductivity in the mixed state of the WSC shows peaks only at photon frequencies $\omega_n \propto \sqrt{n}+\sqrt{n+1}$, with a linear background. However, the tilt of BW cones results in the emergence of optical transitions beyond the usual dipolar ones. For type-II BW cones, unique intraband transition conductivity peaks emerge at low frequency, which can serve as an indicator to distinguish between type-I and type-II BW cones in WSCs.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits on the electron-phonon coupling and superconducting $T_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish fundamental upper bounds on the electron-phonon interaction strength and superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in metals stemming from an intrinsic instability of the equilibrium between electrons and the crystal lattice with respect to strong interaction. Our theory explains why the largest observed electron-phonon couplings $\lambda\le 4$ as well as the mechanism of metastable superconductivity with higher $T_c$. We conclude based on our theory and analysis of experimental data that room-temperature superconductivity is feasible but only in hydrogen compounds.</description>

      <title>Majorana braiding in superconductors with fixed total number of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional topological superconductors treated at the mean-field level host zero-energy edge Majorana modes, which encode topological degeneracy of their ground states. Geometric manipulations (braiding) of multiple wires can be used to induce topologically robust transformations within the ground state subspace. The mean-field ground states do not have a definite number of particles and thus cannot describe an isolated system. Projecting such states onto fixed particle number gives a very good approximation to the true ground state of an isolated superconductor. In previous work, we showed that so projecting the prototypical Kitaev wave function of a single wire retains key features of the mean-field description, such as the zero-energy single-particle spectral peaks near the wire edges. Here we consider the case of multiple wires with conserved total charge. Again, using the projected Kitaev wave functions as the template, we identify the many-body counterparts of the mean-field topologically degenerate ground states. We then demonstrate how the quantum gates equivalent to braiding of Majorana zero modes can be implemented, albeit with reduced protection from noise and disorder.</description>

      <title>Nematic Ising superconductivity with hidden magnetism in few-layer 6R-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs), the manipulation of interlayer stacking/coupling allows for the construction of customizable quantum systems exhibiting exotic physics. An illustrative example is the diverse range of states of matter achieved through varying the proximity coupling between two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin liquid (QSL) and superconductors within the TaS2 family. This study presents a demonstration of the intertwined physics of spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking, hidden magnetism, and Ising superconductivity in the three-fold rotationally symmetric, non-magnetic natural vdWHs 6R-TaS2. A distinctive phase emerges in 6R-TaS2 below a characteristic temperature (T*) of approximately 30 K, which is characterized by a remarkable set of features, including a giant extrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE), Kondo screening, magnetic field-tunable thermal hysteresis, and nematic magneto-resistance. At lower temperatures, a coexistence of nematicity and Kondo screening with Ising superconductivity is observed, providing compelling evidence of hidden magnetism within a superconductor. This research not only sheds light on unexpected emergent physics resulting from the coupling of itinerant electrons and localized/correlated electrons in natural vdWHs but also emphasizes the potential for tailoring exotic quantum states through the manipulation of interlayer interactions.</description>

      <title>Josephson currents in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the interface between $S$-wave and $P$-wave paired superfluids in neutron stars induces a neutron supercurrent, akin to the Josephson junction effect in electronic superconductors. The proton supercurrent entrainment by the neutron superfluid generates, in addition to the neutral supercurrent, a charged current across the interface. Beyond the stationary limit, the motions of the neutron vortex line and proton flux tube arrays, responding to secular changes in the neutron star's rotation rate, induce a time-dependent oscillating Josephson current across this interface. We show that such motion produces radiation from the interface, which is phenomenologically significant enough to heat the star and alter its cooling rate during the photon cooling era.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid and antiferromagnetic correlations with hole doping in the bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-$T_c$ superconductivity (SC) was recently found in the bilayer material La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La327) under high pressures. We study the bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model derived from the band structure of the La327. The model is solved by cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) with natural orbitals renormalization group (NORG) as impurity solver at zero temperature, considering only normal states. With hole doping, we have observed sequentially the Mott insulator (Mott), pseudogap (PG), non-Fermi liquid (NFL), and Fermi liquid (FL) phases, with quantum correlations decreasing. The ground state of the La327 is in the NFL phase with Hund spin correlation, which transmits the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ ($z$) orbital inter-layer AFM correlation to the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. When the $\sigma$-bonding state of the $z$ orbitals ($z+$) is no longer fully filled, the inter-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations weaken rapidly. At low pressures, the fully filled $z+$ band supports a strong inter-layer AFM correlations, potentially favoring short-range spin density wave (SDW) and suppressing SC. Hole doping at low pressures may achieve a similar effect to high pressures, under which the $z+$ band intersects with the Fermi level, and consequently the spin correlations weaken remarkably, potentially suppressing the possible short-range SDW and favoring SC.</description>

      <title>Normal state quantum geometry and superconducting domes in (111) oxide interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13993v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the influence of the normal state quantum geometry on the superconducting phase in (111) oriented oxide interfaces and discuss some of the implications for the $\text{LaAlO}_3/\text{SrTiO}_3$ (LAO/STO) heterostructure. From a tight-binding modeling of the interface, we derive a two-band low-energy model, allowing us to analytically compute the quantum geometry and giving us access to the superfluid weight, as well as to showcase the role of two particular relevant energy scales. One is given by the trigonal crystal field which stems from the local trigonal symmetry at the interface, and the other one is due to orbital mixing at the interface. Our calculations indicate that the variation of the superfluid weight with the chemical potential $\mu$ is controlled by the quantum geometry in the low-$\mu$ limit where it presents a dome. At higher values of $\mu$ the conventional contribution dominates. In order to make quantitative comparisons between our results and experimental findings, we rely on an experimentally observed global reduction of the superfluid weight that we apply to both the conventional and geometric contributions. Furthermore, an experimentally measured non-monotonic variation of $\mu$ with the gate voltage $V_g$ is taken into account and yields a two-dome scenario for the superconducting critical temperature as a function of $V_g$. The observed dome in the low-$V_g$ regime is explained by the non-monotonic evolution of a dominant conventional part of the superfluid density. In contrast, the expected second dome at larger values of $V_g$ limit would be due to a dominant quantum-geometric contribution.</description>

      <title>Electric field enhancement of the superconducting spin-valve effect via strain-transfer across a ferromagnetic/ferroelectric interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a ferromagnet/superconductor/ferromagnet (F/S/F) superconducting spin-valve (SSV), a change of the magnetization alignment of the two F layers modulates the critical temperature (Tc) of the S layer. The Tc-switching (the SSV effect) is based on the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism. Fast and large resistive switching associated with the Tc-switching is suitable for nonvolatile cryogenic memory applications. However, external magnetic field-based operation of SSVs is hindering their miniaturization, and therefore, electric field control of the SSV effect is desired. Here, we report epitaxial growth of a La0.67Ca0.33MnO3/YBa2Cu3O7/La0.67Ca0.33MnO3 SSV on a piezo-electric [Pb(Mg0.33Nb0.67)O3]0.7-[PbTiO3]0.3 (001) substrate and demonstrate electric field control of the SSV effect. Electric field-induced strain-transfer from the piezo-electric substrate increases the magnetization and Tc of the SSV, and leads to an enhancement of the magnitude of Tc-switching. The results are promising for the development of magnetic-field-free superconducting spintronic devices, in which the S/F interaction is not only sensitive to the magnetization alignment but also to an applied electric field.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric AlBN Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the properties of molecular beam epitaxy deposited AlBN thin films on a recently developed epitaxial nitride metal electrode Nb2N. While a control AlN thin film exhibits standard capacitive behavior, distinct ferroelectric switching is observed in the AlBN films with increasing Boron mole fraction. The measured remnant polarization Pr of 15 uC/cm2 and coercive field Ec of 1.45 MV/cm in these films are smaller than those recently reported on films deposited by sputtering, due to incomplete wake-up, limited by current leakage. Because AlBN preserves the ultrawide energy bandgap of AlN compared to other nitride hi-K dielectrics and ferroelectrics, and it can be epitaxially integrated with GaN and AlN semiconductors, its development will enable several opportunities for unique electronic, photonic, and memory devices.</description>
