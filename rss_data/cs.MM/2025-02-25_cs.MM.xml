      <title>Multi-modal and Metadata Capture Model for Micro Video Popularity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As short videos have become the primary form of content consumption across various industries, accurately predicting their popularity has become key to enhancing user engagement and optimizing business strategies. This report presents a solution for the 2024 INFORMS Data Mining Challenge, focusing on our developed 3M model (Multi-modal and Metadata Capture Model), which is a multi-modal popularity prediction model. The 3M model integrates video, audio, descriptions, and metadata to fully explore the multidimensional information of short videos. We employ a retriever-based method to retrieve relevant instances from a multi-modal memory bank, filtering similar videos based on visual, acoustic, and text-based features for prediction. Additionally, we apply a random masking method combined with a semi-supervised model for incomplete multi-modalities to leverage the metadata of videos. Ultimately, we use a network to synthesize both approaches, significantly improving the accuracy of predictions. Compared to traditional tag-based algorithms, our model outperforms existing methods on the validation set, showing a notable increase in prediction accuracy. Our research not only offers a new perspective on understanding the drivers of short video popularity but also provides valuable data support for identifying market opportunities, optimizing advertising strategies, and enhancing content creation. We believe that the innovative methodology proposed in this report provides practical tools and valuable insights for professionals in the field of short video popularity prediction, helping them effectively address future challenges.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Multimodal Recommender Systems: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acquiring valuable data from the rapidly expanding information on the internet has become a significant concern, and recommender systems have emerged as a widely used and effective tool for helping users discover items of interest. The essence of recommender systems lies in their ability to predict users' ratings or preferences for various items and subsequently recommend the most relevant ones based on historical interaction data and publicly available information. With the advent of diverse multimedia services, including text, images, video, and audio, humans can perceive the world through multiple modalities. Consequently, a recommender system capable of understanding and interpreting different modal data can more effectively refer to individual preferences. Multimodal Recommender Systems (MRS) not only capture implicit interaction information across multiple modalities but also have the potential to uncover hidden relationships between these modalities. The primary objective of this survey is to comprehensively review recent research advancements in MRS and to analyze the models from a technical perspective. Specifically, we aim to summarize the general process and main challenges of MRS from a technical perspective. We then introduce the existing MRS models by categorizing them into four key areas: Feature Extraction, Encoder, Multimodal Fusion, and Loss Function. Finally, we further discuss potential future directions for developing and enhancing MRS. This survey serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners in MRS field, providing insights into the current state of MRS technology and identifying areas for future research. We hope to contribute to developing a more sophisticated and effective multimodal recommender system. To access more details of this paper, we open source a repository: https://github.com/Jinfeng-Xu/Awesome-Multimodal-Recommender-Systems.</description>

      <title>Audio Visual Segmentation Through Text Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) is to localize and segment the sounding source objects from the video frames. Researchers working on AVS suffer from limited datasets because hand-crafted annotation is expensive. Recent works attempt to overcome the challenge of limited data by leveraging the segmentation foundation model, SAM, prompting it with audio to enhance its ability to segment sounding source objects. While this approach alleviates the model's burden on understanding visual modality by utilizing pre-trained knowledge of SAM, it does not address the fundamental challenge of the limited dataset for learning audio-visual relationships. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AV2T-SAM}, a novel framework that bridges audio features with the text embedding space of pre-trained text-prompted SAM. Our method leverages multimodal correspondence learned from rich text-image paired datasets to enhance audio-visual alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a novel feature, $\mathbf{\textit{\textbf{f}}_{CLIP} \odot \textit{\textbf{f}}_{CLAP}}$, which emphasizes shared semantics of audio and visual modalities while filtering irrelevant noise. Experiments on the AVSBench dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both datasets of AVSBench. Our approach outperforms existing methods by effectively utilizing pretrained segmentation models and cross-modal semantic alignment.</description>

      <title>A Split-Window Transformer for Multi-Model Sequence Spammer Detection using Multi-Model Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new Transformer, called MS$^2$Dformer, that can be used as a generalized backbone for multi-modal sequence spammer detection. Spammer detection is a complex multi-modal task, thus the challenges of applying Transformer are two-fold. Firstly, complex multi-modal noisy information about users can interfere with feature mining. Secondly, the long sequence of users' historical behaviors also puts a huge GPU memory pressure on the attention computation. To solve these problems, we first design a user behavior Tokenization algorithm based on the multi-modal variational autoencoder (MVAE). Subsequently, a hierarchical split-window multi-head attention (SW/W-MHA) mechanism is proposed. The split-window strategy transforms the ultra-long sequences hierarchically into a combination of intra-window short-term and inter-window overall attention. Pre-trained on the public datasets, MS$^2$Dformer's performance far exceeds the previous state of the art. The experiments demonstrate MS$^2$Dformer's ability to act as a backbone.</description>

      <title>Audio-FLAN: A Preliminary Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in audio tokenization have significantly enhanced the integration of audio capabilities into large language models (LLMs). However, audio understanding and generation are often treated as distinct tasks, hindering the development of truly unified audio-language models. While instruction tuning has demonstrated remarkable success in improving generalization and zero-shot learning across text and vision, its application to audio remains largely unexplored. A major obstacle is the lack of comprehensive datasets that unify audio understanding and generation. To address this, we introduce Audio-FLAN, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset covering 80 diverse tasks across speech, music, and sound domains, with over 100 million instances. Audio-FLAN lays the foundation for unified audio-language models that can seamlessly handle both understanding (e.g., transcription, comprehension) and generation (e.g., speech, music, sound) tasks across a wide range of audio domains in a zero-shot manner. The Audio-FLAN dataset is available on HuggingFace and GitHub and will be continuously updated.</description>

      <title>Continuous Patch Stitching for Block-wise Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most recently, learned image compression methods have outpaced traditional hand-crafted standard codecs. However, their inference typically requires to input the whole image at the cost of heavy computing resources, especially for high-resolution image compression; otherwise, the block artefact can exist when compressed by blocks within existing learned image compression methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel continuous patch stitching (CPS) framework for block-wise image compression that is able to achieve seamlessly patch stitching and mathematically eliminate block artefact, thus capable of significantly reducing the required computing resources when compressing images. More specifically, the proposed CPS framework is achieved by padding-free operations throughout, with a newly established parallel overlapping stitching strategy to provide a general upper bound for ensuring the continuity. Upon this, we further propose functional residual blocks with even-sized kernels to achieve down-sampling and up-sampling, together with bottleneck residual blocks retaining feature size to increase network depth. Experimental results demonstrate that our CPS framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance against existing baselines, whilst requiring less than half of computing resources of existing models. Our code shall be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Fully Automatic Content-Aware Tiling Pipeline for Pathology Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the use of deep learning (DL) methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced computational pathology, enhancing both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) Whole Slide Images (WSI) plays a crucial role by providing detailed tissue samples for the analysis and training of DL models. However, WSIs often contain regions with artifacts such as tissue folds, blurring, as well as non-tissue regions (background), which can negatively impact DL model performance. These artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant and can lead to inaccurate results. This paper proposes a fully automatic supervised DL pipeline for WSI Quality Assessment (WSI-QA) that uses a fused model combining CNNs and ViTs to detect and exclude WSI regions with artifacts, ensuring that only qualified WSI regions are used to build DL-based computational pathology applications. The proposed pipeline employs a pixel-based segmentation model to classify WSI regions as either qualified or non-qualified based on the presence of artifacts. The proposed model was trained on a large and diverse dataset and validated with internal and external data from various human organs, scanners, and H&amp;E staining procedures. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in WSI artifact detection. The proposed model consistently achieved over 95% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score across all artifact types. Furthermore, the WSI-QA pipeline shows strong generalization across different tissue types and scanning conditions.</description>

      <title>A Survey on 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03890v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (GS) has emerged as a transformative technique in explicit radiance field and computer graphics. This innovative approach, characterized by the use of millions of learnable 3D Gaussians, represents a significant departure from mainstream neural radiance field approaches, which predominantly use implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering algorithm, not only promises real-time rendering capability but also introduces unprecedented levels of editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research. Through this survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for both newcomers and seasoned researchers, fostering further exploration and advancement in explicit radiance field.</description>

      <title>ContextualStory: Consistent Visual Storytelling with Spatially-Enhanced and Storyline Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual storytelling involves generating a sequence of coherent frames from a textual storyline while maintaining consistency in characters and scenes. Existing autoregressive methods, which rely on previous frame-sentence pairs, struggle with high memory usage, slow generation speeds, and limited context integration. To address these issues, we propose ContextualStory, a novel framework designed to generate coherent story frames and extend frames for visual storytelling. ContextualStory utilizes Spatially-Enhanced Temporal Attention to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, handling significant character movements effectively. Additionally, we introduce a Storyline Contextualizer to enrich context in storyline embedding, and a StoryFlow Adapter to measure scene changes between frames for guiding the model. Extensive experiments on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets demonstrate that ContextualStory significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in both story visualization and continuation.

      <description>arXiv:2409.02108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shadows are created when light encounters obstacles, resulting in regions of reduced illumination. In computer vision, detecting, removing, and generating shadows are critical tasks for improving scene understanding, enhancing image quality, ensuring visual consistency in video editing, and optimizing virtual environments. This paper offers a comprehensive survey and evaluation benchmark on shadow detection, removal, and generation in both images and videos, focusing on the deep learning approaches of the past decade. It covers key aspects such as tasks, deep models, datasets, evaluation metrics, and comparative results under consistent experimental settings. Our main contributions include a thorough survey of shadow analysis, the standardization of experimental comparisons, an exploration of the relationships between model size, speed, and performance, a cross-dataset generalization study, the identification of open challenges and future research directions, and the provision of publicly available resources to support further research in this field.</description>

      <title>MLLM can see? Dynamic Correction Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, but the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly generate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize visual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to the strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual information, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel dynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs DeCo, which adaptively selects the appropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and applied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared to baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/DeCo.</description>

      <title>Parallel Backpropagation for Inverse of a Convolution with Application to Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm with running time $O(\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation of the same. Inverse of Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use the Inverse of Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm for optimizing the inverse of convolution layer, resulting in fast training times also. We implement this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models.</description>

      <title>Llasa: Scaling Train-Time and Inference-Time Compute for Llama-based Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-based large language models (LLMs), particularly in the GPT series and the o1 model, have demonstrated the effectiveness of scaling both training-time and inference-time compute. However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis. Second, we propose a simple framework Llasa for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as Llama. Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns. Furthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy. In addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available.</description>
