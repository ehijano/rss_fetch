      <title>Quasi-symmetric nets: a constructive approach to the equimodular elliptic type of Kokotsakis polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates flexible Kokotsakis polyhedra with a quadrangular base of equimodular elliptic type, filling a significant gap in the literature by providing the first explicit constructions of this type together with an explicit algebraic characterization in terms of flat and dihedral angles. A straightforwardly constructible class of polyhedra - called quasi-symmetric nets (QS-nets) - is introduced, characterized by a symmetry relation among flat angles. It is shown that every elliptic QS-net has equimodular elliptic type and is flexible in real three-dimensional Euclidean space (rather than only in complex configuration spaces), except for a few exceptional choices of dihedral angles, and that its flexion admits a closed-form parameterization. Examples are constructed that are non-self-intersecting and belong exclusively to the equimodular elliptic type. To support applications in computational geometry, a numerical pipeline is developed that searches for candidate solutions, verifies them using the explicit algebraic characterization, and constructs and visualizes the resulting polyhedra; numerical validations achieve high precision. Taken together, these results provide constructive criteria, algorithms, and validated examples for the equimodular elliptic type, enabling the design of a broad range of flexible Kokotsakis mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The Squishy Grid Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of approximating Euclidean distances by the infinite integer grid graph. Although the topology of the graph is fixed, we have control over the edge-weight assignment $w:E\to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, and hope to have grid distances be asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, that is, for all grid points $u,v$, $\mathrm{dist}_w(u,v) = (1\pm o(1))\|u-v\|_2$. We give three methods for solving this problem, each attractive in its own way.
  * Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive, non-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid. Distances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean distances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove that the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is $(1+1/\Theta(\log^\xi \log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and $\xi=\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can be improved quantitatively.
  * Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of "highways." It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which converges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach.
  * The first two methods are deterministic. An even simpler approach is to sample the edge weights independently from a common distribution $\mathscr{D}$. Whether there exists a distribution $\mathscr{D}^*$ that makes grid distances Euclidean, asymptotically and in expectation, is major open problem in the theory of first passage percolation. Previous experiments show that when $\mathscr{D}$ is a Fisher distribution, grid distances are within 1\% of Euclidean. We demonstrate experimentally that this level of accuracy can be achieved by a simple 2-point distribution that assigns weights 0.41 or 4.75 with probability 44\% and 56\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>tensorflow-riemopt: A Library for Optimization on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents tensorflow-riemopt, a Python library for geometric machine learning in TensorFlow. The library provides efficient implementations of neural network layers with manifold-constrained parameters, geometric operations on Riemannian manifolds, and stochastic optimization algorithms for non-Euclidean spaces. Designed for integration with TensorFlow Extended, it supports both research prototyping and production deployment of machine learning pipelines.
