      <title>An efficient approach for searching three-body periodic orbits passing through Eulerian configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new efficient approach for searching three-body periodic equal-mass collisionless orbits passing through Eulerian configuration is presented. The approach is based on a symmetry property of the solutions at the half period. Depending on two previously established symmetry types on the shape sphere, each solution is presented by one or two distinct initial conditions (one or two points in the search domain). A numerical search based on Newton's method on a relatively coarse search grid for solutions with relatively small scale-invariant periods $T^{*}&lt;70$ is conducted. The linear systems at each Newton's iteration are computed by high order high precision Taylor series method. The search produced 12,431 initial conditions (i.c.s) corresponding to 6,333 distinct solutions. In addition to passing through the Eulerian configuration, 35 of the solutions are also free-fall ones. Although most of the found solutions are new, all linearly stable solutions among them (only 7) are old ones. Particular attention is paid to the details of the high precision computations and the analysis of accuracy. All i.c.s are given with 100 correct digits.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of a hanging string with a freely pivoting attached mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the natural resonant frequency of a suspended flexible string is significantly modified (by one order of magnitude) by adding a freely pivoting attached mass at its lower end. This articulated system then exhibits complex nonlinear dynamics such as bending oscillations, similar to those of a swing becoming slack, thereby strongly modifying the system resonance that is found to be controlled by the length of the pivoting mass. The dynamics is experimentally studied using a remote and noninvasive magnetic parametric forcing. To do so, a permanent magnet is suspended by a flexible string above a vertically oscillating conductive plate. Harmonic and period-doubling instabilities are experimentally reported and are modeled using the Hill equation, leading to analytical solutions that accurately describe the experimentally observed tonguelike instability curves.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dissipative Euler's equations for a free body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic thermal fluctuations within a real solid challenge the rigid body assumption that is central to Euler's equations for the motion of a free body. Recently, we have introduced a dissipative and stochastic version of Euler's equations in a thermodynamically consistent way (European Journal of Mechanics - A/Solids 103, 105184 (2024)). This framework describes the evolution of both orientation and shape of a free body, incorporating internal thermal fluctuations and their concomitant dissipative mechanisms. In the present work, we demonstrate that, in the absence of angular momentum, the theory predicts that principal axis unit vectors of a body undergo an anisotropic Brownian motion on the unit sphere, with the anisotropy arising from the body's varying moments of inertia. The resulting equilibrium time correlation function of the principal eigenvectors decays exponentially. This theoretical prediction is confirmed in molecular dynamics simulations of small bodies. The comparison of theory and equilibrium MD simulations allow us to measure the orientational diffusion tensor. We then use this information in the Stochastic Dissipative Euler's Equations, to describe a non-equilibrium situation of a body spinning around the unstable intermediate axis. The agreement between theory and simulations is excellent, offering a validation of the theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Mpemba meets Newton: Exploring the Mpemba and Kovacs effects in the time-delayed cooling law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive research, the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying the Mpemba effect, a phenomenon where a substance cools faster after initially being heated, remain elusive. Although historically linked with water, the Mpemba effect manifests across diverse systems, sparking heightened interest in Mpemba-like phenomena. Concurrently, the Kovacs effect, a memory phenomenon observed in materials like polymers, involves rapid quenching and subsequent temperature changes, resulting in nonmonotonic relaxation behavior. This paper probes the intricacies of the Mpemba and Kovacs effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling, recognized as a simplistic yet effective phenomenological model accommodating memory phenomena. This law allows for a nuanced comprehension of temperature variations, introducing a time delay ($\tau$) and incorporating specific protocols for the thermal bath temperature, contingent on a defined waiting time ($t_{\text{w}}$). Remarkably, the relevant parameter space is two-dimensional ($\tau$ and $t_{\text{w}}$), with bath temperatures exerting no influence on the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect or the relative strength of the Kovacs effect. The findings enhance our understanding of these memory phenomena, providing valuable insights applicable to researchers across diverse fields, ranging from physics to materials science.</description>
