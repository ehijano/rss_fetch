      <title>The NeurIPS 2023 Machine Learning for Audio Workshop: Affective Audio Benchmarks and Novel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NeurIPS 2023 Machine Learning for Audio Workshop brings together machine learning (ML) experts from various audio domains. There are several valuable audio-driven ML tasks, from speech emotion recognition to audio event detection, but the community is sparse compared to other ML areas, e.g., computer vision or natural language processing. A major limitation with audio is the available data; with audio being a time-dependent modality, high-quality data collection is time-consuming and costly, making it challenging for academic groups to apply their often state-of-the-art strategies to a larger, more generalizable dataset. In this short white paper, to encourage researchers with limited access to large-datasets, the organizers first outline several open-source datasets that are available to the community, and for the duration of the workshop are making several propriety datasets available. Namely, three vocal datasets, Hume-Prosody, Hume-VocalBurst, an acted emotional speech dataset Modulate-Sonata, and an in-game streamer dataset Modulate-Stream. We outline the current baselines on these datasets but encourage researchers from across audio to utilize them outside of the initial baseline tasks.</description>

      <title>emoDARTS: Joint Optimisation of CNN &amp; Sequential Neural Network Architectures for Superior Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial for enabling computers to understand the emotions conveyed in human communication. With recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL), the performance of SER models has significantly improved. However, designing an optimal DL architecture requires specialised knowledge and experimental assessments. Fortunately, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides a potential solution for automatically determining the best DL model. The Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a particularly efficient method for discovering optimal models. This study presents emoDARTS, a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and Sequential Neural Network (SeqNN: LSTM, RNN) architecture that enhances SER performance. The literature supports the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to improve performance.
  While DARTS has previously been used to choose CNN and LSTM operations independently, our technique adds a novel mechanism for selecting CNN and SeqNN operations in conjunction using DARTS. Unlike earlier work, we do not impose limits on the layer order of the CNN. Instead, we let DARTS choose the best layer order inside the DARTS cell. We demonstrate that emoDARTS outperforms conventionally designed CNN-LSTM models and surpasses the best-reported SER results achieved through DARTS on CNN-LSTM by evaluating our approach on the IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, and MSP-Podcast datasets.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Robustness of Spectral Clustering for Deep Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering speaker embeddings is crucial in speaker diarization but hasn't received as much focus as other components. Moreover, the robustness of speaker diarization across various datasets hasn't been explored when the development and evaluation data are from different domains. To bridge this gap, this study thoroughly examines spectral clustering for both same-domain and cross-domain speaker diarization. Our extensive experiments on two widely used corpora, AMI and DIHARD, reveal the performance trend of speaker diarization in the presence of domain mismatch. We observe that the performance difference between two different domain conditions can be attributed to the role of spectral clustering. In particular, keeping other modules unchanged, we show that differences in optimal tuning parameters as well as speaker count estimation originates due to the mismatch. This study opens several future directions for speaker diarization research.</description>

      <title>Exploring Green AI for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors leveraging deep neural networks exhibit impressive recognition performance. Nonetheless, this advantage is accompanied by a significant carbon footprint. This is mainly due to the use of high-performance computing with accelerators and high training time. Studies show that average deep NLP model produces around 626k lbs of CO\textsubscript{2} which is equivalent to five times of average US car emission at its lifetime. This is certainly a massive threat to the environment. To tackle this challenge, this study presents a novel framework for audio deepfake detection that can be seamlessly trained using standard CPU resources. Our proposed framework utilizes off-the-shelve self-supervised learning (SSL) based models which are pre-trained and available in public repositories. In contrast to existing methods that fine-tune SSL models and employ additional deep neural networks for downstream tasks, we exploit classical machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and shallow neural networks using the SSL embeddings extracted using the pre-trained model. Our approach shows competitive results compared to the commonly used high-carbon footprint approaches. In experiments with the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset, we achieve a 0.90\% equal error rate (EER) with less than 1k trainable model parameters. To encourage further research in this direction and support reproducible results, the Python code will be made publicly accessible following acceptance.

      <title>XLAVS-R: Cross-Lingual Audio-Visual Speech Representation Learning for Noise-Robust Speech Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech recognition and translation systems perform poorly on noisy inputs, which are frequent in realistic environments. Augmenting these systems with visual signals has the potential to improve robustness to noise. However, audio-visual (AV) data is only available in limited amounts and for fewer languages than audio-only resources. To address this gap, we present XLAVS-R, a cross-lingual audio-visual speech representation model for noise-robust speech recognition and translation in over 100 languages. It is designed to maximize the benefits of limited multilingual AV pre-training data, by building on top of audio-only multilingual pre-training and simplifying existing pre-training schemes. Extensive evaluation on the MuAViC benchmark shows the strength of XLAVS-R on downstream audio-visual speech recognition and translation tasks, where it outperforms the previous state of the art by up to 18.5% WER and 4.7 BLEU given noisy AV inputs, and enables strong zero-shot audio-visual ability with audio-only fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>AdaProj: Adaptively Scaled Angular Margin Subspace Projections for Anomalous Sound Detection with Auxiliary Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art approach for semi-supervised anomalous sound detection is to first learn an embedding space by using auxiliary classification tasks based on meta information or self-supervised learning and then estimate the distribution of normal data. In this work, AdaProj a novel loss function is presented. In contrast to commonly used angular margin losses, which project data of each class as close as possible to their corresponding class centers, AdaProj learns to project data onto class-specific subspaces. By doing so, the resulting distributions of embeddings belonging to normal data are not required to be as restrictive as other loss functions allowing a more detailed view on the data. In experiments conducted on the DCASE2022 and DCASE2023 datasets, it is shown that using AdaProj to learn an embedding space significantly outperforms other commonly used loss functions and results in a state-of-the-art performance on the DCASE2023 dataset.</description>

      <title>Speech-Aware Neural Diarization with Encoder-Decoder Attractor Guided by Attention Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-End Neural Diarization with Encoder-Decoder based Attractor (EEND-EDA) is an end-to-end neural model for automatic speaker segmentation and labeling. It achieves the capability to handle flexible number of speakers by estimating the number of attractors. EEND-EDA, however, struggles to accurately capture local speaker dynamics. This work proposes an auxiliary loss that aims to guide the Transformer encoders at the lower layer of EEND-EDA model to enhance the effect of self-attention modules using speaker activity information. The results evaluated on public dataset Mini LibriSpeech, demonstrates the effectiveness of the work, reducing Diarization Error Rate from 30.95% to 28.17%. We will release the source code on GitHub to allow further research and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>RTFS-Net: Recurrent Time-Frequency Modelling for Efficient Audio-Visual Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17189v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation methods aim to integrate different modalities to generate high-quality separated speech, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as speech recognition. Most existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models operate in the time domain. However, their overly simplistic approach to modeling acoustic features often necessitates larger and more computationally intensive models in order to achieve SOTA performance. In this paper, we present a novel time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method: Recurrent Time-Frequency Separation Network (RTFS-Net), which applies its algorithms on the complex time-frequency bins yielded by the Short-Time Fourier Transform. We model and capture the time and frequency dimensions of the audio independently using a multi-layered RNN along each dimension. Furthermore, we introduce a unique attention-based fusion technique for the efficient integration of audio and visual information, and a new mask separation approach that takes advantage of the intrinsic spectral nature of the acoustic features for a clearer separation. RTFS-Net outperforms the prior SOTA method in both inference speed and separation quality while reducing the number of parameters by 90% and MACs by 83%. This is the first time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method to outperform all contemporary time-domain counterparts.</description>

      <title>Unimodal Multi-Task Fusion for Emotional Mimicry Prediciton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a methodology for the Emotional Mimicry Intensity (EMI) Estimation task within the context of the 6th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild. Our approach leverages the Wav2Vec 2.0 framework, pre-trained on a comprehensive podcast dataset, to extract a broad range of audio features encompassing both linguistic and paralinguistic elements. We enhance feature representation through a fusion technique that integrates individual features with a global mean vector, introducing global contextual insights into our analysis. Additionally, we incorporate a pre-trained valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) module from the Wav2Vec 2.0 model. Our fusion employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for efficient temporal analysis of audio data. Utilizing only the provided audio data, our approach demonstrates significant improvements over the established baseline.</description>

      <title>Gammatonegram Representation for End-to-End Dysarthric Speech Processing Tasks: Speech Recognition, Speaker Identification, and Intelligibility Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dysarthria is a disability that causes a disturbance in the human speech system and reduces the quality and intelligibility of a person's speech. Because of this effect, the normal speech processing systems can not work properly on impaired speech. This disability is usually associated with physical disabilities. Therefore, designing a system that can perform some tasks by receiving voice commands in the smart home can be a significant achievement. In this work, we introduce gammatonegram as an effective method to represent audio files with discriminative details, which is used as input for the convolutional neural network. On the other word, we convert each speech file into an image and propose image recognition system to classify speech in different scenarios. Proposed CNN is based on the transfer learning method on the pre-trained Alexnet. In this research, the efficiency of the proposed system for speech recognition, speaker identification, and intelligibility assessment is evaluated. According to the results on the UA dataset, the proposed speech recognition system achieved 91.29% accuracy in speaker-dependent mode, the speaker identification system acquired 87.74% accuracy in text-dependent mode, and the intelligibility assessment system achieved 96.47% accuracy in two-class mode. Finally, we propose a multi-network speech recognition system that works fully automatically. This system is located in a cascade arrangement with the two-class intelligibility assessment system, and the output of this system activates each one of the speech recognition networks. This architecture achieves an accuracy of 92.3% WRR. The source code of this paper is available.</description>

      <title>RoDia: A New Dataset for Romanian Dialect Identification from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RoDia, the first dataset for Romanian dialect identification from speech. The RoDia dataset includes a varied compilation of speech samples from five distinct regions of Romania, covering both urban and rural environments, totaling 2 hours of manually annotated speech data. Along with our dataset, we introduce a set of competitive models to be used as baselines for future research. The top scoring model achieves a macro F1 score of 59.83% and a micro F1 score of 62.08%, indicating that the task is challenging. We thus believe that RoDia is a valuable resource that will stimulate research aiming to address the challenges of Romanian dialect identification. We release our dataset at https://github.com/codrut2/RoDia.</description>
