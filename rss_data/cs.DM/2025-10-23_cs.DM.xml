      <title>The vertex visibility number of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $x\in V(G)$, then $S\subseteq V(G)\setminus\{x\}$ is an $x$-visibility set if for any $y\in S$ there exists a shortest $x,y$-path avoiding $S$. The $x$-visibility number $v_x(G)$ is the maximum cardinality of an $x$-visibility set, and the maximum value of $v_x(G)$ among all vertices $x$ of $G$ is the vertex visibility number ${\rm vv}(G)$ of $G$. It is proved that ${\rm vv}(G)$ is equal to the largest possible number of leaves of a shortest-path tree of $G$. Deciding whether $v_x(G) \ge k$ holds for given $G$, a vertex $x\in V(G)$, and a positive integer $k$ is NP-complete even for graphs of diameter $2$. Several general sharp lower and upper bounds on the vertex visibility number are proved. The vertex visibility number of Cartesian products is also bounded from below and above, and the exact value of the vertex visibility number is determined for square grids, square prisms, and square toruses.</description>

      <title>Recommend-to-Match with Random Supply Rejections: Formulation, Approximation, and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching demand with supply in crowd-sourcing logistics platforms must contend with uncertain worker participation. Motivated by this challenge, we study a two-stage ``recommend-to-match" problem under stochastic supplier rejections, where each demand is initially recommended to multiple potential suppliers prior to final matching decisions. We formulate a stochastic optimization model that explicitly captures uncertain supplier acceptance behavior. We show that an exact mixed-integer linear formulation is obtainable for the special case with homogeneous and independent acceptance responses, but the general problem does not admit an efficient formulation. Particularly, our analysis reveals that deterministic linear approximation methods can perform arbitrarily poorly in such settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approximation approach based on mixed-integer exponential cone programming (MIECP) and establish its parametric performance guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world freight data validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our MIECP-based solution achieves near-optimal matching performance while reducing computation time by over 90% compared to benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Supermodular Maximization with Cardinality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite set of $n$ elements, $f: 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ be a nonnegative monotone supermodular function, and $k$ be a positive integer no greater than $n$. This paper addresses the problem of maximizing $f(S)$ over all subsets $S \subseteq V$ subject to the cardinality constraint $|S| = k$ or $|S|\le k$.
  Let $r$ be a constant integer. The function $f$ is assumed to be {\em $r$-decomposable}, meaning there exist $m\,(\ge1)$ subsets $V_1, \dots, V_m$ of $V$, each with a cardinality at most $r$, and a corresponding set of nonnegative supermodular functions $f_i : 2^{V_i} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, $i=1,\ldots,m$ such that $f(S) =\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(S \cap V_i)$ holds for each $S \subseteq V$. Given $r$ as an input, we present a polynomial-time $O(n^{(r-1)/2})$-approximation algorithm for this maximization problem, which does not require prior knowledge of the specific decomposition.
  When the decomposition $(V_i,f_i)_{i=1}^m$ is known, an additional connectivity requirement is introduced to the problem. Let $G$ be the graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $\cup_{i=1}^m \{uv:u,v\in V_i,u\neq v\}$. The cardinality constrained solution set $S$ is required to induce a connected subgraph in $G$. This model generalizes the well-known problem of finding the densest connected $k$-subgraph. We propose a polynomial time $O(n^{(r-1)/2})$-approximation algorithm for this generalization. Notably, this algorithm gives an $O(n^{1/2})$-approximation for the densest connected $k$-subgraph problem, improving upon the previous best-known approximation ratio of $O(n^{2/3})$.</description>

      <title>String graphs are quasi-isometric to planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every countable string graph $S$, there is a planar graph $G$ with $V(G)=V(S)$ such that \[ \frac{1}{23660800}d_S(u,v) \le d_G(u,v) \le 162 d_S(u,v) \] for all $u,v\in V(S)$, where $d_S(u,v)$, $d_G(u,v)$ denotes the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $S$ and $G$ respectively. In other words, string graphs are quasi-isometric to planar graphs.
  This theorem lifts a number of theorems from planar graphs to string graphs, we give some examples. String graphs have Assouad-Nagata (and asymptotic dimension) at most 2. Connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive string graphs are accessible. A finitely generated group $\Gamma$ is virtually a free product of free and surface groups if and only if $\Gamma$ is quasi-isometric to a string graph.
  Two further corollaries are that countable planar metric graphs and complete Riemannian planes are also quasi-isometric to planar graphs, which answers a question of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu. For finite string graphs and planar metric graphs, our proofs yield polynomial time (for string graphs, this is in terms of the size of a representation given in the input) algorithms for generating such quasi-isometric planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Burling graphs in graphs with large chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph class is $\chi$-bounded if the only way to force large chromatic number in graphs from the class is by forming a large clique. In the 1970s, Erd\H{o}s conjectured that intersection graphs of straight-line segments in the plane are $\chi$-bounded, but this was disproved by Pawlik et al. (2014), who showed another way to force large chromatic number in this class -- by triangle-free graphs $B_k$ with $\chi(B_k)=k$ constructed by Burling (1965). This also disproved the celebrated conjecture of Scott (1997) that classes of graphs excluding induced subdivisions of a fixed graph are $\chi$-bounded.
  We prove that in broad classes of graphs excluding induced subdivisions of a fixed graph, including the increasingly more general classes of segment intersection graphs, string graphs, region intersection graphs, and hereditary classes of graphs with finite asymptotic dimension, large chromatic number can be forced only by large cliques or large graphs $B_k$.
  One corollary is that the hereditary closure of $\{B_k\colon k\geq 1\}$ forms a minimal hereditary graph class with unbounded chromatic number -- the second known graph class with this property after the class of complete graphs. Another corollary is that the decision variant of approximate coloring in the aforementioned graph classes can be solved in polynomial time by exhaustively searching for a sufficiently large clique or copy of $B_k$. We also discuss how our results along with some results of Chudnovsky, Scott, and Seymour on the existence of colorings can be turned into polynomial-time algorithms for the search variant of approximate coloring in string graphs (with intersection model in the input) and other aforementioned graph classes. Such an algorithm has not yet been known for any graph class that is not $\chi$-bounded.</description>

      <title>The maximal hard-core model as a recoverable system: Gibbs measures and phase coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recoverable systems provide coarse models of data storage on the two-dimensional square lattice, where each site reconstructs its value from neighboring sites according to a specified local rule. To study the typical behavior of recoverable patterns, this work introduces an interaction potential on the local recovery regions of the lattice, which defines a corresponding interaction model. We establish uniqueness of the Gibbs measure at high temperature and derive bounds on the entropy in the zero- and low-temperature regimes.
  For the recovery rule under consideration, exactly recoverable configurations coincide with maximal independent sets of the grid. Relying on methods developed for the standard hard-core model, we show phase coexistence at high activity in the maximal case. Unlike the standard hard-core model, however, the maximal version admits nontrivial ground states even at low activity, and we manage to classify them explicitly. We further verify the Peierls condition for the associated contour model. Combined with the Pirogov-Sinai theory, this shows that each ground state gives rise to an extremal Gibbs measure, proving phase coexistence at low activity.</description>

      <title>Recognizing Leaf Powers and Pairwise Compatibility Graphs is NP-Complete</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leaf powers and pairwise compatibility graphs were introduced over twenty years ago as simplified graph models for phylogenetic trees. Despite significant research, several properties of these graph classes remain poorly understood. In this paper, we establish that the recognition problem for both classes is NP-complete. We extend this hardness result to a broader hierarchy of graph classes, including pairwise compatibility graphs and their generalizations, multi interval pairwise compatibility graphs.</description>

      <title>Families of tractable problems with respect to vertex-interval-membership width and its generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are graphs whose edges are labelled with times at which they are active. Their time-sensitivity provides a useful model of real networks, but renders many problems studied on temporal graphs more computationally complex than their static counterparts. To contend with this, there has been recent work devising parameters for which temporal problems become tractable. One such parameter is vertex-interval-membership (VIM) width. Broadly, this gives a bound on the number of vertices we need to keep track of at any given time to solve many problems. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a new parameter, tree-interval-membership (TIM) width, that generalises both VIM width and several existing generalisations. Secondly, we provide meta-algorithms for both VIM and TIM width which can be used to prove fixed-parameter-tractability for large families of problems, bypassing the need to give involved dynamic programming arguments for every problem. In doing this, we provide a characterisation of problems in FPT with respect to both parameters. We apply these algorithms to temporal versions of Hamiltonian path, dominating set, matching, and edge deletion to limit maximum reachability.</description>

      <title>An unconditional lower bound for the active-set method in convex quadratic maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the active-set method needs an exponential number of iterations in the worst-case to maximize a convex quadratic function subject to linear constraints, regardless of the pivot rule used. This substantially improves over the best previously known lower bound [IPCO 2025], which needs objective functions of polynomial degrees $\omega(\log d)$ in dimension $d$, to a bound using a convex polynomial of degree 2. In particular, our result firmly resolves the open question [IPCO 2025] of whether a constant degree suffices, and it represents significant progress towards linear objectives, where the active-set method coincides with the simplex method and a lower bound for all pivot rules would constitute a major breakthrough.
  Our result is based on a novel extended formulation, recursively constructed using deformed products. Its key feature is that it projects onto a polygonal approximation of a parabola while preserving all of its exponentially many vertices. We define a quadratic objective that forces the active-set method to follow the parabolic boundary of this projection, without allowing any shortcuts along chords corresponding to edges of its full-dimensional preimage.</description>

      <title>Hitting all longest paths in $H$-free graphs and $H$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \textit{longest path transversal number} of a connected graph $G$, denoted by $lpt(G)$, is the minimum size of a set of vertices of $G$ that intersects all longest paths in $G$. We present constant upper bounds for the longest path transversal number of \textit{hereditary classes of graphs}, that is, classes of graphs closed under taking induced subgraphs. Our first main result is a structural theorem that allows us to \textit{refine} a given longest path transversal in a graph using domination properties. This has several consequences: First, it implies that for every $t \in \{5,6\}$, every connected $P_t$-free graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq t-2$. Second, it shows that every $(\textit{bull}, \textit{chair})$-free graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq 5$. Third, it implies that for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, every connected chordal graph $G$ with no induced subgraph isomorphic to $K_t \mat \overline{K_t}$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq t-1$, where $K_t \mat \overline{K_t}$ is the graph obtained from a $t$-clique and an independent set of size $t$ by adding a perfect matching between them. Our second main result provides an upper bound for the longest path transversal number in \textit{$H$-intersection graphs}. For a given graph $H$, a graph $G$ is called an \textit{$H$-graph} if there exists a subdivision $H'$ of $H$ such that $G$ is the intersection graph of a family of vertex subsets of $H'$ that each induce connected subgraphs. The concept of $H$-graphs, introduced by Bir\'o, Hujter, and Tuza, naturally captures interval graphs, circular-arc graphs, and chordal graphs, among others. Our result shows that for every connected graph $H$ with at least two vertices, there exists an integer $k = k(H)$ such that every connected $H$-graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq k$.</description>
