      <title>Ultraviolet Renormalization of Spin Boson Models I. Normal and 2-Nilpotent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ultraviolet problem for models of a finite-dimensional quantum mechanical system linearly coupled to a bosonic quantum field, such as the (many-)spin boson model or its rotating-wave approximation. If the state change of the system upon emission or absorption of a boson is either given by a normal matrix or by a 2-nilpotent one, which is the case for the previously named examples, we prove an optimal renormalization result. We complement it, by proving the norm resolvent convergence of appropriately regularized models to the renormalized one. Our method consists of a dressing transformation argument in the normal case and an appropriate interior boundary condition for the 2-nilpotent case.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ Theory from many-body quantum Gibbs states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on the torus as a rigorous limit of the quantum Gibbs state of an interacting Bose gas, where the limiting classical measure describes the critical behavior of the Bose gas just above the Bose--Einstein phase transition. Since the quantum problem is typically formulated using a nonlocal interaction potential, a key challenge is to approximate the local $\Phi^4_3$ theory by a Hartree measure with a nonlocal interaction. This requires uniform estimates on the Hartree measure, which are achieved using techniques from recent development on stochastic quantization and paracontrolled calculus from \cite{GIP15}. The connection to the quantum problem is then established by applying the variational approach in \cite{LewNamRou-21}, where using a recent correlation inequality from \cite{DeuNamNap-25} we refine the analysis and derive a quantitative convergence of the quantum correlation functions to those of the Hartree classical field.</description>

      <title>Functorial Einstein Algebras and the Malicious Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein algebra, the concept due to Geroch, is essentially general relativity in an algebraic disguise. We introduce the concept of Einstein-Grassmann algebra as a superalgebra (defining a supermanifold) which is also an Einstein algebra. We employ this concept to confront the supermanifold structure with the structure of strong singularity, the so-called malicious singularity, in general relativity. Einstein-Grassmann algebras consist of two parts: a part called body and a part called soul. For the body part, the singularity theorems apply and the singularities persist as the conclusions of the classical theorems on the existence of singularities require. We prove that, if we relax algebraical requirements, the soul part of the algebra can survive the malicious singularity. In particular, we study the behaviour of supercurves in the presence of malicious singularity.</description>

      <title>Scaling of highly excited Schr\"odinger-Poisson eigenstates and universality of their rotation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a comprehensive numerical characterization of the excited spherically symmetric stationary states of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson problem. The analysis is conducted with reference to dark matter distributions around galaxies; the squared modulus of the eigenfunction represents the dark matter density distribution, and an associated eigenvelocity models the experimental galactic rotation curves. This paper aims to establish a connection between the fundamental structure of these eigenfunctions and eigenvelocities and the physical properties of the system.
  Through numerical simulations of highly excited eigenstates, novel heuristic laws are proposed, which describe how their fundamental features scale with the excitation index $n$. Key characteristics of the eigenfunctions include: the effective support, which exhibits a parabolic dependence on the excitation index; the distances between adjacent nodes, whose pattern varies regularly with $n$; and the oscillation amplitude, which follows a power law with an exponent approaching $-1$ for large $n$, consistent with astrophysical observations. The eigenvelocities exhibit a mid-range oscillatory region with an average linear trend, whose slope approaches zero in the large $n$ limit, consistent with the physical expectation of a flat plateau for the rotation curves. Additionally, we derive heuristic scaling relationships with the excitation index $n$, revealing a universal behavior in the predicted rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Lie algebras with compatible scalar products for non-homogeneous Hamiltonian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study from an algebraic and geometric viewpoint Hamiltonian operators which are sum of a non-degenerate first-order homogeneous operator and a Poisson tensor. In flat coordinates, also known as Darboux coordinates, these operators are uniquely determined by a triple composed by a Lie algebra, its most general non-degenerate quadratic Casimir and a 2-cocycle. We present some classes of operators associated to Lie algebras with non-degenerate quadratic Casimirs and we give a description of such operators in low dimensions. Finally, motivated by the example of the KdV equation we discuss the conditions of bi-Hamiltonianity of such operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global invertible symmetries act unitarily on local observables or states of a quantum system. In this note, we aim to generalise this statement to non-invertible symmetries by considering unitary actions of higher fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ on twisted sector local operators. We propose that the latter transform in $\ast$-representations of the tube algebra associated to $\mathcal{C}$, which we introduce and classify using the notion of higher $S$-matrices of higher braided fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Out-of-distribution generalisation for learning quantum channels with low-energy coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When experimentally learning the action of a continuous variable quantum process by probing it with inputs, there will often be some restriction on the input states used. One experimentally simple way to probe the channel is using low-energy coherent states. Learning a quantum channel in this way presents difficulties, due to the fact that two channels may act similarly on low energy inputs but very differently for high energy inputs. They may also act similarly on coherent state inputs but differently on non-classical inputs. Extrapolating the behaviour of a channel for more general input states from its action on the far more limited set of low energy coherent states is a case of out-of-distribution generalisation. To be sure that such generalisation gives meaningful results, one needs to relate error bounds for the training set to bounds that are valid for all inputs. We show that for any pair of channels that act sufficiently similarly on low energy coherent state inputs, one can bound how different the input-output relations are for any (high energy or highly non-classical) input. This proves out-of-distribution generalisation is always possible for learning quantum channels using low energy coherent states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstates of central spin models in which the central spin is unentangled with the environment are known as dark states. They have recently been observed in a class of integrable XX models. Here we find that dark states are present in XY models, but only for particular configurations of the central spin magnetic field. We show this via an explicit construction of the Bethe states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel modification of the original Enskog equation is proposed. The modification is much simpler than that is made in the modified (or revised) Enskog equation proposed by van Beijeren \&amp; Ernst in 1973 and does not require a consideration of many-body configuration. The proposed modification is general enough to be adapted to various equations of states for non-ideal gases. It is shown that the H-theorem can be established for the Enskog and the Enskog--Vlasov equation with the proposed modification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant primitives of Eisenstein series for principal congruence subgroups and show that they are precisely the corresponding non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. We present closed formulas that naturally generalise existing results for the full modular group. We also focus on Eisenstein series of weight two in the case where the modular curve has genus zero. We show that in those cases the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight two can be written as single-valued logarithms whose argument is a rational function of the Hauptmodul.</description>

      <title>The detailed balance property and chemical systems out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detailed balance property is a fundamental property that must be satisfied in all the macroscopic systems with a well defined temperature at each point. On the other hand, many biochemical networks work in non-equilibrium conditions and they can be effectively modelled using sets of equations in which the detailed balance condition fails. In this paper we study a class of "out of equilibrium" chemical networks that can be obtained freezing the concentration of some substances in chemical networks for which the detailed balance property holds. In particular, we prove that any chemical system with bidirectional chemical reactions can be extended to a system having additional substances and for which the detailed balance property holds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we construct non-trivial weak solutions $(v, \theta)$ to the inviscid Euler-Boussinesq system in two spatial dimensions. These solutions exhibit compact temporal support, thereby violating the conservation of the temperature's $L^p$-norm. Furthermore, the pair $(v, \theta)$ resides in the H\"older space $C^\gamma(\mathbb R \times \mathbb T^2) \times C^\gamma (\mathbb R \times \mathbb T^2)$ for any exponent $\gamma&lt;1/3$. The methodology integrates a Nash iteration scheme with a linear decoupling technique to achieve these results.</description>

      <title>Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In particular, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a Pfaffian of a matrix based on qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that links the amplitudes of systems with different qubit counts, enabling scalable calculations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for applications in global entanglement, Shannon-R\'enyi entropy, formation probabilities, and quantum tomography, significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Black Strings and String Clouds Embedded in Anisotropic Quintessence: Solutions for Scalar Particles and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spacetime metric associated with a black string surrounded by a cloud of strings and an anisotropic fluid of quintessence in cylindrically symmetric AdS spacetime. We solve Einstein's equation to obtain the explicit form of the metric, investigate typical values for its parameters, and determine their role in the event horizon formation. Within our findings, we show that the intensity of the cloud of strings regulates the size of the event horizon and, when the cloud is absent, the horizon increases drastically for larger values of the quintessence's state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$. Additionally, the metric shows that, unless $\alpha_{Q}$ is close to its lower bound, the contribution from the quintessence fluid is only significant at large distances from the black string. Finally, to explore the quantum implications of this dark energy candidate, we use the confluent Heun function to solve the Klein-Gordon equation for a spin-0 particle near the event horizon. Our results indicate that the presence of quintessence alters the particle's radial wave function. This modification, in principle, could give rise to an observable that we termed as \enquote{dark phase}.</description>

      <title>Optimal multi-time-scale estimates for diluted autocatalytic chemical networks. (1) Introduction and $\sigma^*$-dominant case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autocatalytic chemical networks are dynamical systems whose linearization around zero has a positive Lyapunov exponent; this exponent gives the growth rate of the system in the diluted regime, i.e. for near-zero concentrations. The generator of the dynamics in the kinetic limit is then a Perron-Frobenius matrix, suggesting the use of Markov chain techniques to get long-time asymptotics. This series of works introduces a new, general procedure providing precise quantitative information about such asymptotics, based on estimates for the Lyapunov eigenvalue and eigenvector. The algorithm, inspired from Wilson's renormalization group method in quantum field theory, is based on a downward recursion on kinetic scales, starting from the fastest, and terminating with the slowest rates. Estimates take on the form of simple rational functions of kinetic rates. They are accurate under a separation of scales hypothesis, loosely stating that kinetic rates span many orders of magnitude. We provide here a brief general motivation and introduction to the method, present some simple examples, and derive a number of preliminary results, in particular the estimation of Lyapunov data for a subclass of so-called $\sigma^*$-dominant graphs.</description>

      <title>On coefficients of operator product expansions for quantum field theories with ordinary, holomorphic, and topological spacetime dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many quantum field theories (such as higher-dimensional holomorphic field theories or raviolo theories), operator product expansions of local operators can have as coefficients not only ordinary functions but also 'derived' functions with nonzero ghost number, which are certain elements of sheaf cohomology. We analyse the 'derived' functions that should appear in operator product expansions for a quantum field theory with an arbitrary number of topological, holomorphic and/or ordinary spacetime dimensions and identify necessary and sufficient conditions for such 'derived' functions to appear. In particular, theories with one topological spacetime dimension and multiple ordinary spacetime dimensions provide a smooth analogue of the (holomorphic) raviolo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kramers escape from a metastable state in the presence of both thermal and quantum fluctuations under strong damping is treated as a thermally activated process in a quantum modified semiclassical potential. Dirac's time-dependent variational method together with the Jackiw-Kerman function is employed to derive the semiclassical potential.</description>

      <title>De Sitter quantum gravity within the covariant Lorentzian approach to asymptotic safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent technical and conceptual advancements in the asymptotic safety approach to quantum gravity have enabled studies of the UV completion of Lorentzian Einstein gravity, emphasizing the role of the state dependence. We present here the first complete investigation of the flow equations of the Einstein-Hilbert action within a cosmological spacetime, namely de Sitter spacetime. Using the newly derived graviton propagator for general gauges and masses in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze the dependence on the gauge and on finite renormalization parameters. Our results provide evidence of a UV fixed point for the most commonly used gauges.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Lieb's Simplified approach to the Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a book about Lieb's Simplified approach to the Bose gas, which is a family of effective single-particle equations to study the ground state of many-body systems of interacting Bosons. It was introduced by Lieb in 1963, and recently found to have some rather intriguing properties. One of the equations of the approach, called the Simple equation, has been proved to make a prediction for the ground state energy that is asymptotically accurate both in the low- and the high-density regimes. Its predictions for the condensate fraction, two-point correlation function, and momentum distribution also agree with those of Bogolyubov theory at low density, despite the fact that it is based on ideas that are very different from those of Bogolyubov theory. In addition, another equation of the approach called the Big equation has been found to yield numerically accurate results for these observables over the entire range of densities for certain interaction potentials.
  This book is an introduction to Lieb's Simplified approach, and little background knowledge is assumed. We begin with a discussion of Bose gases and quantum statistical mechanics, and the notion of Bose-Einstein condensation, which is one of the main motivations for the approach. We then move on to an abridged bibliographical overview on known theorems and conjectures about Bose gases in the thermodynamic limit. Next, we introduce Lieb's Simplified approach, and its derivation from the many-body problem. We then give an overview of results, both analytical and numerical, on the predictions of the approach. We then conclude with a list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of a Schr\"odinger equation in dimension one with a nonlinear point interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09674v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an effective equation for the dynamics of many identical bosons in dimension one in the presence of a tiny impurity. The interaction between every pair of bosons is mediated by the impurity through a positive three-body potential. Assuming a simultaneous mean-field and short-range scaling with the short-range proceeding slower than the mean-field, and choosing an initial fully condensed state, we prove propagation of chaos and obtain an effective one-particle Schr\"odinger equation with a defocusing nonlinearity concentrated at a point. More precisely, we prove the convergence of one-particle density operators in the trace-class topology and estimate the fluctuations as superexponential. This is the first derivation of the so-called nonlinear delta model, widely investigated in the last decades, as a phenomenological model for several physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>The open XYZ spin 1/2 chain: Separation of Variables and scalar products for boundary fields related by a constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the open XYZ spin chain with boundary fields. We solve the model by the new Separation of Variables approach introduced in arXiv:1904.00852. In this framework, the transfer matrix eigenstates are obtained as a particular sub-class of the class of so-called separate states. We consider the problem of computing scalar products of such separate states. As usual, they can be represented as determinants with rows labelled by the inhomogeneity parameters of the model. We notably focus on the special case in which the boundary parameters parametrising the two boundary fields satisfy one constraint, hence enabling for the description of part of the transfer matrix spectrum and eigenstates in terms of some elliptic polynomial Q-solution of a usual TQ-equation. In this case, we show how to transform the aforementioned determinant for the scalar product into some more convenient form for the consideration of the homogeneous and thermodynamic limits: as in the open XXX or XXZ cases, our result can be expressed as some generalisation of the so-called Slavnov determinant.</description>

      <title>General solution to Euler-Poisson equations of a free symmetric body by direct summation of power series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euler-Poisson equations describe the temporal evolution of a rigid body's orientation through the rotation matrix and angular velocity components, governed by first-order differential equations. According to the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem, these equations can be solved by expressing their solutions as power series in the evolution parameter. In this work, we derive the sum of these series for the case of a free symmetric rigid body. By using the integrals of motion and directly summing the terms of these series, we obtain the general solution to the Euler-Poisson equations for a free symmetric body in terms of elementary functions. This method circumvents the need for standard parametrizations like Euler angles, allowing for a direct, closed-form solution. The results are consistent with previous studies, offering a new perspective on solving the Euler-Poisson equations.</description>

      <title>Twisted Bilayer Graphene in Commensurate Angles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ``magic angles" in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has spurred extensive research into its electronic properties. The primary tool for studying this thus far has been the famous Bistritzer-MacDonald model (BM model), which relies on several approximations. This work aims to build the first steps in studying magic angles without using this model. Thus, we study a 2d model for TBG in both AA and AB stacking \emph{without} the approximations of the BM model in the continuum setting, using two copies of a potential with the symmetries of graphene, either sharing a common origin (in AA stacking) or with shifted origins (in AB stacking), and twisted with respect to each other. Our results hold for a wide class of potentials in both stacking types. We describe the angles for which the two twisted lattices are commensurate and prove the existence of Dirac cones in the vertices of the Brillouin zone for such angles. Furthermore, we show that for small potentials, the slope of the Dirac cones is small for commensurate angles that are close to incommensurate angles. This work is the first to establish the existence of Dirac cones for twisted bilayer graphene (for either stacking) in the continuum setting without relying on the BM model. This work is the first in a series of works to build a more fundamental understanding of the phenomenon of magic angles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geodesics on the manifold of mixed quantum states for the Bures metric. It is shown that these geodesics correspond to physical non-Markovian evolutions of the system coupled to an ancilla. Furthermore, we argue that geodesics lead to optimal precision in single-parameter estimation in quantum metrology. More precisely, if the unknown parameter $x$ is a phase shift proportional to the time parametrizing the geodesic, the estimation error obtained by processing the data of measurements on the system is equal to the smallest error that can be achieved from joint detections on the system and ancilla, meaning that the ancilla does not carry any information on this parameter. This error can saturate the Heisenberg bound. Reciprocally, assuming that the system-ancilla output and input states are related by a unitary $e^{-i x H}$ with $H$ a $x$-independent Hamiltonian, we show that if the error obtained from measurements on the system is equal to the minimal error obtained from joint measurements on the system and ancilla then the system evolution is given by a geodesic. In such a case, the measurement on the system bringing most information on $x$ is $x$-independent and can be determined in terms of the intersections of the geodesic with the boundary of quantum states. These results show that geodesic evolutions are of interest for high-precision detections in systems coupled to an ancilla in the absence of measurements on the ancilla.</description>

      <title>Magic Resource Can Enhance the Quantum Capacity of Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of magic resource in the quantum capacity of channels. We consider the quantum channel of the recently proposed discrete beam splitter with the fixed environmental state. We find that if the fixed environmental state is a stabilizer state, then the quantum capacity is zero. Moreover, we find that the quantum capacity is nonzero for some magic states, and the quantum capacity increases linearly with respect to the number of single-qudit magic states in the environment. We also bound the maximal quantum capacity of the discrete beam splitter in terms of the amount of magic resource in the environmental states. These results suggest that magic resource can increase the quantum capacity of channels; it sheds new insight into the role of stabilizer and magic states in quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the behavior of quantum entropy under quantum convolution and its application in quantifying magic. We first establish an entropic, quantum central limit theorem (q-CLT), where the rate of convergence is bounded by the magic gap. We also introduce a new quantum divergence based on quantum convolution, called the quantum Ruzsa divergence, to study the stabilizer structure of quantum states. We conjecture a ``convolutional strong subadditivity'' inequality, which leads to the triangle inequality for the quantum Ruzsa divergence. In addition, we propose two new magic measures, the quantum Ruzsa divergence of magic and quantum-doubling constant, to quantify the amount of magic in quantum states. Finally, by using the quantum convolution, we extend the classical, inverse sumset theory to the quantum case. These results shed new insight into the study of the stabilizer and magic states in quantum information theory.</description>

Abstract: We show the non-compactness of moduli space of solutions of the monopole equations for $3/2$-spinors on a closed 3-manifold is equivalent to the existence of `3/2-Fueter sections' that are solutions of an overdetermined non-linear elliptic differential equation. These are sections of a fiber bundle whose fiber is a special 4-dimensional submanifold of the hyperk\"ahler manifold of center-framed charged one $SU(2)$-instantons on $\mathbf{R}^4$. This fiber bundle does not inherit a hyperk\"ahler structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: von Neumann algebras have been playing an increasingly important role in the context of gauge theories and gravity. The crossed product presents a natural method for implementing constraints through the commutation theorem, rendering it a useful tool for constructing gauge invariant algebras. The crossed product of a Type III algebra with its modular automorphism group is semifinite, which means that the crossed product regulates divergences in local quantum field theories. In this letter, we find a sufficient condition for the semifiniteness of the crossed product of a type III algebra with any locally compact group containing the modular automorphism group. Our condition surprisingly implies the centrality of the modular flow in the symmetry group, and we provide evidence for the necessity of this condition. Under these conditions, we construct an associated trace which computes physical expectation values. We comment on the importance of this result and and its implications for subregion physics in gauge theory and gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use conformal geometry methods and the construction of Friedrich's cylinder at spatial infinity to study the propagation of spin-$0$ fields (solutions to the wave equation) on $n$-dimensional Minkowski spacetimes in a neighbourhood of spatial and null infinity. We obtain formal solutions written in terms of series expansions close to spatial and null infinity and use them to compute non-trivial asymptotic spin-$0$ charges. It is shown that if one considers the most general initial data within the class considered in this paper, the expansion is poly-homogeneous and hence of restricted regularity at null infinity. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the initial data needed to obtain regular solutions and well-defined limits for the asymptotic charges at the critical sets where null infinity and spatial infinity meet. In even dimensions, we find that there are infinitely many well-defined asymptotic charges at the critical sets, while for odd higher dimensions there exists no non-trivial asymptotic charges that remain regular at the critical sets.</description>

Abstract: We study a percolation model with restrictions on the opening of sites on the square lattice. In this model, each site $s \in \mathbb{Z}^{2}$ starts closed and an attempt to open it occurs at time $t=t_s$, where $(t_s)_{s \in \mathbb{Z}^2}$ is a sequence of independent random variables uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$. The site will open if the volume difference between the two largest clusters adjacent to it is greater than or equal to a constant $r$ or if it has at most one adjacent cluster. Through numerical analysis, we determine the critical threshold $t_c(r)$ for various values of $r$, verifying that $t_c(r)$ is non-decreasing in $r$ and that there exists a critical value $r_c=5$ beyond which percolation does not occur. Additionally, we find that the correlation length exponent of this model is equal to that of the ordinary percolation model. For $t = 1$ and $1 \leq r \leq 9$, we estimate the averages of the density of open sites, the number of distinct cluster volumes, and the volume of the largest cluster.</description>

      <title>Stationary Distribution of open Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes on an Interval as a marginal of a two-layer ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on an interval with open boundaries. We provide a representation for its stationary distribution as a marginal of the top layer of a two-layer ensemble under Liggett's condition. The representation is valid in the fan region and in the shock region, extending the representation previously obtained in [Bryc-Zatitskii-2024 arXiv:2403.03275] to ASEP. We also give a recursion for the two-layer weight function.</description>

      <title>Edge spectra of Gaussian random symmetric matrices with correlated entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the largest eigenvalue of a Gaussian random symmetric matrix $X_n$, with zero-mean, unit variance entries satisfying the condition $\sup_{(i, j) \ne (i', j')}|\mathbb{E}[X_{ij} X_{i'j'}]| = O(n^{-(1 + \varepsilon)})$, where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. It follows from Catalano et al. (2024) that the empirical spectral distribution of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges weakly almost surely to the standard semi-circle law. Using a F\"{u}redi-Koml\'{o}s-type high moment analysis, we show that the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} X_n)$ of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges almost surely to $2$. This result is essentially optimal in the sense that one cannot take $\varepsilon = 0$ and still obtain an almost sure limit of $2$. We also derive Gaussian fluctuation results for the largest eigenvalue in the case where the entries have a common non-zero mean. Let $Y_n = X_n + \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}}\mathbf{1} \mathbf{1}^\top$. When $\varepsilon \ge 1$ and $\lambda \gg n^{1/4}$, we show that \[
  n^{1/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sqrt{2} Z, \] where $Z$ is a standard Gaussian. On the other hand, when $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$, we have $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j}X_{ij}) = O(n^{1 - \varepsilon})$. Assuming that $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j} X_{ij}) = \sigma^2 n^{1 - \varepsilon} (1 + o(1))$, if $\lambda \gg n^{\varepsilon/4}$, then we have \[
  n^{\varepsilon/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sigma Z. \] While the ranges of $\lambda$ in these fluctuation results are certainly not optimal, a striking aspect is that different scalings are required in the two regimes $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$ and $\varepsilon \ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Constructing Multipartite Planar Maximally Entangled States from Phase States and Quantum Secret Sharing Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the construction of Planar Maximally Entangled (PME) states from phase states. PME states form a class of $n$-partite states in which any subset of adjacent particles whose size is less than or equal to half the total number of particles is in a fully entangled state. This property is essential to ensuring the robustness and stability of PME states in various quantum information applications. We introduce phase states for a set of so-called noninteracting $n$ particles and describe their corresponding separable density matrices. These phase states, although individually separable, serve as a starting point for the generation of entangled states when subjected to unitary dynamics. Using this method, we suggest a way to make complex multi-qubit states by watching how unconnected phase states change over time with a certain unitary interaction operator. In addition, we show how to derive PME states from these intricate phase states for two-, three-, four-, and K-qubit systems. This construction method for PME states represents a significant advance over absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states, as it provides a more accessible and versatile resource for quantum information processing. Not only does it enable the creation of a broader class of multipartite entangled states, overcoming the limitations of AME states, notably their restricted availability in low-dimensional systems; for example, the absence of a four-qubit AME state, but it also offers a systematic construction method for any even number of qudits, paving the way for practical applications in key quantum technologies such as teleportation, secret sharing and error correction, where multipartite entanglement plays a central role in protocol efficiency.</description>

      <title>Conditional symmetries and conditional constants of motion for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional symmetries were introduced by Levi and Winternitz in their 1989 seminal paper to deal with nonlinear PDEs. Here we discuss their application in the framework of ODEs, and more specifically Dynamical Systems; it turns out they are closely related to two established -- albeit maybe less widely known -- concepts, i.e. orbital symmetries and configurational invariants. The paper is devoted to studying the interplay of these notions, and their application in the study of Dynamical Systems, with special attention to invariant manifolds of these.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a natural class of extensions of the Anderson model on $\mathbb Z^d$, called random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSOs), which feature a random block potential. They are defined on the $d$-dimensional lattice $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ and take the form $H=V + \lambda \Psi$, where $V$ is a diagonal block matrix with diagonal blocks that are i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ GUE, $\Psi$ describes the interactions between neighboring blocks, and $0&lt;\lambda\ll 1$ is a small coupling parameter (making $H$ a perturbation of $V$). We focus on three specific RBSOs: (1) the block Anderson model, where $\Psi$ is the Laplacian operator on $\mathbb Z^d$; (2) the Anderson orbital model, where $\Psi$ is a block Laplacian operator; (3) the Wegner orbital model, where the nearest-neighbor blocks of $\Psi$ are random matrices. Assuming $d\ge 7$ and $W\ge L^\varepsilon$ for a small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, under certain lower bound on $\lambda$, we prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for the bulk eigenvectors, as well as a quantum diffusion estimate for the Green's function. Together with the localization result established in arXiv:1608.02922, our results rigorously demonstrate the existence of an Anderson localization-delocalization transition for RBSOs as $\lambda$ varies. Our proof is based on the $T$-expansion method and the concept of self-energy renormalization developed for random band matrices in arXiv:2104.12048. Additionally, we explore a conceptually new idea called coupling renormalization. This phenomenon extends the self-energy renormalization and is prevalent in quantum field theory, yet it is identified here for the first time within the context of random Schr\"odinger operators. We anticipate that our techniques can be adapted to real or non-Gaussian block potentials and more general interactions $\Psi$.</description>

      <title>Representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation in terms of Neumann series of Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation is obtained. The solutions are represented as Neumann series of Bessel functions. The representations are shown to be uniformly convergent with respect to the spectral parameter. Explicit formulas for the coefficients are obtained via a system of recursive integrals. The result is based on the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of the transmutation kernel. An efficient numerical method for solving initial-value and spectral problems based on this approach is presented with a numerical example. The method can compute large sets of eigendata with non-deteriorating accuracy.</description>
