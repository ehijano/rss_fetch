      <title>Investigating the origin of the Milky Way streams. A revised look at their orbital pole distribution in light of precession effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams around the Milky Way (MW) can provide valuable insights into its history and substructure formation. Previous studies have suggested that several MW streams could have an origin related to that of the disc of satellite galaxies (DoS) and the young halo globular clusters of the MW, given that many of these structures present a similar orbital pole orientation. In this work we test the validity of this hypothesis by revising the orbital pole distribution of the MW streams with the latest stream dataset (galstreams). For a sample of 91 streams at Galactocentric distances of $d&lt;100$ kpc we find that the pole distribution has no preferred orbital direction. However, as we subtract the streams closer to the Galactic centre, by imposing several lower distance cuts, we find that the larger the Galactocentric distance of the streams, the higher the fraction of stream poles pointing in a direction similar to the DoS. This trend could be explained if the stream pole distribution were originally anisotropic, but precession effects displaced the orbital poles of the streams closer to the Galactic centre. From the pole distribution and the estimated precession rates of the streams in the sample, we infer that the streams nearer the Galactic centre are indeed quite likely to be affected by precession. Finally, we corroborate with hydrodynamical simulations that, even in a scenario in which the MW substructures had a common origin, an overdensity in their orbital pole direction cannot be appreciated until the selected sample also includes material at $d \gtrsim 150$ kpc.</description>

      <title>A long time ago in an LAE far, far away: a signpost of early reionization or a nascent AGN at $z=13$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JADES survey recently reported the discovery of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA at $z = 13$, the highest redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) ever observed. This observation suggests that either the intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is highly ionized, or the galaxy's intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ emission properties are extreme. We use radiative transfer simulations of reionization that capture the distribution of ionized gas in the $z = 13$ IGM to investigate the implications of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA for reionization. We find that if JADES-GS-z13-1-LA is a typical star forming galaxy (SFG) with properties characteristic of LAEs at $z \sim 6$, its detection suggests that the universe is $\gtrsim 5\%$ ionized by $z = 13$. We also investigate the possibility that the extreme properties of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA are driven by an AGN. Using a simple analysis based on the fact that AGN are expected to produce more ionizing photons than SFGs, we estimate that the likelihood that JADES-GS-z13-1-LA hosts an AGN is $88\%$, $66\%$, and $33\%$ if the IGM is $&lt; 1\%$, $\approx 5\%$ and $\approx 25\%$ ionized, respectively. We also highlight other features in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA that may be indicative of AGN activity, including strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption extending to $\sim 1300$ angstroms, and a possible CII*$\lambda1335$ emission line. Our findings strongly motivate dedicated follow-up observations of JADES-GS-z13-1-LA to determine whether it hosts an AGN.</description>

      <title>Strength in Numbers: Red Galaxies Bolster the Cosmic Star Formation Rate Density at z &gt; 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive account of the cosmic star-formation history demands an accurate census of dust-enshrouded star formation over cosmic time. We provide strong new constraints from a large sample of 777 red galaxies, selected based on their dust-reddened, rest-frame UV-optical emission. This sample of 777 galaxies spans $1 &lt; z &lt; 8$ and is selected from PRIMER JWST NIRCam and HST COSMOS optical data, ensuring robust colour criteria. The SEDs indicate that these dust-reddened galaxies are star-forming, with median $\mathrm{SFR \sim 40M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) = 10.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$; each exceeds the corresponding medians of the full JWST-detected population by over two dex. Our sample thus clearly shows that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end: they comprise 72 \% of galaxies with $\log(M/M_{\odot}) &gt; 10$ at $z = 3.3$, rising to 91\% by $z \sim 7$ (albeit with large uncertainties at the highest redshifts). Crucially, we find that the number density of massive red star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 6$ is sufficient to explain the abundance of quiescent galaxies at $z &gt; 3$, consistent with typical quenching timescales allowed in the $\mathrm{\sim 1Gyr}$ interval from $z \sim 6$ to $z \sim 3$. This large abundance yields a substantial contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density: at $z \sim 4$, red galaxies provide $\mathrm {\rho_{SFR} = 3.9^{+0.6}_{-0.5} \times 10^{-2} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}Mpc^{-3}}$, and at $z \sim 5$ they supply nearly 40 \% of the total $\rho_{SFR}$. This exceeds the contribution of bright sub(mm)-selected dusty star-forming galaxies by more than an order of magnitude. Future deeper and wider ALMA surveys will provide further opportunities to strengthen and extend our results in our quest to fully quantify the contribution of dust-obscured activity to $\rho_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Excavating The Ruins: an Ancient $z=2.675$ Galaxy Which Formed in the First 500 Myr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of an ancient galaxy at $z=2.675$ which we dub ``Eridu.'' Simultaneously modeling the JWST/NIRSpec G140M and G235M spectra from the SMILES program and $0.4-25\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ HST, JWST/NIRCam, and JWST/MIRI photometry from the the JADES+SMILES photometric catalogs shows that Eridu is massive and quiescent with stellar mass $\log(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})=10.96^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ and average star formation rate $&lt;1\ \mathrm{M_\odot\ yr^{-1}}$ over the last 100 Myr. Star formation histories inferred from various models produce disconcertingly early and fast formation within $\sim300$ Myr of the Big Bang and quenching 2 Gyr prior to observation ($z\sim10$). This stellar mass assembly implies that the progenitor of Eridu had $M_*\approx10^{11}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z&gt;10$, nearly two orders of magnitude more than the most massive current high redshift observations. From Eridu's spectrum we infer $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} =+0.65^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$, indicating its stellar population is extremely $\alpha$-enhanced, which is consistent with the rapid formation timescale inferred from its star formation history. Eridu inhabits a massive protostructure which offers additional explanations for rapid mass assembly and quenching via environmental mechanisms, e.g. major mergers. Though its inferred formation is at odds with observations of the brightest cosmic dawn galaxies, we anticipate that future high-redshift galaxy formation models and sophisticated stellar population modeling codes will unearth how Eridu formed at the dawn of time.</description>

      <title>Data-driven dust inference at mid-to-high Galactic latitudes using probabilistic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for accurately and precisely inferring photometric dust extinction towards stars at mid-to-high Galactic latitudes using probabilistic machine learning to model the colour-magnitude distribution of zero-extinction stars in these regions. Photometric dust maps rely on a robust method for inferring stellar reddening. At high Galactic latitudes, where extinction is low, such inferences are particularly susceptible to contamination from modelling errors and prior assumptions, potentially introducing artificial structure into dust maps. In this work, we demonstrate the use of normalising flows to learn the conditional probability distribution of the photometric colour-magnitude relations of zero-extinction stars, conditioned on Galactic cylindrical coordinates for stars within 2.5 kpc at mid-to-high Galactic latitudes. By using the normalising flow to model the colour-magnitude diagram, we infer the posterior distribution of dust extinction towards stars along different lines of sight by marginalising over the flow. We validate our method using data from Gaia, Pan-STARRS, and 2MASS, showing that we recover unbiased posteriors and successfully detect dust along the line of sight in two calibration regions at mid-Galactic latitude that have been extensively studied in the context of polarisation surveys.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Binding and Star Formation in Molecular Clouds of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational binding and star-forming properties of molecular clouds (MCs) in the Milky Way (MW) are estimated from CO cloud observations and from a model of pressure-bounded virial equilibrium (PVE). Two CO surveys are analyzed with the standard CO conversion factor. The main results are: (1) For each survey the cloud virial parameter $\alpha_{vir}$ increases by a factor ~2 from galactocentric radius $R_{gal}$ = 4 kpc to 15 kpc. (2) PVE models match these trends only if the surface densities of survey clouds and nearby stars are comparable. This evidence of environmental influence resembles that seen in other disk galaxies. (3) Many survey clouds form stars even though their virial parameter exceeds the critical value $\alpha_{vir}\approx2$. In PVE such clouds with constant velocity dispersion have stable equilibrium and cannot form stars by simple global collapse. (4) However, simulations show that $\alpha_{vir}\approx2$ clouds with dissipating turbulence may form filaments, cores and protostars with little global contraction. Such clouds can match the MW star formation rate if their protostellar cores have mass fraction ~10$^{-3}$. A simple model predicts that the star-forming age of a cloud is proportional to the ratio of its YSOs to its mass. (5) Clouds within ~500 pc of the Sun are predicted to have star-forming ages 1-10 Myr and average YSO age ~2 Myr, matching evolutionary models. The Orion A cloud is predicted to have ~60 Class 0 protostars, ~2900 YSOs and efficiency $SFE\approx0.02$, in good agreement with observed estimates.</description>

      <title>Evolution of magnetized hub-filament systems: Comparing the observed properties of W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine three cluster-forming hub-filament systems (HFS) - W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106 - spanning evolutionary stages from early to advanced, with a focus on their magnetic field (B-field) structures and filament line-mass distributions. Our goal is to identify indicators of HFS evolution, particularly within their hubs, as star formation progresses. Our analysis combines observations of dense star-forming gas and young stellar populations. We present new JCMT/POL-2 observations of 850micron dust polarized emission to probe magnetic field morphology and dense gas structures. Archival infrared and radio data are also used to trace star formation activity. We derive radial column density profiles centered on the hubs to define distinct filament and hub regions. We then analyze histograms of line mass, polarization intensity (PI), polarization fraction (PF), and the relative orientation between B-fields and filaments.
  As HFS evolve, we observe changes in the filament line-mass function (FLMF), PF, and B-field-filament alignment - especially within the hub, which also increases in size. Massive bipolar outflows and radiation bubbles reshape the plane-of-sky B-fields, aligning them with cavity walls and shells, consistent with known rearrangements near HII regions. We also find a notable similarity between hub sizes and young cluster radii. "Double-node" star formation - where two subregions within a hub show different evolutionary stages - emerges as a common HFS feature. We present evidence for its widespread occurrence across several well-studied, nearby star-forming clouds.</description>

      <title>AllBRICQS: The Discovery of Luminous Quasars in the Northern Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the second catalog of bright quasars from the All-sky BRIght, Complete Quasar Survey (AllBRICQS), focusing on spectroscopically observed quasars in the Northern Hemisphere with Galactic latitude $|b| &gt; 10^\circ$. This catalog includes their spectral data, redshifts, and luminosities. AllBRICQS aims to identify the last remaining optically bright quasars using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Gaia all-sky survey Data Release 3 (DR3). AllBRICQS searches for quasars that are brighter than $B_P = 16.5$ or $R_P = 16$ mag in Gaia DR3, based on simple selection criteria. Here, we report 62 new AllBRICQS quasars spanning various types, which include typical broad emission line quasars and the most luminous iron low-ionization broad absorption line quasars discovered to date. Spectroscopic observations were conducted using the Long-Slit Spectrograph on the 1.8-meter telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, YFOSC on the 2.4-meter telescope at Lijiang Observatory, and BFOSC on the 2.16-meter telescope at Xinglong Observatory. We applied flux calibration using ZTF broadband photometry to correct for attenuation due to intermittent thin clouds during the observations. Redshifts were determined using inverse-variance weighted cross-correlation methods. Our targets span the bolometric luminosity range of $44.9&lt;\log \left( L_{\rm bol} / {\rm erg~s^{-1}} \right)&lt;48.0$ at redshifts between 0.09 and 2.48. These confirmed AllBRICQS quasars provide a valuable resource for future research into quasar evolution, black holes, their environments, and their host galaxies across multiple wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Radio continuum and \HI 21-cm line observations of a nearby luminous infrared galaxy IRAS 17526+3253</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from our EVN and GMRT observations of the radio continuum and spectral line emission in IRAS 17526+3253, along with an analysis of its arcsecond-scale radio properties using archival VLA data. The EVN observations detected radio continuum emission from both the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE) nuclei. The NW nucleus shows two components with high brightness temperatures and radio luminosities, likely indicating the presence of an AGN core and jet. Meanwhile, our EVN observation failed to detect the OH line emission, possibly due to radio frequency interference and/or the emission being partly resolved out and below our detection limit. The multi-band radio spectral energy distribution (SED) deviates from a single power-law at low frequencies, suggesting low-frequency absorption. The GMRT spectral line data reveal both \HI absorption and emission. The \HI emission is diffuse and shows a velocity gradient from about 7500 \kms in the NW to 7800 \kms in the SE nucleus. On larger scales, the \HI emission extends about 4' along the NW-SE direction, with the southeastern extension matching the optical tidal tail. In addition, the weak \HI absorption features show broad line profiles, possibly due to overlapping \HI gas from the two nuclei. The aforementioned results are consistent with properties of intermediate-stage mergers reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Low-velocity large-scale shocks in the infrared dark cloud G035.39-00.33: bubble-driven cloud-cloud collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-velocity large-scale shocks impacting on the ISM may efficiently shape molecular clouds and trigger star formation within them. These shocks, both driven by galactic bubbles and/or cloud-cloud collisions, leave specific signatures in the gas morphology and kinematics. Observational studies of such signatures are crucial to investigate if and how shocks affect the clouds formation process and trigger their future star formation. We have analysed the shocked and dense gas tracers SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) emission toward the IRDC G035.39-00.33, using new, larger-scale maps obtained with the 30m telescope at the Instituto de Radioastronom\`ia Millim\'etrica. We find that the dense gas is organised into a northern and a southern filament having different velocities and tilted orientation with respect to each other. The two filaments are spatially separated yet connected by a faint bridge feature also seen in a position-velocity diagram extracted across the cloud. This bridge-feature, typical of cloud-cloud collisions, also coincides with a very spectrally narrow SiO-traced emission. The northern filament is suggested to be interacting with the nearby supernova remnant G035.6-0.4. Toward the southern filament, we also report the presence of a parsec-scale, spectrally narrow SiO emission likely driven by the interaction between this filament and a nearby expanding shell. The shell is visible in the 1.3 GHz and 610 MHz continuum images and our preliminary analysis suggests it may be the relic of a supernova remnant. We conclude that the two filaments represent the densest part of two colliding clouds, pushed toward each other by nearby Supernova Remnants. We speculate that this cloud-cloud collision driven by stellar feedback may have assembled the infrared dark cloud. We also evaluate the possibility that star formation may have been triggered within G035.39-00.33 by the collision.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Gas Dynamics of Henize 2-10: Possible Drivers of the Starburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triggers of starburst episodes are a key component to our understanding of the baryon cycle in galaxies. Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested catalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single kinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to assess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to dominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such dwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which appears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst episode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy itself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA 21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the dynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an HI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995), which was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these new observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI appears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a tidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of some type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of available results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the starburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could be falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.</description>

      <title>The Consequences of Rubin Observatory Time-Domain Survey Design and Host-Galaxy Contamination on the Identification of Binary Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are consequences of galaxy mergers and dominate the low-frequency gravitational wave background. Finding binary SMBHs in existing time-domain observations has proven difficult, as their periodic, electromagnetic signals can be confused with the natural variability of single quasars. In this work, we investigate the effects of host-galaxy contamination and survey design (cadence and duration) on the detectability of binary SMBHs with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We simulate millions of LSST light curves of single and binary quasars, with a distribution of quasar and host-galaxy properties motivated by empirical observations and the anticipated LSST detection space. We then apply simple sinusoidal curve fits as a potential, computationally inexpensive detection method. We find that host-galaxy contamination will increase false-positive rates and decrease binary parameter recovery rates. Lower mass, lower luminosity binary systems are most likely to be negatively affected by host galaxy contamination. We also find that monitoring duration affects binary detection more than survey effective cadence for this detection method. As the light curve duration increases, false-positive rates are suppressed and binary parameter recovery rates, especially for binary period, are improved. Increasing the light curve duration from 5 to 10 yrs shows the most dramatic improvement for successful binary detection and false-positive rejection, with additional improvement from extending the light curve duration to 20 yrs. The observation duration increase is especially critical for recovering binary periods that are longer than a decade.</description>

      <title>A Targeted Gamma-Ray Search of Five Prominent Galaxy Merger Systems with 17 years of Fermi-LAT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena, driving intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114 using 16.8 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain $\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16, $\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$ and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission. The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $&lt; 5$). This is the first targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger systems.</description>

      <title>Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess morphology of dark matter in simulations of the Milky Way galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strongest experimental evidence for dark matter is the Galactic Center gamma-ray excess observed by the Fermi telescope and even predicted prior to discovery as a potential dark matter signature via WIMP dark matter self-annihilations. However, an equally compelling explanation of the excess gamma-ray flux appeals to a population of old millisecond pulsars that also accounts for the observed boxy morphology inferred from the bulge old star population. We employ a set of Milky Way-like galaxies found in the Hestia constrained simulations of the local universe to explore the rich morphology of the central dark matter distribution, motivated by the GAIA discovery of a vigorous early merging history of the Milky Way galaxy. We predict a significantly non-spherical gamma-ray morphology from the WIMP interpretation. Future experiments, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array, that extend to higher energies, should distinguish between the competing interpretations.</description>

      <title>Misty, patchy, and turbulent: constraining the cool circumgalactic medium with mCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the largest baryon reservoir around galaxies, but its extent, mass, and temperature distribution remain uncertain. We propose that cool gas ($\sim 10^4$ K) in the CGM resides in clumpy structures referred to as cloud complexes (CCs) rather than uniformly filling the entire CGM volume. Each CC contains a mist of tiny cool cloudlets dispersed in a warm/hot medium ($\sim 10^5$ - $10^6$~K). Modeling CCs in the mist limit (unit area covering fraction within a CC) simplifies the calculation of observables like ion absorption columns, equivalent widths, compared to modeling individual cloudlets from first principles. Through Monte Carlo realizations of CCs, we explore how CC properties affect the observed variation in observables. We find that a power-law distribution of CCs ($dN_{\rm CC}/dR \propto R^{-1}$) with a total of $\sim 10^3$ CCs each with a radius of $\sim 10$ kpc and total cool gas mass of $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$ reproduces MgII column density and equivalent width distribution trends with impact parameter for the COS-Halos sample (Werk+ 2013). We further show that the area-averaged MgII column density, combined with the area covering fraction, provides a robust proxy for estimating the cool CGM mass, independent of other model parameters. Modeling a larger number of (smaller size) cloudlets within a CC shows that line blending from individual cloudlets results in turbulent broadening on the CC scale. This work presents a practical framework for linking CGM models with observations of a multiphase CGM, illuminating the distribution of cool gas in galaxy halos.</description>

      <title>Absolute Calibration of Cluster Mira Variables to Provide a New Anchor for the Hubble Constant Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mira variables in globular clusters can provide an accurate and precise absolute calibration of their period-luminosity relations (PLRs) to independently anchor the cosmic distance scale and determine the Hubble constant. We present homogeneous near-infrared ($JHK_s$) time-series photometric observations of a sample of 55 candidate long-period variables in 18 globular clusters covering a wide metallicity range ($-1.7 &lt; \textrm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -0.1$ dex). The Gaia proper motions, long-period variability information, and optical-infrared colors are used to identify 41 oxygen-rich Miras as members of the globular clusters. Mean luminosities of Miras in the $JHK_s$ bands are independently calibrated using the recommended distances and mean parallaxes to their host clusters. Cluster Mira PLRs exhibit scatter comparable to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) variables and do not show any dependence on iron abundance for a wide range of metallicities. We establish the accuracy of cluster Miras as independent anchors by determining a distance modulus to the LMC, $18.45 \pm 0.04$ mag, in agreement with the 1.2\% precise geometric distance. Our $H$-band photometry is transformed to derive Hubble Space Telescope F160W PLR for cluster Miras providing a three-anchor baseline with the LMC and NGC 4258. We employ three-anchor solution to determine distances to two type Ia supernovae host galaxies, NGC 1559 ($31.39\pm0.05$ mag) and M101 ($29.07\pm0.04$ mag), and provide a $3.7\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 73.06\pm 2.67$ km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Similar to Cepheids, our independent baseline solution results in a local $H_0$ determination that is systematically larger than its inference from the early universe probes, further supporting the ongoing Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>A Galactic Self-Portrait: Density Structure and Integrated Properties of the Milky Way Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution history of the Milky Way disk is imprinted in the ages, positions, and chemical compositions of individual stars. In this study, we derive the intrinsic density distribution of different stellar populations using the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. A total of 203,197 red giant branch stars are used to sort the stellar disk ($R \leq 20$ kpc) into sub-populations of metallicity ($\Delta$[M/H]$= 0.1$ dex), age ($\Delta \log(\frac{\textrm{age}}{\textrm{yr}})= 0.1$), and $\alpha$-element abundances ([$\alpha$/M]). We fit the present-day structural parameters and density distribution of each stellar sub-population after correcting for the survey selection function. The low-$\alpha$ disk is characterized by longer scale lengths and shorter scale heights, and is best fit by a broken exponential radial profile for each population. The high-$\alpha$ disk is characterized by shorter scale lengths and larger scale heights, and is generally well-approximated by a single exponential radial profile. These results are applied to produce new estimates of the integrated properties of the Milky Way from early times to the present day. We measure the total stellar mass of the disk to be $5.27^{+0.2}_{-1.5} \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and the average mass-weighted scale length is $R_{d} = 2.37 \pm 0.2$ kpc. The Milky Way's present-day color of $(g-r) = 0.72 \pm 0.02$ is consistent with the classification of a red spiral galaxy, although it has only been in the "green valley" region of the galaxy color-mass diagram for the last $\sim 3$ Gyr.</description>

      <title>Metallicity of Active Galactic Nuclei from ultraviolet and optical emission lines-II. Revisiting the $C43$ metallicity calibration and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a new semi-empirical calibration is proposed between ultraviolet emission lines (\ion{C}{iii}]$\lambda1909$, \ion{C}{iv}$\lambda1549$, \ion{He}{ii}]$\lambda1640$) of type~2 AGNs and their metallicity ($Z$). This calibration is derived by comparing a large sample of 106 objects (data taken from the literature) located over a wide range of redshifts ($0 \: \lesssim \: z \: \lesssim \: 4.0$) with predictions from photoionization models that adopt a recent C/O-O/H relation derived via estimates using the $T_{\rm e}$ method, which is considered the most reliable method. We found that the new calibration produces $Z$ values in agreement (within an uncertainty of $\pm 0.1$ dex) with those from other calibrations and from estimates via the $T_{\rm e}$-method. We find also that AGN metallicities are already high at early epochs, with no evidence for monotonic evolution across the redshift range $0 \: \lesssim \: z \: \lesssim \: 12$. Notably, the highest metallicities in our sample, reaching up to $\rm 4\: Z_{\odot}$, are found in objects at $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$. This redshift range coincides with the peak of the cosmic star formation rate history, suggesting a strong connection between the major epoch of star formation, black hole growth, and rapid metal enrichment in the host galaxies of AGNs. Furthermore, our analysis reveals no significant correlation between AGN metallicity and radio properties (radio spectral index or radio luminosity) or host galaxy stellar mass. The lack of a clear mass-metallicity relation, consistent with findings for local AGNs, suggests that the chemical evolution of the nuclear gas is decoupled from the global properties of the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Proper Motion of Strongly Lensed Binary Neutron Star Mergers in LIGO/Virgo/Kagra can be Constrained by Measuring Doppler Induced Gravitational Wave Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed binary neutron star (NS-NS) mergers are expected to be observed once LIGO/Virgo/Kagra reaches the planned A+ or proposed A\# sensitivity. We demonstrate that the relative transverse velocity of the source-lens system can be constrained by comparing the phase of the two associated gravitational wave (GW) images, using both semi-analytical and numerical Bayesian methods. For A+ sensitivity, a one-sigma NS-NS merger signal in magnification $(\mu=200)$ and redshift $(z_{\rm S}=1)$ will carry a marginally detectable dephasing signature for a source transverse velocity of $\sim 1800$ km/s. This is comparable to the velocity dispersion of large galaxy clusters. Assuming the same population distribution, the most likely source parameters of $\mu=100$ and $z_{\rm S}=1.4$ are always expected to showcase detectable dephasing imprints for A\# sensitivity, provided they are moving with transverse velocities larger than $\sim 2000$ km/s. We conclude that a first measurement of the relative transverse velocity of a source via GW dephasing methods is likely only a few years away.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts for the Enhanced Large Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects in stellar mass gravitational wave sources I: Expected fraction of signals with significant dephasing in the dynamical and AGN channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first overview of the expected quantity of signals which will showcase significant gravitational wave phase shifts caused by astrophysical environments, considering the upcoming A+ and A\# LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. We construct and analyse two general families of dephasing prescriptions with extensions to eccentric sources, as well as collect five specific prescriptions for the fundamental smoking gun physical mechanisms at play in the dynamical and AGN formation channel for stellar mass binary black holes: Roemer delays, tidal forces and hydrodynamical interactions. We compute the expected fraction of signals containing astrophysical dephasing, as a function of environmental properties and based on observed distributions of binary parameters. We find that next generation detectors can expect to find environmental effects in hundreds of detected signals.</description>

      <title>Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave sources</title>

Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations for equal masses. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e&gt; 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>NGC 663 as a laboratory for massive star evolution</title>

Abstract: Massive young clusters with rich populations of high-mass stars are ideal laboratories to explore their evolutionary paths. Despite being the most prominent cluster in the Perseus-arm Cas OB8 association, NGC 663 remains comparatively little studied. We present a comprehensive investigation of its properties, integrating astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic data for the cluster and its surroundings, including accurate spectral classification for over 150 members. Gaia astrometry indicates over 300 B-type members, possibly rendering NGC 663 the most massive cluster in the Perseus arm, with initial mass likely exceeding 10000 M_\sun . This large population makes NGC 663 an excellent laboratory for studying massive star evolution. Spectral analysis of the earliest members reveals approximately solar metallicity and a turn-off mass of approximate 8.5 M_\sun, consistent with the photometric age of 23 Ma. We identify five spectroscopic blue stragglers, including the Be/X-ray binary RX J0146.9$+$6121. We outline its evolutionary history and compare its properties with other Be stars. Although the cluster contains many Be stars, their relative fraction is not particularly high. Intriguingly, four of the six blue supergiant members appear to have significantly higher masses than the brightest giants near the Hertzsprung gap. These observations suggest that most mid-B supergiants may form via mergers, unless stars of 10-12 M_\sun born as primaries in binaries rarely undergo supernova explosions. Similarly, if Be stars form through the binary channel, then either most are produced through case A evolution or supernovae are uncommon among primaries in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Photometric redshift calibration with self-organising maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Euclid survey aims to trace the evolution of cosmic structures up to redshift $z$ $\sim$ 3 and beyond. Its success depends critically on obtaining highly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all tomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints. However, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases arising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we utilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of $|\Delta\langle z \rangle| = \langle z_{\text{est}} \rangle - \langle z \rangle \leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that defining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift (spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins satisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the photo-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of ten bins [$0 &lt; z\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the realism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey in incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet the requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography defined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used mean spec-$z$ of SOM cells. To examine the impact on the expected biases for $\Omega_{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_{8}$, and $\Delta w_{0}$ measured by Euclid, we perform a Fisher forecast for cosmic shear only, based on our redshift uncertainties. Here, we find that even under an evaluation of the uncertainty where the impact of the redshift bias is substantial, most absolute biases remain below 0.1$\sigma$ in the idealised scenario and below 0.3$\sigma$ in the more realistic case.</description>
