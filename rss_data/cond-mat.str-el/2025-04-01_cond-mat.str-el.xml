      <title>Detection of anyon braiding through pump-probe spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the braiding of anyons in a quantum spin liquid leaves a distinct dynamical signature in the nonlinear pump-probe response. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and matrix product state techniques, we study the nonlinear pump-probe response of the toric code in a magnetic field, a model which hosts mobile electric $e$ and magnetic $m$ anyonic excitations. While the linear response signal oscillates and decays with time like $\sim t^{-1.3}$, the amplitude of the nonlinear signal for $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$ features a linear-in-time enhancement at early times. The comparison between $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$, which involves the non-trivial braiding of $e$ and $m$ anyons, and $\chi^{(3)}_{XXX}$ that involves the trivial braiding of the same types of anyons, serves to distinguish the braiding statistics of anyons. We support our analysis by constructing a hard-core anyon model with statistical gauge fields to develop further insights into the time dependence of the pump-probe response. Pump-probe spectroscopy provides a distinctive new probe of quantum spin liquid states, beyond the inconclusive broad features observed in single spin flip inelastic neutron scattering.</description>

      <title>Cavity-assisted magnetization switching in a quantum spin-phonon chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a N\'eel magnetization switching mechanism in a hybrid magnon-phonon optical cavity system. A terahertz-pumped single-mode cavity photon couples to a spin-phonon chain, while the system dissipates energy via different baths. Our mean-field analysis reveals that the photon induces magnetization switching by generating strongly entangled magnon pairs with opposite momenta -- a feature weakly present in the cavity-free system. This switching occurs only at specific drive frequencies, namely at low magnon energies and near the upper edge (perpendicular modes) of the two-magnon band. Our results underscore the roles of laser fluence, damping, and photon loss in modulating the switching process, offering a promising route for cavity-assisted magnetization control in opto-spintronics.</description>

      <title>Learning phases with Quantum Monte Carlo simulation cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new machine learning input data type, "spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised machine learning on two models, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions. Additionally, we conduct a regression task to predict superfluid density, which reflects non-local properties of the quantum system, and achieve good accuracy. These results validate the spin-opstring as an effective input for machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry and magnetism in a 3D Kagome lattice: RPt$_2$B (R = La and Nd) prototype crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality in crystals arises from the exclusive presence of proper symmetry operations, such as rotations and screw axes, while lacking improper operations like inversion, mirror planes, and roto-inversions. Crystallographic chirality is expected to be coupled with magnetic responses in magnetically active chiral compounds. Therefore, this study investigates the interplay between structural chirality and magnetic ordering in the rare-earth platinum boride family, RPt$_2$B, where R denotes lanthanide elements. Our results show that the R sites structurally form a chiral three-dimensional Kagome lattice, which can lead to magnetic frustration resolved through chiral antiferromagnetic orderings in conjunction with chiral symmetry. Symmetry analysis reveals that these chiral antiferromagnetic states are low-energy states, competing with higher-in-energy (001) ferromagnetic configuration. We also identified Kramers-type Weyl points in the electronic structure without magnetic response. In the magnetically active chiral compound NdPt$_2$B, Zeeman splitting lifts degeneracies at the high-symmetry points; however, Weyl points persist due to the breaking of time-reversal (T) and inversion (P) symmetries. We also estimate the anomalous Hall conductivity, a measurable observable of the allowed topological features finding a value of $\sigma_{xy} = 293$ S$\cdot$cm$^{-1}$ comparable with another Kagome magnetic materials like Mn$_3$PtN and FeSn, for example. This study elucidates the intricate interplay among chirality, magnetism, and topology in rare-earth Kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamics away from Equilibrium of a Disordered Binary Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a binary disordered alloy when it is subjected to an interaction quench. Our study uses a nonequilibrium embedding scheme (DMFT+CPA) that combines the capacity of DMFT (dynamical mean field theory) to treat strongly correlated systems and the capacity of CPA (coherent potential approximation) to treat disordered systems, to effectively address the interplay of disorder and interaction for the nonequilibrium system. Our solution is applied on the equilibrium binary disordered and interacting alloy for the calculation of the density of states. This equilibrium density of states shows the modifications of the disorder-driven gap by the interaction and that of the interaction-driven Mott gap by the disorder. Next, we assess the relaxation of the system that is initially in equilibrium at a given temperature, and then abruptly has its interaction strength changed from zero to a finite value at which it is kept constant. The system undergoes a short time transient and then settles into a long-time state in a process that depends in a nontrivial manner on the disorder and interaction strength. In addition, we calculate the effective temperature of the system after it has gone through its initial transient and settled into its long-time state. The long-time effective temperature is increased with increasing final interaction strength. However, for a given final interaction, the final temperature can be tuned by the disorder strength over a broad range, with stronger disorder leading to lower temperature. Altogether, the results illustrate the nontrivial interplay between disorder and interaction for a binary alloy away from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Paramagnetic half-moon shaped diffuse scattering arising from 3D magnetic frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use spin dynamics simulations to determine the origin of the unusual correlated diffuse scattering, characterised by half-moon shapes bridging the magnetic Bragg peaks, observed in the polarised elastic neutron scattering from manganese tungstate, MnWO\textsubscript{4}. We first fit a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with twelve nearest-neighbour exchange interactions and single-ion anisotropy to the experimental ground-state magnon dispersion. We then show via spin dynamics simulations that our model Hamiltonian both reproduces the experimentally observed half-moon features and captures their persistence into the paramagnetic regime. Moreover, we identify the three-dimensional, competing antiferromagnetic interactions driving this behavior. Our work complements earlier studies of half-moon-shaped signatures in pyrochlore and triangular structures, by providing insight into their origin in a zigzag chain geometry with three-dimensional competing exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Revealing quantum phase string effect in doped Mott-insulator: a tensor network state approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the fermionic tensor network (TN) state method to understand the strongly correlated nature in a doped Mott insulator. We conduct a comparative study of the $\sigma t$-$J$ model, in which the no-double-occupancy constraint remains unchanged but the quantum phase string effect associated with doped holes is precisely switched off. Thus, the ground state of the $\sigma t$-$J$ model can serve as a well-controlled reference state of the standard $t$-$J$ model. In the absence of phase string, the spin long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is found to be essentially decoupled from the doped holes, and the latter contribute to a Fermi-liquid-like compressibility and a coherent single-particle propagation with a markedly reduced pairing tendency. In contrast, our TN calculations of the $t$-$J$ model indicate that the AFM order decreases much faster with doping and the single-particle propagation of doped holes gets substantially suppressed, concurrently with a much stronger charge compressibility at small doping and a significantly amplified Cooper pairing tendencies. These findings demonstrate that quantum many-body interference from phase strings plays a pivotal role in the $t$-$J$ model, mediating long-range entanglement between spin and charge degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Robust Magnetic Polaron Percolation in the Antiferromagnetic CMR System EuCd$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic EuCd$_2$P$_2$ has attracted considerable attention due to its unconventional (magneto)transport properties. At a temperature $T_{\rm peak}$ significantly above the magnetic ordering temperature $T_\textrm{N} = 11\,$K a large peak in resistivity is observed which gets strongly suppressed in magnetic field, resulting in a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), for which magnetic fluctuations and the formation of ferromagnetic clusters have been proposed as underlying mechanisms. Employing a selection of sensitive probes including fluctuation spectroscopy and third-harmonic resistance, Hall effect, AC susceptibility and $\mu$SR measurements, allows for a direct comparison of electronic and magnetic properties on multiple time scales. We find compelling evidence for the formation and percolation of magnetic polarons, which explains the CMR of the system. Large peaks in the weakly-nonlinear transport and the resistance noise power spectral density at zero magnetic field signify an inhomogeneous, percolating electronic system below $T^\ast \approx 2\,T_\textrm{N}$ with a percolation threshold at $T_{\rm peak}$. In magnetic fields, the onset of large negative MR in the paramagnetic regime occurs at a universal critical magnetization similar to ferromagnetic CMR materials. The size of the magnetic polarons at the percolation threshold is estimated to $\sim 1 - 2\,$nm. The mechanism of magntic cluster formation and percolation in EuCd$_2$P$_2$ appears to be rather robust despite large variations in carrier concentration and likely is relevant for other Eu-based antiferromagnetic CMR systems.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity in quantum many-body scars of spin-1 models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak ergodicity breaking, particularly through quantum many-body scars (QMBS), has become a significant focus in many-body physics. Krylov state complexity quantifies the spread of quantum states within the Krylov basis and serves as a powerful diagnostic for analyzing nonergodic dynamics. In this work, we study spin-one XXZ magnets and reveal nonergodic behavior tied to QMBS. For the XY model, the nematic N\'eel state exhibits periodic revivals in Krylov complexity. In the generic XXZ model, we identify spin helix states as weakly ergodicity-breaking states, characterized by low entanglement and nonthermal dynamics. Across different scenarios, the Lanczos coefficients for scarred states display an elliptical pattern, reflecting a hidden SU(2) algebra that enables analytical results for Krylov complexity and fidelity. These findings, which exemplify the rare capability to characterize QMBS analytically, are feasible with current experimental techniques and offer deep insights into the nonergodic dynamics of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Effect of Interlayer Stacking on the Electronic Properties of 1$T$-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlled stacking of van der Waals materials is a powerful tool for exploring the physics of quantum condensed matter. Given the small binding between layers, exploitation for engineering will require a breakthrough in stacking methodology, or an ability to take advantage of thicker defective stacks. Here we describe computational groundwork for the latter, using -- on account of its promise for cold memory applications -- 1$T$-TaS$_2$ as a model system. Comparing recursive Hendricks-Teller calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to published X-ray diffraction data, we obtain the key parameters describing the random stacking in mesoscopic flakes. These then regulate the electronic structures via specification of the random stacks in dynamical mean-field theory simulations. Hubbard repulsion induces strongly correlated metallic, band and Mott insulating layers, providing compelling evidence that electronic properties follow from the coexistence of more than the metallic and insulating planes associated by ordinary band theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase diagram of the extended spin-3/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg model: A DMRG study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently there has been considerable excitement surrounding the promising realization of high-spin Kitaev material, such as the quasi-2D compound CrI$_3$ and CrGeTe$_3$. However, the stability of quantum spin liquids (QSL) against single ion anisotropy (SIA) in these materials and the global quantum phase diagram of the extended spin-3/2 Kitaev model with finite SIA remain unclear. In this study, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to explore the quantum phase diagram of the generalized spin-3/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg (K-H) model accompanied with SIA $A_c$. In the $A_c=0$ limit, the spin-3/2 K-H model exhibits a quantum phase diagram similar to that of a spin-1/2 system, including two QSLs around antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Kitaev models. For models with finite $A_c$, we map out the quantum phase diagram around two Kitaev points and observe distinct types of in-plane vortex orders developed from these two QSL phases. Interestingly, series of nearly degenerate vortex configurations are discovered in each vortex phases. Using linear spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that these vortex configurations can be understood as a consequence of the quantum correction on a continuous family of degenerate classical states.</description>

      <title>Local basis for interacting topological bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of correlated states in moire materials has challenged the established methods of projecting interactions into a local Wannier basis due to topological obstructions that manifest in extended interactions. This difficulty can sometimes be evaded by decomposing the band into a basis of extended itinerant states and a lattice of local states, using the heavy fermion prescription. We revisit this framework by systematically identifying the dominant interaction channels guided by the eigenvalues of the projected density operator. This approach can be applied both to tight-binding and continuum models, allowing us to identify a hierarchy in interaction scales that can be universally used to reduce the Hilbert space dimension and determine an appropriate local basis for modeling electronic correlations in interacting topological materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis, which is recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. In this work, we extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we find a clear evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by the dynamical quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>A Topological Superconductor Tuned by Electronic Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological superconductor, characterized by either a chiral order parameter or a chiral topological surface state in proximity to bulk superconductivity, is foundational to topological quantum computing. As in other topological phases of matter, electronic correlations can tune topological superconductivity via modifications of the low-energy Fermiology. Such tuning has not been realized so far. Here we uncover a unique topological superconducting phase in competition with electronic correlations in 10-unit-cell thick FeTe$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ films grown on SrTiO$_{3}$ substrates. When the Te content $x$ exceeds $0.7$, we observe a rapid increase of the effective mass for the Fe $d_{xy}$ band, with the emergence of a superconducting topological surface state confirmed by high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy; however, near the FeTe limit, the system enters an incoherent regime where the topological surface state becomes unidentifiable and superconductivity is suppressed. Theory suggests that the electron-electron interactions in the odd-parity $xy^-$ band with a strong $d_{xy}$ character lead to an orbital-selective correlated phase. Our work establishes FeTe$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ thin films as a unique platform where electronic correlations sensitively modulate topological superconductivity, suggesting opportunities to use tunable electron-electron interactions to engineer new topological phases in a broad class of materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general strategy to develop quantum many-body approximations of primitives in linear algebra algorithms. As a practical example, we introduce a coupled-cluster inspired framework to produce approximate Hamiltonian moments, and demonstrate its application in various linear algebra algorithms for ground state estimation. Through numerical examples, we illustrate the difference between the ground-state energies arising from quantum many-body linear algebra and those from the analogous many-body perturbation theory. Our results support the general idea of designing quantum many-body approximations outside of perturbation theory, providing a route to new algorithms and approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pfaffian formulas used to compute overlaps necessary to carry out generator coordinate method calculations using a set of Hartree- Fock- Bogoliubov wave functions, is generalized to the case where each of the HFB states are expanded in different arbitrary bases spanning different sub-space of the Hilbert space. The formula obtained is compared with previous results proving to be completely equivalent to them. A discussion of equivalent formulas obtained in the literature is carried out.</description>

      <title>Twisted Nodal Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent proposals for the realization of time-reversal symmetry breaking and topological superconductivity in twisted nodal superconductors have led to a surge of theoretical and experimental studies of these systems, marking one of the newest entries in the rapidly growing field of moir\'e materials. The interplay between order parameters of the separate layers makes twisted superconductors unique, leading to additional emergent phenomena in regimes usually not of importance in moir\'e physics, such as bulk interfaces and large twist angles. We review the physics of twisted nodal superconductors, highlighting both similarities and qualitative differences with other moir\'e platforms. While inspired by the rise of moir\'e materials, the field is anchored in studies of unconventional superconductivity preceding the moir\'e era, which we discuss in detail. In addition to summarizing the developments at the present stage, we present a detailed outlook on the major open questions in the field and some of the most exciting future directions.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in High-Entropy Antimonide M$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$Sb (M = equimolar Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-entropy concept was applied to the synthesis of transition-metal antimonides, M1-xPtxSb (M = equimolar Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir). High-entropy antimonide samples crystallized in a pseudo-hexagonal NiAs-type crystal structure with a P63/mmc space group were successfully synthesized through a conventional solid-state reaction and subsequent quenching. A detailed investigation of the composition and equilibration conditions confirmed the reversible phase transition between a multi-phase state at low temperature and an entropy-driven single-phase solid solution at high temperatures. Electrical resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements of single-phase M1-xPtxSb (x = 0.2) samples revealed a bulk superconducting transition at 2.15(2) K. This study demonstrates that the high-entropy concept provides numerous opportunities for the discovery of new functional materials such as superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Heteroanionic compounds, which contain two or more types of anions, have emerged as a promising class of materials with diverse properties and functionalities. In this paper, I review the experimental findings on Ca3ReO5Cl2 and related com-pounds that exhibit remarkable pleochroism and novel quantum magnetism. I discuss how the heteroanionic coordination affects the optical and magnetic properties by modulating the d-orbital states of the transition metal ions and then compare these materials with other heteroanionic and monoanionic compounds and highlight the potential of A3MO5X2 materials for future exploration of materials and phenomena.</description>

      <title>Topological Electronic Structure and Transport Properties of the Distorted Rutile-type WO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the transport properties and electronic structures of distorted rutile-type WO2. Electrical resistivity and Hall effect measurements of high-quality single crystals revealed the transport property characteristics of topological materials; these characteristics included an extremely large magnetoresistance of 13,200% (2 K and 9 T) and a very high carrier mobility of 25,700 cm2 V-1 s-1 (5 K). First-principles calculations revealed Dirac nodal lines (DNL) near the Fermi energy in the electronic structure when spin-orbit interactions (SOIs) were absent. Although these DNLs mostly disappeared in the presence of SOIs, band crossings at high-symmetry points in the reciprocal space existed as Dirac points. Furthermore, DNLs protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry persisted on the ky = {\pi}/b plane. The unique transport properties originating from the topological electronic structure of chemically and thermally stable WO2 could represent an opportunity to investigate the potential electronic applications of the material.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and Weak Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a realistic model relevant to La$_2$CuO$_4$ and other altermagnetic perovskite oxides, we study interrelations between weak ferromagnetism (WF), anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and net orbital magnetization (OM). All of them can be linked to the form of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Nevertheless, while spin WF is induced by the DM vector components having the same sign in all equivalent bonds, AHE and OM are related to alternating-sign components, which do not contribute to any canting of spins. The microscopic model remains invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t} \}$, combining the shift ${\bf t}$ of antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices to each other with the spin flip $\mathcal{S}$. Thus, the band structure remains Kramers-degenerate, but the time-reversal symmetry is broken, providing a possibility to realize AHE in antiferromagnetic substances. The altermagnetic splitting of bands, breaking the $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t}\}$ symmetry, does not play a major role in the problem. More important is the orthorhombic strain, responsible for finite values of AHE and OM.</description>

      <title>Toward the detection of spin-vortex-induced loop currents in a single bilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ thin film and their possible use as qubits: Model calculations for three nano-island architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory for cuprate superconductivity predicts the existence of nano-sized loop currents called, ``spin-vortex-induced loop currents (SVILCs)''. In this wok, we first calculate magnetic fields produced by them in a single bilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) thin film for the purpose of detecting the SVILCs. The estimated magnitude of the magnetic field at the point 10$a$ ($a$ is the lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) above the surface could be in the order of 100mT; thus, they may be detectable by currently available detection methods. Next, we investigate the use of them as qubits (the ``SVILC qubits'') in an architecture composed of three nano-islands of the thin film; and consider the use of the detection of the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs as the qubit readout. We show there are a number of energy levels suitable for qubit states that can be manipulated by external current feeding, and the magnetic field generated by the SVILCs is large enough to be used for the readout.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that interlayer \(s_{\pm}\)-wave pairing dominates superconductivity in La\(_{2.85}\)Pr\(_{0.15}\)Ni\(_2\)O\(_7\) thin films through self-consistent mean-field calculations. We further show that applying a perpendicular electric field breaks layer equivalence, generating nodal structures, Fermi arcs, and finite low-energy states in the \(d_{x^2-y^2}\) orbital. Our results quantitatively align with recent experimental observations for the superconducting gaps, and we propose experimental symmetry-breaking perturbations as a direct test for the interlayer pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of UGe$_2$ at ambient pressure: comparison with X-ray photoemission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on experimental crystallographic data, electronic structure of UGe$_2$ have been calculated and compared with our results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. We employed two different advanced full potential (FP) methods: FP-local-orbital (FPLO) and FP-linear augmented plane waves (Wien2k) codes for non-magnetic and ferromagnetic states. Starting from the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) or generalised gradient approximation (GGA), we verified either the orbital polarisation (OP) correction or the GGA+U approach for the U 5f-electrons, changing Coulomb-repulsion energies U in the range 0-4 eV. Satisfying agreement was achieved between experimental and our calculated magnetic moments using ab-initio LSDA+OP and non-ab-initio GGA+U approaches, the latter for realistic U values of 2-3 eV. We proved by the LSDA+OP approach an existence of the Fermi surface nesting vector along the a axis, possibly responsible for the triplet superconducting pairing. The calculated data reveal predominantly an itinerant U 5f-electron character of bands near the Fermi level, EF, with only small contributions from the U 6d and Ge 4p states. The experimental XPS spectrum of valence bands (VB) also contains the sharp main 5f-electron peak at EF, a wide hump (around -2 eV), and broad small peaks at higher energies. In the calculated XPS spectrum, the width of the main 5f-electron peak varies between 0.8 and 1.4 eV, depending on a method used in computations, but the hump remains unresolved. A newly observed asymmetric 1-eV satellite in the experimental 4f-core XPS spectrum together with known 3-eV and 7-eV satellites suggest dual behaviour of U-5f-electrons in UGe$_2$, the feature is inferred also from the VB studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $J_1-J_3$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice is know to exhibit a fascinating emergent $q=4$ Potts order (or $K_4$) due to the order-by-disorder mechanism: for large $J_3&gt;0$, fluctuations select one among the four equivalent collinear ground states, which themselves belong to a larger ground state manifold. We study this model with a rate $p$ of magnetic site vacancies through a numerical approach. First, we analyze the effect of few impurities on the ground state, favouring non-coplanar configurations. Second, for finite dilutions, we perform parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations in the $(T,p)$ plane, showing the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the $q=4$ Potts transition. This is a rare example of competing order parameters that exclude each other, whith the chiral one appearing only due to disorder.</description>

      <title>Density wave order with antiphase feature associated with the pseudogap in cuprate superconductor Bi2+xSr2-xCuO6+delta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong correlation effect in cuprate superconductors have greatly enriched the phase diagram showing the co-existence of superconductivity with many intertwined orders. One of the prominent issues concerning the superconductivity mechanism is about the pseudogap phase which behaves either as cooperator or competitor for superconductivity and its fundamental reason remains still elusive. Here we report the measurements of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) in the model superconducting system Bi2+xSr2-xCuO6+delta with a transition temperature Tc~7 K. Although this system is supposed to be slightly overdoped, a pseudogap feature can be easily observed in the energy region of about 20-60 meV. A modulation of local density of states (LDOS) with a periodicity of about 4a0/3 (a0: Cu-O-Cu bond length) can be easily observed, which is also supported by the Fourier transformation pattern with wavevectors at about (0,+-3pi/2a0) and (+-3pi/2a0,0). Surprisingly, we find that the LDOS exhibits a clear antiphase feature in the pseudogap energy region below and above the Fermi energy, indicating that it is an intrinsic feature of the pseudogap phase. We interpret this modulation and antiphase feature as a possible consequence of the pair density wave due to the Amperean pairing with finite momentum. Our results give a deep insight on the understanding of the pseudogap phase in cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Jordanian deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2 $-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.</description>

      <title>Ambient and high pressure studies of structural, electronic and magnetic properties of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ single crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A thorough study of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ single crystals, which were grown from Sn flux, was performed using both bulk (heat capacity, ac susceptibility, dc magnetization, electrical resistivitivity, magnetoresistance) and microscopic (M\"ossbauer spectroscopy) techniques. Electrical resistance and magnetic susceptibility were measured also under high pressure conditions (up to 19 GPa and 9.5 GPa, respectively). Further insight into electronic properties and phonons is provided by ab initio calculations. The results indicate that EuZn$_2$P$_2$ is an antiferromagnet with strong Eu-Eu exchange coupling of ferromagnetic type within the basal plane and weaker antiferromagnetic interaction along the c axis. The Eu magnetic moments are tilted from the basal plane. Hydrostatic pressure strongly affects both magnetic (increase of the N\'eel temperature) and electronic (suppression of the band gap and semi metallic behavior) properties, indicating a strong interplay of structure with magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of europium-based crystals containing As or P by a flux method: attempts to grow EuAgP single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Europium-based materials are highly attractive due to their diverse range of physical properties. In these studies, we aimed to synthesize single crystals of the potentially topological semimetallic compound EuAgP, which up to this day has only been obtained in polycrystalline form. The flux method was employed for the syntheses, using fluxes such as: Bi, Sn, Pb, and In, in their various ratios. The purpose of using Bi flux was to try synthesizing an analog of EuAgAs single crystals, by fully substituting arsenic with phosphorus. The obtained crystals were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Despite many unsuccessful attempts to synthesize EuAgP single crystals, the study provides valuable insights into how different fluxes and their ratios influence the final synthesis product. It also underscores the complexity of designing analogs between arsenides and phosphides.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum metrology using non-Hermitian spin model with RT-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian transverse XY model with Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interaction having RT-symmetry, referred to as iKSEA model, possesses both an exceptional point at which eigenvectors coalesce and a quantum critical point where gap-closing occurs. To precisely estimate the magnetic field of the system, we prove that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the ground state of the iKSEA model, which is a lower bound of the precision quantified by the root mean square error, scales as $N^2$, with N being the system-size. This provides Heisenberg scaling both at the quantum critical point and the exceptional point in the thermodynamic limit. It indicates that when the system is in contact with the bath, resulting in this non-Hermitian model, reservoir engineering can provide enhanced precision of system parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate analytically that, in contrast to Hermitian systems, QFI surpasses the Heisenberg limit and achieves super-Heisenberg scaling ($\sim N^6$), when the strength of the KSEA interaction approaches the anisotropy parameter, permitting competition between non-hermiticity and hermiticity features, as long as the system size is moderate.</description>

      <title>Universality of R\'enyi Entropy in Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th R\'enyi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Intertwining bulk and surface: the case of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UTe$_2$ has been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies in recent years, as it is recognized as an odd-parity bulk superconductor. Its surface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density wave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we propose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface and in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual features detected by surface probes in this material. Through a phenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental signatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of CDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii) the magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the CDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature and its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental checks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.</description>

      <title>Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering Study of Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$</title>

Abstract: We present a combined oxygen $K$-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of the bilayer ruthenate Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Our RIXS experiments on Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ were carried out on the overlapping planar and inter-planar oxygen resonances, which are distinguishable from the apical one. Comparison to equivalent oxygen $K$-edge spectra recorded on band-Mott insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ is made. In contrast to Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ spectra, which contain excitations linked to Mott physics, Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ spectra feature only intra-$t_{2g}$ ones that do not directly involve the Coulomb energy scale. As found in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we resolve two intra-$t_{2g}$ excitations in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Moreover, the lowest lying excitation in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ shows a significant dispersion, revealing a collective character differently from what is observed in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Theoretical modelling supports the interpretation of this lowest energy excitation in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ as a magnetic transverse mode with multi-particle character, whereas the corresponding excitation in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ is assigned to combined longitudinal and transverse spin modes. These fundamental differences are discussed in terms of the inequivalent magnetic ground-state manifestations in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ and Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Gauged cooling of topological excitations and emergent fermions on quantum simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulated cooling is a robust method for preparing low-energy states of many-body Hamiltonians on near-term quantum simulators. In such schemes, a subset of the simulator's spins (or qubits) are treated as a ``bath,'' which extracts energy and entropy from the system of interest. However, such protocols are inefficient when applied to systems whose excitations are highly non-local in terms of the microscopic degrees of freedom, such as topological phases of matter; such excitations are difficult to extract by a local coupling to a bath. We explore a route to overcome this obstacle by encoding of the microscopic degrees of freedom into those of the quantum simulator in a non-local manner. To illustrate the approach, we show how to efficiently cool the ferromagnetic phase of the quantum Ising model, whose excitations are domain walls, via a ``gauged cooling'' protocol in which the Ising spins are coupled to a $Z_2$ gauge field that simultaneously acts as a reservoir for removing excitations. We show that our protocol can prepare the ground states of the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases equally efficiently. The gauged cooling protocol naturally extends to (interacting) fermionic systems, where it is equivalent to cooling by coupling to a fermionic bath via single-fermion hopping.</description>

Abstract: Condensed matter systems can host emergent `vacua' with particles, fields and dimension different from that of the universe we inhabit. Motivated by the appearance of emergent gauge fields with both electric and magnetic charges, we consider the fate of electromagnetism in two dimensions in the presence of magnetic monopoles. We find that generically electromagnetic fields are damped due to resistive effects. However, we can still identify a magnetohydrodynamic regime. It exhibits magnetosonic waves which, unlike in $d=3$, are isotropic, to which there is a contribution from the odd viscosity coefficient present in the system. Further, we find a dynamo action, which unlike in $d=3$ requires compressibility of the flow.</description>

      <title>Efficiently preparing chiral states via fermionic cooling on bosonic quantum hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers. An important open question is how to efficiently prepare the ground states of arbitrary fermionic Hamiltonians, especially those with nontrivial topology. Here, we propose an efficient protocol for preparing low-energy states of fermionic Hamiltonians on a noisy bosonic quantum simulator by adiabatic cooling using a simulated bath. We arrange the couplings such that the simulated system and bath together obtain a local fermionic description in which fermionic excitations can be extracted individually, via coherent hopping to the bath, rather than in pairs as would otherwise be required by fermion parity conservation. This approach thus achieves a linear (rather than quadratic) scaling of the cooling rate vs. excitation density at low densities. We show that certain topological phases such as the chiral (non-Abelian) phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be prepared efficiently using our protocol. Our protocol performs favorably in the presence of noise, making it suitable for execution on near-term quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We consider two-dimensional periodically driven systems of fermions with particle-hole symmetry. Such systems support non-trivial topological phases, including ones that cannot be realized in equilibrium. We show that a space-time defect in the driving Hamiltonian, dubbed a ``time vortex,'' can bind $\pi$ Majorana modes. A time vortex is a point in space around which the phase lag of the Hamiltonian changes by a multiple of $2\pi$. We demonstrate this behavior on a periodically driven version of Kitaev's honeycomb spin model, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes and time vortices can realize any combination of $0$ and $\pi$ Majorana modes. We show that a time vortex can be created using Clifford gates, simplifying its realization in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Magnetothermal transport in ultraclean single crystals of Kitaev magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The layered honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has emerged as a promising candidate for realizing a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. Previous studies have reported oscillation-like anomalies in the longitudinal thermal conductivity and half-integer quantized thermal Hall conductivity above the antiferromagnetic critical field $H_c$, generating significant interest. However, the origins of these phenomena remain contentious due to strong sample dependence. Here we re-examine the magnetothermal transport properties using recently available ultra-pure $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ single crystals to further elucidate potential signatures of the spin liquid state. Our findings reveal that while anomalies in thermal conductivity above $H_c$ persist even in ultraclean crystals, their magnitude is significantly attenuated, contrary to the quantum oscillations hypothesis. This suggests that the anomalies are likely attributable to localized stacking faults inadvertently introduced during magnetothermal transport measurements. The thermal Hall conductivity exhibits a half-quantized plateau, albeit with a narrower width than previously reported. This width reduction can be understood through two distinct mechanisms: sample-dependent magnetic critical fields that influence the lower boundary of the plateau region, and the decoupling between chiral Majorana edge currents and phononic thermal transport that determines the upper boundary. These results indicate that structural imperfections exert a substantial influence on both the oscillation-like anomalies and quantization effects observed in magnetothermal transport measurements of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.</description>

      <title>Explicit demonstration of the equivalence between DFT+U and the Hartree-Fock limit of DFT+DMFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several methods have been developed to improve the predictions of density functional theory (DFT) in the case of strongly correlated electron systems. Out of these approaches, DFT+$U$, which corresponds to a static treatment of the local interaction, and DFT combined with dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), which considers local fluctuations, have both proven incredibly valuable in tackling the description of materials with strong local electron-electron interactions. While it is in principle known that the Hartree-Fock (HF) limit of the DFT+DMFT approach should recover DFT+$U$, demonstrating this equivalence in practice is challenging, due to the very different ways in which the two approaches are generally implemented. In this work, we introduce a way to perform DFT+$U$ calculations in Quantum ESPRESSO using Wannier functions as calculated by Wannier90, which allows us to use the same Hubbard projector functions both in DFT+$U$ and in DFT+DMFT. We benchmark these DFT+$U$ calculations against DFT+DMFT calculations where the DMFT impurity problem is solved within the HF approximation. Considering a number of prototypical materials including NiO, MnO, LaMnO$_3$, and LuNiO$_3$, we establish the sameness of the two approaches. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our approach by going beyond the commonly used atomic orbital-like projectors by performing DFT+$U$ calculations for VO$_2$ using a special set of bond-centered Wannier functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical methods capable of handling nonequilibrium impurity models are essential for the study of transport problems and the solution of the nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) equations. In the strong correlation regime, the self-consistently resummed hybridization expansion is an appealing strategy, which however has been employed so far mainly in the lowest-order noncrossing approximation. At higher orders, standard implementations become numerically costly, but a significant speed-up can be achieved by evaluating multidimensional integrals in an approximate factorized form. Here we develop a one-crossing approximation solver based on the recently introduced quantics tensor cross interpolation, and demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency with applications to the Anderson impurity model and nonequilibrium steady-state DMFT calculations for the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Coarsening dynamics of Ising-nematic order in a frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phase ordering dynamics of the classical antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ (nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings) Heisenberg model on the square lattice in the strong frustration regime ($J_2/J_1 &gt; 1/2$). While thermal fluctuations preclude any long-range magnetic order at finite temperatures, the system exhibits a long-range spin-driven nematic phase at low temperatures. The transition into the nematic phase is further shown to belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class based on the critical exponents near the phase transition. Our large-scale stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations find a two-stage phase ordering when the system is quenched from a high-temperature paramagnetic state into the nematic phase. In the early stage, collinear alignments of spins lead to a locally saturated Ising-nematic order. Once domains of well-defined Ising order are developed, the late-stage relaxation is dominated by curvature-driven domain coarsening, as described by the Allen-Cahn equation. The characteristic size of Ising-nematic domains scales as the square root of time, similar to the kinetic Ising model described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our results confirm that the late-stage ordering kinetics of the spin-driven nematic, which is a vestigial order of the frustrated Heisenberg model, belongs to the dynamical universality class of a non-conserved Ising order. Interestingly, the system shows no violation of the superuniversality hypothesis under weak bond disorder. The dynamic scaling invariance is preserved in the presence of weak bond disorder. We also discuss possible applications of our results to materials for which vestigial Ising-nematic order is realized.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible SPTs: an on-site realization of (1+1)d anomaly-free fusion category symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.</description>

      <title>Soft phonon and the central peak at the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in SrTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous displacive phase transition in SrTiO$_3$ near $T_c \approx 105$ K features a central elastic peak in neutron scattering investigations at temperatures above $T_c$, i.e., before the corresponding soft phonon mode is overdamped upon cooling. The origin of this central peak is still not understood. Here, we report an inelastic x-ray scattering investigation of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in SrTiO$_3$. We compare quantitatively measurements of the soft phonon mode on two differently grown samples and discuss the findings regarding results from thermodynamic and transport probes such as specific heat and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to perform elastic scans with both high momentum- and milli-electronvolt energy-resolution and, thus, be able to separate elastic intensities of the central peak from low-energy quasielastic phonon scattering. Our results indicate that the evolution of the soft mode is similar in both samples though the intensities of the central peak differ by a factor of four. Measurements revealing anisotropic correlation lengths on cooling towards $T_c$, indicate that local properties of the crystals to which collective lattice excitations are insensitive are likely at the origin of the central elastic line in SrTiO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically-exact algorithm using few-body revealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopically large bath. The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for triple-Q magnetic orders on a hexagonal lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive Ginzburg-Landau theory describing triple-Q magnetic orders on hexagonal lattices, focusing on $O(N)$ models with $N=2$ and $N=3$. Through systematic analysis of symmetry-allowed terms in the free energy, we establish complete phase diagrams governed by competing interaction parameters. Our theory reveals distinct magnetic configurations including single-Q, double-Q, and triple-Q states, each characterized by unique symmetry breaking patterns and collective excitations. The framework provides fundamental insights into complex magnetic orders recently observed in materials such as Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, where the interplay between geometric frustration and multiple ordering vectors leads to exotic magnetic states. Our results establish clear connections between microscopic interactions, broken symmetries, and experimentally observable properties, offering a powerful tool for understanding and predicting novel magnetic phases in frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: U(1) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase is studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations that have finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Corbino Shockley-Ramo Paradox for Hydrodynamic Current Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Johnson noise thermometry enables direct measurement of the electron temperature, a valuable probe of many-body systems. Practical use of this technique calls for non-equilibrium generalizations of the Johnson-Nyquist theorem. For a hydrodynamic Corbino device, however, a na\"ive use of the Shockley-Ramo theorem alongside the "Corbino paradox" leads to yet another paradox: bulk velocity fluctuations cannot be measured by the contacts. In this work, we resolve the unphysical "Corbino Shockley-Ramo paradox" by correctly formulating the hydrodynamic Shockley-Ramo problem. This allows us to properly formulate the problem of current noise in an hydrodynamic multi-terminal device of arbitrary geometry, as well as validate a previously unjustified assumption for rectangular geometry results. As an example, we compute the Johnson noise in a hydrodynamic Corbino device, where we find a suppression of Johnson noise with magnetic field. This unusual characteristic serves as a strong signature of viscous hydrodynamic behavior.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of broken-symmetry approach to exchange interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broken-symmetry (BS) approaches are widely employed to evaluate Heisenberg exchange parameters, primarily in combination with DFT calculations. For many magnetic materials, BS-DFT calculations give reasonable estimations of exchange parameters, although systematic failures have also been reported. While the latter were attributed to deficiencies of approximate exchange-correlation functional, we prove here by treating a simple model system that the broken-symmetry methodology has serious problems. Detailed analysis clarifies the intrinsic issue with the broken-symmetry treatment of low-spin states. It shows, in particular, that the error in the BS calculation of exchange parameter scales with the degree of covalency between the magnetic and the bridging orbitals. This is due to the constraint on the form of multiconfigurational state imposed by the BS determinant, a feature common to other single-reference methods too. As a possible tool to overcome this intrinsic drawback of single-determinant BS approaches, we propose their extension to a minimal multiconfigurational version.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a larger quantum many-body state, while generating entanglement for its remaining constituents. We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to symmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or (non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point to a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</description>

      <title>Non-linear and non-empirical double hybrid density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-linear and non-empirical (nLanE) double hybrid density functional derived from an accurate interpolation of the adiabatic connection in density functional theory, incorporating the correct asymptotic expansions. By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nLanE-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nLanE-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through SIE4x4 and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.</description>
