      <title>Adiabatic Elimination in Relativistic Stochastic Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the adiabatic elimination of fast variables in relativistic stochastic mechanics, which is analyzed in the equation of motion and in the distribution function, with relativistic corrections explicitly derived. A new dimensionless parameter is introduced to characterize the timescale. The adiabatic elimination is also compared with the path integral coarse graining, which is more general yet computationally demanding.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady states in bead-spring models: Entropy production and probability distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-equilibrium models comprising of beads connected by springs. The system is coupled to two thermal baths kept at different temperatures. We derive the steady state probability distributions of positions of the bead for the one-bead system in the underdamped case. We employ the recently proposed technique of an effective temperature, along with numerical simulations to solve the Langevin equations and obtain their corresponding probability distributions. It is observed that the marginal probability distributions in the position are independent of mass. We also obtain theoretically and numerically the rate of entropy production for the one-bead system. The probability distribution of the positions in the two-beads system are obtained theoretically and numerically, both in the underdamped and overdamped case. Lastly, we discuss the notion of ergodicity and have tested the convergence of the time-averaging and the ensemble-averaging protocols.</description>

      <title>Quasi-adiabatic thermal ensemble preparation in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-adiabatic thermal process for preparing finite-temperature ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. The process gradually transforms a thermal ensemble of a noninteracting system into that of an interacting system of interest over a finite operation time, with the temperature controlled by parameters associated with the entropy of the initial state. We analyze this process in both nonintegrable and integrable spin chains with translational invariance. For the nonintegrable case, numerical simulations show that the thermal properties of local observables are accurately reproduced with a single parameter in the high temperature regime, although the operation time increases exponentially with precision. In contrast, for the integrable transverse-field Ising model, we analytically show that an extensive number of parameters tied to local conserved quantities is generally necessary, and that the operation time increases linearly with system size, diverging in the thermodynamic limit. These results clarify the potential and limitations of the quasi-adiabatic thermal process for an ensemble preparation and highlight the role of integrability in determining its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gyration driven by dichotomous noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stochastic dynamics of a particle on a plane in presence of two noises and
  a confining parabolic potential - an analog of the experimentally-relevant Brownian Gyrator (BG) model. In contrast to the standard BG model, we suppose here that the time-evolution of the position components is driven not by Gaussian white-noises, but by two statistically-independent dichotomous noises. We calculate analytically the position variances and cross-correlations, as well as the mean angular momentum, which permits us to establish the conditions in which a spontaneous rotational motion of the particle around the origin takes place. We also present a numerical analysis of the mean angular velocity.
  Lastly, we
  calculate analytically some marginal position probability density functions revealing a remarkably rich behavior that emerges in such a system of two coupled linear stochastic differential equations. We show that depending on the values of parameters characterizing noises these distributions approach the steady-state forms defined on a finite support, having very unusual shapes, possessing multiple maxima and minima, plateaus and exhibiting a discontinuous behavior.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum Mpemba effect in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a fundamental role in many-body systems, both in and out of equilibrium. The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) - a phenomenon where systems initially farther from equilibrium can thermalize faster - can be understood in terms of how rapidly a symmetry, broken by initial conditions, is dynamically restored. In this work, we study the QME in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XYZ model with power-law decaying interactions in the presence of a magnetic field. In the prethermal regime generated by large field strengths, the system develops a continuous U(1) symmetry, enabling the QME to emerge. However, due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the QME can only arise when interactions are sufficiently short-ranged. This leads to an interplay between the external field, interaction range, and dynamical symmetry restoration. We systematically explore this interplay and analyze the dependence of the QME on the effective temperature set by the initial state. Our results demonstrate the tunability of the QME via long-range interactions, which can be probed in experimental platforms of trapped ions, polar molecules, and NV centers.</description>

      <title>Structure of solutions to continuous constraint satisfaction problems through the statistics of wedged and inscribed spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of random landscapes has long relied on counting stationary points: metastable states and the barriers between them. However, this method is useless for describing flat regions, common in constraint satisfaction problems. We introduce a characterization of flat regions by counting the number of spheres that can be uniquely inserted into them, either by wedging spheres of fixed radius or by inscribing spheres of variable radius. The ratio of these counts constrains the topology of the solution space. We apply this characterization to the spherical perceptron and show the existence of at least two topological regimes.</description>

      <title>Demon's variational principle for informational active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between information, dissipation, and control is reshaping our understanding of thermodynamics in feedback-regulated systems. We develop the informational Onsager-Machlup principle, a generalized variational framework that unifies energetic, dissipative, and informational contributions within a single formalism. This framework introduces a conditioned Onsager-Machlup integral to quantify path entropy under specified memory states and enables the derivation of cumulant generating functions for arbitrary observables in systems with measurement and feedback. Applying this principle to a minimal model of an information-driven swimmer, where feedback adaptively modulates viscous drag based on velocity measurements, we obtain analytical expressions for the mean velocity and higher-order cumulants. Here, we show that information-based feedback can sustain persistent motion even in dissipative environments, establishing a theoretical foundation for informational active matter and providing a systematic route for designing feedback-powered engines operating far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Wettability from Diffusion: A Universal Molecular Scaling Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying wettability at the nanoscale remains challenging, as macroscopic contact-angle measurements fail to capture the molecular interactions that define hydrophilic and hydrophobic behavior. We derive an analytical relation linking the water contact angle to the lateral diffusion of interfacial molecules, establishing a quantitative connection between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic wettability. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the ratio of interfacial to bulk diffusion uniquely determines the contact angle across the full hydrophilic-hydrophobic spectrum. This diffusion-based formulation eliminates the need for droplet geometries or free-energy sampling, enabling quantitative assessment of wetting directly from short ab-initio molecular dynamics trajectories. The approach provides a universal and efficient route to evaluate surface affinity in reactive, defective, or confined environments.</description>

      <title>Physical models of embryonic epithelial healing: A review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embryonic healing in epithelial tissues is distinct from adult wound healing, as it lacks inflammatory responses or immune cell recruitments, making it ideal to test models of wound healing driven primarily by epithelial dynamics. Many models have been developed to describe this process, ranging from simple mechanistic models to more elaborate multiscale simulations. We review different classes of physical models, from discrete to continuum models, and how they address key questions about the mechanics, signaling, and coordination of cells during wound closure. We highlight tensions between model complexity and interpretability and discuss recent efforts to bridge gaps across scales. Finally, we identify directions for hybrid modeling and model-experiment integration that could push forward our understanding of epithelial repair in development and disease.</description>

      <title>Emergent Discrete Time Crystals on Digital Quantum Computers: Boundary-Protected and Ancilla-Induced Disorder Mechanisms of Thermalization Slowdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems typically evolve toward an infinite-temperature thermal state due to continuous energy absorption. Before reaching equilibrium, however, they can transiently exhibit long-lived prethermal states that host exotic nonequilibrium phenomena, such as discrete time crystals (DTCs). In this study, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of periodically driven product states in a kicked Ising model implemented on the IBM Quantum Eagle and Heron processors. By using ancilla qubits to mediate interactions, we construct Kagome and Lieb lattices on superconducting qubits with heavy-hex connectivity. We identify two distinct types of noise-induced DTCs on Kagome and Lieb lattices, both arising from quantum noise in ancilla qubits. Type-I DTCs originate from robust boundary-mode period-doubling oscillations, stabilized by symmetry charge pumping, that are redistributed into the bulk due to ancilla noise. Type-II DTCs, in contrast, emerge in systems without charge-pumped qubits, where quantum noise unexpectedly stabilizes period-doubling oscillations that would otherwise rapidly decay. On the noisier Eagle device (ibm_kyiv), we observe both type-I and type-II DTCs on 53-qubit Kagome lattices with and without charge-pumped qubits, respectively. In contrast, on the lower-noise Heron device (ibm_marrakesh), period-doubling oscillations are confined to boundary-localized oscillations on 82-qubit Kagome and 40-qubit Lieb lattices, as redistribution into the bulk is suppressed. These experimental findings are supported by noisy matrix-product-state simulations, in which ancilla noise is modeled as random sign flips in the two-qubit gate rotation angles. Our results demonstrate that quantum noise in ancilla qubits can give rise to novel classes of prethermal dynamical phases, including boundary-protected and noise-induced DTCs.</description>

      <title>Theory of Crystallization versus Vitrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.14968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competition between crystallization and vitrification in glass-forming materials manifests as a non-monotonic behavior in the time-temperature transformation (TTT) diagrams, which quantify the time scales for crystallization as a function of temperature. We develop a coarse-grained lattice model, the Arrow-Potts model, to explore the physics behind this competition. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the model showcases non-monotonic TTT diagrams resulting in polycrystalline structures, with two distinct regimes limited by either crystal nucleation or growth. At high temperatures, crystallization is limited by nucleation and results in the growth of compact crystal grains. At low temperatures, crystal growth is influenced by glassy dynamics, and proceeds through dynamically heterogeneous and hierarchical relaxation pathways producing fractal and ramified crystals. To explain these phenomena, we combine the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami theory with the field theory of nucleation, a random walk theory for crystal growth, and the dynamical facilitation theory for glassy dynamics. The unified theory yields an analytical formula relating crystallization timescale to the nucleation and growth rates through universal exponents governing glassy dynamics of the model. We show that the formula with the universal exponents yields excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation data and thus, it also accounts for the non-monotonic TTT diagrams produced by the model. Both the model and theory can be used to understand structural ordering in various glassy systems including bulk metallic glass alloys, organic molecules, and colloidal suspensions.</description>

      <title>Hidden nonreciprocity as a stabilizing effective potential in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions are known to produce distinctive dynamics in active matter. To shed light on how the stationary state of such systems is affected by breaking reciprocity, we consider active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles coupled nonreciprocally by a transverse force, which is perpendicular to the gradient of the interaction energy. Focusing on the steady-state distribution of positions, we show that the nonreciprocal coupling helps keep the system at its stable configurations, including not only energy minima but also nonequilibrium configurations stabilized by the persistent noise which propels the particles. In contrast, the transverse force would not change the stationary distribution at all if the noise were thermal. For a variety of active systems, we demonstrate the stabilizing role of the nonreciprocity, finding that it stiffens springs, aligns spins, improves associative memory, and enhances motility-induced phase separation.</description>

Abstract: Ising model is famous in condensed matter and statistical physics. In this work we present a free-fermion formulation of the two-dimensional classical Ising models on the honeycomb, triangular and Kagom\'e lattices. Each Ising model is studied in the cases of a zero field and of an imaginary field $i(\pi/2){k_B}T$. We employ the decorated lattice technique, star-triangle transformation and weak-graph expansion method to exactly map each Ising model in both cases into an eight-vertex model on the square lattice. The resulting vertex weights are shown to satisfy the free-fermion condition. In the zero field case, each Ising model is an even free-fermion model. In the case of the imaginary field, the Ising model on the honeycomb lattice is an even free-fermion model while the models on the triangular and Kagom\'e lattices are odd free-fermion models. We obtain the exact solution of the Kagom\'e lattice Ising model under the imaginary field $i(\pi/2){k_B}T$, a result not previously reported in the literature. We also show that the frustrated Ising models on the triangular and Kagom\'e lattices in the imaginary field still exhibit a non-zero residual entropy.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature series expansion of square lattice Ising model: A study based on Fisher zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-temperature expansion of Ising model has long been a topic of significant interest in condensed matter and statistical physics. In this paper we present new results of the coefficients in the low-temperature series of the Ising partition function on the square lattice, in the cases of a zero field and of an imaginary field $i(\pi/2)k_BT$. The coefficients in the low-temperature series of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit are represented using the explicit expression of the density function of the Fisher zeros. The asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of the coefficients when the order goes to infinity is determined exactly, for both the series of the free energy and of the partition function. Our analytic and numerical results demonstrate that, the convergence radius of the sequence is dependent on the accumulation points of the Fisher zeros which have the smallest modulus. In the zero field case this accumulation point is the physical critical point, while in the imaginary field case it corresponds to a non-physical singularity. We further discuss the relation between the series coefficients and the energy state degeneracies, using the combinatorial expression of the coefficients and the subgraph expansion.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Tool to Analyse Spectroscopic Changes in High-Dimensional Data</title>

Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</description>

      <title>Beyond-classical computation in quantum simulation</title>

Abstract: Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. However, establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here, we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three-, and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable time frame. Thus, quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.</description>

      <title>Networks of neural networks: more is different</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The common thread behind the recent Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield and those conferred to Giorgio Parisi in 2021 and Philip Anderson in 1977 is disorder. Quoting Philip Anderson: "more is different". This principle has been extensively demonstrated in magnetic systems and spin glasses, and, in this work, we test its validity on Hopfield neural networks to show how an assembly of these models displays emergent capabilities that are not present at a single network level. Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs also pattern disentanglement. Namely, when inputted with a composite signal -- e.g., a musical chord -- it can return the single constituting elements -- e.g., the notes making up the chord. Here, restricting to notes coded as Rademacher vectors and chords that are their mixtures (i.e., spurious states), we use tools borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems to investigate this task, obtaining the conditions over the model control-parameters such that pattern disentanglement is successfully executed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R\'enyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</description>

      <title>The beginning of the endpoint bootstrap for conformal line defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A challenge in the study of conformal field theory (CFT) is to characterize the possible defects in specific bulk CFTs. Given the success of numerical bootstrap techniques applied to the characterization of bulk CFTs, it is desirable to develop similar tools to study conformal defects. In this work, we successfully demonstrate this possibility for endable conformal line defects. We achieve this by incorporating the endpoints of a conformal line defect into the numerical four-point bootstrap and exploit novel crossing symmetry relations that mix bulk and defect CFT data in a way that further possesses positivity, so that rigorous numerical bootstrap techniques are applicable. We implement this approach for the pinning field line defect of the $3d$ Ising CFT, obtaining estimates of its defect CFT data that agree well with other recent estimates, particularly those obtained via the fuzzy sphere regularization. An interesting consequence of our bounds is nearly rigorous evidence that the $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric defect exhibiting long range order obtained as a direct sum of two conjugate pinning field defects is unstable to domain wall proliferation.</description>

      <title>Modified rational six vertex model on a rectangular lattice : new formula, homogeneous and thermodynamic limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the work of Belliard, Pimenta and Slavnov (2024) studying the modified rational six vertex model. We find another formula of the partition function for the inhomogeneous model, in terms of a determinant that mix the modified Izergin one and a Vandermonde one. This expression enables us to compute the partition function in the homogeneous limit for the rectangular lattice, and then to study the thermodynamic limit. It leads to a new result, we obtain the first order of free energy with boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information-processing systems that coordinate multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have a much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</description>
