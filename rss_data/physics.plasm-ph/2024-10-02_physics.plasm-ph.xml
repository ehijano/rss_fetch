      <title>Triboplasma assisted chemical conversion in granular systems: a semi-analytic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-analytic model for a novel plasma-assisted chemical conversion pathway using triboplasmas generated in granular flows. Triboelectric charge relaxation is a well known phenomena where the potential generated from contact charging of particles exceeds the breakdown voltage of the background gas. In this work, we extend the triboelectric charge relaxation theory to include non equilibrium plasma energy and particle balance equations to predict the formation of dissociated and excited species that act as precursors to chemical conversion, for example in plasma-assisted ammonia synthesis. Our example case study with nitrogen background gas and teflon/aluminum tribomaterial system yielded high excited nitrogen species densities per collision that are comparable to current plasma-assisted conversion pathways. We also present a regime diagram for various gases where Paschen breakdown parameters are used to determine whether triboplasmas can be formed for a given effective work-function difference between two materials. Our sensitivity studies indicate particle velocity, particle radius, solids fraction and space charge effects play a critical role in overall plasma densities and excited species production.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition From Turbulence To Zonal Flows In The Hasegawa-Wakatani System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition between two-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence and quasi-one-dimensional zonostrophic turbulence is examined in the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani system, which is considered as a minimal model of $\beta$-plane-like drift-wave turbulence with an intrinsic instability. Extensive parameter scans were performed across a wide range of values for the adiabaticity parameter $C$ describing the strength of coupling between the two equations. A sharp transition from 2D isotropic turbulence to a quasi-1D system, dominated by zonal flows, is observed using the fraction of the kinetic energy of the zonal modes as the order parameter, at $C\approx0.1$. It is shown that this transition exhibits a hysteresis behaviour around the transition point, where the adiabaticity parameter plays the role of the control parameter of its non-linear self-organisation. It was also observed that the radial particle flux scales with the adiabaticity parameter following two different power law dependencies in the two regimes. A simple quasi-linear saturation rule, which accounts for the presence of zonal flows, is proposed, and is shown to agree very well with the observed nonlinear fluxes. Motivated by the phenomenon of quasi-one dimensionalisation of the system at high $C$, a number of reduction schemes based on a limited number of modes were investigated and the results were compared to direct numerical simulations. In particular, it was observed that a minimal reduced model consisting of 2 poloidal and 2 radial modes was able to replicate the phase transition behaviour, while further reduction failed to capture it.</description>

      <title>Magnetic mesh generation and field line reconstruction for scrape-off layer and divertor modeling in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of divertor targets and baffles for optimal heat and particle exhaust from magnetically confined fusion plasmas requires a combination of fast, low-fidelity models (such as EMC3-lite [1]) for scoping studies and high-fidelity ones (such as EMC3-EIRENE [2]) for verification. Both of those approaches benefit from a magnetic flux tube mesh for fast interpolation and mapping of field line segments [3]. A new mesh generator for unstructured quadrilateral flux tubes with adaptive refinement is presented and integrated into FLARE [4]. For HSX with an extended first wall, it is found that several layers of flux tubes can span the entire half field period before splitting is required. This is an advantage over the traditional setup of the EMC3-EIRENE mesh where careful construction of several sub-domains is required already for the much tighter present first wall. The divide and conquer paradigm with unstructured mesh layout offers a powerful alternative for integration into optimization workflows. Further examples for W7-X and CTH are presented.</description>

      <title>Superluminal spacetime boundary, time reflection and quantum light generation from relativistic plasma mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plasma mirror is an optical device for high-power, ultrashort-wavelength electromagnetic fields, utilizing a sheet of relativistic oscillating electrons to generate and manipulate light. In this work, we propose that the spatiotemporally varying plasma oscillation, induced by an ultra-high-intensity laser beam, functions as a "spacetime mirror" with significant potential for exploring quantum light. We find that the spacetime mirror exhibits several exotic features: (i) a superluminal spacetime boundary, (ii) time reflection and refraction, and (iii) quantum light sources with pair generation. Our theoretical and simulation results are in excellent agreement, and experimental verification is underway. Our work demonstrates the interplay with emerging fields such as time varying media, suggesting the plasma mirror as an ideal platform to study strong-field quantum optics at extremes.</description>

      <title>Detachment scalings derived from 1D scrape-off-layer simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fusion power plants will require detachment to mitigate sputtering and keep divertor heat fluxes at tolerable levels. Controlling detachment on these devices may require the use of real-time scrape-off-layer modeling to complement the limited set of available diagnostics. In this work, we use the configurable Hermes-3 edge modeling framework to perform time-dependent, fixed-fraction-impurity 1D detachment simulations. Although currently far from real-time, these simulations are used to investigate time-dependent effects and the minimum physics set required for control-relevant modeling. We show that these simulations reproduce the expected rollover of the target ion flux - a typical characteristic of detachment onset. We also perform scans of the input heat flux and impurity concentration and show that the steady-state results closely match the scalings predicted by the 0D time-independent Lengyel-Goedheer model. This allows us to indirectly compare to SOLPS simulations, which find a similar scaling but a lower value for the impurity concentration required for detachment for given upstream conditions. We use this result to suggest a series of improvements for the Hermes simulations, and finally show simulations demonstrating the impact of time-dependence.</description>

      <title>Multi-component multi-scale hydrodynamic plasma flow models in mechanical and thermal disequilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work is motivated by the mixing mechanism in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), which remarkably degrades the ignition performance. The mixing is a direct result of velocity disequilibrium and affected by temperature disequilibrium.To deal with these disequilibria, we propose a fully-disequilibrium hydrodynamic model (termed as Baer-Nunziato-Zeldovich model or BNZ model) with 9 equations, 4 temperatures (two for ions, and two for electrons), 4 pressures (two for ions, and two for electrons) and 2 ion velocities for two-component dense plasma flows. The model can be used for describing both grain and atomic mixing by choosing corresponding relaxation mechanism. The derivation starts from a multi-component conservative entropy-dissipative Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model to obtain a 14-equation model. It is then reduced to more practical 9-equation BNZ model and further to simpler 8-equation model, 6-equation model (the Kapila-Zeldovich model or the KZ model), and the 5-equation model. The reductions are performed on the basis of various relaxation time evaluations, the plasma neutrality and the smallness of the electron mass. The models are thermodynamics-compatible, and capable of dealing with mechanical and thermal disequilibria at both atomic and grain scales. Moreover, the corresponding hydrodynamic subsystems are shown to be hyperbolic and solved with the Godunov finite volume method. The BNZ model and solution methods are verified and validated by some benchmark problems and 1D-2D comparisons. We then consider the velocity, pressure and temperature disequilibria during the passage of an ablation shock in ICF.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Guiding-Center Motion: Action Principle, Kinetic Theory, and Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We treat the guiding-center dynamics in a varying external Maxwell field using a relativistically covariant action principle which reproduces the known Vandervoort expression for the drift velocity and extends it to curved spacetime. We derive the corresponding kinetic theory and ideal hydrodynamic theory. In contrast to conventional five-equation hydrodynamics, the guiding-center hydrodynamics needs only three equations due to a constraint on the motion across magnetic field. We argue that such a hydrodynamics is applicable to strongly coupled plasmas where kinetic theory fails.</description>
