      <title>A Generative AI-driven Metadata Modelling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since decades, the modelling of metadata has been core to the functioning of any academic library. Its importance has only enhanced with the increasing pervasiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven information activities and services which constitute a library's outreach. However, with the rising importance of metadata, there arose several outstanding problems with the process of designing a library metadata model impacting its reusability, crosswalk and interoperability with other metadata models. This paper posits that the above problems stem from an underlying thesis that there should only be a few core metadata models which would be necessary and sufficient for any information service using them, irrespective of the heterogeneity of intra-domain or inter-domain settings. To that end, this paper advances a contrary view of the above thesis and substantiates its argument in three key steps. First, it introduces a novel way of thinking about a library metadata model as an ontology-driven composition of five functionally interlinked representation levels from perception to its intensional definition via properties. Second, it introduces the representational manifoldness implicit in each of the five levels which cumulatively contributes to a conceptually entangled library metadata model. Finally, and most importantly, it proposes a Generative AI-driven Human-Large Language Model (LLM) collaboration based metadata modelling approach to disentangle the entanglement inherent in each representation level leading to the generation of a conceptually disentangled metadata model. Throughout the paper, the arguments are exemplified by motivating scenarios and examples from representative libraries handling cancer information.</description>

      <title>AICat: An AI Cataloguing Approach to Support the EU AI Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) requires providers and deployers of high-risk AI applications to register their systems into the EU database, wherein the information should be represented and maintained in an easily-navigable and machine-readable manner. Given the uptake of open data and Semantic Web-based approaches for other EU repositories, in particular the use of the Data Catalogue vocabulary Application Profile (DCAT-AP), a similar solution for managing the EU database of high-risk AI systems is needed. This paper introduces AICat - an extension of DCAT for representing catalogues of AI systems that provides consistency, machine-readability, searchability, and interoperability in managing open metadata regarding AI systems. This open approach to cataloguing ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability in AI application markets beyond the immediate needs of high-risk AI compliance in the EU. AICat is available online at https://w3id.org/aicat under the CC-BY-4.0 license.</description>

      <title>Graph Analysis of Citation and Co-authorship Networks of Egyptian Authors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current research conducts a comprehensive analysis of citation networks focusing on publications by authors affiliated with Egyptian institutions. Leveraging the Semantic Scholar platform and its API, a citation network and a co-authorship network graphs are constructed to visualize the interconnections among these publications and their authors. This is done using the Python package for graph analysis (Networkx). The primary objective is to identify influential Egyptian publications and assess the centrality of nodes within the citation network. Through meticulous data collection including web scraping techniques, we obtained a cleaned dataset comprising publications by authors affiliated with Egyptian institutions. The analysis addresses challenges related to data quality, technical intricacies, and time constraints, resulting in a reliable and robust dataset. The findings provide valuable information on the impact of Egyptian publications, offering insights into the scholarly influence of authors associated with Egyptian institutions. This research equips researchers and academics interested in evaluating the impact of Egyptian publications with valuable data for future studies, collaborations, and policy decisions.</description>

      <title>LLM4SR: A Survey on Large Language Models for Scientific Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of scientific research, offering unprecedented support across various stages of the research cycle. This paper presents the first systematic survey dedicated to exploring how LLMs are revolutionizing the scientific research process. We analyze the unique roles LLMs play across four critical stages of research: hypothesis discovery, experiment planning and implementation, scientific writing, and peer reviewing. Our review comprehensively showcases the task-specific methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. By identifying current challenges and proposing future research directions, this survey not only highlights the transformative potential of LLMs, but also aims to inspire and guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging LLMs to advance scientific inquiry.

      <title>Hidden Entity Detection from GitHub Leveraging Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Named entity recognition is an important task when constructing knowledge bases from unstructured data sources. Whereas entity detection methods mostly rely on extensive training data, Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way towards approaches that rely on zero-shot learning (ZSL) or few-shot learning (FSL) by taking advantage of the capabilities LLMs acquired during pretraining. Specifically, in very specialized scenarios where large-scale training data is not available, ZSL / FSL opens new opportunities. This paper follows this recent trend and investigates the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in such scenarios to automatically detect datasets and software within textual content from GitHub repositories. While existing methods focused solely on named entities, this study aims to broaden the scope by incorporating resources such as repositories and online hubs where entities are also represented by URLs. The study explores different FSL prompt learning approaches to enhance the LLMs' ability to identify dataset and software mentions within repository texts. Through analyses of LLM effectiveness and learning strategies, this paper offers insights into the potential of advanced language models for automated entity detection.</description>

      <title>Forecasting high-impact research topics via machine learning on evolving knowledge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential growth in scientific publications poses a severe challenge for human researchers. It forces attention to more narrow sub-fields, which makes it challenging to discover new impactful research ideas and collaborations outside one's own field. While there are ways to predict a scientific paper's future citation counts, they need the research to be finished and the paper written, usually assessing impact long after the idea was conceived. Here we show how to predict the impact of onsets of ideas that have never been published by researchers. For that, we developed a large evolving knowledge graph built from more than 21 million scientific papers. It combines a semantic network created from the content of the papers and an impact network created from the historic citations of papers. Using machine learning, we can predict the dynamic of the evolving network into the future with high accuracy (AUC values beyond 0.9 for most experiments), and thereby the impact of new research directions. We envision that the ability to predict the impact of new ideas will be a crucial component of future artificial muses that can inspire new impactful and interesting scientific ideas.</description>

      <title>Interesting Scientific Idea Generation using Knowledge Graphs and LLMs: Evaluations with 100 Research Group Leaders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to identify novel and impactful ideas, especially across disciplines. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems offer new approaches, potentially inspiring ideas not conceived by humans alone. But how compelling are these AI-generated ideas, and how can we improve their quality? Here, we introduce SciMuse, which uses 58 million research papers and a large-language model to generate research ideas. We conduct a large-scale evaluation in which over 100 research group leaders -- from natural sciences to humanities -- ranked more than 4,400 personalized ideas based on their interest. This data allows us to predict research interest using (1) supervised neural networks trained on human evaluations, and (2) unsupervised zero-shot ranking with large-language models. Our results demonstrate how future systems can help generating compelling research ideas and foster unforeseen interdisciplinary collaborations.</description>

      <title>Ten (or more!) reasons to register your software with the Astrophysics Source Code Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This presentation covered the benefits of registering astronomy research software with the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL, ascl.net), a free online registry for software used in astronomy research. Indexed by ADS and Clarivate's Web of Science, the ASCL currently contains over 3600 codes, and its entries have been cited over 17,000 times. Registering your code with the ASCL is easy with our online submissions system. Making your software available for examination shows confidence in your research and makes your research more transparent, reproducible, and falsifiable. ASCL registration allows your software to be cited on its own merits and provides a citation method that is trackable and accepted by all astronomy journals, and by journals such as \textit{Science} and \textit{Nature}. Adding your code to the ASCL also allows others to find your code more easily, as it can then be found not only in the ASCL itself, but also in ADS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.</description>
