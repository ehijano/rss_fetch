      <title>Rigorous Bound on the Violation of Dynamic Reciprocity Induced by Four-Wave Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic reciprocity imposes stringent performance constraints on nonlinear optical devices such as isolators and circulators. The seminal result by Shi et al. establishes that nonlinear optical devices relying on the intensity-dependent refractive index obey dynamic reciprocity for small signals with spectrally distinct fields. However, it has also been recognized that it is possible to violate dynamic reciprocity by exploiting frequency mixing processes. In this paper, we establish a rigorous upper bound on this violation that is independent of device geometry. We demonstrate that this bound captures the parameter scalings of realizable physical systems, and that under some conditions dynamic reciprocity violation can grow unbounded to achieve arbitrary nonlinear isolation. These results provide an analytically robust version of dynamic reciprocity, as well as theoretical guidance for the development of power efficient nonlinear optical isolators and circulators.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the Third Harmonic Generation Efficiency of ITO nanolayers coupled to Tamm Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the enhancement of third harmonic generation in indium tin oxide nanolayers coupled to Tamm plasmon polaritons (TPPs). The TPPs are excited at the interface between a thin gold mirror and a silicon dioxide/silicon nitride (SiO2/Si3N4) distributed Bragg reflector with a 30nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) nanolayer embedded in hte topmost dielectric layer under the metal mirror. This ITO nanolayer exhibits epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) behavior at nearinfrared wavelengths. By tuning the angle of incidence and resonance conditions, we achieve strong confinement and localization of the electromagnetic field at the TPP mode, which significantly boosts the local electric field and the nonlinear optical response of the structure. Our experiments reveal that the third harmonic generation (THG) efficiency is maximized when the TPP resonance coincides with the ENZ wavelength (i.e., the wavelength at which the real part of the ITO permittivity vanishes) of the ITO, resulting in a tenfold enhancement of the measured THG efficiency compared to a bare ITO nanolayer. We further investigate the dependence of the THG signal on the incident angle and sample orientation, confirming that the enhancement is directly related to the excitation of the TPP mode with nonreciprocal behaviour. Numerical simulations based on the transfer matrix method (TMM) support our findings. Our study demonstrates that the TPP-ENZ platform offers a versatile and highly efficient approach to enhancing nonlinear optical processes, with potential applications in frequency conversion, optical signal processing, and the development of quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of cathodoluminescence from photon statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.</description>

      <title>Rabi frequency for polar systems interacting with light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of polar systems coupled to classical external beams in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The permanent dipole moments (PDMs) sustained by polar systems can couple to the electromagnetic field, giving rise to a variety of processes such as difference-frequency and harmonic generation, reflected in complicated dynamics of the atomic system. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics can be described simply in a dynamic reference frame. We derive a Jaynes-Cummings-like framework with effective parameters describing frequency shift, coupling strength with the driving field, and a rescaled relaxation rate. The familiar linear scaling of the interaction strength with the field amplitude is replaced with a nonlinear dependence, suggesting potential applications for improving the coherence of quantum system ensembles with permanent dipoles.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of partially occluded objects with a physics-driven self-training neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach utilizing a physics-informed deep learning (DL) algorithm to reconstruct occluded objects in a terahertz (THz) holographic system. Taking the angular spectrum theory as prior knowledge, we generate a dataset consisting of a series of diffraction patterns that contain information about the objects. This dataset, combined with unlabeled data measured from experiments, are used for the self-training of a physics-informed neural network (NN). During the training process, the neural network iteratively predicts the outcomes of the unlabeled data and reincorporates these results back into the training set. This recursive strategy not only reduces noise but also minimizes mutual interference during object reconstruction, demonstrating its effectiveness even in data-scarce situations. The method has been validated with both simulated and experimental data, showcasing its significant potential to advance the field of terahertz three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Additionally, it sets a new benchmark for rapid, reference-free, and cost-effective power detection.</description>

      <title>Optical activation function using a metamaterial waveguide for an all-optical neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we experimentally demonstrated that the nonlinear optical coefficient of the original Si can be enhanced by incorporating a metamaterial structure into an existing silicon waveguide. The two-photon absorption coefficient enhanced by the metamaterial structure was 424 cm/GW, which is 1.2x10^3 times higher than that of Si. Using this metamaterial waveguide-based nonlinear optical activation function, we achieved a high inference accuracy of 98.36% in the handwritten character recognition task, comparable to that obtained with the ReLU function as the activation function. Therefore, our approach can contribute to the realization of more power-efficient and compact all-optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the enhanced photonic spin Hall effect in a subwavelength grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) structures has great potential for various polarization-sensitive applications and devices. Here, using optical weak measurement, we observe spin-dependent and spin-independent angular shifts of the reflected beam, enhanced by SPR in a subwavelength nickel grating. An enhanced in-plane photonic spin Hall effect manifested in the angular splitting of circularly polarized photons with opposite helicity signs is demonstrated. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that angular in-plane shifts can be changed from spin-independent (Goos-Hanchen shift) to spin-dependent (PSHE) when the incident beam polarization state changes. The SPR-induced depolarization of light and the mixing of polarization states are analyzed. High purity of spin separation and a high degree of circular polarization are achieved with an optimal polarization state (preselection angle) and a resonance angle of incidence. The spineless spatial separation of two orthogonal components of the field with diagonal linear polarizations is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance of the ALPS II Regeneration Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Regeneration Cavity (RC) is a critical component of the Any Light Particle Search II (ALPS II) experiment. It increases the signal from possible axions and axion-like particles in the experiment by nearly four orders of magnitude. The total round-trip optical losses of the power circulating in the cavity must be minimized in order to maximize the resonant enhancement of the cavity, which is an important figure of merit for ALPS II. Lower optical losses also increase the cavity storage time and with the 123 meter long ALPS II RC we have demonstrated the longest storage time of a two-mirror optical cavity. We measured a storage time of $7.17 \pm 0.01$ ms, equivalent to a linewidth of 44.4 Hz and a finesse of 27,500 at a wavelength of 1064 nm.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Based Construction of Molecular Potential and Its Application in Exploring the Deep-Lying-Orbital Effect in HighOrder Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract. Creating soft-Coulomb-type (SC) molecular potential within single-active-electron approximation (SAE) is essential since it allows solving time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with fewer computational resources compared to other multielectron methods. The current available SC potentials can accurately reproduce the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is sufficient for analyzing nonlinear effects in laser-molecule interactions like high-order harmonic generation (HHG). However, recent discoveries of significant effects of deep-lying molecular orbitals call for more precise potentials to analyze them. In this study, we present a fast and accurate method based on machine learning to construct SC potentials that simultaneously reproduce various molecular features, including energies, symmetries, and dipole moments of HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2. We use this ML model to create SC SAE potentials of the HCN molecule and then comprehensively analyze the fingerprints of lower-lying orbitals in HHG spectra emitted during the H-CN stretching. Our findings reveal that HOMO-1 plays a role in forming the second HHG plateau. Additionally, as the H-C distance increases, the plateau structure and the smoothness of HHG spectra are altered due to the redistribution of orbital electron density. These results are in line with other experimental and theoretical studies. Lastly, the machine learning approach using deconvolution and convolution neural networks in the present study is so general that it can be applied to construct molecular potential for other molecules and molecular dynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Spatio-spectral control of spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme aimed at achieving spatio-spectral control over spontaneous emission within a four-level atom-light coupling system interacting with optical vortices carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). The atom comprises a ground level and two excited states coupled with two laser fields, forming a V subsystem where the upper states exclusively decay to a common fourth state via two channels. By investigating various initial states of the atom and considering the presence or absence of quantum interference in spontaneous emission channels, we analyze how the characteristics of the OAM-carrying vortex beam imprint onto the emission spectrum. The interplay between the optical vortex and the quantum system, including its environment modes, induces a wide variety of spatio-spectral behaviour, including two-dimensional spectral-peak narrowing, spectralpeak enhancement, spectral-peak suppression, and spontaneous emission reduction or quenching in the spatial azimuthal plane. Our findings shed light on the dynamics of atom-vortex beam light interactions and offer insights into the manipulation of emission properties at the quantum level.</description>

      <title>Attractive-repulsive interaction in coupled quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergent dynamics of quantum self-sustained oscillators induced by the simultaneous presence of attraction and repulsion in the coupling path. We consider quantum Stuart-Landau oscillators under attractive-repulsive coupling and construct the corresponding quantum master equation in the Lindblad form. We discover an interesting symmetry-breaking transition from quantum limit cycle oscillation to quantum inhomogeneous steady state; This transition is contrary to the previously known symmetry-breaking transition from quantum homogeneous to inhomogeneous steady state. The result is supported by the analysis on the noisy classical model of the quantum system in the weak quantum regime. Remarkably, we find the generation of entanglement associated with the symmetry-breaking transition that has no analogue in the classical domain. This study will enrich our understanding of the collective behaviors shown by coupled oscillators in the quantum domain.</description>

      <title>General Intelligent Imaging and Uncertainty Quantification by Deterministic Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational imaging is crucial in many disciplines from autonomous driving to life sciences. However, traditional model-driven and iterative methods consume large computational power and lack scalability for imaging. Deep learning (DL) is effective in processing local-to-local patterns, but it struggles with handling universal global-to-local (nonlocal) patterns under current frameworks. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel DL framework that employs a progressive denoising strategy, named the deterministic diffusion model (DDM), to facilitate general computational imaging at a low cost. We experimentally demonstrate the efficient and faithful image reconstruction capabilities of DDM from nonlocal patterns, such as speckles from multimode fiber and intensity patterns of second harmonic generation, surpassing the capability of previous state-of-the-art DL algorithms. By embedding Bayesian inference into DDM, we establish a theoretical framework and provide experimental proof of its uncertainty quantification. This advancement ensures the predictive reliability of DDM, avoiding misjudgment in high-stakes scenarios. This versatile and integrable DDM framework can readily extend and improve the efficacy of existing DL-based imaging applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-optical helicity-independent switching (AO-HIS) is of interest for ultrafast and energy efficient magnetic switching in future magnetic data storage approaches. Yet, to achieve high bit density magnetic recording it is necessary to reduce the size of the magnetic bits addressed by laser pulses at well-controlled positions. Metallic nanostructures that support localized surface plasmons enable spatial electromagnetic confinement well below the diffraction limit and rare-earth transition metal alloys such as GdTbCo have demonstrated nanometre-sized stable domains. Here, we deposit plasmonic gold nanostructures on a GdTbCo film and probe the magnetic state using magnetic force microscopy. We observe localized AO-HIS down to a critical dimension of 240 nm after excitation of the gold nanostructures by a single 370 fs long laser pulse with a centre wavelength of 1030 nm. We demonstrate that the strong localization of optical fields through plasmonic nanostructures enables reproducible localized nanoscale AO-HIS at sub-wavelength length scales. We study the influence of the localized electromagnetic field enhancement by the plasmonic nanostructures on the required fluence to switch the magnetization.</description>

Abstract: Fluorescence collection from individual emitters plays a key role in state detection and remote entanglement generation, fundamental functionalities in many quantum platforms. Planar photonics have been demonstrated for robust and scalable addressing of trapped-ion systems, motivating consideration of similar elements for the complementary challenge of photon collection. Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize a diffractive collection element operating at $\lambda=397$ nm predicted to offer a total 0.25\% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode. A more efficient design with more demanding fabrication requirements would offer $1.14\%$, and we indicate avenues to improved devices approaching the limits predicted for ideal beams. We point out a particularly simple integrated waveguide configuration for polarization-based remote entanglement generation enabled by integrated collection.</description>

      <title>Low-light phase retrieval with implicit generative priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase retrieval (PR) is fundamentally important in scientific imaging and is crucial for nanoscale techniques like coherent diffractive imaging (CDI). Low radiation dose imaging is essential for applications involving radiation-sensitive samples. However, most PR methods struggle in low-dose scenarios due to high shot noise. Recent advancements in optical data acquisition setups, such as in-situ CDI, have shown promise for low-dose imaging, but they rely on a time series of measurements, making them unsuitable for single-image applications. Similarly, data-driven phase retrieval techniques are not easily adaptable to data-scarce situations. Zero-shot deep learning methods based on pre-trained and implicit generative priors have been effective in various imaging tasks but have shown limited success in PR. In this work, we propose low-dose deep image prior (LoDIP), which combines in-situ CDI with the power of implicit generative priors to address single-image low-dose phase retrieval. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate LoDIP's superior performance in this task and its applicability to real experimental scenarios.</description>
