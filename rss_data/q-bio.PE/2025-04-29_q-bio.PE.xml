      <title>Mantodea phylogenomics provides new insights into X-chromosome progression and evolutionary radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Praying mantises, members of the order Mantodea, play important roles in agriculture, medicine, bionics, and entertainment. However, the scarcity of genomic resources has hindered extensive studies on mantis evolution and behaviour. Results: Here, we present the chromosome-scale reference genomes of five mantis species: the European mantis (Mantis religiosa), Chinese mantis (Tenodera sinensis), triangle dead leaf mantis (Deroplatys truncata), orchid mantis (Hymenopus coronatus), and metallic mantis (Metallyticus violaceus). We found that transposable element expansion is the major force governing genome size in Mantodea. Based on whole-alignments, we deduced that the Mantodea ancestor may have had only one X chromosome and that translocations between the X chromosome and an autosome may have occurred in the lineage of the superfamily Mantoidea. Furthermore, we found a lower evolutionary rate for the metallic mantis than for the other mantises. We also found that Mantodea underwent rapid radiation after the K-Pg mass extinction event, which could have contributed to the confusion in species classification. Conclusions: We present the chromosome-scale reference genomes of five mantis species to reveal the X-chromosome evolution, clarify the phylogeny relationship, and transposable element expansion.</description>

      <title>The two-clock problem in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological time can be measured in two ways: in generations and in physical time. When generation intervals differ between individuals, these two clocks diverge, which impedes our ability to relate mathematical models to real populations. In this paper we show that nevertheless, these disparate clocks become equivalent in the long run via a simple identity relating generational and physical time. This equivalence allows us to directly translate statements from mathematical models to the physical world and vice versa. As an application, we obtain a generalized Euler-Lotka equation linking the basic reproduction number $R_0$ to the growth rate, and derive several information-theoretic bounds on these quantities. We also show how the fitness of a lineage can be defined consistently in population models, with applications to microbial growth, epidemiology and population biology.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Levins metapopulation model to time varying colonization and extinction rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metapopulation theory explores the population persistence in fragmented habitats by considering a balance between the extinction of local populations and recolonization of empty sites. In general, the extinction and colonization rates have been considered as constant parameters and the novelty of this paper is to assume that they are subject to deterministic variations. We noticed that an averaging approach proposed by C. Puccia and R. Levins can be adapted to construct the upper and lower averages of the difference between the extinction and colonization rates, whose sign is useful to determine either the permanence or the extinction of the metapopulation. In fact, we use these averages to revisit the classical model introduced by R. Levins. From a mathematical perspective, these averages can be seen as Bohl exponents whereas the corresponding analysis is carried out by using tools of non autonomous dynamics. Last but not least, compared with the Levins model, the resulting dynamics of the time varying model shares the persistence/extinction scenario when the above stated upper and lower averages have the same sign but also raises open questions about metapopulation persistence in the case of the averages have different sign.</description>

      <title>DLCM: a versatile multi-level solver for heterogeneous multicellular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational modeling of multicellular systems may aid in untangling cellular dynamics and emergent properties of biological cell populations. A key challenge is to balance the level of model detail and the computational efficiency, while using physically interpretable parameters to facilitate meaningful comparisons with biological data.
  For this purpose, we present the DLCM-solver (discrete Laplacian cell mechanics), a flexible and efficient computational solver for spatial and stochastic simulations of populations of cells, developed from first principle to support mechanistic investigations. The solver has been designed as a module in URDME, the unstructured reaction-diffusion master equation open software framework, to allow for the integration of intra-cellular models with extra-cellular features handled by the DLCM. The solver manages discrete cells on a fixed lattice and reaction-transport events in a continuous-time Markov chain. Space-continuous micro-environment quantities such as pressure and chemical substances are supported by the framework, permitting a variety of modeling choices concerning chemotaxis, mechanotaxis, nutrient-driven cell growth and death, among others.
  An essential and novel feature of the DLCM-solver is the coupling of cellular pressure to the curvature of the cell populations by elliptic projection onto the computational grid, with which we can include effects from surface tension between populations.
  We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by implementing benchmark problems of cell sorting, cellular signaling, tumor growth, and chemotaxis models. We additionally formally analyze the computational complexity and show that it is theoretically optimal for systems based on pressure-driven cell migration. In summary, the solver balances efficiency and a relatively fine resolution, while supporting a high level of interpretability.</description>

      <title>Computational Typology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typology is a subfield of linguistics that focuses on the study and classification of languages based on their structural features. Unlike genealogical classification, which examines the historical relationships between languages, typology seeks to understand the diversity of human languages by identifying common properties and patterns, known as universals. In recent years, computational methods have played an increasingly important role in typological research, enabling the analysis of large-scale linguistic data and the testing of hypotheses about language structure and evolution. This article provides an illustration of the benefits of computational statistical modeling in typology.</description>
