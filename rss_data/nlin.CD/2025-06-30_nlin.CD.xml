      <title>Collective oscillations in the finite-size Kuramoto model below the critical coupling: shot-noise approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model, a paradigmatic framework for studying synchronization, exhibits a transition to collective oscillations only above a critical coupling strength in the thermodynamic limit. However, real-world systems are finite, and their dynamics can deviate significantly from mean-field predictions. Here, we investigate finite-size effects in the Kuramoto model below the critical coupling, where the infinite-size theory predicts complete asynchrony. Using a shot-noise approach, we derive analytically the power spectrum of emergent collective oscillations and demonstrate their dependence on the coupling strength. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results, though deviations arise near the critical coupling due to nonlinear effects. Our findings reveal how finite-size fluctuations sustain synchronization in regimes where classical mean-field theories fail, offering insights for applications in neural networks, power grids, and other coupled oscillator systems.</description>

      <title>Modelling the non-linear dynamics of the looping pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Looping pendulum phenomenon was first introduced in 2019 at the 32nd edition of the IYPT, wherein a lighter bob sweeps around a cylindrical rod to support the weight of a heavier bob. In this paper, the phenomenon was divided based on rotating and non-rotating forces, and differential equations were derived for each. To verify the theoretical derivation, an experimental analysis was done, varying the mass ratio with the vertical distance travelled by the heavier bob. (Tracked using tracker) Experimental findings fit a logarithmic curve fit -- falling succinctly with a similar trend with the simulation run with MATLAB solving the derived differential equations. Furthermore, to verify the simulation, the trajectory of both the lighter and heavier mass was also compared for the simulation and experimental findings. The experimental findings fit very closely to the simulation findings, accrediting the validity and accuracy of the derived theory.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum reservoir computers for forecasting chaotic dynamics: generalized synchronization and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words, quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems. Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion $GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.</description>
