      <title>Characterizing Online Toxicity During the 2022 Mpox Outbreak: A Computational Analysis of Topical and Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Online toxicity, encompassing behaviors such as harassment, bullying, hate speech, and the dissemination of misinformation, has become a pressing social concern in the digital age. The 2022 Mpox outbreak, initially termed "Monkeypox" but subsequently renamed to mitigate associated stigmas and societal concerns, serves as a poignant backdrop to this issue. Objective: In this research, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the toxic online discourse surrounding the 2022 Mpox outbreak. Our objective is to dissect its origins, characterize its nature and content, trace its dissemination patterns, and assess its broader societal implications, with the goal of providing insights that can inform strategies to mitigate such toxicity in future crises. Methods: We collected more than 1.6 million unique tweets and analyzed them from five dimensions, including context, extent, content, speaker, and intent. Utilizing BERT-based topic modeling and social network community clustering, we delineated the toxic dynamics on Twitter. Results: We identified five high-level topic categories in the toxic online discourse on Twitter, including disease (46.6%), health policy and healthcare (19.3%), homophobia (23.9%), politics (6.0%), and racism (4.1%). Through the toxicity diffusion networks of mentions, retweets, and the top users, we found that retweets of toxic content were widespread, while influential users rarely engaged with or countered this toxicity through retweets. Conclusions: By tracking topical dynamics, we can track the changing popularity of toxic content online, providing a better understanding of societal challenges. Network dynamics spotlight key social media influencers and their intents, indicating that addressing these central figures in toxic discourse can enhance crisis communication and inform policy-making.</description>

      <title>Let Community Rules Be Reflected in Online Content Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content moderation is a widely used strategy to prevent the dissemination of irregular information on social media platforms. Despite extensive research on developing automated models to support decision-making in content moderation, there remains a notable scarcity of studies that integrate the rules of online communities into content moderation. This study addresses this gap by proposing a community rule-based content moderation framework that directly integrates community rules into the moderation of user-generated content. Our experiment results with datasets collected from two domains demonstrate the superior performance of models based on the framework to baseline models across all evaluation metrics. In particular, incorporating community rules substantially enhances model performance in content moderation. The findings of this research have significant research and practical implications for improving the effectiveness and generalizability of content moderation models in online communities.</description>

      <title>Decoding Decentralized Finance Transactions through Ego Network Motif Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is increasingly studied and adopted for its potential to provide accessible and transparent financial services. Analyzing how investors use DeFi is important for reaching a better understanding of their usage and for regulation purposes. However, analyzing DeFi transactions is challenging due to often incomplete or inaccurate labeled data. This paper presents a method to extract ego network motifs from the token transfer network, capturing the transfer of tokens between users and smart contracts. Our results demonstrate that smart contract methods performing specific DeFi operations can be efficiently identified by analyzing these motifs while providing insights into account activities.</description>

      <title>Controllability and Observability of Temporal Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous complex systems, such as those arisen in ecological networks, genomic contact networks, and social networks, exhibit higher-order and time-varying characteristics, which can be effectively modeled using temporal hypergraphs. However, analyzing and controlling temporal hypergraphs poses significant challenges due to their inherent time-varying and nonlinear nature, while most existing methods predominantly target static hypergraphs. In this article, we generalize the notions of controllability and observability to temporal hypergraphs by leveraging tensor and nonlinear systems theory. Specifically, we establish tensor-based rank conditions to determine the weak controllability and observability of temporal hypergraphs. The proposed framework is further demonstrated with synthetic and real-world examples.</description>

      <title>An evidence-accumulating drift-diffusion model of competing information spread on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an agent-based model of information spread, grounded on psychological insights on the formation and spread of beliefs. In our model, we consider a network of individuals who share two opposing types of information on a specific topic (e.g., pro- vs. anti-vaccine stances), and the accumulation of evidence supporting either type of information is modelled by means of a drift-diffusion process. After formalising the model, we put forward a campaign of Monte Carlo simulations to identify population-wide behaviours emerging from agents' exposure to different sources of information, investigating the impact of the number and persistence of such sources, and the role of the network structure through which the individuals interact. We find similar emergent behaviours for all network structures considered. When there is a single type of information, the main observed emergent behaviour is consensus. When there are opposing information sources, both consensus or polarisation can result; the latter occurs if the number and persistence of the sources exceeds some threshold values. Importantly, we find the emergent behaviour is mainly influenced by how long the information sources are present for, as opposed to how many sources there are.</description>

      <title>Looking AT the Blue Skies of Bluesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pitfalls of centralized social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter/X, have led to concerns about control, transparency, and accountability. Decentralized social networks have emerged as a result with the goal of empowering users. These decentralized approaches come with their own tradeoffs, and therefore multiple architectures exist. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale analysis of Bluesky, a prominent decentralized microblogging platform. In contrast to alternative approaches (e.g. Mastodon), Bluesky decomposes and opens the key functions of the platform into subcomponents that can be provided by third party stakeholders. We collect a comprehensive dataset covering all the key elements of Bluesky, study user activity and assess the diversity of providers for each sub-components.</description>

      <title>Node classification in networks via simplicial interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the node classification task, it is natural to presume that densely connected nodes tend to exhibit similar attributes. Given this, it is crucial to first define what constitutes a dense connection and to develop a reliable mathematical tool for assessing node cohesiveness. In this paper, we propose a probability-based objective function for semi-supervised node classification that takes advantage of higher-order networks' capabilities. The proposed function reflects the philosophy aligned with the intuition behind classifying within higher order networks, as it is designed to reduce the likelihood of nodes interconnected through higher-order networks bearing different labels. Additionally, we propose the Stochastic Block Tensor Model (SBTM) as a graph generation model designed specifically to address a significant limitation of the traditional stochastic block model, which does not adequately represent the distribution of higher-order structures in real networks. We evaluate the objective function using networks generated by the SBTM, which include both balanced and imbalanced scenarios. Furthermore, we present an approach that integrates the objective function with graph neural network (GNN)-based semi-supervised node classification methodologies, aiming for additional performance gains. Our results demonstrate that in challenging classification scenarios-characterized by a low probability of homo-connections, a high probability of hetero-connections, and limited prior node information-models based on the higher-order network outperform pairwise interaction-based models. Furthermore, experimental results suggest that integrating our proposed objective function with existing GNN-based node classification approaches enhances classification performance by efficiently learning higher-order structures distributed in the network.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Latent Arguments in Social Media Messaging by Employing LLMs-in-the-Loop Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of social media has led to a surge in popularity for automated methods of analyzing public opinion. Supervised methods are adept at text categorization, yet the dynamic nature of social media discussions poses a continual challenge for these techniques due to the constant shifting of the focus. On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting themes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching patterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant portion of research into social media discourse still depends on labor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach, which are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of discovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic LLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging. To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k Facebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads with 14 themes. Additionally, we design a downstream task as stance prediction by leveraging talking points in climate debates. Furthermore, we analyze demographic targeting and the adaptation of messaging based on real-world events.</description>
