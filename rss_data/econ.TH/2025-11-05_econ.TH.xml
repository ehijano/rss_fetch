      <title>Mediation and worker performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study how a firm uses mediated communication with a worker and its clients to maximize worker performance over time. I find that optimal mediation involves occasional randomizations, secret from clients, between two continuations. In one, the worker cuts corner and then retains his current continuation utility. In the other, the worker exerts effort and then receives the highest continuation equilibrium utility less a minimal penalty for underperformance. These randomizations eventually disappear, replaced by canonical carrot-and-stick incentives. Optimal mediation Pareto-improves upon no mediation for both the worker and the average client if and only if the worker is sufficiently patient.</description>

      <title>Automation and Task Allocation Under Asymmetric Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A firm can complete the tasks needed to produce output using either machines or workers. Unlike machines, workers have private information about their preferences over tasks. I study how this information asymmetry shapes the mechanism used by the firm to allocate tasks across workers and machines. I identify important qualitative differences between the mechanisms used when information frictions are large versus small. When information frictions are small, tasks are substitutes: automating one task lowers the marginal cost of other tasks and reduces the surplus generated by workers. When frictions are large, tasks can become complements: automation can raise the marginal cost of other tasks and increase the surplus generated by workers. The results extend to a setting with multiple firms competing for workers.</description>

      <title>On Three-Layer Data Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a three-layer data market comprising users (data owners), platforms, and a data buyer. Each user benefits from platform services in exchange for data, incurring privacy loss when their data, albeit noisily, is shared with the buyer. The user chooses platforms to share data with, while platforms decide on data noise levels and pricing before selling to the buyer. The buyer selects platforms to purchase data from. We model these interactions via a multi-stage game, focusing on the subgame Nash equilibrium. We find that when the buyer places a high value on user data (and platforms can command high prices), all platforms offer services to the user who joins and shares data with every platform. Conversely, when the buyer's valuation of user data is low, only large platforms with low service costs can afford to serve users. In this scenario, users exclusively join and share data with these low-cost platforms. Interestingly, increased competition benefits the buyer, not the user: as the number of platforms increases, the user utility does not necessarily improve while the buyer utility improves. However, increasing the competition improves the overall utilitarian welfare. Building on our analysis, we then study regulations to improve the user utility. We discover that banning data sharing maximizes user utility only when all platforms are low-cost. In mixed markets of high- and low-cost platforms, users prefer a minimum noise mandate over a sharing ban. Imposing this mandate on high-cost platforms and banning data sharing for low-cost ones further enhances user utility.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Nash Reversion Strategies: Three Period Dynamic Co-operative Signalling with Sticky Efficiency Wages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18471v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses Nash equilibrium reversion as an optimal tool for clearing dynamic prices and wages. Various exogenous competitive rigidities determine the balanced growth path of the efficiency wage and the outcome of repeated household/firm wage bargaining decisions. A location model is used to explore the extent to which a downstream spatial cooperation agreement might affect the price equilibrium. There is also an endogenous hiring function and a knowledge base that is increasing in output as is the real wage. As the article demonstrates after accounting for real rigidities in the baseline model the effect of wage growth on household utility through staggered bargaining can be best captured by adopting a policy of point scoring on the mobility of skilled labor against the model's key rigidities. Mobility point scores which serve to encourage mobility from skilled labor within the model not only increase the knowledge base but also place upward pressure on nominal wage growth.</description>
