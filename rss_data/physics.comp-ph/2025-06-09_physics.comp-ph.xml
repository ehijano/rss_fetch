      <title>Petrov-Galerkin model reduction for collisional-radiative argon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulation of nonequilibrium plasmas -- crucial to applications in electric propulsion, hypersonic re-entry, and astrophysical flows -- requires state-specific collisional-radiative (CR) kinetic models, but these come at a prohibitive computational cost. Traditionally, this cost has been mitigated through empirical or physics-based simplifications of the governing equations. However, such approaches often fail to retain the essential features of the original dynamics, particularly under strong nonequilibrium conditions. To address these limitations, we develop a Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order model (ROM) for CR argon plasma based on oblique projections that optimally balance the covariance of full-order state trajectories with that of the system's output sensitivities. This construction ensures that the ROM captures both the dominant energetic modes and the directions most relevant to input-output behavior. After offline training in a zero-dimensional setting using nonlinear forward and adjoint simulations, the ROM is coupled to a finite-volume solver and applied to one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) ionizing shock-tube problems. The ROM achieves a 3$\times$ reduction in state dimension and more than one order of magnitude savings in floating-point operations, while maintaining errors below 1% for macroscopic quantities. In both 1D and 2D, it robustly reproduces complex unsteady plasma features -- such as periodic fluctuations, electron avalanches, triple points, and cellular ionization patterns -- in contrast to standard ROM strategies, which become unstable or inaccurate under these challenging conditions. These results demonstrate that the proposed projection-based ROM enables substantial model compression while preserving key physical mechanisms in nonequilibrium plasma physics, paving the way for fast, reliable simulation of high-speed plasma flows.</description>

      <title>Application-specific Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials: Exploring the Trade-off Between Precision and Computational Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing computational materials science and chemistry by offering an efficient alternative to {\em ab initio} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, fitting high-quality MLIPs remains a challenging, time-consuming, and computationally intensive task where numerous trade-offs have to be considered, e.g. How much and what kind of atomic configurations should be included in the training set? Which level of {\em ab initio} convergence should be used to generate the training set? Which loss function should be used for fitting the MLIP? Which machine learning architecture should be used to train the MLIP? The answers to these questions significantly impact both the computational cost of MLIP training and the accuracy and computational cost of subsequent MLIP MD simulations. In this study, we highlight that simultaneously considering training set selection strategies, energy versus force weighting, precision of the {\em ab initio} reference simulations, as well as model complexity and computational cost of MLIPs can lead to a significant reduction in the overall computational cost associated with training and evaluating MLIPs. This opens the door to computationally efficient generation of high-quality MLIPs for a range of applications which demand different accuracy versus training and evaluation cost trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Mapping correlations and coherence: adjacency-based approach to data visualization and regularity discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations, by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new computational approaches to regularity discovery.</description>

      <title>Revealing hidden correlations from complex spatial distributions: Adjacent Correlation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and forecasting.</description>

      <title>Addressing geometrical perturbations by applying generalized polynomial chaos to virtual density in continuous energy Monte-Carlo power iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the use of the virtual density method to model uniform geometrical perturbations. We propose a general algorithm using surface tracking in order to estimate explicitly the effect of geometrical perturbations in continuous-energy Monte Carlo simulations, and we apply the intrinsic generalized polynomial chaos method in order to estimate the coefficients of a reduced model giving the multiplication factor as a function of the amplitude of the geometrical perturbation. Our method accurately estimates the reactivity change induced by uniform expansion or swelling deformations that do not significantly modify the neutron energy spectrum, for a large range of deformations within a single Monte Carlo simulation. On the other hand, the method may fail when the effect of the geometrical perturbation on the energy spectrum is significant enough.</description>

      <title>Robustness of complexity estimation in event-driven signals against accuracy of event detection method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complexity has gained recent attention in machine learning for its ability to extract synthetic information from large datasets. Complex dynamical systems are characterized by temporal complexity associated with intermittent birth-death events of self-organizing behavior. These rapid transition events (RTEs) can be modelled as a stochastic point process on the time axis, with inter-event times (IETs) revealing rich dynamics. In particular, IETs with power-law distribution mark a departure from the Poisson statistics and indicate the presence of nontrivial complexity that is quantified by the power-law exponent $\mu$ of the IET distribution. However, detection of RTEs in noisy signals remains a challenge, since false positives can obscure the statistical structure of the underlying process. In this paper, we address the problem of quantifying the effect of the event detection tool on the accuracy of complexity estimation. This is reached through a systematic evaluation of the Event-Driven Diffusion Scaling (EDDiS) algorithm, a tool exploiting event-driven diffusion to estimate temporal complexity.After introducing the event detection method RTE-Finder (RTEF), we assess the performance of the RTEF-EDDiS pipeline using event-driven synthetic signals. The reliability of the RTEF is found to strongly depend on parameters such as the percentile and the number of false positives can be much higher than the number of genuine complex events. Despite this, we found that the complexity estimation is quite robust with respect to the rate of false positives. For the power-law distributed IETs with $\mu\le2.5$, the second moment scaling $H$ appears to even improve as the rate of false positives increases, reaching estimation errors of about 4-7%.</description>

      <title>Compression, simulation, and synthesis of turbulent flows with tensor trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent fluids are paramount to real-life applications, from predicting and modeling flows to diagnostic purposes in engineering. However, they are also computationally challenging due to their intrinsically non-linear dynamics, which requires a very high spatial resolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows on a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of the number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is yet not clear how the compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows, measured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no TT fluid solver has been extensively validated in a fully developed turbulent regime yet. We fill this gap. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of TTs as an Ansatz to compress, simulate, and synthetically generate fiducial turbulent snapshots in 3D. Specifically, first, we exhaustively investigate the effect of TT compression of given snapshots on key turbulence signatures, including the energy spectrum and different accuracy metrics. Second, we present a TT solver to simulate time evolution of 3D fluid fields according to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations entirely within the compressed representation. Third, we develop a TT algorithm to generate artificial snapshots displaying all the signatures of turbulence. In all three cases, a number of parameters scaling polylogarithmically with the mesh size is enough for accurate descriptions. Our findings confirm that fluids in truly turbulent regimes admit an efficient TT description and offer a powerful, quantum-inspired toolkit for their computational treatment.</description>

      <title>Dictionary-Based Reconstruction of Spatio-Temporal 3D Magnetic Field Images from Quantum Diamond Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic imaging with high spatio-temporal resolution is critical for probing current paths in various systems, from biosensing to microelectronics. Conventional 2D Fourier-based current source localization methods are ill-posed in multilayer or dynamic systems due to signal overlap and noise. In this work, we demonstrate an innovative nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center-based wide-field magnetic microscopy technique for dynamic three-dimensional imaging and localization of current sources. Using custom-fabricated multilayer micro-coil platform to emulate localized, time-varying currents similar to neuronal activity, we acquire magnetic field maps with micrometre-scale spatial and millisecond-scale temporal resolution using per-pixel lock-in-based detection. Source localization and image reconstruction are achieved using a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-based reconstruction framework that incorporates experimentally measured basis maps as spatial priors. Our method enables robust identification of active current sources across space and time, and significantly advances the accuracy of dynamic 3D current imaging and NV-based magnetometry for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Toward Greater Autonomy in Materials Discovery Agents: Unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05616v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning, physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Efficient dataset generation for machine learning perovskite alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead-based perovskite solar cells have reached high efficiencies, but toxicity and lack of stability hinder their wide-scale adoption. These issues have been partially addressed through compositional engineering of perovskite materials, but the vast complexity of the perovskite materials space poses a significant obstacle to exploration. We previously demonstrated how machine learning (ML) can accelerate property predictions for the CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$ perovskite alloy. However, the substantial computational demand of density functional theory (DFT) calculations required for model training prevents applications to more complex materials. Here, we introduce a data-efficient scheme to facilitate model training, validated initially on CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$ data and extended to the ternary alloy CsSn(Cl/Br/I)$_3$. Our approach employs clustering to construct a compact yet diverse initial dataset of atomic structures. We then apply a two-stage active learning approach to first improve the reliability of the ML-based structure relaxations and then refine accuracy near equilibrium structures. Tests for CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$ demonstrate that our scheme reduces the number of required DFT calculations during the different parts of our proposed model training method by up to 20% and 50%. The fitted model for CsSn(Cl/Br/I)$_3$ is robust and highly accurate, evidenced by the convergence of all ML-based structure relaxations in our tests and an average relaxation error of only 0.5 meV/atom.</description>

      <title>Defect-free and defective adaptations of crystalline sheets to stretching deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elastic response of the crystalline sheet to the stretching deformation in the form of wrinkles has been extensively investigated. In this work, we extend this fundamental scientific question to the plastic regime by exploring the adaptations of crystalline sheets to the large uniaxial mechanical stretching. We reveal the intermittent plastic shear deformations leading to the complete fracture of the sheets wrapping the cylinder. Specifically, systematic investigations of crystalline sheets of varying geometry show that the fracture processes can be classified into defect-free and defective categories depending on the emergence of topological defects. We highlight the characteristic mechanical and geometric patterns in response to the large stretching deformation, including the shear-driven intermittent lattice tilting, the vortex structure in the displacement field, and the emergence of mobile and anchored dislocations as plastic excitations. The effects of noise and initial lattice orientation on the plastic deformation of the stretched crystalline sheet are also discussed. These results advance our understanding of the atomic level on the irreversible plastic instabilities of 2D crystals under large uniaxial stretching and may have potential practical implications in the precise engineering of structural instabilities in packings of covalently bonded particulate systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Simulating Nonlinear Solid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network (ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities. ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.</description>

Abstract: We present a Machine Learning approach based on Symbolic Regression to derive, from either numerically generated or experimentally measured spectral data, closed-form expressions that model the optical properties of biological materials. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider three case studies with the aim of retrieving the refractive index of the materials that constitute the biological structures considered. The results obtained show that, in addition to retrieving readable and dimensionally homogeneous dispersion models, the expressions found have a physical meaning and their algebraic form is similar to that of the models used to characterize the dispersive behavior of transparent dielectrics in the visible region.</description>

      <title>GP-Recipe: Gaussian Process approximation to linear operations in numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03471</link>

Abstract: We introduce new Gaussian Process (GP) high-order approximations to linear operations that are frequently used in various numerical methods. Our method employs the kernel-based GP regression modeling, a non-parametric Bayesian approach to regression that operates on the probability distribution over all admissible functions that fit observed data. We begin in the first part with discrete data approximations to various linear operators applied to smooth data using the most popular squared exponential kernel function. In the second part, we discuss data interpolation across discontinuities with sharp gradients, for which we introduce a new GP kernel that fits discontinuous data without oscillations. The current study extends our previous GP work on polynomial-free shock-capturing methods in finite difference and finite volume methods to a suite of linear operator approximations on smooth data. The formulations introduced in this paper can be readily adopted in daily practices in numerical methods, including numerical approximations of finite differences, quadrature rules, interpolations, and reconstructions, which are most frequently used in numerical modeling in modern science and engineering applications. In the test problems, we demonstrate that the GP approximated solutions feature improved solution accuracy compared to the conventional finite-difference counterparts.</description>

      <title>The role of effective mass and long-range interactions in the band-gap renormalization of photo-excited semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how to control changes in electronic structure and related dynamical renormalizations by external driving fields is the key for understanding ultrafast spectroscopy and applications in electronics. Here we focus on the band-gap's modulation by external electric fields and uncover the effect of band dispersion on the gap renormalization. We employ the Green's function formalism using the real-time Dyson expansion to account for dynamical correlations induced by photodoping. The many-body formalism captures the dynamics of systems with long-range interactions, carrier mobility, and variable electron and hole effective mass. We also demonstrate that mean-field simulations based on the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which lacks dynamical correlations, yields a qualitatively incorrect picture of band-gap renormalization. We find the trend that increasing effective mass, thus decreasing mobility, leads to as much as a 6\% enhancement in band-gap renormalization. Further, the renormalization is strongly dependent on the degree of photodoping. As the screening induced by free electrons and holes effectively reduces any long-range and interband interactions for highly excited systems, we show that there is a specific turnover point with minimal band-gap. We further demonstrate that the optical gap renormalization follows the same trend though its magnitude is altered by the Moss-Burstein effect.</description>
