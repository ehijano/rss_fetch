      <title>Determining Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Rates from Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering and absorption rates of light dark matter with electron spin-dependent interactions depend on the target's spin response. We show how this response is encoded by the target's dynamical magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using neutron scattering. We directly use existing neutron scattering data to compute the dark matter scattering rate in a candidate target material, finding close agreement with the previous first-principles calculation at MeV dark matter masses. Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Visible Collider Signals of Natural Quirks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though some LHC searches for new physics exceed the TeV scale, there may be discoveries waiting to be made at much lower masses. We outline a simple quirk model, motivated by models that address the hierarchy problem through neutral naturalness, in which new electroweakly charged states with masses as low as 100 GeV have not yet been probed by the LHC. We also describe a novel search strategy which is complementary to current search methods. In particular, we show its potential to discover natural quirks over regions of parameter space that present methods will leave unexplored, even after the LHC's high-luminosity run.</description>

      <title>No Dark Matter Axion During Minimal Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study minimal versions of Higgs inflation in the presence of a massless QCD axion. While the inflationary energy scale of the metric variant is too high to accommodate isocurvature bounds, it was argued that Palatini Higgs inflation could evade these constraints. We show, however, that an energy-dependent decay constant enhances isocurvature perturbations, implying that axions can at most constitute a tiny fraction $&lt; 10^{-5}$ of dark matter. This conclusion can be avoided in Einstein-Cartan gravity by an additional coupling of the axion to torsion, albeit for a very specific choice of parameters. Analogous constraints as well as the possibility to alleviate them are relevant for all inflationary models with a non-minimal coupling to gravity.</description>

      <title>Tensor hybrid charmonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass and current coupling of the tensor hybrid charmonia $H_{\mathrm{c}} $ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}}$ with quantum numbers $J^{\mathrm{PC} }=2^{-+}$ and $2^{++}$, as well as their full widths are calculated in the context of QCD sum rule method. The spectral parameters of these states are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule approach including dimension-12 terms $\sim \langle g_{s}^{3}G^{3}\rangle ^{2} $. The full width of these hybrid states are evaluated by considering their kinematically allowed decay channels. In the case of the hybrid state $H_{\mathrm{c}} $ decays to $ D^{(\pm )}D^{\ast (\mp )}$, $D^{0}\overline{D}^{\ast 0}$, and $D_{s}^{(\pm )}D_{s}^{\ast (\mp )} $ mesons are taken into account. The processes $ \widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}} \to D^{(\ast)+}D^{(\ast )-}$, $D^{(\ast) 0} \overline{D}^{(\ast) 0}$, and $D_{s}^{(\ast)+}D_{s}^{(\ast) -} $ are employed to estimate the full width of the hybrid charmonium $\widetilde{H}_{ \mathrm{c}}$. The partial widths of these decays are computed by means of QCD three-point sum rule approach which is necessary to calculate strong couplings at the relevant hybrid-meson-meson vertices. Our predictions $ m=(4.16\pm 0.14)~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\widetilde{m}=(4.5\pm 0.1)~\mathrm{GeV}$ for the masses and $\Gamma \left[ H_{\mathrm{c}}\right] =(160\pm 23)~\mathrm{ MeV}$, $\Gamma \left[ \widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}}\right] =(206\pm 25)~\mathrm{ MeV}$ for the full width of these hybrid charmonia can be useful to study and interpret various resonances in the $4-5~\mathrm{GeV}$ mass range.</description>

      <title>Search for anomalous quartic gauge couplings in the process $\mu^+\mu^-\to \bar{\nu}\nu\gamma\gamma$ with a nested local outlier factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the increasing luminosities of colliders, handling the growing amount of data has become a major challenge for future new physics~(NP) phenomenological research. To improve efficiency, machine learning algorithms have been introduced into the field of high-energy physics. As a machine learning algorithm, the local outlier factor~(LOF), and the nested LOF~(NLOF) are potential tools for NP phenomenological studies. In this work, the possibility of searching for the signals of anomalous quartic gauge couplings~(aQGCs) at muon colliders using the NLOF is investigated. Taking the process $\mu^+\mu^-\to \nu\bar{\nu}\gamma\gamma$ as an example, the signals of dimension-8 aQGCs are studied, expected coefficient constraints are presented. The NLOF algorithm are shown to outperform the k-means based anomaly detection methods, and a tradition counterpart.</description>

      <title>Octaquarks in a simple chromomagnetic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the octaquark, which is composed of two baryons and one meson using a simple chromomagnetic model. First, we construct the wave function of the octaquark satisfying the Pauli exclusion principle in the flavor SU(3) breaking case. In order to calculate the binding energy, we consider the lowest threshold by taking into account the decay products. By calculating the color-spin interaction of octaquarks for all possible quantum numbers, we determine several candidates for compact octaquarks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Observables for the Chiral Magnetic Effect from Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions remains challenging due to substantial background contributions that obscure the expected signal. In this Letter, we present a novel machine learning approach for constructing optimized observables that significantly enhance CME detection capabilities. By parameterizing generic observables constructed from flow harmonics and optimizing them to maximize the signal-to-background ratio, we systematically develop CME-sensitive measures that outperform conventional methods. Using simulated data from the Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics framework, our machine learning observables demonstrate up to 90\% higher sensitivity to CME signals compared to traditional $\gamma$ and $\delta$ correlators, while maintaining minimal background contamination. The constructed observables provide physical insight into optimal CME detection strategies, and offer a promising path forward for experimental searches of CME at RHIC and the LHC.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dynamics of charmonia in strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of charmonium systems in strong external magnetic fields using a relativistic light-front Hamiltonian approach within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework. By solving the eigenvalue problem for the invariant mass squared operator with confinement potentials and one-gluon-exchange interactions, we obtain the mass spectrum and wave functions under varying magnetic fields. Our results reveal significant spectral modifications via the Zeeman effect, including $\eta_c$-$J/\psi$ mixing and magnetic sublevel splitting. Momentum density analysis demonstrates wave function deformation, with transverse momentum broadening and longitudinal narrowing under strong fields, alongside structural shifts in parton distributions such as double-hump profiles in excited states. Relativistic corrections and center-of-mass coupling critically drive these dynamics, highlighting the necessity of a relativistic framework for QCD bound states in extreme magnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Two-pole structures in QCD -- a universal phenomenon governed by chiral dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate how the two-pole structures of the $\Lambda(1405)$ emerge from the underlying universal chiral dynamics that describe the coupled-channel interactions between octet baryons and pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Specifically, we attribute this phenomenon to the form of the leading-order chiral potential, which is of the Weinberg-Tomozawa type. We reveal how the underlying chiral dynamics can be exposed by examining the light-quark mass evolution of the two poles. The latest lattice QCD simulations have indeed found evidence for the existence of the two poles of $\Lambda(1405)$, in qualitative agreement with our predictions. We briefly mention a recent work in which lattice QCD simulations are studied more quantitatively, along with a proposal for how the SU(3) flavor content of the two poles of $\Lambda(1405)$ can be experimentally verified.</description>

      <title>Hybrid framework of Fermi-Dirac spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline the hybrid framework of spin hydrodynamics, combining classical kinetic theory with the Israel-Stewart method of introducing dissipation. We obtain the local equilibrium expressions for the baryon current, the energy-momentum tensor, and the spin tensor of particles with spin 1/2 following the Fermi-Dirac statistics and compare them with the previously derived versions where the Boltzmann approximation was used. The expressions in the two cases have the same form, but the coefficients are governed by different functions. The relative differences between the tensor coefficients in the Fermi-Dirac and Boltzmann cases are found to grow exponentially with the baryon chemical potential. In the proposed formalism, nonequilibrium processes are studied including mathematically possible dissipative corrections. Standard conservation laws are applied, and the condition of positive entropy production allows for transfer between the spin and orbital parts of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Probing Gauged $U(1)$ Sub-GeV Dark Matter via Cosmic Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) traversing the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be cooled through interactions with DM particles. In this study, we investigated constraints on sub-GeV DM particles charged under various $U(1)$ gauge symmetries by exploiting the cooling effect of CRs in AGNs. We find that for low DM and mediator masses, the CR cooling rate is higher compared to the standard model cooling process. Furthermore, by utilizing constraints from the CR cooling effect in NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056, we explore the bounds on the DM-electron and DM-proton elastic scattering cross-sections. Our results indicate that in the sub-GeV DM mass range, these constraints are more stringent than those from certain boosted DM mechanisms and current direct detection limits.</description>

      <title>Exact Wigner function for chiral spirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact solution of the Dirac equation for fermions coupled to an external periodic chiral condensate (chiral spiral) is used to obtain the exact formula for the Wigner function (up to the quantum loop corrections). We find that the resulting expressions for various coefficients of the Wigner function exhibit properties that cannot be reproduced within the standard semiclassical expansion. The formula for the axial vector component of the Wigner function can be conveniently used to study spin polarization effects and illustrate connections between the spin density matrix and axial current. In particular, we find that during an adiabatic change of the periodic potential into a uniform one, the polarization vector is twisted from its original direction.</description>

      <title>Support for Gravitationally-Attractive Composite Antimatter and Gravitationally-Repulsive Non-composite Antimatter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALPHA collaboration recently published the article "Observation of the effects of gravity on the motion of antimatter" in issue 621 of Nature (2023), in which their conclusion states that "The probability that our data are consistent with repulsive gravity is so small as to be quantitatively meaningless (less than $10^{-15}$). Consequently, we can rule out the existence of repulsive gravity of magnitude 1$g$ between the Earth and antimatter." Indeed, their experiment proved that antihydrogen falls toward the Earth. Antihydrogen, however, is a composite particle and its mass, like that of the proton, is dominated by the mass of its binding energy. In this paper, we point out that their experiment only measures the gravitational effect on composite antimatter, and not free or valence antimatter particles such as antiquarks or antileptons. Here, we review the various theoretical frameworks supporting the possibility that valence antiquarks experience a repulsion of the order $g$ by the Earth's gravitational field. We show that the ALPHA collaboration's recent result may actually be consistent with a repulsive gravitational component of about 15%. Next, we review our concept for a direct interaction experiment between antiquarks and the Earth's gravitational field, which should be capable of providing irrefutable evidence of the gravitational repulsion of non-composite antiparticles. Finally, we suggest that existing data, collected by AMS-01 of daughter particles from cosmic protons interacting with the Mir space station, may help demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed experiment.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis from cosmological CP breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that baryogenesis can arise from the cosmological evolution of a scalar field that governs CP-violating parameters, such as the Yukawa couplings and the theta terms of the Standard Model. During the big bang, this scalar may reach a CP-violating minimum, where its mass can be comparable to the inflationary Hubble scale. Such dynamics can emerge in theories featuring either a spontaneously broken local U(1) symmetry or modular invariance. The latter arises naturally as the effective field theory capturing the geometric origin of CP violation in toroidal string compactifications. Modular baryogenesis is compatible with the modular approach to resolving the strong CP problem.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Goldstones at the QCD chiral phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the universal non-equilibrium enhancement of long-wavelength Goldstone bosons induced by quenches to broken phase in Model G -- the dynamical universality class of an $O(4)$-antiferromagnet and chiral QCD phase transition. Generic scaling arguments predict a parametric enhancement in the infrared spectra of Goldstones, which is confirmed by fully-fledged stochastic simulations. The details of the enhancement are determined by the non-linear dynamics of a superfluid effective theory, which is a limit of Model G reflecting the broken $O(4)$ symmetry. Our results translate to a parametric enhancement of low-momentum pions in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, which are underpredicted in current hydrodynamic models without critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter boosted by supernova shock within the effective field theory framework from the CDEX-10 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova shocks can boost dark matter (DM) particles to high, yet nonrelativistic, velocities, providing a suitable mechanism for analysis within the framework of the nonrelativistic effective field theory (NREFT). These accelerated DM sources extend the experimental ability to scan the parameter space of light DM into the sub-GeV region. In this study, we specifically analyze DM accelerated by the Monogem Ring supernova remnant, whose age ($\sim 68000$ yr) and distance to Earth ($\sim 300$ parsecs) are strategically matched to enable detection with current terrestrial detectors. Utilizing the 205.4 kg$\cdot$day data obtained from the CDEX-10 experiment at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), we derive new constraints on boosted DM within the NREFT framework. The NREFT coupling constant exclusion regions now penetrate the sub-GeV mass range, with optimal sensitivity achieved for operators $\mathcal{O}_{3}$, $\mathcal{O}_{6}$, $\mathcal{O}_{15}$ in the 0.4--0.6 GeV mass range.</description>

      <title>Supersizing hydrodynamical simulations of reionization using perturbative techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that perturbative techniques inspired by effective field theory (EFT) can be used to "paint on" the 21~cm field during reionization using only the underlying linear density field. This procedure is accurate to within O(10%) on large scales and thus can be used to enlarge or "supersize" hydrodynamical simulations. In particular, the EFT provides a mapping between the linear density field and a nonlinear tracer field, both in real and redshift space. We show that this mapping can be reliably extracted from relatively small simulation volumes using the THESAN suite of simulations, which have a comoving volume of (95.5 Mpc)^3. Specifically, we show that if we fit the EFT coefficients in a small ~5% sub-volume of the simulation, we can accurately predict the 21cm field in the rest of the simulation given only the linear density field. We show that our technique is robust to different models of dark matter and differences in the sub-grid reionization modeling.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Parity-violating Trispectra in Galaxy Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity-violating interactions are ubiquitous phenomena in particle physics. If they are significant during cosmic inflation, they can leave imprints on primordial perturbations and be observed in correlation functions of galaxy surveys. Importantly, parity-violating signals in the four-point correlation functions (4PCFs) cannot be generated by Einstein gravity in the late universe on large scales, making them unique and powerful probes of high-energy physics during inflation. However, the complex structure of the 4PCF poses challenges in diagnosing the underlying properties of parity-violating interactions from observational data. In this work, we introduce a general framework that provides a streamlined pipeline directly from a particle model in inflation to galaxy 4PCFs in position space. We demonstrate this framework with a series of toy models, effective-field-theory-like models, and full models featuring tree-level exchange-type processes with chemical-potential-induced parity violation. We further showed the detection sensitivity of these models from BOSS data and highlighted potential challenges in data interpretation and model prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study tackles the impact dark energy in different systems by a simple unifying formalism. We introduce a parameter space to compare gravity tests across all cosmic scales, using the McVittie spacetime (MCV), that connect spherically symmetric solutions with cosmological solutions. By analyzing invariant scalars, the Ricci, Weyl, and Kretschmann scalars, we develop a phase-space description that predicts the dominance of the Cosmological Constant. We explore three cases: (1) the local Hubble flow around galaxy groups and clusters, (2) spherical density distributions and (3) binary motion. Our results show that galaxy groups and clusters exhibit Kretschmann scalar values consistent with the Cosmological Constant curvature, indicating where dark energy dominates.</description>

      <title>Input to European Strategy Update for Particle Physics: Sustainability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human activity continues to have an enormous negative impact on the ability of the planet to sustain human and other forms of life. Six out of the nine planetary boundaries have been crossed, a seventh is close to threshold. Prominent manifestations of this development are climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions, as well as loss of biodiversity. In recognition of the urgency of these problems, several international agreements have been ratified to achieve net-zero emissions and to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. Significant reductions in emissions are required by 2030 to meet international climate targets. The field of particle physics has an obligation and an opportunity to contribute to such mitigation efforts and to avoid causing further harm. This document urges the European Strategy Update in Particle Physics to set a clear and bold mandate for embedding environmental sustainability throughout the future scientific programme, and advocates for a series of actions that will enable this.</description>

      <title>2026 ESPPU input from the ANUBIS Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is imperative for us as a particle physics community to fully exploit the physics potential of the High-Luminosity LHC. This calls for us not to leave any stone unturned in the search for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. Many BSM models that address fundamental questions of physics like the particulate nature of dark matter, the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe, small but non-zero neutrino masses etc, predict Long-Lived Particles (LLPs) with macroscopic lifetimes of $\tau&gt;10^{-10}$ s. The challenge in searching for BSM models with LLP signatures at the HL-LHC is that it requires the complementary interplay of general purpose detectors like ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb; dedicated detectors situated close to the beamline including the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF); and dedicated detectors covering a large decay volume at a reasonable solid angle transverse to the beamline, i.e., a Transverse Physics Facility (TPF). Hence, it is of vital importance to realise a TPF in order to expand dramatically the physics coverage within long-lived particle searches to harvest the physics at the HL-LHC fully. A TPF may be composed of several experiments based at the HL-LHC. In this document, we propose that the community realise the ANUBIS experiment as part of a TPF.</description>

      <title>Inclusive semileptonic decays from lattice QCD: analysis of systematic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations of inclusive semileptonic decay rates involve new types of systematic effects, such as truncation errors in the estimation of energy integrals, or finite-volume effects for multi-body final states. We investigate them for the lattice data of $D_s \to X_s \ell\nu$ decays, obtained using M\"obius domain-wall fermions. Separating the ground-state and excited-state contributions results in better control over these systematic effects. With the Chebyshev polynomial approximation, the truncation error is under control, while the finite-volume effects are estimated using a model to describe two-body final states.</description>

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern neural network architectures demands fast and memory-efficient implementations to mitigate computational bottlenecks. In this work, we evaluate the recently proposed BitNet architecture in HEP applications, assessing its performance in classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks. Specifically, we investigate its suitability for quark-gluon discrimination, SMEFT parameter estimation, and detector simulation, comparing its efficiency and accuracy to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that while BitNet consistently performs competitively in classification tasks, its performance in regression and generation varies with the size and type of the network, highlighting key limitations and potential areas for improvement.</description>

      <title>Tunneling with physics-informed RG flows in the anharmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the anharmonic oscillator with physics-informed renormalisation group (PIRG) flows, with an emphasis on the weak coupling regime with its instanton-dominated tunnelling processes. We show that the instanton physics behind the exponential decay of the energy gap is already covered in the first order of the derivative expansion of the PIRG. The crucial new ingredients in the present analysis are the use of the ground state expansion within PIRG flows, as well as precision numerics based on Galerkin methods. Our result $a_{\mathrm{inst}} = 1.910(2)$ for the decay constant is in quantitative agreement with the analytic one, $a_{\mathrm{inst}} = 1.886$ with a deviation of $1\%$. This illustrates very impressively the capacity of the PIRG for fully capturing non-perturbative physics already in relatively simple approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed numerical and analytical study of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of Model G, the dynamical universality class relevant to the chiral phase transition. We perform numerical 3D stochastic (Langevin) simulations of the $O(4)$ critical point for large lattices in the chiral limit. We quench the system from the high-temperature unbroken phase to the broken phase and study the non-equilibrium dynamics of pion fields. Strikingly, the non-equilibrium evolution of the two-point functions exhibits a regime of growth, a parametrically large enhancement, and a subsequent slow relaxation to equilibrium. We analyze our numerical results using dynamic critical scaling and mean-field theory. The growth of the two point functions is determined by the non-linear dynamics of an ideal non-abelian superfluid, which is a limit of Model G that reflects the broken chiral symmetry. We also relate the non-equilibrium two-point functions to a long-lived parametric enhancement of soft pion yields relative to thermal equilibrium following a quench.</description>

Abstract: Metastability is a phenomenon encountered in many different physical systems, ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic decay timescale from a metastable to a stable state is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to study out-of-equilibrium field theories.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Annihilating Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of cosmic domain walls can form in the early Universe as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries. We study the production of a cosmological background of gravitational waves (GWs) from such networks, when they annihilate due to a small explicit symmetry breaking term. Averaging over several 3+1-dimensional high-resolution lattice field simulations, we obtain a GW spectrum with the following characteristics: (1) a broad asymmetric peak, roughly located at frequency $f\sim 2 H_{\rm gw}$, where $H_{\rm gw}$ is the Hubble rate at the end of GW production, shortly after annihilation, (2) a doubly broken power spectrum $\propto k^{-n}$, with initial slope $n \sim 0.5$ after the main peak and $n \sim 1.8$ at high $f$, while the low frequency region $f&lt;f_p$ agrees with the causality behavior $\sim k^3$. Additionally, extending previous results, we find that GW production continues to be efficient until a value of the Hubble scale $H_{\text gw}$ that is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the naive estimate $\sigma H = \Delta V$, where $\sigma$ is the wall tension and $\Delta V$ the size of the symmetry breaking term, thereby leading to a $O(100)$ larger GW signal. We find such results to be robust when changing the shape of the scalar field potential or including a time-dependent symmetry breaking term. Our findings have important implications for GW searches, especially in light of the reported evidence for a stochastic GW background in Pulsar Timing Array data.</description>

Abstract: Muon counting is an effective strategy for discriminating between gamma and hadron-initiated air showers. However, their detection, which requires shielded detectors, is highly expensive and challenging to implement across large, environmentally sensitive areas.
  This work allowed to establish for the first time that at PeV energies the gamma/hadron discriminator based on the new $LCm$ variable have proton rejection levels of the order of $10^{-4}$, outperforming the discrimination power based on the counting of the number of muons.
  A thorough examination of muon depleted showers at the PeV energies and the simulation strategy devised to achieve the required $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ simulated showers is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of normal modes based on the Boltzmann equation within the mutilated relaxation time approximation (RTA). Using this linearized effective kinetic description, our analysis encompasses a complete order calculation in wavenumber k, extending the conventional hydrodynamic mode analysis to intermediate and short-wavelength regions. Furthermore, our linear mode analysis can provide a natural classification of kinetic modes into collective modes and non-collective single-particle excitations. In the case of an energy-independent relaxation time, the behavior of hydrodynamic onset transitions is recovered (Romatschke in Eur Phys J C 76:352, 2016). However, for the case with an energy-dependent relaxation time, the distinct classification becomes less clear, as the location of hydrodynamic modes is not well separated from non-hydrodynamic modes.</description>

      <title>Symbol letters of Feynman integrals from Gram determinants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbol letters are crucial for analytically calculating Feynman integrals in terms of iterated integrals. We present a novel method to construct the symbol letters for a given integral family without prior knowledge of the canonical differential equations. We provide a program package implementing our algorithm, and demonstrate its effectiveness in solving non-trivial problems with multiple loops and legs. Using our method, we successfully bootstrap the canonical differential equations for a two-loop five-point family with two external masses and for a three-loop four-point family with two external masses, which were previously unknown in the literature. We anticipate that our method can be applied to a wide range of cutting-edge calculations in the future.</description>

      <title>A Global View of the EDM Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) are sensitive probes of the symmetry structure of elementary particles, which in turn is closely tied to the baryon asymmetry in the universe. A meaningful interpretation framework for EDM measurements has to be based on effective quantum field theory. We interpret the measurements performed to date in terms of a hadronic-scale Lagrangian, using the SFitter global analysis framework. We find that part of this Lagrangian is constrained very well, while some of the parameters suffer from too few high-precision measurements. Theory uncertainties lead to weaker model constraints, but can be controlled within the global analysis.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar and vector tetraquarks $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06759v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar and vector four-quark states $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ are studied in the context of the QCD sum rule method. We model $T_{\mathrm{ \ \ PS}} $ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ as structures built of diquarks $ b^{T}C\gamma_{5}b$, $\overline{c}C\overline{c}^{T}$ and $b^{T}C\gamma _{5}b$ , $\overline{c}C\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\overline{c}^{T}$, respectively, with $ C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The spectroscopic parameters of the tetraquarks $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$, i.e., their masses and current couplings are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. We evaluate the full widths of $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ by taking into account their kinematically allowed decay channels. In the case of the pseudoscalar particle they are processes $T_{\mathrm{PS}} \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{3}P_{0})$ and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. The vector state $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ can dissociate to meson pairs $2 B_{c}^{-}$, $2 B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. Partial widths of these decays are determined by the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices, which evaluated in the context of the three-point sum rule approach. Predictions obtained for the mass and full width of the pseudoscalar $m =(13.092\pm 0.095)~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma _{\mathrm{PS} }=(63.7\pm 13.0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and vector $\widetilde{m} =(13.15\pm 0.10)~ \mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{V}}=(53.5\pm 10.3)~\mathrm{MeV}$ tetraquarks can be useful for analyses of different four-quark resonances.</description>

      <title>Effect of the scalar unparticle and polarization at muon colliders through the exclusive W boson hadronic decays in the final state in the Randall-Sundrum model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by using Feynman diagram techniques we have evaluated the effect of the scalar unparticle and polarization at the muon colliders through the exclusive W boson hadronic decays $W^{\pm} \rightarrow \pi^{\pm}\gamma$, $W^{\pm} \rightarrow K^{\pm}\gamma$, $W^{\pm} \rightarrow \rho^{\pm}\gamma$ in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. The results show that with fixed collision energies, the total cross-sections for hadronic productions in final states depend strongly on the parameters of the unparticle physics and muon beam polarization. The total cross-sections achieve the maximum value when both of muon beams polarize left or right and the minimum value when the $\mu^{-}$ beam polarizes left, the $\mu^{+}$ beam polarizes right and vice versa. In case of the different polarization, the cross-sections increase as the collision energy increases and they change insignificantly when the $\mu^{-}$ beam polarizes left, the $\mu^{+}$ beam polarizes right. With the benchmark background $(\Lambda_{U}, d_{U})$ $= (1 $TeV$, 1.9)$, the cross-sections reach the maximum value. The integrated luminosity value is shown to correspond to a significance $1\sigma, 3\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group study of a four-fermion model with $CP$ violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a functional renormalization group analysis of a four-fermion model with $CP$ and $P$ violation to explore the nonperturbative infrared dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) within the Wilsonian renormalization group framework, particularly in the context of spontaneous $CP$-violation models. Our analysis of the fixed-point structure reveals that, in the large-$N_c$ limit, the $CP$-violating $\bar{\theta}$ parameter is dynamically induced and approaches $\pi \cdot (N_f/2)$ (where $N_f$ is the number of flavors) as the system enters the chirally broken phase. This behavior arises due to criticality and the large anomalous dimensions of the $U(1)_A$-violating four-fermion couplings. Furthermore, this trend appears to persist beyond the leading large-$N_c$ approximation, provided that the infrared dynamics of QCD remains dominated by the scalar condensate of the quark bilinear, as expected. Notably, our findings highlight that $CP$-violating four-fermion interactions, which are perturbatively irrelevant, can become relevant in the chirally broken phase through nonperturbative effects, with potential implications for spontaneous $CP$-violation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation group evolution of the shape function $g_{17}$ in $\bar{B}\to X_s \gamma$ and $\bar{B} \to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$ at subleading power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive and solve the renormalisation-group (RG) equation of the shape function $g_{17}(\omega,\omega_1;\mu)$, which appears at subleading power in the factorization of the inclusive decays $\bar{B} \to X_s \gamma$ and $\bar B \to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$. Our results provide the first ingredient for a next-to-leading order analysis of the respective resolved-photon ${Q}^{c}_{1} - {Q}_{7\gamma}$ interference contribution, whose current uncertainties are among the largest ones in both inclusive penguin modes. As a by-product of our study, we find that the analytic properties of the soft anomalous dimension as well as the jet functions in a factorization theorem allow for a simplified renormalisation of operators in Heavy-Quark Effective Theory that are composed of fields smeared along distinct light-cone directions. Their hadronic matrix elements become relevant in various inclusive and exclusive $B$-decays beyond leading power in the heavy-quark and large-energy expansion. Using these insights, we derive and solve a simpler ``reduced'' RG equation of an amplitude-level soft function that describes the long-distance QCD dynamics for penguin contributions to exclusive $\bar{B}_{d,s} \to \gamma \gamma$ decays, and which has recently been discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Melting of $c \bar c$ and $b \bar b$ pairs in the pre-equilibrium stage of proton-nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the melting of $c\bar c$ and $b\bar b$ pairs in the early stage of high-energy proton-nucleus collisions. We describe the early stage in terms of an evolving $SU(3)$ glasma stage, that is dominated by intense, out-of-equilibrium gluon fields. On top of these fields, we liberate heavy quark-antiquark pairs, whose constituents are let evolve according to relativistic kinetic theory coupled to the gluon fields. We define a pair-by-pair probability that the pair melts during the evolution, which we relate to the fluctuations of the color charges induced by the interaction of the quarks with the gluon fields. We find that color decorrelation is the main melting mechanism within the pre-equilibrium stage. Moreover, we estimate that within $\Delta \tau\approx0.4-0.5$ fm/c after the formation time of the pairs, about $50\%$ of $c\bar c$ and $b\bar b$ pairs are melted.</description>

      <title>Global parametrizations of $\pi\pi$ scattering with dispersive constraints: Beyond the S0 wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new global parametrizations of $\pi\pi \to \pi\pi$ scattering for the S2, P, D, F, and G partial waves up to at least 1.8 GeV, easy to implement for phenomenological use. With earlier S0-wave parametrizations, slightly updated here, they reproduce previous partial wave dispersion analyses up to the $\pi\omega$ threshold. In addition, these new parametrizations have improved their description of recent P-wave data, the inelasticity in various waves, and their fulfillment of Roy-like and forward dispersion relations. The latter now test very high partial waves and have an improved matching with the Regge regime, extending those with P-wave contributions up to 1.6 GeV. Above 1.6 GeV and up to 1.8 GeV, or sometimes somewhat beyond, the parametrizations are simple unconstrained fits to data.</description>

      <title>Learning Broken Symmetries with Approximate Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recognizing symmetries in data allows for significant boosts in neural network training, which is especially important where training data are limited. In many cases, however, the exact underlying symmetry is present only in an idealized dataset, and is broken in actual data, due to asymmetries in the detector, or varying response resolution as a function of particle momentum. Standard approaches, such as data augmentation or equivariant networks fail to represent the nature of the full, broken symmetry, effectively overconstraining the response of the neural network. We propose a learning model which balances the generality and asymptotic performance of unconstrained networks with the rapid learning of constrained networks. This is achieved through a dual-subnet structure, where one network is constrained by the symmetry and the other is not, along with a learned symmetry factor. In a simplified toy example that demonstrates violation of Lorentz invariance, our model learns as rapidly as symmetry-constrained networks but escapes its performance limitations.</description>

      <title>Trilepton and tetralepton bound and resonant states: the QED counterpart of multiquark states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the first prediction of tetralepton resonant states containing muons, extending beyond the simplest tetralepton system, dipositronium ($\mathrm{Ps}_2$). With the rapid advancements in experimental facilities, the production and study of these intriguing states may be within reach. We perform a comprehensive analysis of S-wave trilepton and tetralepton systems within the framework of a QED Coulomb potential. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the three- or four-body Schr\"odinger equation and utilize the complex scaling method to identify resonant states. We uncover a series of bound and resonant states in the trilepton systems $e^+e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^+\mu^-$, $e^+e^+\mu^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^+e^-$, as well as the tetralepton systems $e^+e^+e^-e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^+\mu^-\mu^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^+e^-e^-$. The energies of these states range from $-30$ eV to $-1$ eV below the total mass of three or four leptons, with their widths varying from less than $0.01$ eV to approximately $0.07$ eV. Additionally, we calculate the spin configurations and root mean square radii of these states, providing insight into their spatial structures. No bound or resonant states are found in the trilepton $e^+\mu^+e^-$, $\mu^+e^+\mu^-$ systems, nor in the tetralepton $\mu^+e^+\mu^-e^-$ system. A comparison with fully heavy tetraquark systems reveals that the additional color degree of freedom in QCD results in the absence of low-energy bound and resonant states. However, this extra degree of freedom allows for a broader range of $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers to produce resonant states, highlighting the rich complexity of QCD systems.</description>

      <title>On the Atomki nuclear anomaly after the MEG-II result</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental results from the Atomki collaboration have reported the observation of anomalous effects in Beryllium, Helium and Carbon nuclear transitions that could hint at physics beyond the Standard Model. However, the MEG-II experiment has recently found no significant anomalous signal in the Beryllium transition ${^8}\text{Be}^\star\to{^8}\text{Be}+e^+e^-$. In view of this result, we critically re-examine the possible theoretical interpretations of the anomalies observed by the Atomki experiment in terms of a new boson $X$ with mass around $17\;$MeV. The present work aims to study the phenomenology of a spin-2 state and revisit the possibility of a pure CP-even scalar, which was initially dismissed due to its inability to explain the Beryllium anomalous signal. Our analysis shows that a spin-2 state is highly disfavoured by the SINDRUM constraint while a scalar boson could explain the Helium and Carbon anomalies while being compatible with other experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory-burdened primordial black holes on high-scale leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of the back-reaction of evaporation on the quantum state of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), known as ``memory burden", on the baryon asymmetry production in the Universe through high-scale leptogenesis. Focusing on PBH masses ranging from 1 to 1000 grams, we investigate the interplay between the non-thermal production of heavy sterile neutrinos and the entropy injection within this non-standard cosmological framework. By assuming appropriate values for the memory-burden parameters, $q=1/2$ and $k=1$, we derive mutual exclusion limits between PBHs and thermal leptogenesis in the mixed parameter space. Our analysis reveals that the primary contribution of PBHs to baryon asymmetry stems from entropy injection. Indeed, we find that, differently from earlier studies based on the semi-classical Hawking evaporation, the memory-burden effect suppresses the non-thermal source term in the PBH mass range explored. This has significant implications for understanding baryogenesis in such alternative cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of true muonium observation in Belle-II existing dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: True muonium ($\mu^+\mu^-$) is one of the cleanest bound states, being composed only of leptons, along with true tauonium and positronium. Unlike the latter, true muonium and true tauonium have not been observed so far. This article shows that the spin-0 state of true muonium (para-TM), decaying into two photons, can be observed at a discovery level of significance in the dataset already collected by the Belle-II experiment at the $\Upsilon (4S)$ peak, with certain assumptions on systematic uncertainties. Para-TM is produced via photon-photon fusion, and its observation is based on the detection of the photon pair resulting from its decay, on top of the continuum background due predominantly to light-by-light scattering. Trigger, acceptance and isolation cuts, along with calorimeter resolution and reconstruction efficiency, are taken into account during the Monte Carlo simulation of both signal and background. In order to separate signal and background, a machine learning method, based on extremely randomized trees, is trained on simulated events. Finally, the expected statistical significance of TM observation is evaluated, taking into account systematic uncertainties in a parametric fashion.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity for first-order QCD phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the QCD phase transition is a crossover in the standard model, nonstandard effects such as a large lepton asymmetry are known to make it first order, with possible applications to gravitational wave production. This process is sensitive to the speed of the bubble walls during the phase transition, which is difficult to compute from first principles. We take advantage of recent progress on wall speed determinations to provide a simple estimate valid in the small supercooling regime which constrains the wall speed to be significantly lower than what has been used in previous literature. This in turn strongly suppresses the production of gravitational waves, to a level that is just out of reach of the most sensitive projected experiment for this signal, $\mu$Ares. While our analysis approximates the equation of state using the template model, we demonstrate that our conclusions remain robust when incorporating state-of-the-art QCD equation of state data.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $ q\bar q\to Z^* \to hA \to4\tau$ process within the lepton-specific 2HDM at the LHC</title>

Abstract: We analyse light Higgs scalar and pseudoscalar associated hadro-production in the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-X (or lepton-specific) within the parameter space allowed by theoretical self-consistency requirements as well as the latest experimental constraints from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), precision data and $B$ physics. Over the viable regions of such a scenario, the Standard Model-like Higgs boson discovered at the LHC in 2012 is the heavier CP-even state $H$. Furthermore, in the Type-X scenario, due to large $\tan\beta$, the lighter Higgs scalar $h$ and the pseudoscalar $A$ mainly decay into two $\tau$ leptons. Therefore, we concentrate on analysing the signal process $pp\to Z^{*} \to hA\to \tau^{+}\tau^{-}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to \ell \nu_\ell \ell \nu_\ell \tau_h \tau_h$ (where $\ell= e, \mu$ whereas $\tau_h$ represents the hadronic decay of the $\tau$) and explore the feasibility of conducting such a search at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}~=$ 14 TeV and a luminosity of $L~=~300~fb^{-1}$. To suppress the huge SM background, we confine ourselves to consider the fraction of signal events with two same-sign $\tau$ leptons further decaying into same-sign leptons while the other two $\tau$ leptons decay hadronically. We find that a combination of kinematical selection and machine learning (ML) analysis will yields significant sensitivity to this process at the end of the LHC Run 3.</description>

      <title>Beautiful Majorana Higgses at Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a novel collider signature within the minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model, featuring a Higgs sector composed of a bi-doublet and two triplets. Our study focuses on a region of the parameter space where the $SU(2)_R$ charged gauge boson $W_R$ lies in the multi-TeV regime (3-100 TeV) and the additional Higgs states play a significant role. In this scenario, a heavy neutral Higgs boson $\Delta$ with a dominant $SU(2)_R$ triplet component can be produced in association with either a Standard Model Higgs boson or a massive weak boson. The subsequent decay of the heavy Higgs into Majorana neutrinos $N$ results in displaced lepton signatures, providing a striking manifestation of lepton number violation. Additionally, we explore how the production of $b$-jets in these processes can enhance hadron-collider sensitivity to such signals. A particularly compelling channel, $pp \to b \bar b NN$, offers the exciting possibility of simultaneously probing the spontaneous mass origin of both Dirac fermions and Majorana states. Based on an optimised event selection strategy and state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations, we outline the expected reach at the HL-LHC and future colliders. Our findings demonstrate that this channel probes a region of parameter space where the neutral Higgs triplet and heavy neutrino masses are relatively light ($m_\Delta \lesssim 250$ GeV, $m_N \lesssim 80$ GeV), indirectly constraining the $W_R$ boson to the deep multi-TeV domain, with sensitivity extending up to 70-80 TeV, effectively turning the LHC into a precision machine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model involves a pointlike 4-fermion interaction. While it gives a useful description of chiral dynamics (mainly in QCD), it nonetheless omits the crucially important internal wave-function of a two-body bound state, $\phi(r)$. This becomes significant near critical coupling where $\phi(r)$ extends to large distance, leading to dilution and suppression of induced couplings $\propto \phi(0)$, such as the Yukawa and quartic couplings, as well as reduced fine-tuning of a hierarchy. In top quark condensation, where the BEH boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state and we have a UV completion such as topcolor, we must go beyond the NJL model and include effects of $\phi(r)$. We provide a formulation of this for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, and find that it leads to an extended $\phi(r)$, a significantly reduced and natural composite scale of $M_0 \sim 6$ TeV, a successful prediction for the quartic coupling, $\lambda$, and fine tuning that is reduced to a few percent, providing a compelling candidate solution to the naturalness problem of the BEH boson. The theory is testable and new physics should begin to emerge on the multi-TeV mass scales and possibly accessible to the LHC.</description>

      <title>Detectable MeV Neutrino Signals from Neutron-Star Common-Envelope Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common-envelope evolution - where a star is engulfed by a companion - is a critical but poorly understood step in, e.g., the formation pathways for gravitational-wave sources. However, it has been extremely challenging to identify observable signatures of such systems. We show that for systems involving a neutron star, the hypothesized super-Eddington accretion onto the neutron star produces MeV-range, months-long neutrino signals within reach of present and planned detectors. While there are substantial uncertainties on the rate of such events (0.01-1/century in the Milky Way) and the neutrino luminosity (which may be less than the accretion power), this signal can only be found if dedicated new analyses are developed. If detected, the neutrino signal would probe super-Eddington accretion, leading to significant new insights into the astrophysics of common-envelope evolution.</description>

      <title>Emergent chirality and superfluidity of parity-doubled baryons in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose novel superfluids induced by the parity-doubled baryons. The parity-doubled baryons, i.e., a nucleon $N(940)$ with spin-parity $J^{P}=1/2^{+}$ and an excited nucleon $N^{\ast}(1535)$ with $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ in vacuum, become degenerate at sufficiently high density where the chiral symmetry is restored. In this study, we extend the conventional $\mathrm{U}(1)$ chiral symmetry to the higher dimensional symmetries, dubbed emergent chiral symmetries, including the naive and mirror assignments as their subgroups. Starting with the Lagrangian up to four-point interactions among the neutron $n$ and its chiral partner $n^{\ast}$, neutral components in $N$ and $N^{\ast}$, in pure neutron matter, we investigate the properties of the ground state with a pairing gap generated by the $n$ and $n^{\ast}$ in the mean-field approximation. We find vector-type condensates that induce the dynamical breaking of a new class of internal symmetries, emergent chiral symmetries, as well as the baryon number and the rotational symmetries of the real space, indicating the appearance of massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons consisting of six quarks: emergent pions, superfluid phonons, and magnons, respectively. We also study the fermionic excitation modes at low-energy scales, and show that they exhibit a spatial anisotropy of the propagation at the Dirac cone in momentum space. Some phenomenological implications are advocated, shedding new light on the properties of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Topological Responses of the Standard Model Gauge Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local Lie algebra of the Standard Model (SM) is $su(3)\times su(2) \times u(1)$, yet its global gauge group, $G_{{\rm SM}_{\rm q}}=$SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1)/$\mathbb{Z}_{\rm q}$, q$=1,2,3,6$ remains undetermined. Building on previous work on 4d anomalies and 5d cobordism invariants, we classify lower-dimensional invertible field theories (iFTs) or symmetry-protected topological states (SPTs) in 4d, 3d, 2d, and 1d. While the integer SPTs are hard to detect, the fractional SPTs produce measurable topological responses. In particular, the symmetry fractionalization labeled by $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{6/{\rm q}}$ in [arXiv:2411.18160] introduces the symmetry-enriched SM variants, denoted as SM$_{({\rm q},k)}$. We further introduce a new integer $n$ series of baryon-minus-lepton $({\bf B}-{\bf L})$-like U(1) symmetries, $X_n \equiv n (\mathbf{B}-\mathbf{L}) + (1-\frac{n}{N_c})\tilde{Y}$ with electroweak hypercharge $\tilde{Y}$, $n\ge1$, $N_c=3$, where the charge $q_{X_n} = q_{\tilde{Y}} \mod n$. Analyzing the symmetry-enriched SM with 0-form and 1-form symmetries $(G_{[0]}, G_{[1]})$, symmetry-twist group homomorphism $\rho$, and symmetry frationalization obstruction $[\beta]$, their spacetime-internal gauge bundle constraints, and their mixed anomalies, we derive the fractional topological response $\sigma_n({\rm q},k)=\frac{{\rm q}(1-n)\gcd(2,n)}{2n}+\frac{k{\rm q}}{6}\mod1.$ Our $\sigma_n$ response requires more general Spin$^c$ manifolds for odd $n$ and Spin manifolds for even $n$. For a given $n$ (with $n\ge 7$ and $n\ne 10,12,15,30$), $\sigma_n$ uniquely fixes the gauge group parameter q and fractionalization label $k$. Moreover, using pairs such as $(n_1,n_2)=(2,3),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)$, etc. uniquely distinguishes SM$_{({\rm q},k)}$. Our results illuminate the global structure of the SM gauge group via measurable topological responses.</description>

      <title>Some insights on the partonic collectivity in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elliptic flow and Number of Constituent Quarks scaling provide crucial insights into the underlying dynamics and degrees of freedom in heavy-ion collisions. This article provides some insights on the transition from hadronic to partonic collectivity, revealing possible key signatures of medium evolution. At low energies around ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \leq 4.0$ GeV), $v_2$ may be negative and NCQ scaling might break down. We expect that as the collision energy rises beyond 4.0 GeV, $v_2$ may become positive and NCQ scaling gradually restores. The transition in $v_2$ behavior, coupled with the breakdown and restoration of NCQ scaling, highlights the increasing significance of partonic interactions at higher energies, marking the onset of partonic collectivity and the emergence of quark-gluon plasma (QGP)-like properties.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on SIGW with Future Pulsar Timing Array Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays are playing a crucial role in the ongoing gravitational wave astronomy revolution. The current evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nHz frequencies offers an opportunity to discover cosmological signals and threatens the observability of other subdominant GWs. We explore prospects to constrain second-order scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) associated with enhanced curvature perturbations in the primordial universe, forecasting realistic future PTA datasets. We assess how the currently observed signal could eventually limit future capabilities to search for GW relics of primordial phenomena and associated phenomenological consequences such as primordial black hole (PBH) formation. Given the sensitivity of PBH abundance to spectral parameters, measuring it remains a challenge for realistic signals. However, future observation could still rule out nearly subsolar mass PBHs formed through standard formation scenarios in some cases. Future progress in constraining PBH models is expected to stem from theoretical advancements in PBH computations, which should help resolve the tension between different computational methods. The analysis is based on and extends the Python code $\texttt{fastPTA}$.</description>

      <title>Core-collapse supernova explosions hindered by eV-mass sterile neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light sterile neutrinos, $\nu_s$, are often introduced to explain an anomalous deficit in the electron antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. If they exist, sterile neutrinos would also be produced in collapsing massive stars through the active-sterile neutrino oscillation. In order to investigate the impacts of sterile neutrinos on supernova dynamics, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core-collapse coupled with the active-sterile oscillation through the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect. As the initial condition of our simulations, we adopt a blue supergiant model that is tuned to reproduce observational features of the SN 1987A progenitor to compare our models with observations of the event. It is found that the active-sterile oscillation reduces the $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes and decreases the explosion energy. We also find that, if the mixing angle $\theta$ and the mass difference $\delta m_\mathrm{s}^2$ between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_s$ are large enough, the star fails to explode. This suggests that these mixing parameters relevant to sterile neutrinos could be constrained by supernova explodability, though other uncertainties in supernova theory need to be addressed to refine them. In addition, we predict neutrino signals from a nearby supernova event and find that the neutrino event number can significantly decrease because the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes are reduced. In particular, DUNE observations of $\nu_e$ will be useful to search for a signature of sterile neutrinos with a tiny mixing angle because a smaller mixing angle leads to a larger effect on the $\nu_e$ flux.</description>

      <title>The Trinity of black hole correspondences: Shadows-quasinormal modes-graybody factors and cautionary remarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correspondences between apparently distant concepts are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. In the context of Black Holes (BHs), Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) were shown to be linked to both shadows, in the so-called eikonal limit, and Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the accuracy of the QNM-GBF correspondence in the context of the Hawking radiation for static and rotating black hole configurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our analysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking spectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between BH shadows and GBFs by drawing a correspondence between such quantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime configurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies, including regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are discussed. This study opens new perspectives by introducing a new correspondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these connections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isospin symmetry is well fulfilled in the QCD vacuum, as evidenced by small mass differences of isospin partners and suppressed isospin-violating decays. Recently, the NA61/SHINE collaboration reported an unexpectedly large isospin-violating charged-to-neutral kaon ratio in Ar-Sc heavy-ion collisions (HIC).Using a quark recombination approach, we introduce a function of kaon multiplicities that reduces to unity in the isospin-symmetric limit independently of the scattering energy and type of nuclei. Using this quantity, we show that nucleus-nucleus collisions violate isospin sizably (at the $6.4\sigma$--level), while proton-proton data on kaon multiplicities do not. We predict other isospin-violating enhancements in HIC, such as the proton-to-neutron ratio $p/n \sim 1.2$ and the hyperon ratio $\Sigma^{+}/\Sigma^{-}\sim1.4$. Finally, we extend the approach to antiquarks in the initial state, useful for e.g. pion-nucleus scattering reactions.</description>
