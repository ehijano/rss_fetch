      <title>Secant sheaves on abelian n-folds with real multiplication and Weil classes on abelian 2n-folds with complex multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let K be a CM-field, i.e., a totally complex quadratic extension of a totally real field F. Let X be a g-dimensional abelian variety admitting an algebra embedding of F into the rational endomorphisms End_Q(X) of X. Let A be the product of X and Pic^0(X). We construct an embedding e of K into End_Q(A) associated to a choice of an F-bilinear polarization h on X and a purely imaginary element q in K. We get the [K:Q]-dimensional subspace HW(A,e) of Hodge Weil classes in the d-th cohomology of A, where d:=4g/[K:Q].
  Let V be the first cohomology of A. The even cohomology S^+ of X is the half-spin representation of the group Spin(V) and so the projectivization P(S^+) contains the even spinorial variety. The latter is a component of the Grassmannian of maximal isotropic subspaces of V. We associate to (h,q) a rational 2^[F:Q]-dimensional subspace B of S^+ such that P(B) is secant to the spinorial variety. Associated to two coherent sheaves G and G' on X with Chern characters in B we obtain the object E in D^b(A) by applying Orlov's equivalence between D^b(XxX) and D^b(A) to the outer tensor product of G and G'. The flat deformations of a normalized Chern class k(E) of E remain of Hodge type under every deformation of (A,e) as an abelian variety (A',e') of Weil type.
  We provide a criterion for the tensor product of ch(G) and ch(G') to belong to the open subset in the tensor square of B for which the algebraicity of the flat deformation of k(E) implies the algebraicity of all classes in HW(A',e'). The algebraicity would thus follow if E is semiregular in the appropriate sense. Examples of such secant sheaves G and G' are provided for X the Jacobian with real multiplication by a real quadratic number field F of a genus 4 curve. The semiregularity of E has not been addressed yet.</description>

      <title>The Chow ring of a sequence of point and rational curve blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of point and rational curve blow-ups blow-ups of smooth $3-$dimensional projective varieties $Z_{i}$ defined over an algebraically closed field $\mathit{k}$, $Z_{s}\xrightarrow{\pi_{s}} Z_{s-1}\xrightarrow{\pi_{s-1}}\cdot\cdot\cdot\xrightarrow{\pi_{2}} Z_{1}\xrightarrow{\pi_{1}} Z_{0}$, with $Z_{0}\cong\mathbb{P}^{3}$, we give an explicit presentations of the Chow ring $A^{\bullet}(Z_{s})$ of its sky. We prove that, in contrast to the case of sequences of point blow-ups, the skies of two sequences of point and rational curve blow-ups of the same length and even with the same proximity relations may have non-isomorphic Chow rings. Moreover, we explore some necessary conditions for the existence of such an isomorphism under some proximity configurations, and we apply the previous results in order to establish the allowed proximity type between two irreducible components of the exceptional divisor when both are regularly and projectively contractable.</description>

Abstract: Let K be a CM-field, i.e., a totally complex quadratic extension of a totally real field F. Let X be a g-dimensional abelian variety admitting an algebra embedding of F into the rational endomorphisms of X. Let A be the product of X and Pic^0(X). We construct an embedding e of K into the rational endomorphism algebra of A associated to a choice of an F-blilinear polarization on X and a totally imaginary element q in K. We get the [K:Q]-dimensional subspace HW(A,e) of Hodge Weil classes in the d-th cohomology of A, where d:=4g/[K:Q]. We detail a strategy for proving the algebraicity of the Weil classes on all deformation of (A,e,h) as a polarized abelian variety of split Weil type, where h is an e(K) compatible polarization. We then specialize to the case F=Q, so that K is an imaginary quadratic number field. We survey how the above strategy was used to prove the algebraicity of the Weil classes on polarized abelian sixfolds of split Weil type. The algebraicity of the Weil classes on all abelian fourfold of Weil type follows. The Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties of dimension at most 5 is known to follow from the latter result.</description>

      <title>Moduli Stacks of $G$-Curves in Homotopy Theory at $h=p-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the action on the deformation space of a formal group by the maximal finite subgroup $G$ of its automorphisms, at the first height where the group has nontrivial $p$-torsion for odd $p$. We show given this group $G$ there is a universal construction of a geometric model of the $G$-action via inverse Galois theory which generalizes the use of level structure to ramification data. We use configuration spaces to understand the model, and conclude that the Lubin-Tate action at $h=p-1$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group action on the configuration space of $p+1$ points on $\mathbb{P}^1$.</description>

      <title>\'Etale Reconstruction for $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$-Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voevodsky proved that normal schemes of finite type over finitely generated fields of characteristic $0$ can be reconstructed from their \'etale sites. Let $K$ be a field that is finitely generated over $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$. Grothendieck conjectured that perfections of finite type $K$-schemes can be reconstructed from their \'etale sites. Adapting Voevodsky's methods, we prove this.</description>

      <title>A categorical perspective on non-abelian localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In equivariant geometry, a localization (a.k.a., concentration) theorem is typically interpreted as a relationship between the equivariant geometry of a space with a group action and the geometry of its fixed locus. We take a different perspective, that of non-abelian localization: a localization theorem relates the geometry of an algebraic stack that is equipped with a $\Theta$-stratification to the geometry of the centers of this stratification. We establish a ``virtual'' $K$-theoretic non-abelian localization formula, meaning it applies to algebraic derived stacks with perfect cotangent complexes. We also establish a categorical upgrade of this theorem, by introducing a category of ``highest weight $K$-homology cycles'' with respect to the stratification, and relating the category of highest weight cycles on the stack to those on the centers of its $\Theta$-stratification. We apply these results to prove a universal wall-crossing formula, and establish a new finiteness theorem for the cohomology of tautological complexes on the stack of one-dimensional sheaves on an algebraic surface.</description>

      <title>Motivic Classes of Isotropic Degeneracy Loci and Symmetric Orbit Closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide explicit formulas for computing the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes of degeneracy loci, especially those coming from the symplectic and odd orthogonal Grassmannians. The Chern--Schwartz--MacPherson classes, K-theory classes, and Cappell--Shaneson L-classes arise as specializations of the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes. Our result is the analogue of the result of Anderson--Chen--Tarasca for the degeneracy loci from the ordinary Grassmannians. As applications, we obtain the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes of orthogonal and symplectic orbit closures in flag varieties.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we propose a conjecture that clarifies the relationship between the number of degree d elliptic curves in complex four-dimensional projective Fano hypersurfaces and their degree d elliptic Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants. The elliptic GW invariants are computed using the elliptic virtual structure constants proposed in our previous works.</description>

      <title>The \'etale fundamental group and $F$-divided sheaves in characteristic $p&gt;0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the \'etale fundamental group controls local systems in characteristic $p$, namely $F$-divided sheaves. In analogy with Grothendieck-Malcev's results for discrete groups, we show that if a morphism $f \colon Y \to X$ of smooth projective varieties over $k=\bar{k}$ induces a surjection on the \'etale fundamental groups, then the pullback functor ${\rm Fdiv}(X)\to {\rm Fdiv}(Y)$ is fully faithful. If $f$ is surjective and the induced map is an isomorphism, then the functor is an equivalence. These results extend the theorem of Esnault-Mehta on the triviality of $F$-divided sheaves over simply connected varieties.</description>

      <title>The MMP singularities of GIT versus Baily-Borel compactifications for the ball quotient case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the geometric invariant theory and the Baily-Borel theory both apply to a moduli space, the two resulting compactifications do not necessarily coincide. They usually differ by a birational transformation in terms of an arrangement, for which the general pattern was firstly described by Looijenga. In this paper, we compare the MMP singularities on both sides for the ball quotient case. We show that if the relevant arrangement is nonempty, the birational transformation from the GIT compactification to the Baily-Borel compactification turns non-log canonical singularities to log canonical singularities. We illustrate this with the moduli spaces of quartic curves, rational elliptic surfaces and cubic threefolds.</description>

      <title>The Narasimhan-Seshadri Theorem revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact Riemann surface. The famous Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem [13] of 1965 uses the Grothendieck construction [4] of 1956 that associates vector bundles $E(\sigma)$ on $X$ to representations $\sigma$ of a certain Fuchsian group $\pi$. Narasimhan and Seshadri show that by taking the representations $\sigma$ to be irreducible unitary of a certain kind, this exactly gives all stable vector bundles on $X$ of a given rank and degree.
  In this note we reformulate the correspondence from representations to bundles, which leads to simpler statements and proofs. The Fuchsian group $\pi$ is replaced by the punctured fundamental group $\pi_1(X-x)$ where $x\in X$. The Grothendieck bundles $E(\sigma)$ then become Deligne's logarithmic extensions to $X$ of bundles with connections on $X-x$ associated to representations of $\pi_1(X-x)$ with scalar local monodromy. We also report how some ideas from algebraic geometry (which were all in place by 1970) have simplified some aspects of the original proof over the decades.
  This simplified approach works equally well for all values of the genus $g$, removing the restriction $g\ge 2$ in the 1965 original. Finally, we comment that such a logarithmic reformulation extends to related kinds of bundles such as principal bundles with reductive structure groups or parabolic bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a refinement of Pixton's formula for the double ramification cycle with target variety which takes into account the correlator of a rubber map previously introduced by the authors. To do so, we need to: reinterpret the correlator in terms of (logarithmic) roots of the trivial line bundle; refine the natural stratification of the boundary of moduli of maps to keep track of how torsion line bundles on the target variety pull-back. We apply the refined DR cycle formula to compute 0-correlated invariants for genus g curve with points and a $\lambda$-class insertion.</description>

Abstract: It is known that any meromorphic connection on the Riemann sphere determines a finite diagram encoding its global Cartan matrix, and that it is invariant under the Fourier-Laplace transform. If the connection is tame at finite distance and untwisted at infinity, the diagram is actually a graph, corresponding to a symmetric generalised Cartan matrix, and it was proved by Boalch/Hiroe-Yamakawa that the corresponding nonabelian Hodge moduli space contains the Nakajima quiver variety of the graph as an open subset. In this note, we show that there exist new nonabelian Hodge diagrams that are graphs, beyond the setting of this quiver modularity theorem. The proof relies on observing that edge multiplicities in nonabelian Hodge diagrams satisfy ultrametric inequalities, which in particular gives a precise characterisation of nonabelian Hodge graphs coming from the untwisted setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a polarised Calabi-Yau threefold $(X,H)$. We reduce a version of the Bayer-Macr\`i-Toda conjecture for $(X,H)$, which ensures the existence of Bridgeland stability conditions on $X$, to verifying a Brill-Noether-type inequality for curves on $X$. We then prove this inequality for a broad class of Calabi-Yau threefolds, including complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds in weighted projective spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce rational bounded $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-laminations on a marked surface $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ as a proposed topological model for the rational tropical points $\mathcal{A}_{Sp_4,\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}(\mathbb{Q}^{\mathsf{T}})$ of the Fock--Goncharov moduli space [FG06]. Our space consists of certain equivalence classes of $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-webs introduced by Kuperberg [Kup96], together with rational measures. We define tropical coordinate systems using the $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-case of the intersection number of Shen--Sun--Weng [SSW25], and establish a bijection using the framework of the graded $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-skein algebra. This provides a topological perspective for Fock--Goncharov duality for $\mathfrak{sp}_4$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we generalize a theorem of Kudla-Rapoport-Yang which gives a formula for the arithmetic degree of the moduli space of CM elliptic curves together with a special endomorphism of a specified degree. Our extension is to the moduli space of QM abelian surfaces with CM together with a special endomorphism of a specified QM degree.</description>

      <title>AI Noether -- Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Laws Derived by AI Systems and Canonical Knowledge via Abductive Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert) enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Derivations Of K-Theoretic Donaldson Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory on $X\times S^1$, with $X$ a closed smooth four-manifold. A partial topological twisting along $X$ renders the theory formally independent of the metric on $X$. The theory depends on the spin structure and the circumference $R$ of $S^1$. The coefficients of the $R$-expansion of the partition function are Witten indices, which are identified with $L^2$-indices of Dirac operators on moduli spaces of instantons. The partition function encodes BPS indices for instanton particles on a spatial manifold $X$, and these indices are special cases of K-theoretic Donaldson invariants. When the 't Hooft flux of the gauge theory is nonzero and $X$ is not spin, the 5d theory can be anomalous, but this anomaly can be canceled by coupling to a line bundle with connection for the global $U(1)$ ``instanton number symmetry''. For $b_2^+(X)&gt;0$ we can derive the partition function from integration over the Coulomb branch of the effective 4d low-energy theory. When $X$ is toric we can also use equivariant localization with respect to the $\mathbb{C}^* \times \mathbb{C}^*$ symmetry. The two methods lead to the same results for the wall-crossing formula. We also determine path integrals for four-manifolds with $b_2^+(X)&gt;1$. Our results agree with those for algebraic surfaces by G\"ottsche, Kool, Nakajima, Yoshioka, and Williams, but apply to a larger class of manifolds. When the circumference of the circle is tuned to special values, the path integral is associated with the 5d superconformal $E_1$ theory. Topological invariants in this case involve generalizations of Seiberg-Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>Faltings elliptic curves in twisted $\mathbb Q$-isogeny classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be the graph attached to the $\mathbb Q$-isogeny class of an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb Q$: that is, a vertex for every elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb Q$ in the isogeny class, and edges in correspondence with the prime degree rational isogenies between them. Stevens shows that there is a unique elliptic curve in $G$ with minimal Faltings height. We call this curve the Faltings elliptic curve in $G$.
  For every square-free integer $d$, we consider the graph~$G^d$ attached to the twisted elliptic curves in $G$ by the quadratic character of $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{d})$. It turns out that $G$ and $G^d$ are canonically isomorphic as abstract graphs (the isomorphism identifies the vertices with equal $j$-invariant). In this paper we determine which vertex is the Faltings elliptic curve in $G^d$. We also obtain the probability of a vertex in $G$ to be the Faltings elliptic curve in~$G^d$. It turns out that this probability depends on the $p$-adic valuations of rational values of certain modular functions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-flag manifolds and moment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of topological $G$-spaces generalizing the classical flag manifolds $G/T$ of compact connected Lie groups. These spaces, which we call the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds $ F_m = F_m(G,T) $, are topological realizations of the algebras $ Q_k(W) $ of $k$-quasi-invariant polynomials of the Weyl group $ W $ in the sense that their (even-dimensional) $G$-equivariant cohomology $ H_G(F_m, {\mathbb C}) $ is naturally isomorphic to $ Q_k(W) $, where $ m $ is a $W$-invariant integer-valued function on the system of roots of $W$ and $ k = \frac{m}{2}$ or $ \frac{m+1}{2}$ depending on whether $m$ is even or odd. Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to the flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We obtain our cohomological results by constructing rational algebraic models of quasi-flag manifolds in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks introduced by B.To\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework for rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the equivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our cohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side, our approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the diagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of subgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects introduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory.</description>

Abstract: The resonance varieties, the holonomy Lie algebra, and the holonomy Chen Lie algebra associated with the Orlik-Solomon algebra of a matroid provide an algebraic lens through which to examine the rich combinatorial structure of matroids and their geometric realizations as complex hyperplane arrangements. In this survey paper, we emphasize the commonalities between these objects but also the possible ways in which realizable and non-realizable matroids differ, leading to some open questions.</description>

We also give some special curves in four-dimensional pseudo-Galilean space and their characterisations, such as position curve, osculating curve, normal curve, rectifying curve, slant helices, and spherical curves. Moreover, this study provides classifications of admissible curves in $G_{1}^{4}$. That is, the admissible rectifying curves lying fully in the $G_{1}^{4}$ are expressed and given necessary and sufficient conditions for such a curve to be an admissible rectifying curve, osculating curve, normal curve, slant helices and spherical curves in $G_{1}^{4}$.</description>

      <title>From Affine to Polynomial: Synthesizing Loops with Branches via Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring software correctness remains a fundamental challenge in formal program verification. One promising approach relies on finding polynomial invariants for loops. Polynomial invariants are properties of a program loop that hold before and after each iteration. Generating such invariants is a crucial task in loop analysis, but it is undecidable in the general case. Recently, an alternative approach to this problem has emerged, focusing on synthesizing loops from invariants. However, existing methods only synthesize affine loops without guard conditions from polynomial invariants. In this paper, we address a more general problem, allowing loops to have polynomial update maps with a given structure, inequations in the guard condition, and polynomial invariants of arbitrary form.
  We use algebraic geometry tools to design and implement an algorithm that computes a finite set of polynomial equations whose solutions correspond to all nondeterministic branching loops satisfying the given invariants. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of invariants for which we present a significantly more efficient algorithm. In other words, we reduce the problem of synthesizing loops to find solutions of multivariate polynomial systems with rational entries. This final step is handled in our software using an SMT solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a natural enlargement of the BGG Category O for a semisimple Lie algebra: the category of weight modules with trivial central character and finite-dimensional weight spaces supported on the root lattice. We give a geometric realization of this category as unipotently monodromic sheaves on the flag variety satisfying a singular support condition. We then explain that a derived version $\mathcal{D}$ of this category is Koszul dual to the Kazhdan-Laumon Category O, a different enlargement of the BGG Category O obtained from a gluing construction for sheaves on the flag variety. This characterizes $\mathcal{D}$ as the category of algebras over a natural monad on a direct sum of copies of the derived Category O. These results give new interpretations of certain classical algebraic constructions of weight modules over semisimple Lie algebras due to Fernando and Mathieu. We also conjecture that our results fit naturally into a proposed Koszul duality relating the small quantum group and the semi-infinite flag variety to the geometry of affine Springer fibers.</description>

Abstract: We show that a purely algebraic structure, a two-dimensional scattering diagram, describes a large part of the wall-crossing behavior of moduli spaces of Bridgeland semistable objects in the derived category of coherent sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$. This gives a new algorithm computing the Hodge numbers of the intersection cohomology of the classical moduli spaces of Gieseker semistable sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, or equivalently the refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants for compactly supported sheaves on local $\mathbb{P}^2$.
  As applications, we prove that the intersection cohomology of moduli spaces of Gieseker semistable sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$ is Hodge-Tate, and we give the first non-trivial numerical checks of the general $\chi$-independence conjecture for refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants of one-dimensional sheaves on local $\mathbb{P}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.02992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove N.Takahashi's conjecture determining the contribution of each contact point in genus-$0$ maximal contact Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathbb{P}^2$ relative to a smooth cubic $E$. This is a new example of a question in Gromov-Witten theory which can be fully solved despite the presence of contracted components and multiple covers. The proof relies on a tropical computation of the Gromov-Witten invariants and on the interpretation of the tropical picture as describing wall-crossing in the derived category of coherent sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, giving a translation of the original Gromov-Witten question into a known statement about Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of one-dimensional Gieseker semistable sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$.
  The same techniques allow us to prove a new sheaves/Gromov-Witten correspondence, relating Betti numbers of moduli spaces of one-dimensional Gieseker semistable sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, or equivalently refined genus-$0$ Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of local $\mathbb{P}^2$, with higher-genus maximal contact Gromov-Witten theory of $(\mathbb{P}^2,E)$. The correspondence involves the non-trivial change of variables $y=e^{i \hbar}$, where $y$ is the refined/cohomological variable on the sheaf side, and $\hbar$ is the genus variable on the Gromov-Witten side. We explain how this correspondence can be heuristically motivated by a combination of mirror symmetry and hyperk\"ahler rotation.</description>

      <title>Moduli of Admissible Pairs for Arbitrary Dimension, I: Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.11194v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A procedure resolving a torsion-free coherent sheaf on a nonsingular $N$-dimensional projective algebraic variety into a locally free sheaf on a projective scheme of certain class is proposed. This is a higher-dimensional analog of the resolution (called the standard resolution in previous works of the author) of coherent sheaves on a surface. The method is applicable to all existing flat families of torsion-free sheaves including those who does not contain locally free sheaves.

      <description>arXiv:2207.04270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate a combinatorial object to sequences of point blow-ups over perfect fields, the weighted directed graph, and another one to the composition of all blow-ups, which we call associated sequential morphisms, the $d-$ary intersection form. Then, in order to consider different fields extensions, we introduce the concepts of algebraically and combinatorially compatible partitions of the exceptional divisor for both sequences of point blow-ups and sequential morphisms, which lead us to define the corresponding algebraic and combinatorial equivalence classes. We prove that there exists a bijection between the respective combinatorial equivalence classes of sequences of point blow-ups and the associated sequential morphisms, and moreover, we also give a proof of the existence of a suitable bijection between the respective algebraic equivalence classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deformation theory of the Fano scheme $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{F}(\mathrm{X})$ of lines on a cubic $\mathrm{X}$ of dimension $d$ with only finitely many singularities. By taking the relative Fano scheme, we define a morphism $\eta:\mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{X}}\rightarrow\mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{F}}$ of the local moduli functors associated to $\mathrm{X}$ and $\mathrm{F}$, respectively. We show that for $d\geqslant 5$, $\eta$ yields an isomorphism on first-order deformations; in particular, $\eta$ is an isomorphism whenever $\mathrm{H}^{0}(\Theta_{\mathrm{X}})=0$.</description>

      <title>Special Values without Semi-Simplicity Via K-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, motivated by studying special values of zeta functions attached to finite type F_p-schemes, we introduce a category of ``arithmetic C(S^1,R)-modules'' attached to any Dedekind ring R, and compute the 0th K-group of this category. Specializing to the case of R=Z_l for some prime l neq p (resp. R=Z_p), we prove that there is a natural functorial lift of the etale cohomology of perfect etale Z_l sheaves (resp. syntomic cohomology of perfect prismatic F-gauges) on a point to arithmetic C(S^1,Z_l)-modules (resp. arithmetic C(S^1,Z_p)-modules). This allows us to define a notion of the multiplicative Euler characteristic via a map from the K_0-group which makes sense without assuming Tate's semi-simplicity conjecture. In particular, we can remove this hypothesis from a theorem of Milne proving a cohomological formula for zeta values attached to smooth proper F_p-schemes. We also discuss extensions of these zeta value formulae to finite type F_p-schemes, and how recent progress in motivic homotopy theory allows us to prove some results without any assumptions on resolution of singularities or Tate's semi-simplicity conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 00s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and several $G$-birational invariants introduced in the pioneering works Kontsevich, Kresch, Pestun, Tschinkel, along with presenting applications. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal C}$ be a fixed equisingularity class of irreducible germs of complex analytic plane curves. We compute a basis of the ${\mathbb C}[[x]]$-module of K\"ahler differentials for generic $\Gamma \in {\mathcal C}$, algorithmically, and study its behaviour under blow-up.
  As a first application, we give an algorithm providing the generic semimodule in an equisingularity class in terms of its multiplicity and its Puiseux characteristic exponents. As another application, we give an alternative proof for a formula of Genzmer, that provides the dimension of the moduli of analytic classes in the equisingularity class of $\Gamma$.</description>

Abstract: Using the $\infty$-categorical enhancement of mixed Hodge modules constructed by the author in a previous paper, we explain how mixed Hodge modules canonically extend to algebraic stacks, together with all the $6$ operations and weights. We also prove that Drew's approach to motivic Hodge modules gives an $\infty$-category that embeds fully faithfully in mixed Hodge modules, and we identify the image as mixed Hodge modules of geometric origin.</description>

      <title>Stability condition on a singular surface and its resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a surface with an ADE-singularity and let $\widetilde{X}$ be its crepant resolution. In this paper, we show that there exists a Bridgeland stability condition $\sigma_X$ on ${\rm D}^b(X)$ and a weak stability condition $\sigma_{\widetilde{X}}$ on the derived category of the desingularisation ${\rm D}^b(\widetilde{X})$, such that pushforward of $\sigma_{\widetilde{X}}$-semistable objects are $\sigma_X$-semistable
  We first construct Bridgeland stability conditions on ${\rm D}^b(\widetilde{X})$ associated to the contraction $\widetilde{X} \longrightarrow X$, generalizing the results of Tramel and Xia in \cite{TX22}, Then we deform it to a weak stability condition $\sigma_{\widetilde{X}}$ and show that it descends to ${\rm D}^b(X)$, producing the stability condition $\sigma_X$.
  Finally, we study the moduli spaces of $\sigma_{\pi^\ast H,\beta,z}$, of $\sigma_{\widetilde{X}}$, and of $\sigma_X$-semistable objects, and we show that the moduli spaces satisfy boundedness and openness, and hence are all Artin stacks of finite type over $\mathbb{C}$.</description>

Abstract: We extend the theory of fields/distributions developed the paper "A Feigin-Frenkel theorem with n singularities" to a general base scheme. In order to do so we introduce suitable notions of topological sheaves on schemes and study their basic properties. We then construct appropriate analogues of the spaces of fields, consider multiplication of fields between them and rebuild the basic theory of vertex algebras in the setting of global distributions in place of formal power series, which takes the form of chiral algebras introduced Beilinson and Drinfeld in "Chiral Algebras".</description>

      <title>Logrithmic Versions of Ginzburg's Sharp Operation for Free Divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a complex manifold, $D\subset M$ a free divisor and $U=M\setminus D$ its complement. In this paper we study the characteristic cycle $\textup{CC}(\gamma\cdot \ind_U)$ of the restriction of a constructible function $\gamma$ on $U$. We globalise Ginzburg's local sharp construction and introduce the log transversality condition, which is a new transversality condition about the relative position of $\gamma$ and $D$. We prove that the log transversality condition is satisfied if either $D$ is normal crossing and $\gamma$ is arbitrary, or $D$ is holonomic strongly Euler homogheneous and $\gamma$ is non-characteristic. Under the log transversality assumption we establish a logarithmic pullback formula for $\textup{CC}(\gamma\cdot \ind_U)$. Mixing Ginzburg's sharp construction with the logarithmic pullback, we obtain a double restriction formula for the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class $c_*(\gamma\cdot \ind_{D\cup V})$ where $V$ is any reduced hypersurface in $M$. Applications of our results include the non-negativity of Euler characteristics of effective constructible functions, and CSM classes of hypersurfaces in the open manifold $\mathbb{P}^n\setminus D$ when $D$ is a linear free divisor or a free hyperplane arrangement.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the recent theory of Sun-Zhang on general Fano fibration (germs) which emerged from the study of non-compact Kahler-Ricci soliton metrics, primarily from an algebro-geometric perspective. In addition to reviewing the existing framework, we present new results, conjectures, and remarks. These include methods for computing weighted volumes via (restricted) volumes, Laplace transforms, and incomplete Gamma-functions, and a conjectural algebro-geometric construction (``bubbling") of Fano fibration with asymptotically conical base from degenerating Fano fibration.</description>

Of related but independent interest, we present a relationship between the characteristic and index of a $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein variety with isolated non-$F$-regular locus which is $F$-pure but not $F$-regular.</description>

In the process, we obtain Chow rings of universal Jacobians over genus $2$ curves with marked Weierstrass points, and the Chow ring of the universal pointed Jacobian. This further provides alternate computations to arxiv:2404.12607 in the genus $2$ case.</description>

      <title>On the Log Hodge Theory of Toroidal Varieties and a Partial Proof of the Absolute Hodge Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an innovative framework in logarithmic Hodge theory for toroidal varieties, introducing weighted toroidal structures and developing a systematic obstruction theory for Hodge classes. Building upon recent advances in toroidal geometry, particularly the $E_1$-degeneration results of Wei (\cite{Wei24}), we construct a categorical Hodge correspondence and prove the Absolute Hodge conjecture for projective toroidal varieties equipped with rational-weighted structures satisfying specific compatibility conditions. Our approach provides new tools for understanding the fine structure of Hodge classes and their extension properties across boundaries, with potential applications in moduli space compactifications, non-abelian Hodge theory, and tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>Strong positivity for the skein algebras of the $4$-punctured sphere and of the $1$-punctured torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.02266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kauffman bracket skein algebra is a quantization of the algebra of regular functions on the $SL_2$ character variety of a topological surface. We realize the skein algebra of the $4$-punctured sphere as the output of a mirror symmetry construction based on higher genus Gromov-Witten theory and applied to a complex cubic surface. Using this result, we prove the positivity of the structure constants of the bracelets basis for the skein algebras of the $4$-punctured sphere and of the $1$-punctured torus. This connection between topology of the $4$-punctured sphere and enumerative geometry of curves in cubic surfaces is a mathematical manifestation of the existence of dual descriptions in string/M-theory for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ $N_f=4$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.14629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the neutral block of the affine monodromic Hecke category for a reductive group is monoidally equivalent to the neutral block of the affine Hecke category for the endoscopic group. The semisimple complexes of both categories can be identified with the generalized Soergel bimodules via the Soergel functor. We extend this identification of semisimple complexes to the neutral blocks of the affine Hecke categories by the technical machinery developed by Bezrukavnikov and Yun.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present several expected properties of the holomorphic Floer theory of a holomorphic symplectic manifold. In particular, we propose a conjecture relating holomorphic Floer theory of Hitchin integrable systems and Donaldson-Thomas invariants of non-compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds. More generally, we conjecture that the BPS spectrum of a 4-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ quantum field theory can be recovered from the holomorphic Floer theory of the corresponding Seiberg-Witten integrable system.</description>

      <title>On the topology and combinatorics of decomposable arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A complex hyperplane arrangement $\mathcal{A}$ is said to be decomposable if there are no elements in the degree 3 part of its holonomy Lie algebra besides those coming from the rank 2 flats. When this purely combinatorial condition is satisfied, it is known that the associated graded Lie algebra of the arrangement group $G$ decomposes (in degrees greater than 1) as a direct product of free Lie algebras. It follows that the $I$-adic completion of the Alexander invariant $B(G)$ also decomposes as a direct sum of "local" invariants and the Chen ranks of $G$ are the sums of the local contributions. Moreover, if $B(G)$ is separated, then the degree 1 cohomology jump loci of the complement of $\mathcal{A}$ have only local components, and the algebraic monodromy of the Milnor fibration is trivial in degree 1.</description>

      <title>The action of component groups on irreducible components of Springer fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple Lie group. Consider a nilpotent element $e\in \mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_G(e)$ be the centralizer of $e$ in $G$, and let $A_e:= Z_G(e)/Z_G(e)^{o}$ be its component group. Write $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ for the set of irreducible components of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_e$. We have an action of $A_e$ on $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$. When $\mathfrak{g}$ is exceptional, we give an explicit description of $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ as an $A_e$-set. For $\mathfrak{g}$ of classical type, we describe the stabilizers for the $A_e$-action. With this description, we prove a conjecture of Lusztig and Sommers. These results suggest relations (first proposed by Lusztig) between Springer fibers and cells in Weyl groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an analogue to Quasi-$F$-splittings, Quasi-$F$-purity, which is definable over rings that are not necessarily $F$-finite. We show that this property is equivalent to being Quasi-$F$-split in the complete local and $F$-finite case. We then exhibit that it is stable under completion, direct limit, and local/finite \'etale extension.</description>

      <title>An algebraic approach to circle packing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for certain triangulations of surfaces, circle packings realising the triangulation can be found by solving a system of polynomial equations. We also present a similar system of equations for unbranched circle packings. The variables in these equations are associated to corners of triangles in the complex, with equations for interior vertices, edges, faces, and generators of first homology. The vertex equations are generalisations of the Descartes circle theorem, of higher degree but more symmetric than those previously found by the authors. We also provide some connections between the spinorial approach of previous work of the authors, and classical Euclidean geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a cubic curve $C$ over a number field, we consider the K3 surface $Y_C$ constructed as the minimal desingularisation of the quotient of $C \times C$ by an automorphism of order 3. We relate the transcendental Brauer groups of $Y_C$ and $C \times C$, allowing us to explicitly compute the former group in the case of a diagonal cubic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. We obtain conjectural insight on the existence of Galois cubic points over $\mathbb{Q}$ for everywhere locally soluble diagonal cubic curves.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of the d-dimensional non-degenerate quadric hypersurface of characteristic p &gt; 2 is a rational function of p composed from the Ehrhart polynomials of integer polytopes. In consequence, we prove that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of quadrics of fixed characteristic is a decreasing function of dimension and recover results of Trivedi and Gessel-Monsky on the behaviour of said Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity as a function of characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiview ideals arise from the geometry of image formation in pinhole cameras, and universal multiview ideals are their analogs for unknown cameras. We prove that a natural collection of polynomials form a universal Gr\"obner basis for both types of ideals using a criterion introduced by Huang and Larson, and include a proof of their criterion in our setting. Symmetry reduction and induction enable the method to be deployed on an infinite family of ideals. We also give an explicit description of the matroids on which the methodology depends, in the context of multiview ideals.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Cohomology of Dominant Line Bundles for Real Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive algebraic groups. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i&gt; 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing. Restricting to the structure sheaf, we get a characterization of the singularities of the normalization of $\mathcal{N}_\theta.$ We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.</description>

      <title>Envelope of Holomorphy of Matsuki Orbits in Complex Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the envelopes of holomorphy of Matsuki orbits $M_{\ell,m,r}$ arising as intersections of $G_0$- and $K$-orbits in complex Grassmannians. These orbits, equipped with natural CR-structures, form a class of compact homogeneous CR-submanifolds whose analytic continuation properties are of fundamental interest. Building on Rossi's theory of holomorphic extension, we establish that the envelope of holomorphy of each Matsuki orbit coincides biholomorphically with the containing $K$-orbit $O_{\ell,m}$. Our approach provides a geometric proof based on the holomorphic fiber bundle structure $\pi : M_{\ell,m,r} \to \mathrm{Gr}_{\ell}(E_+) \times \mathrm{Gr}_{m}(E_-)$, clarifying the role of compact isotropic fibers in constraining holomorphic extension. Explicit examples, including the orbit $M_{1,1,1} \subset \mathrm{Gr}_3(\mathbb{C}^8)$, illustrate the method and highlight connections with classical constructions in complex geometry and representation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we showed that the adjoint polynomial of a polyhedral cone equals the multidegree polynomial of the toric ideal with multigrading, both given by the vertex rays. This fact implies a conjecture of Aluffi, to the effect that the adjoint polynomial of a polyhedral cone in the positive orthant is a covolume polynomial.</description>
