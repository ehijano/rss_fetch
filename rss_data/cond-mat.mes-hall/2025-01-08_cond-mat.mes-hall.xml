      <title>Sub-micron Circuit Fabrication on Diamond Anvils for Mesoscopic High-Pressure Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel fabrication procedure to produce high-quality lift-off structures on diamond anvils extending from the culet down to the slanted facets. Feature sizes down to 500 nm are achieved through the use of a bi-layer resist stack and electron beam lithography. Device structures with strong adhesion to the diamond surface and high abrasion resistance are realized by optimizing the surface treatment. To benchmark our process, we fabricate a multi-lead tungsten circuit to measure changes of the superconducting transition temperature of zirconium across the structural phase transition at $\sim$30 GPa; showing a 4-fold jump of the critical temperature. Our process is easily reproducible in most traditional academic and industrial cleanroom facilities. This work paves the way for complex and high-precision fabrication and measurements inside diamond anvil cells and on other faceted crystalline samples.</description>

      <title>Probing Stress and Magnetism at High Pressures with Two-Dimensional Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure serves as a fundamental tuning parameter capable of drastically modifying all properties of matter. The advent of diamond anvil cells (DACs) has enabled a compact and tabletop platform for generating extreme pressure conditions in laboratory settings. However, the limited spatial dimensions and ultrahigh pressures within these environments present significant challenges for conventional spectroscopy techniques. In this work, we integrate optical spin defects within a thin layer of two-dimensional (2D) materials directly into the high-pressure chamber, enabling an in situ quantum sensing platform for mapping local stress and magnetic environments up to 4~GPa. Compared to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers embedded in diamond anvils, our 2D sensors exhibit around three times stronger response to local stress and provide nanoscale proximity to the target sample in heterogeneous devices. We showcase the versatility of our approach by imaging both stress gradients within the high-pressure chamber and a pressure-driven magnetic phase transition in a room-temperature self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$. Our work demonstrates an integrated quantum sensing device for high-pressure experiments, offering potential applications in probing pressure-induced phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and mechanical deformation.</description>

      <title>The dipolar Aleppo lattice: Ground state ordering and ergodic dynamics in the absence of vertex frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Aleppo spin ice geometry, another variation of decimated square ice patterns, which in contrast to similar systems previously studied, does not exhibit vertex frustration. Using synchrotron-based photoemission electron microscopy, we directly visualize low-energy states achieved after thermal annealing, in addition to temperature-dependent moment fluctuations. The results reveal the observation of ground state patterns and the absence of ergodicity-breaking dynamics. Our observations further confirm vertex frustration to be an important criterion for the emergence of ergodicity transitions.</description>

      <title>Simulating Pattern Recognition Using Non-volatile Synapses: MRAM, Ferroelectrics and Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project explores the use of non-volatile synapses in neuromorphic computing for pattern recognition tasks through a comprehensive simulation-based approach. The main approach is through spintronic synapses, which leverage the electron's spin properties to achieve efficient data processing and storage. This offers a promising alternative to traditional electronic synapses which require constant power recharge to prevent data leakage. The goal is to develop and simulate a neural network model that incorporates spintronic synapses, examining their potential to perform complex pattern recognition tasks such as image and sound classification. By building a simulation environment, we will replicate various models, including spin transfer torque based MRAM, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy based MRAM, ferroelectric field effect transistors, and skyrmion based nanotrack for synaptic devices, to evaluate their performance and compare results across different non-volatile implementations. The findings will highlight the effectiveness of spintronic synapses in creating low-power, high-performance neuromorphic hardware, providing valuable insights into their application for future energy-efficient artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Transitions from Composite Fermi Liquid to Moore-Read States in Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals represent a significant class of topological gapless materials in three dimensions and have been shown to exhibit three-dimensional quantum Hall effect. However, existing research mainly focuses on scenarios without interactions. Recent studies suggest that the fractional quantum Hall effect can arise in a Weyl semimetal with a one-third filled Landau level under a magnetic field. However, it remains unclear whether more exotic states, such as composite Fermi liquid and MooreRead states, can appear at half filling. Here we surprisingly find the existence of composite Fermi liquid, Moore-Read states and charge density waves in the same Weyl-orbit-based Landau level of a Weyl semimetal and their transitions induced by varying the distance between Weyl points. We attribute these transitions to a significant change in the single-particle wave functions of the Landau level as the distance between Weyl points is varied. Finally, we demonstrate that a transition from composite Fermi liquid to Moore-Read states can be induced by tuning the direction of a magnetic field, a process that is more experimentally accessible.</description>

      <title>Theory of Tunneling between Two-Dimensional Electron Layers Driven by Spin Pumping: Adiabatic Regime and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunneling spectroscopy between parallel two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems provides a powerful method to probe the underlying electronic properties by measuring tunneling conductance. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for spin transport in 2D-to-2D tunneling systems, driven by spin pumping. This theory applies to a vertical heterostructure where two layers of metallic 2D electron systems are separated by an insulating barrier, with one layer exchange-coupled to a magnetic layer driven at resonance. Utilizing a non-perturbative Floquet-Keldysh formalism, we derive general expressions for the tunneling spin and charge currents across a broad range of driving frequencies, extending beyond the traditional adiabatic pumping regime. At low frequencies, we obtain analytical results that recover the known behaviors in the adiabatic regime. However, at higher frequencies, our numerical findings reveal significant deviations in the dependence of spin and charge currents on both frequency and precession angle. This work offers fresh insights into the role of magnetization dynamics in tunneling transport, opening up new avenues for exploring non-adiabatic spin pumping phenomena.</description>

      <title>The signature of topology in polar and chiral non-magnetic crystal classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology is fundamental to condensed matter physics, underlying phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in its various forms, protected surface states and spin-valley locking. Central to this is the Berry curvature, a measure of the geometric properties of Bloch wavefunctions in crystals. Despite its established connections to space inversion and time-reversal symmetries, a comprehensive framework linking the Berry curvature to other crystal symmetries is still missing. Here, we present a theoretical model for the Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature in the proximity of optical resonances for all non-magnetic crystal classes. The Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature is readily derived from the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of the time-invariant point groups. We show that the diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix, which define the divergence of the Berry curvature, are non-zero only for the chiral crystal classes, pointing towards a topological origin of circular dichroism. In polar crystals, we uniquely find a non-zero curl of the Berry curvature, suggesting a topological origin of spontaneous polarization via the Maxwell-Berry equations. Our findings thus open new perspectives for the topological interpretation of textbook phenomena at the heart of condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Thermal Transport Properties of Magnons on the $\alpha$-T$_3$ Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate magnons on the $\alpha$-T$_3$ lattice. Atomistic spin dynamics simulations show that next-nearest neighbor hopping and easy-axis anisotropy stabilize ferromagnetic order in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We identify one topologically trivial magnon insulator phase and three magnon Chern insulator phases. The topologically trivial magnon insulator phase exhibits a small but non-zero magnon thermal Hall conductivity, while in the magnon Chern insulator phases the Chern number of the lowest magnon band dominates the magnon thermal Hall conductivity. The sign of the magnon thermal Hall conductivity does not change at the topological phase boundaries, but distinct changes are observed in the magnitude.</description>

      <title>Matters Arising from S. Vaitiekenas et al., "Zero-bias peaks at zero magnetic field in ferromagnetic hybrid nanowires" Nature Physics 2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021 Nature Physics published a paper by Vaitiekenas, Liu, Krogstrup and Marcus titled "Zero-bias peaks at zero magnetic field in ferromagnetic hybrid nanowires". The paper reports low temperature transport measurements on semiconductor InAs nanowires with two partly overlapping shells -- a shell of EuS, a magnetic insulator, and a shell of Al, a metal that becomes superconducting at temperatures below 1.2K. The paper claims that (1) the data are consistent with induced topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs), and (2) that this is facilitated by the breaking of the time reversal symmetry through a direct magnetic interaction with the EuS shell. In this Matters Arising, we present an alternative explanation which is based on trivial effects that are likely to appear in the reported geometry. Specifically, first, we find that data the authors present in support of the topological superconductivity claim can originate from unintended quantum dots in their devices, a widely known likely explanation that is not being discussed in the paper. Second, our analysis of the setup, supported by our numerical micromagnetic simulations, shows similar effects could be obtained due to stray magnetic fields from the region of the EuS shell damaged during Al etching. This basic picture should come before the exotic interpretation in terms of magnetic exchange interaction with a ferromagnetic insulator.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Flux Trapping in and Fabrication of Large-Scale Superconductor Circuits Using AC-Biased Shift Registers With 108500 Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of superconductor integrated circuits comprising six ac-powered SFQ shift registers with a total of 27078 bits and 108500 Josephson junctions (JJs) per 5 mm x 5 mm chip have been designed, fabricated, and tested to characterize flux trapping, fabrication process yield, and parameter spread. The six 4513-bit registers in the circuits have a common single-phase ac clock and individual input/output drivers enabling their parallel testing. We have investigated flux trapping in the circuits with various geometry, size, and distance between moats in two active ground planes (GPs), and containing up to three additional 'dummy' GPs, using multiple cooldowns through the critical temperature with various cooling rates and residual magnetic fields up to ~1.2 $\mu$T. For the slit-type and square moats arrayed along the sides of the register cells, we have found a negligible effect of flux sequestered in the moats on the operating margins of the registers, and negligible probability of detrimental flux trapping outside of the moats. Circuits with 0.3-$\mu$m-wide slit moats occupying &lt;2% of the circuit area were fully operational in 100% of cooldowns, supporting the viability of VLSI superconductor digital circuits. We have found a strong enhancement of flux trapping outside of the moats in circuits with closely spaced GPs and determined a critical distance, t$_c$=0.6 $\mu$m, between them. The presence of GPs spaced below t$_c$ rendered the circuits nonoperational in 100% of cooldowns. We have measured 30 chips with &gt;3M JJs and determined individual cell margins in 138 registers to characterize the fabrication-related parameter spread and detect fabrication defects and flux-trapping events. By finding outlier cells in the statistical distribution of the individual cell margins, we detected about one defect per million JJs, in most cases causing magnetic flux trapping in the affected cell.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of Cr$_8$ and V$_8$ molecular rings from ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.</description>

      <title>Single-molecule Scale Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy using Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single-molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single-molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. Particularly, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance, encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods. This detailed analysis serves as a foundation for the development of new technologies and the exploration of potential applications.</description>

      <title>Spin Environment of a Superconducting Qubit in High Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolishing readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carnot famously showed that engine operation is chiefly characterised by the magnitude of the temperature ratio $T_\mathrm{h}/T_\mathrm{c}$ between its hot and cold reservoirs. While temperature ratios ranging between $1.3-2.8$ and $2-10$ are common in macroscopic commercial engines and engines operating in the microscopic regime, respectively, the quest is to test thermodynamics at its extremes. Here we present the hottest engine on earth, with temperature ratios as high as $110$. We achieve this by realising an underdamped single-particle engine using a charged microparticle that is electrically levitated under vacuum conditions. Noisy electric fields are used to synthesise reservoir temperatures in excess of $10^7$ K. As a result, giant fluctuations show up in all thermodynamic quantities of the engine, such as heat exchange and efficiency. Moreover, we find that the particle experiences an effective position dependent temperature, which gives rise to dynamics that drastically deviates from that of standard Brownian motion. We develop a theoretical model accounting for the effects of this multiplicative noise and find excellent agreement with the measured dynamics. The high level of control over the presented experimental platform opens the door to emulate the stochastic dynamics of cellular and biological processes, and provides thermodynamic insight required for the development of nanotechnologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective extended conformal field theory with symmetry W_infinity*{bar W_infinity} that describes the thermodynamic limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model is considered. The dynamic structure factor of the chiral component in the repulsive regime is determined and compared with the corresponding one of the free bosonic theory, given that both share isomorphic Hilbert spaces but differ in the time evolution of quantum states. In either case, a sharp response function peaked at only one resonant frequency is found, and the physical implications of this outcome are addressed. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between this result and the corresponding one obtained in the first quantized formulation of the Calogero-Sutherland model is provided. Complete agreement in the parameter region in which both results overlap is found. This outcome provides further support to the equivalence between the first and second quantized treatments of the Calogero-Sutherland model, in which the computational advantages from integrability in the first formulation are paralleled by those from the algebraic structure of the second.</description>

      <title>Critical properties in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the localization transition in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model with quasiperiodic and Stark potentials, where the non-Hermiticity comes from the nonreciprocal hopping. The localization length, the inverse participation ratio and the energy gap are adopted as the characteristic quantities. We perform the scaling analysis to derive the scaling functions of the three quantities with critical exponents in several critical regions, with respect to the quasiperiodic and Stark potentials and the nonreciprocal strength. We numerically verify the finite-size scaling forms and extract the critical exponents in different situations. Two groups of new critical exponents for the non-Hermitian AAS model and its pure Stark limit are obtained, which are distinct to those for the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre model and their Hermitian counterparts. Our results indicate that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian AAS, Aubry-Andre, and Stark models belong to different universality classes. We demonstrate that these critical exponents are independent of the nonreciprocal strength, and remain the same in different critical regions and boundary conditions. Furthermore, we establish a hybrid scaling function with a hybrid exponent in the overlap region between the critical regions for the non-Hermitian AAS and Stark models.</description>

Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for magnetization dynamics is recast into spinor form using the real-valued Clifford algebra (geometric algebra) of three-space. We show how the undamped case can be explicitly solved to obtain component-wise solutions, with clear geometrical meaning. Generalizations of the approach to include damping are formulated. The implications of the axial property of the magnetization vector are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Flux pinning in superconducting multilayer 2H-NbSe$_2$ nano-step junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductors exhibit dissipationless supercurrents even under finite bias and magnetic field conditions, provided these remain below the critical values. However, type-II superconductors in the flux flow regime display Ohmic dissipation arising from vortex dynamics under finite magnetic fields. The interplay between supercurrent and Ohmic dissipation in a type-II superconductor is dictated by vortex motion and the robustness of vortex pinning forces. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of the superconducting phase transitions and vortex dynamics in the atomically thin type-II superconductor 2H-NbSe$_2$. We fabricated a high-quality multilayer 2H-NbSe$_2$ with a step junction, demonstrating supercurrent in clean limit below a critical temperature of 6.6 K and a high residual resistance ratio of 17. The upper critical field was estimated to be 4.5 T and the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length 8.6 nm. Additionally, we observed phase transitions induced by vortex viscous dynamics in the 2H-NbSe$_2$ step junction. Analysis of the pinning force density using the Dew-Hughes model indicates that the pinning force in the 2H-NbSe$_2$ device can be attributed to step junction, related to the surface-$\Delta\kappa$ type of pinning centers. Our findings pave the way for engineering pinning forces by introducing artificial pinning centers through partial atomic thickness variation in layered 2D superconductors while minimizing unwanted quality degradation in the system.</description>

Abstract: We report here the reversibility and bistability of the switching behavior in an azobenzene derivative induced by the bias applied by a Scanning-Tunneling Microscopy (STM) tip, at low temperature and in ultra-high vacuum environment. This cis-to-trans and trans-to-cis switching were observed during STM imaging in either polarity at +2V or -2V, on a sub-second time scale. This results in a blinking effect visible on STM images, corresponding to the reversible switching of the azobenzene molecule under the applied STM bias through an electric field induced process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have promised the realisation of artificial materials with multiple physical phenomena such as giant optical nonlinearities, spin-to-charge interconversion in spintronics and topological carrier protection, in a single layered device through an infinitely diverse set of quantum materials. However, most efforts have only focused on exfoliated material that inherently limits both the dimensions of the materials and the scalability for applications. Here, we show the epitaxial growth of large area heterostructures of topological insulators (Bi2Se3), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, WSe2) and ferromagnets (Co), resulting in the combination of functionalities including tuneable optical nonlinearities, spin-to-charge conversion and magnetic proximity effects. This is demonstrated through coherent phase resolved terahertz currents, bringing novel functionalities beyond those achievable in simple homostructures. In particular, we show the role of different TMD polymorphs, with the simple change of one atomic monolayer of the artificial material stack entirely changing its optical, electrical and magnetic properties. This epitaxial integration of diverse two-dimensional materials offers foundational steps towards diverse perspectives in quantum material engineering, where the material polymorph can be controlled at technological relevant scales for coupling applications in, for example, van der Waals nonlinear optics, optoelectronics, spintronics, multiferroics and coherent current control.</description>

Abstract: Quantum geometric tensor (QGT), which is usually obtained by evaluating the quantum distance between Bloch states parametrized by momentum, plays a key role in exploring the exotic responses of quantum materials. Herein, we revisit the concept of QGT by further taking into account the spin degree of freedom. Besides the conventional QGT relating to momentum translation, we uncover a new QGT (termed Zeeman QGT) relating to momentum translation as well as spin rotation, whose imaginary (real) part gives the Zeeman Berry curvature (quantum metric). Notably, we show that these novel quantum geometric quantities can drive an intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current (IGMC) in spin-orbit coupled materials when the electron spin is steered by an oscillating magnetic field. With symmetry analysis, we show that a wide range of materials can support the IGMC, as illustrated by model calculations. Finally, we discuss the experimental aspects of detecting the IGMC driven by Zeeman QGT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Floquet topological matter has attracted significant attention for its potential to reveal novel topological phases inaccessible in static systems. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a time-periodic driving on the five-dimensional (5D) normal insulators. We show that the time-periodic driving can induce a topological phase transition from a \textbf{TP} (time reversal combined with space inversion) symmetry-preserving normal insulator to a 5D Floquet topological semimetal with emergent Yang monopoles characterized by the second Chern number. Additionally, we show that this time-periodic driving can also lead to a topological phase transition from a \textbf{TP} symmetry-breaking normal insulator to a 5D Floquet topological semimetal with a Hopf link formed by Weyl surfaces. Besides, further increasing the strength of the time-periodic driving, the two 5D Floquet topological semimetal phases are transformed into the 5D Floquet Chern insulators. Our paper is helpful for future studies in higher dimensional Floquet systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the electronic transport behavior of Fano-Anderson (FA) systems, consisting of a one-dimensional finite backbone chain and an attached side-group of varying length. The tight-binding model within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) reveals distinct interference patterns between the frontier orbitals of odd and even side-group systems that lead to distinct transport mechanisms across various configurations. The even side-group systems exhibit resonant tunneling peaks, while the odd ones demonstrate significant destructive interference at Fermi energy leading to antiresonance and reduced current responses. Further exploration of the role of electron-electron interactions within mean-field Hubbard Hamiltonian indicates the emergence of negative differential resistance (NDR) in odd side-group systems at lower biases, a phenomenon absent in the non-interacting case. Our study demonstrates the critical role of quantum interferences among the frontier molecular orbitals and electron correlations in shaping the transport behavior of FA systems, providing insights for the design of molecular-scale electronic devices.</description>

Abstract: The Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect describes the ability of chiral molecules and crystals to transmit spin-polarized currents, a phenomenon first identified in 1999. Although this effect holds great promise for a broad spectrum of different applications in device physics and synthetic chemistry (including, e.g., spintronics, quantum computing, spin- and enantio-selective chemistry), its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The prevailing hypothesis attributes the CISS effect to enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) within chiral molecules. However, the SOC magnitude required to align with experimental observations significantly exceeds the values derived from conventional atomic-scale calculations, particularly for systems composed of light atoms. In this work, we leverage the implementation of \texttt{fully relativistic density functional theory (DFT)} equations, as available in the \texttt{Dirac code}, to investigate how molecular chirality manifests itself in the chirality density of electronic states. We further explore how this responds to an applied external electric field. To assess spin-dependent transport, we employ the \texttt{Landauer-Imry-B\"uttiker} formalism, examining the dependence of spin transmission on the twist angle of the molecular structure that defines its geometrical chirality. While our findings qualitatively align with experimental trends, they point to the necessity of a more general treatment of SOC, \textit{e.g.}, including geometrical terms or through the dependence of advanced exchange-correlation functionals on the electronic spin-current density.</description>

Abstract: Controlling magnetic states by a small current is essential for the next-generation of energy-efficient spintronic devices. However, it invariably requires considerable energy to change a magnetic ground state of intrinsically quantum nature governed by fundamental Hamiltonian, once stabilized below a phase transition temperature. We report that surprisingly an in-plane current can tune the magnetic state of nm-thin van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 from a hard magnetic state to a soft magnetic state. It is the direct demonstration of the current-induced substantial reduction of the coercive field. This surprising finding is possible because the in-plane current produces a highly unusual type of gigantic spin-orbit torque for Fe3GeTe2. And we further demonstrate a working model of a new nonvolatile magnetic memory based on the principle of our discovery in Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a tiny current. Our findings open up a new window of exciting opportunities for magnetic van der Waals materials with potentially huge impacts on the future development of spintronic and magnetic memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the electromagnetic vacuum is responsible for the Lamb shift, which is a crucial phenomenon in quantum electrodynamics (QED). In circuit QED, the readout or bus resonators that are dispersively coupled can result in a significant Lamb shift of the qubit. However, previous approaches or proposals for controlling the Lamb shift in circuit QED demand overheads in circuit designs or non-perturbative renormalization of the system's eigenbases, which can impose formidable limitations.In this work, we propose and demonstrate an all-microwave method for controlling the Lamb shift of fixed-frequency transmons. We employ the drive-induced longitudinal coupling between the transmon and resonator. By simply using an off-resonant monochromatic drive near the resonator frequency, we can control the net Lamb shift up to 30 MHz and engineer it to zero with the drive-induced longitudinal coupling without facing the aforementioned challenges. Our work establishes an efficient way of engineering the fundamental effects of the electromagnetic vacuum and provides greater flexibility in non-parametric frequency controls of multilevel systems.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Ray Polaritons in Twisted Asymmetric Stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons offers numerous possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale. The development of twistoptics - the modulation of the optical properties by twisting stacks of vdW materials - enables directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, known as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of directional propagation of polaritons by reporting the visualization of unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). They arise naturally in twisted hyperbolic stacks with very different thicknesses of their constituents, demonstrated for homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Importantly, their ray-like propagation, characterized by large momenta and constant phase, is tunable by both the twist angle and the illumination frequency. Apart from their fundamental importance, our findings introduce twisted asymmetric stacks as efficient platforms for nanoscale directional polariton propagation, opening the door for applications in nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>

Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>Surface conduction and reduced electrical resistivity in ultrathin noncrystalline NbP semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17337v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrical resistivity of conventional metals, such as copper, is known to increase in thin films due to electron-surface scattering, limiting the performance of metals in nanoscale electronics. Here, we find an unusual reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in niobium phosphide (NbP) semimetal deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400 \deg C. In films thinner than 5 nm, the room temperature resistivity (~34 microohm*cm for 1.5-nm-thick NbP) was up to six times lower than the bulk NbP resistivity, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness (typically ~100 microohm*cm). Remarkably, the NbP films are not crystalline, but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower effective resistivity is due to conduction via surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics, beyond the limitations of conventional metals.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19421v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications. However, less effort has been devoted to searching for the Rashba effect and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators, from the perspective of material design and establishing universal rules. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. As the atomic number rises, the bandgaps of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) decrease continuously from 2.14 eV for MgAl2S3Se. The trend persists until the bandgap, when combined with strong spin-orbit coupling, shrinks to cause band inversion and reopen with nontrivial topology. Especially in specific Janus systems, pz orbitals near the Fermi level, in conjunction with band inversion, could create a hybrid spin texture with double Rashba splitting. Notably, the Rashba effect, nontrivial topological states and unique spin textures can be significantly tuned synchronously through small biaxial strain. Our work not only expands the diverse Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family with multifunctional application prospects but also reveals the designing rules of Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning identified nitride quantum wells for enhanced red emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: III-nitride heterostructures are critical for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications, however red emission remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge by systematically exploring their design space with machine learning. We surprisingly uncover that larger polarization fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. We outline strategies for engineering polarization fields through the tuning of composition, strain, and interlayer and quantum-barrier thicknesses. Without polarization fields, efficient red emission would not be possible in nitride LEDs given the current challenges in nitride epitaxy. Our results show how polarization can improve light emission from polar semiconductor heterostructures.</description>
