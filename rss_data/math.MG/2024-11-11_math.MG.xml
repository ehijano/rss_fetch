      <title>Relative Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of optimal transport relative to a distinguished subset, which acts as a reservoir of mass, allowing us to compare measures of different total variation. This relative transportation problem has an optimal solution and we obtain relative versions of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, Wasserstein distance, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality and Monge-Kantorovich duality. We also prove relative versions of the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani theorem, which connect the spaces of measures arising from the relative optimal transport problem to spaces of Lipschitz functions.</description>

      <title>A Complete Graphic Statics for Rigid-Jointed 3D Frames. Part 1: Legendre Transforms for Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend graphic statics to describe the forces and moments in 3D rigid-jointed frame structures. Graphic statics relates the form diagram (the geometrical layout of structural bars) to a reciprocal force diagram representing the forces in those bars. For 3D structures, Rankine reciprocals represent bar forces by areas of polygons perpendicular to bars. Unfortunately, that description is incomplete. Here, Rankine reciprocals are generalised to provide a complete description. Not only can any state of axial self-stress be described, but so can any state of self-stress involving axial and shear forces coexistent with bending and torsional moments. This is achieved using a discrete version of Maxwell's Diagram of Stress which maps the body space containing the structure into the stress space containing the force diagram. This mapping is a Legendre transform, defined via a stress function and its gradients. The description resulting here is applicable to any state of self-stress in any 3D bar structure whose joints may have any degree of fixity. Using homology theory, a structural frame is decomposed into a set of loops, with states of self-stress being represented by dual loops in the stress space. Loops need not be plane. At any point on the structure the six components of stress resultant (axial and two shear force components, with torsional and two bending moment components) are represented by the oriented areas of the dual loops projected onto the six basis bivector planes in the 4D stress space. This description is complete: any self-stress of any frame can be represented. Finally, this paper describes an object whose projections encode internal moments. It is a hybrid of form and force: it plots the original stress function at the dual coordinates. This allows internal bending and torsional moments to be separated from the moments about the origin associated with the forces.</description>

      <title>A Fnitely Stable Edit Distance for Merge Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02738v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we define a novel edit distance for merge trees, which we argue to be suitable for a good range of applications. Relying also on some technical results contained in other works, we investigate its stability properties, which end up being analogous to the ones of the 1-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams. In the appendix, we extensively compare our metric in relationship with other metrics appearing in the literature, with both theoretic and practical considerations and a simulation.</description>

      <title>Answers to questions of Gr\"unbaum and Loewner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 5$, with the property that there is exactly one hyperplane $H$ passing through $c(K)$, the centroid of $K$, such that the centroid of $K\cap H$ coincides with $c(K)$. This provides answers to questions of Gr\"unbaum and Loewner for $n\geq 5$. The proof is based on the existence of non-intersection bodies in these dimensions.</description>

      <title>H\"older curves with exotic tangent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important implication of Rademacher's Differentiation Theorem is that every Lipschitz curve $\Gamma$ infinitesimally looks like a line at almost all of its points in the sense that at $\mathcal{H}^1$-almost every point of $\Gamma$, the only tangent to $\Gamma$ is a straight line through the origin. In this article, we show that, in contrast, the infinitesimal structure of H\"older curves can be much more extreme. First we show that for every $s&gt;1$ there exists a $(1/s)$-H\"older curve $\Gamma_s$ in a Euclidean space with $\mathcal{H}^s(\Gamma_s)&gt;0$ such that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits infinitely many topologically distinct tangents. Second, we study the tangents of self-similar connected sets (which are canonical examples of H\"older curves) and prove that the curves $\Gamma_s$ have the additional property that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits infinitely many homeomorphically distinct tangents to $\Gamma_s$ which are not admitted as (not even bi-Lipschitz to) tangents to any self-similar set at typical points.</description>
