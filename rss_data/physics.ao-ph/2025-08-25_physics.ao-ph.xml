      <title>Enhanced predictions of the Madden-Julian oscillation using the FuXi-S2S machine learning model: Insights into physical mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of tropical atmospheric variability on intraseasonal timescales, and reliable MJO predictions are essential for protecting lives and mitigating impacts on societal assets. However, numerical models still fall short of achieving the theoretical predictability limit for the MJO due to inherent constraints. In an effort to extend the skillful prediction window for the MJO, machine learning (ML) techniques have gained increasing attention. This study examines the MJO prediction performance of the FuXi subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) ML model during boreal winter, comparing it with the European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts S2S model. Results indicate that for the initial strong MJO phase 3, the FuXi-S2S model demonstrates reduced biases in intraseasonal outgoing longwave radiation anomalies averaged over the tropical western Pacific (WP) region during days 15-20, with the convective center located over this area. Analysis of multiscale interactions related to moisture transport suggests that improvements could be attributed to the FuXi-S2S model's more accurate prediction of the area-averaged meridional gradient of low-frequency background moisture over the tropical WP. These findings not only explain the enhanced predictive capability of the FuXi-S2S model but also highlight the potential of ML approaches in advancing the MJO forecasting.</description>

      <title>FuXi-TC: A generative framework integrating deep learning and physics-based models for improved tropical cyclone forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most devastating natural hazards, yet their intensity remains notoriously difficult to predict. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are constrained by both computational demands and intrinsic predictability, while state-of-the-art deep learning-based weather forecasting models tend to underestimate TC intensity due to biases in reanalysis-based training data. Here, we present FuXi-TC, a diffusion-based generative forecasting framework that combines the track prediction skill of the FuXi model with the intensity representation of NWP simulations. Trained on outputs from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model driven by FuXi background fields, FuXi-TC corrects systematic biases and reconstructs realistic TC structures without retraining global models. Across 21 TCs in 2024, FuXi-TC substantially reduces root mean square error in 5-day intensity forecasts relative to both FuXi and ERA5, achieving skill comparable to the high-resolution deterministic forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Moreover, FuXi-TC delivers forecasts within seconds, over three orders of magnitude faster than WRF, enabling real-time operational use and large ensembles. These results demonstrate the value of integrating generative diffusion models with physics-informed datasets to advance TC prediction, offering both improved accuracy and transformative computational efficiency for disaster preparedness. More broadly, they highlight the potential of using physics-based simulations to construct new training datasets that further enhance deep learning based weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Domain-aligned generative downscaling enhances projections of extreme climate events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is exacerbating extreme weather events globally, including high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong winds, and tropical cyclones, posing severe threats to human health, infrastructure, food security, and socio-economic systems. Although existing global climate models (GCMs) provide essential tools for climate prediction, they face limitations such as insufficient resolution and high computational costs when simulating extreme events. To address these issues, this study proposes a spatiotemporal downscaling model based on generative machine learning-the Domain Aligned Climate Downscaling model (DACD), designed to enhance the simulation capabilities for extreme weather events. The proposed model employs domain adaptation tricks and a Flow Matching training framework to transform global low-resolution climate data into high-resolution local-scale climate information while achieving precise simulation of multivariable and temporal scales. The results show that during the historical period (2005-2014), our model outperformed existing methods in simulating high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong wind, and tropical cyclone tracks, significantly reducing errors and improving the ability to capture extreme events. Under different future scenarios (2015-2100), the model reveals a significant increasing trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, particularly under the high-emission scenario (SSP585). Compared to traditional methods, our model more accurately simulates the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of extreme events, providing an essential tool for understanding the impacts of climate change. This study offers a new technological pathway for high-resolution climate analysis and extreme event prediction, providing scientific support for addressing future climate change and formulating adaptation strategies.</description>

      <title>Ensembles of Neural Surrogates for Parametric Sensitivity in Ocean Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of the oceans are crucial in understanding the Earth system. Despite their efficiency, simulations at lower resolutions must rely on various uncertain parameterizations to account for unresolved processes. However, model sensitivity to parameterizations is difficult to quantify, making it challenging to tune these parameterizations to reproduce observations. Deep learning surrogates have shown promise for efficient computation of the parametric sensitivities in the form of partial derivatives, but their reliability is difficult to evaluate without ground truth derivatives. In this work, we leverage large-scale hyperparameter search and ensemble learning to improve both forward predictions, autoregressive rollout, and backward adjoint sensitivity estimation. Particularly, the ensemble method provides epistemic uncertainty of function value predictions and their derivatives, providing improved reliability of the neural surrogates in decision making.</description>

      <title>Closure of the sea surface height budget with a Stokes offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sea surface height budget, obtained by integrating hydrostatic balance over the water column, relates sea surface height variations to variations of the seafloor pressure, density in the water column, and atmospheric surface pressure. This budget is crucial for calibrating and interpreting satellite altimetry measurements. It only holds once non-hydrostatic surface gravity waves are averaged out, however, which complicates an observational closure of the budget. Using data from the California Current System, this study demonstrates that the budget closes to within understood uncertainties if GPS buoy measurements of surface height are interpreted as Lagrangian measurements. The buoy largely follows wave motion and spends slightly more time near wave crests than troughs. The associated Stokes offset, which reaches a maximum of 16 cm in these observations, must be accounted for in the Eulerian sea surface height budget.</description>

      <title>On the modeling of nonlinear wind-induced ice-drift ocean currents at the North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the governing equations for geophysical flows, by means of a thin-shell approximation and a tangent plane approximation, we derive the equations describing, at leading order, the nonlinear ice-drift flow for regions centered around the North Pole. An exact solution is derived in the material/Lagrangian formalism, describing a superposition of oscillations, a mean Ekman flow and a geostrophic current.</description>
