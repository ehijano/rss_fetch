      <title>Observation of a generalized Gibbs ensemble in photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of Light Localization at the Edges of Quasicrystal Waveguide Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are unique systems that, unlike periodic structures, lack translational symmetry but exhibit long-range order dramatically enriching the system properties. While evolution of light in the bulk of photonic quasicrystals is well studied, experimental evidences of light localization near the edge of truncated photonic quasicrystal structures are practically absent. In this Letter, we observe both linear and nonlinear localization of light at the edges of radially cropped quasicrystal waveguide arrays, forming an aperiodic Penrose tiling. Our theoretical analysis reveals that for certain truncation radii, the system exhibits linear eigenstates localized at the edge of the truncated array, whereas for other radii, this localization does not occur, highlighting the significant influence of truncation on edge light localization. Using single-waveguide excitations, we experimentally confirm the presence of localized states in Penrose arrays inscribed by a femtosecond laser and investigate the effects of nonlinearity on these states. Our theoretical findings identify a family of edge solitons, and experimentally, we observe a transition from linear localized states to edge solitons as the power of the input pulse increases. Our results represent the first experimental demonstration of localization phenomena induced by the selective truncation of quasiperiodic photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Stability and dynamics of massive vortices in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of structures involving vortices in one component and bright solitary waves in another has a time-honored history in two-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. In the present work, we revisit this topic extending considerations well-past the near-integrable regime of nearly equal scattering lengths. Instead, we focus on stationary states and spectral stability of such structures for large values of the inter-component interaction coefficient. We find that the state can manifest dynamical instabilities for suitable parameter values. We also explore a phenomenological, yet quantitatively accurate upon suitable tuning, particle model which, in line also with earlier works, offers the potential of accurately following the associated stability and dynamical features. Finally, we probe the dynamics of the unstable vortex-bright structure, observing an unprecedented, to our knowledge, instability scenario in which the oscillatory instability leads to a patch of vorticity that harbors and eventually ejects multiple vortex-bright structures.</description>

      <title>Hydromagnetic shock waves in a cold weakly collisional plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the topic of existence of hydrodynamic shock waves in a cold weakly collisional plasma. For this purpose we consider the well established Adlam-Allen model with the addition of a dashpot term associated with the dissipation of the motion of the electrons relative to the ions. We establish the connection between this model and the Korteweg-de-Vries Burgers equation via an asymptotic multiscale analysis. This fact suggests the possibility that this system may support shock wave solutions. Accordingly, by considering a corresponding dynamical system arising through a co-traveling frame reduction, we identify such orbits via a phase-plane analysis. We then leverage such initial conditions within systematic simulations of the original modified Adlam-Allen model, revealing a variety of supported robust wavefronts depending on the magnitude of the dissipation considered.</description>
