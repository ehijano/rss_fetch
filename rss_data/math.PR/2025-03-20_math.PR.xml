      <title>Lagrangian chaos and unique ergodicity for stochastic primitive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the stochastic 3D primitive equations (PEs) with non-degenerate noise is chaotic, i.e., the corresponding top Lyapunov exponent is strictly positive almost surely. This result builds on the landmark work by Bedrossian, Blumenthal, and Punshon-Smith on Lagrangian chaos in stochastic fluid mechanics. Our primary contribution is establishing an instance where Lagrangian chaos can be proven for a fluid flow with supercritical energy, a key characteristic of 3D fluid dynamics. For the 3D PEs, establishing the existence of the top Lyapunov exponent is already a challenging task. We address this difficulty by deriving new estimates for the invariant measures of the 3D PEs, which capture the anisotropic smoothing in the dynamics of the PEs. As a by-product of our results, we also obtain the first uniqueness result for invariant measures of stochastic PEs.</description>

      <title>Real Eigenvalues of Asymmetric Wishart Matrices: Expected Number, Global Density and Integrable Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the real eigenvalues of asymmetric Wishart matrices of size $N$, indexed by the rectangular parameter $\nu \in \mathbb{N}$ and the non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$. The rectangular parameter $\nu$ is either fixed or proportional to $N$. The non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau$ is either fixed or $\tau = 1 - O(1/N)$, corresponding to the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, respectively.
  We establish a decomposition structure for the finite-$N$ correlation kernel of the real eigenvalues, which form Pfaffian point processes. Taking the symmetric limit $\tau = 1$, where the model reduces to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble, this decomposition structure reduces to the known rank-one perturbation structure established by Adler, Forrester, Nagao, and van Moerbeke, as well as by Widom. Using the decomposition structure, we show that the expected number of real eigenvalues is proportional to $\sqrt{N}$ in the strongly non-Hermitian regime and to $N$ in the weakly non-Hermitian regime, providing explicit leading coefficients in both cases. Furthermore, we derive the limiting real eigenvalue densities, which recovers the Marchenko-Pastur distribution in the symmetric limit.</description>

      <title>Free multiplicative convolution with an arbitrary measure on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop analytic tools for studying the free multiplicative convolution of any measure on the real line and any measure on the nonnegative real line. More precisely, we construct the subordination functions and the $S$-transform of an arbitrary probability measure. The important multiplicativity of $S$-transform is proved with the help of subordination functions. We then apply the $S$-transform to establish convolution identities for stable laws, which had been considered in the literature only for the positive and symmetric cases. Subordination functions are also used in order to extend Belinschi--Nica's semigroup of homomorphisms, and to establish regularity properties of free multiplicative convolution, in particular, the absence of singular continuous part and analyticity of the density.</description>

      <title>Upper tail large deviations for Brownian motions with one-sided collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system of interacting Brownian motions, where a particle is reflected asymmetrically from its left neighbor, belongs to the KPZ universality class, with multi-point asymptotics having been derived in previous works. In this paper we show upper tail large deviation principles for all three fundamental initial conditions, including explicit calculation of the rate function. For the periodic case the Lambert-W function, which is already present in the Fredholm determinant formula, also appears in the rate function.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard Large and Moderate Deviations for the Laguerre Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show limit theorems for the weighted spectral measure of the Laguerre ensemble under a nonstandard scaling, when the parameter grows faster than the matrix size. For this parameter scaling, the limit behavior is similar to the case of the Gaussian ensemble. We show a large deviation principle, moderate deviations and a CLT for the spectral measure. For the moderate deviations and the CLT, we observe a particular dependence on the rate of the parameter and a corrective shift by a signed measure. The proofs are based on the tridiagonal representation of the Laguerre ensemble.</description>

      <title>A control variate method for threshold crossing probabilities of plastic deformation driven by transient coloured noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid method combining partial differential equation (PDE) and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to obtain efficient estimates of statistics for plastic deformation related to kinematic hardening models driven by transient coloured noise. Our approach employs a control variate strategy inspired by [CPAM, 75 (3), 455-492, 2022] and relies on a class of PDEs with non-standard boundary conditions, which we derive here. The solutions of those PDEs represent the statistics of models driven by transient white noise and are significantly easier to solve than the coloured noise version. We apply our method to threshold-crossing probabilities, which are used as failure criteria known as ultimate and serviceability limit states under non-stationary excitation. Our contribution provides solid grounds for such calculations and is significantly more computationally efficient in terms of variance reduction compared to standard MC simulations.</description>

      <title>Resetting Dyson Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new stochastic process of $N$ interacting particles on the line that evolve via Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) with Dyson's index $\beta &gt; 0$ and undergo simultaneous resetting to their initial positions at a constant rate $r$. We call this process the resetting Dyson Brownian motion (RDBM) -- in short the $\beta$-RDBM. For $\beta = 1,2,4$, the positions of the particles in the RDBM can be interpreted as the eigenvalues of a random matrix ensemble where the entries of an $N x N$ Gaussian matrix evolve as simultaneously resetting Brownian motions (with rate $r$) in the presence or absence of a harmonic trap. For $r=0$ and in the presence of a harmonic trap, this system reaches an equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann state of the so called Dyson log-gas. However, the stochastic resetting drives the system at long time to a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS). We compute exactly the joint distribution of the positions of the particles in this NESS for all $\beta&gt;0$ and calculate several observables for large $N$: the average density profile of the gas, the extreme value statistics, the spacing between two consecutive particles and the full counting statistics. We show that a nonzero resetting rate $r&gt;0$ drastically changes the nature of the fluctuations in the stationary state: while the log-gas is rather rigid, the $\beta$-RDBM in its NESS becomes fluffy, i.e., the fluctuations of different observables are of the same order as their mean. In the absence of a harmonic trap, our results for the $\beta = 2$-RDBM can be related to nonintersecting Brownian motions in the presence of resetting. Our model demonstrates interesting effects arising from the interplay between the eigenvalue repulsion and the all-to-all attraction (generated by stochastic resetting) in an interacting particle system. Numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Dynkin Systems and the One-Point Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note I demonstrate that the collection of Dynkin systems on finite sets assembles into a Connes-Consani $\mathbb{F}_1$-module, with the collection of partitions of finite sets as a sub-module. The underlying simplicial set of this $\mathbb{F}_1$-module is shown to be isomorphic to the delooping of the Krasner hyperfield $\mathbb{K}$, where $1+1=\{0,1\}$. The face and degeneracy maps of the underlying simplicial set of the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of partitions correspond to merging partition blocks and introducing singleton blocks, respectively. I also show that the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of partitions cannot correspond to a set with a binary operation (even partially defined or multivalued) under the ``Eilenberg-MacLane'' embedding. These results imply that the $n$-fold sum of the Dynkin $\mathbb{F}_1$-module with itself is isomorphic to the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of the discrete projective geometry on $n$ points.</description>

      <title>Inferring diffusivity from killed diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider diffusion of independent molecules in an insulated Euclidean domain with unknown diffusivity parameter. At a random time and position, the molecules may bind and stop diffusing in dependence of a given `binding potential'. The binding process can be modeled by an additive random functional corresponding to the canonical construction of a `killed' diffusion Markov process. We study the problem of conducting inference on the infinite-dimensional diffusion parameter from a histogram plot of the `killing' positions of the process. We show first that these positions follow a Poisson point process whose intensity measure is determined by the solution of a certain Schr\"odinger equation. The inference problem can then be re-cast as a non-linear inverse problem for this PDE, which we show to be consistently solvable in a Bayesian way under natural conditions on the initial state of the diffusion, provided the binding potential is not too `aggressive'. In the course of our proofs we obtain novel posterior contraction rate results for high-dimensional Poisson count data that are of independent interest. A numerical illustration of the algorithm by standard MCMC methods is also provided.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Bayesian Update via Ensemble Kernel Regression with Clustering and Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Bayesian update for a prior ensemble is proposed to extend traditional ensemble Kalman filtering to settings characterized by non-Gaussian priors and nonlinear measurement operators. In this framework, the observed component is first denoised via a standard Kalman update, while the unobserved component is estimated using a nonlinear regression approach based on kernel density estimation. The method incorporates a subsampling strategy to ensure stability and, when necessary, employs unsupervised clustering to refine the conditional estimate. Numerical experiments on Lorenz systems and a PDE-constrained inverse problem illustrate that the proposed nonlinear update can reduce estimation errors compared to standard linear updates, especially in highly nonlinear scenarios.</description>

      <title>Joint Hybrid Precoding and Multi-IRS Optimization for mmWave MU-MISO Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper attempts to jointly optimize the hybrid precoding (HP) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) beamforming matrices in a multi-IRS-aided mmWave communication network, utilizing the Alamouti scheme at the base station (BS). Considering the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the objective function, the underlying problem is cast as an optimization problem, which is shown to be non-convex in general. To tackle the problem, noting that the unknown matrices contribute multiplicatively to the objective function, they are reformulated into two new matrices with rank constraints. Then, using the so-called inner approximation (IA) technique in conjunction with majorization-minimization (MM) approaches, these new matrices are solved iteratively. From one of these matrices, the IRS beamforming matrices can be effectively extracted. Meanwhile, HP precoding matrices can be solved separately through a new optimization problem aimed at minimizing the Euclidean distance between the fully digital (FD) precoder and HP analog/digital precoders. This is achieved through the use of a modified block coordinate descent (MBCD) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms various benchmark schemes in terms of achieving a higher achievable rate.</description>

      <title>System of stochastic interacting wave functions that model quantum measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a system of non-linear stochastic evolution equations that describes the continuous measurements of quantum systems with mixed initial state. We address quantum systems with unbounded Hamiltonians and unbounded interaction operators. Using arguments of the theory of quantum measurements we derive a system of stochastic interacting wave functions (SIWF for short) that models the continuous monitoring of quantum systems. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to this system under conditions general enough for the applications. We obtain that the mixed state generated by the SIWF at any time does not depend on the initial state, and satisfies the diffusive stochastic quantum master equation, which is also known as Belavkin equation. We present two physical examples. In one, the SIWF becomes a system of non-linear stochastic partial differential equations. In the other, we deal with a model of a circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a sharp uniform-in-time error estimate for the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), which is a widely-used sampling algorithm. Under mild assumptions, we obtain a uniform-in-time $O(\eta^2)$ bound for the KL-divergence between the SGLD iteration and the Langevin diffusion, where $\eta$ is the step size (or learning rate). Our analysis is also valid for varying step sizes. Consequently, we are able to derive an $O(\eta)$ bound for the distance between the invariant measures of the SGLD iteration and the Langevin diffusion, in terms of Wasserstein or total variation distances. Our result can be viewed as a significant improvement compared with existing analysis for SGLD in related literature.</description>

      <title>Passage-times for partially-homogeneous reflected random walks on the quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a random walk on the first quadrant of the square lattice, whose increment law is, roughly speaking, homogeneous along a finite number of half-lines near each of the two boundaries, and hence essentially specified by finitely-many transition laws near each boundary, together with an interior transition law that applies at sufficient distance from both boundaries. Under mild assumptions, in the (most subtle) setting in which the mean drift in the interior is zero, we classify recurrence and transience and provide power-law bounds on tails of passage times; the classification depends on the interior covariance matrix, the (finitely many) drifts near the boundaries, and stationary distributions derived from two one-dimensional Markov chains associated to each of the two boundaries. As an application, we consider reflected random walks related to multidimensional variants of the Lindley process, for which the recurrence question was studied recently by Peign\'e and Woess (Ann. Appl. Probab., vol. 31, 2021) using different methods, but for which no previous quantitative results on passage-times appear to be known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional one-component plasma (OCP) is a model of electrically charged particles which are embedded in a uniform background of the opposite charge, and interact through a logarithmic potential. More than 30 years ago, Jancovici, Lebowitz and Manificat discovered an asymptotic law for probabilities of large charge fluctuations in the OCP. We prove that this law holds for the hierarchical counterpart of the OCP. The hierarchical model was recently introduced by Chatterjee, and is inspired by Dyson's hierarchical model of the Ising ferromagnet.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the half-space KPZ equation with a Neumann boundary condition, starting from stationary Brownian initial data. We derive a variance identity that links the fluctuations of the height function to the transversal fluctuations of a half-space polymer model. Utilizing this identity, we obtain estimates for the polymer endpoints, leading to optimal fluctuation exponents for the height function in both the subcritical and critical regimes, as well as an optimal upper bound for the fluctuation exponents in the supercritical regime. We also compute the average growth rate as a function of the boundary parameter.</description>

      <title>Sparse Hanson-Wright Inequalities with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive new Hanson-Wright-type inequalities tailored to the quadratic forms of random vectors with sparse independent components. Specifically, we consider cases where the components of the random vector are sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables with $\alpha&gt;0$. When $\alpha=\infty$, these inequalities can be seen as quadratic generalizations of the classical Bernstein and Bennett inequalities for sparse bounded random vectors. To establish this quadratic generalization, we also develop new Bersntein-type and Bennett-type inequalities for linear forms of sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables that go beyond the bounded case $(\alpha=\infty)$. Our proof relies on a novel combinatorial method for estimating the moments of both random linear forms and quadratic forms.
  We present two key applications of these new sparse Hanson-Wright inequalities: (1) A local law and complete eigenvector delocalization for sparse $\alpha$-subexponential Hermitian random matrices, generalizing the result of He et al. (2019) beyond sparse Bernoulli random matrices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first local law and complete delocalization result for sparse $\alpha$-subexponeitial random matrices down to the near-optimal sparsity $p\geq \frac{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}{n}$ when $\alpha\in (0,2)$ as well as for unbounded sparse sub-gaussian random matrices down to the optimal sparsity $p\gtrsim \frac{\log n}{n}.$ (2) Concentration of the Euclidean norm for the linear transformation of a sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random vector, improving on the results of G\"otze et al. (2021) for sparse sub-exponential random vectors.</description>

      <title>On the prime Selmer ranks of cyclic prime twist families of elliptic curves over global function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11486v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix a prime number $p$. Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field of characteristic coprime to 2, 3, and $p$, which also contains the primitive $p$-th root of unity $\mu_p$. Based on the works by Swinnerton-Dyer and Klagsbrun, Mazur, and Rubin, we prove that the probability distribution of the sizes of prime Selmer groups over a family of cyclic prime twists of non-isotrivial elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ satisfying a number of mild constraints conforms to the distribution conjectured by Bhargava, Kane, Lenstra, Poonen, and Rains with explicit error bounds. The key tools used in proving these results are the Riemann hypothesis over global function fields, the Erd\"os-Kac theorem, and the geometric ergodicity of Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-Periodic Homogenization of Integral Functionals with Convex and Nonstandard Growth Integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current investigation aims to study the stochastic-periodic homogenization for a family of functionals with convex and nonstandard growth integrands defined on Orlicz-Sobolev's spaces. It focuses on the concept of stochastic two-scale convergence in this type of spaces, which is a combination of both well-known periodic two-scale convergence and stochastic two-scale convergence in the mean schemes. One fundamental in this topic is to extend the classical compactness results of the stochastic two-scale convergence method to the Orlicz-Sobolev's spaces. Moreover, it is shown, by the stochastic two-scale convergence method, that the sequence of minimizers of a class of highly oscillatory minimizations problems involving convex functionals converges to the minimizers of a homogenized problem with a suitable convex integrand.</description>

      <title>Covariance Operator Estimation via Adaptive Thresholding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies sparse covariance operator estimation for nonstationary processes with sharply varying marginal variance and small correlation lengthscale. We introduce a covariance operator estimator that adaptively thresholds the sample covariance function using an estimate of the variance component. Building on recent results from empirical process theory, we derive an operator norm bound on the estimation error in terms of the sparsity level of the covariance and the expected supremum of a normalized process. Our theory and numerical simulations demonstrate the advantage of adaptive threshold estimators over universal threshold and sample covariance estimators in nonstationary settings.</description>

      <title>On the Approximability of Stationary Processes using the ARMA Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the theoretical literature on stationary random variables, pure Moving Average models and pure Autoregressive models have a rich body of work, but the corresponding literature on Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models is very sparse. We attempt to fill certain gaps in this sparse line of work. Central to our observations is the spectral lemma connecting supnorm based function approximation on the unit circle to random variable approximation. This method allows us to provide quantitative approximation bounds in contrast with the qualitative boundedness and stability guarantees associated with unit root tests. Using the spectral lemma we first identify a class of stationary processes where approximation guarantees are feasible. This turns a known heuristic argument motivating ARMA models based on rational approximations into a rigorous result. Second, we identify an idealized stationary random process for which we conjecture that a good ARMA approximation is not possible. Third, we calculate exact approximation bounds for an example process, and a constructive proof that, for a given order, Pad\'e approximations do not always correspond to the best ARMA approximation. Unlike prior literature, our approach uses the generating function of the random process rather than the spectral measure, and further our results focus on approximation error of the random variable rather than the prediction error as in some classical infimum results by Szego, Kolmogorov, and Wiener.</description>

      <title>Uniform Convergence Rate of the Nonparametric Estimator for Integrated Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonparametric estimation of integrated diffusion processes has been extensively studied, with most existing research focusing on pointwise convergence. This paper is the first to establish uniform convergence rates for the Nadaraya-Watson estimators of their coefficients. We derive these rates over unbounded support under the assumptions of a vanishing observation interval and a long time horizon. Our findings serve as essential tools for specification testing and semiparametric inference in various diffusion models and time series, facilitating applications in finance, geology, and physics through nonparametric estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Energy Market Contracts: Dynkin Game with Doubly RBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines a Contract for Difference (CfD) with early exit options, a key risk management tool in electricity markets. The contract, involving a producer and a regulatory entity, is modeled as a two-player Dynkin game with mean-reverting electricity prices and penalties for early termination.
  We formulate the strategic interaction using Doubly Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (DRBSDEs), which characterize the fair contract value and optimal stopping strategies. We show that the first component of the DRBSDE solution represents the value of the Dynkin game, and that the first hitting times correspond to a Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we link the problem to a Skorokhod problem with time-dependent boundaries, deriving an explicit formula for the Skorokhod adjustment processes.
  To solve the DRBSDE, we develop a deep learning-based numerical algorithm, leveraging neural networks for efficient computation. We analyze the convergence of the deep learning algorithm, as well as the value function and optimal stopping rules. Numerical experiments, including a CfD model calibrated on French electricity prices, highlight the impact of exit penalties, price volatility, and contract design. These findings offer insights for market regulators and energy producers in designing effective risk management strategies.</description>

      <title>Model-independent upper bounds for the prices of Bermudan options with convex payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose $\mu$ and $\nu$ are probability measures on $\mathbb R$ satisfying $\mu \leq_{cx} \nu$. Let $a$ and $b$ be convex functions on $\mathbb R$ with $a \geq b \geq 0$. We are interested in finding \[ \sup_{\mathcal M} \sup_{\tau} \mathbb{E}^{\mathcal M} \left[ a(X) I_{ \{ \tau = 1 \} } + b(Y) I_{ \{ \tau = 2 \} } \right] \] where the first supremum is taken over consistent models $\mathcal M$ (i.e., filtered probability spaces $(\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb F, \mathbb P)$) such that $Z=(z,Z_1,Z_2)=(\int_{\mathbb R} x \mu(dx) = \int_{\mathbb R} y \nu(dy), X, Y)$ is a $(\mathbb F,\mathbb P)$ martingale, where $X$ has law $\mu$ and $Y$ has law $\nu$ under $\mathbb P$) and $\tau$ in the second supremum is a $(\mathbb F,\mathbb P)$-stopping time taking values in $\{1,2\}$.
  Our contributions are first to characterise and simplify the dual problem, and second to completely solve the problem in the symmetric case under the dispersion assumption. A key finding is that the canonical set-up in which the filtration is that generated by $Z$ is not rich enough to define an optimal model and additional randomisation is required. This holds even though the marginal laws $\mu$ and $\nu$ are atom-free.
  The problem has an interpretation of finding the robust, or model-free, no-arbitrage bound on the price of a Bermudan option with two possible exercise dates, given the prices of co-maturing European options.</description>
