      <title>Investigation of Direct Nuclear Reactions in a Storage Ring Using In-Ring Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Experiments involving nuclear reactions in a storage ring offer exceptional possibilities for precise measurements in inverse kinematics. These experiments provide excellent angular and energy resolution by particle spectroscopy, in addition to high luminosities. However, the extremely low-pressure environment maintained in the storage rings poses significant difficulties for experiments employing detectors or any outgassing material in the ring.
  \textbf{Purpose:} To investigate nuclear reactions in inverse kinematics using the storage-ring technique. The reactions were induced by scattering of a ${}^{20}\mathrm{Ne}$ beam off a hydrogen target at an energy of 50~MeV/u.
  \textbf{Method:} A beam of fully stripped ${}^{20}$Ne ions was injected into the ESR storage ring at an energy of 50 MeV/u. The beam interacted with an internal hydrogen gas-jet target. An ultra-high vacuum compatible detector setup was installed around the gas jet inside the ring to measure the recoiling particles generated by nuclear reactions.
  \textbf{Results:} Multiple reaction channels were observed during the experiment. In particular, we present the results from studies on elastic and inelastic scattering, as well as the neutron transfer reaction ${}^{20}\mathrm{Ne}(p,d){}^{19}\mathrm{Ne}^*$. The experimental data were compared to calculations that took into account the most significant excited states, using a coupled-reaction channel approach. A very good agreement with the experimental data was achieved.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} The present results are the first demonstration of the investigation transfer reactions using detectors directly installed in the ring. This provides an important proof-of-principle for prospective studies with far-from-stability radioactive beams in the future.</description>

      <title>$t$+$t$ cluster states in $^{6}$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of $t$+$t$ cluster states in $^{6}$He provides valuable insights into exotic nuclear structures and the behavior of fermionic cluster systems. This study shows rich cluster resonant state structures above the threshold, identified by experimental reconstruction and theoretical calculations. The excitation energy spectrum above the $t$+$t$ threshold in $^{6}$He is measured via the fragmentation excitation process during the breakup reaction of $^{9}$Li on a $^{208}$Pb target at an incident energy of 32.7 MeV/nucleon. The resonant states are reconstructed from the final state coincident particles $t$+$t$ using the invariant mass method, while the non-resonant background is estimated using the event mixing method. The two new states of energy level peaks at $17.016\pm0.002$ and $19.4\pm0.6$ MeV are observed in addition to the previously observed energy level peaks at $13.9\pm0.3$ and $15.0\pm0.3$ MeV. Microscopic cluster model calculations exploring the $t+t$ resonance states in $^6\mathrm{He}$ yield theoretical energy spectra which are then compared with the current experimental results. The calculated reduced width amplitudes (RWA) of the $t+t$ channels further confirm the clustering structure of the identified $t+t$ resonance states.</description>

      <title>Development and Benchmarking of JANGOFETT: A Novel Geant4-Operated Fission Event Tracking Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments measuring fission observables encounter false coincidences arising from timing overlap of separate fission product decays. Simulations of both fission observables and particles in detector systems exist, but have not yet been combined to produce accurate event-by-event outputs in a time-dependent manner. Geant4 is a powerful simulation tool for nuclear physics studies, but it does not handle multiple initial particles in a single simulation instance, nor does it feature high fidelity fission sampling. JANGOFETT: A Novel Geant4-Operated Fission Event Tracking Tool has been developed to address this challenge. The tool utilizes simulated fission data from an external program in conjunction with Geant4, which has been modified to produce a single timeline of events over an entire simulated experiment. The physical accuracy of the simulated overlapping energy depositions within detectors has been verified via simulation of fission products from the spontaneous fission of 252Cf.</description>

      <title>Towards a Study of Low Energy Antiproton Annihilations on Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A study of antiproton annihilations at rest on thin solid targets is underway at the ASACUSA facility, which now features a dedicated beam line for slow extraction at 250 eV. The experiment will employ new technologies, such as the Timepix4 ASICs coupled to silicon sensors, to measure the total multiplicity, energy, and angular distribution of various prongs produced in thin solid targets. A detection system consisting of seven Timepix4, covering most of the solid angle, is being constructed. A 3D annihilation vertex reconstruction algorithm from particle tracks in the single-plane detectors has been developed using Monte Carlo simulations. The measurements will enable a study of pbar-nucleus interactions, their dependence on nucleus mass and branching ratios. The results will be used to assess and potentially improve various simulation models.</description>

      <title>Mirror-skin thickness: A possible observable sensitive to the charge symmetry breaking energy density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new observable, named the mirror-skin thickness, in order to extract the strength of the charge symmetry breaking (CSB) term in the energy density functional (EDF). The mirror-skin thickness of $ N = 20 $ isotones and $ Z = 20 $ isotopes is studied by using Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations with various Skyrme EDFs and adding CSB and charge independence breaking (CIB) terms. It is shown that the mirror-skin thickness is sensitive only to the CSB EDF, but hardly depends on either the isospin symmetric part of the nuclear EDF or the CIB term. Therefore, this observable can be used to extract the magnitude of the CSB term in the EDF quantitatively, either from experimental data or ab initio calculations. We have studied the accuracy in the mirror-skin thickness that is needed to extract sensible information. Our study may also help to understand the inconsistency between the strength of the phenomenological CSB and that extracted from ab initio calculations [Naito et al. Nuovo. Cim. C 47, 52 (2024)]. Among possible mirror pairs for experimental study, we propose the mirror-skin thickness between $ {}^{42} \mathrm{Ca} $ and $ {}^{42} \mathrm{Ti} $, which could be accessed in future experiments in RIBF and/or FRIB.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic emission from strongly interacting hadronic and partonic matter created in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dilepton production in heavy-ion, proton-proton, and proton-nucleus collisions from low energies of 1 AGeV (SIS) to ultra-relativistic energies (LHC) using the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach. PHSD is a microscopic, non-equilibrium approach that integrates hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom, providing a comprehensive description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions from initial nucleon-nucleon interactions to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation, hadronization, and final-state interactions. Key dilepton sources in PHSD include hadronic decays, bremsstrahlung, QGP radiation ($q+\bar q \to e^+e^-$, \ $q+\bar q \to g+ e^+e^-$, \ $q+g \to q+ e^+e^-$), primary Drell-Yan production, and semileptonic decays of correlated charm and bottom pairs. PHSD well describes dilepton data from HADES, STAR, and ALICE experiments. We examine in-medium effects, such as the vector meson spectral function broadening, and present the excitation function for the dilepton "excess" in the invariant mass range $0.4&lt;M_{ee}&lt;0.75$ GeV/c$^2$. For the first time we report on the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$-dependence of the QGP radiation calculated on a basis of the Dynamical-Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) in PHSD. The influence of $\mu_B$ on the QGP yield grows at lower collision energies, where $\mu_B$ becomes large, however, its impact on the total dilepton spectra is small due to the lowering of the QGP volume with decreasing energy. The excitation function of QGP dileptons, is presented versus correlated charm, confirming that the QGP radiation overshines charm contributions at $\sqrt{s} \simeq 25-30$ GeV in central Au+Au collisions, providing access to thermal QGP dileptons at BES RHIC and FAIR.</description>

      <title>Geant4 and FLUKA Simulations of a Cyclotron Based 30 MeV Proton-Beryllium Reaction: Benchmarking and Optimization of Neutron Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For studies where a reliable neutron source/beam is required and a nuclear reactor is not a viable option (considering their high neutron flux supply, which may not be suitable for research concerning low flux operations), alternative approaches may be sought. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation analysis of 30 MeV 9Be(p,n)9B reaction, which can be utilized as an isotropic neutron source. Due to different underlying physics and transport mechanisms, slight variations in findings between Geant4 and FLUKA may occur, and hence may require one to have a guide at hand to address the differences and interpret the data more accurately before conducting the actual experiment. Through these Monte Carlo simulation toolkits, this work estimates resulting neutron fluence and dose equivalent of prompt gamma decays, as well as how materials such as paraffin and borated polyethylene moderates its energy spectrum. Furthermore, this work also presents an exemplar modular irradiation station designed for target-moderator configurations, with the capability of generating thermal neutron fields .</description>

      <title>Systematic optimization of resonance parameters in a transport approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study optimizes resonance parameters responsible for strangeness production in the SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) transport model using a genetic algorithm. By fitting resonance parameters to experimental data on exclusive strangeness cross-sections at low energies, we significantly improve the model's accuracy, especially in pion-proton interactions. Our approach explores how machine learning tools can be used for precise resonance tuning in transport approaches.</description>

      <title>Search for Double Beta Decay of $^{136}$Xe to the $0^+_1$ Excited State of $^{136}$Ba with PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a search of double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe to the excited state, $0^+_1$, of $^{136}$Ba (2$\nu \beta \beta$-0$_1^+$), using the dual-phase xenon detector of PandaX-4T with the first 94.9-day commissioning data. The multi-site events are reconstructed up to the MeV energy scale, which helps to improve the background model significantly. The background contribution from the stainless steel platform outside PandaX-4T cryostat is evaluated for the first time. No significant evidence for 2$\nu \beta \beta$-$0_1^+$ is observed, resulting in a lower limit on half-life of $7.5 \times 10^{22}$ yr at the 90% confidence level. This is the first experimental limit on such a rare decay in a natural xenon-based detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neutrino long-baseline experiments the energy of the incoming neutrino must be reconstructed from observations of the final state. We first discuss the problems that arise for energy conservation during the final-state interactions in a momentum-dependent potential. We then show that the presence of such a potential is necessarily connected with a large uncertainty in the reconstructed energy. This same uncertainty also affects the determination of energy- and four-momentum-transfers in neutrino-nucleus reactions. We analyze the origins of these uncertainties using transport theory for the description of the evolution of the final state of the reaction. We show that even for the final state evolution the spectral functions of target nuclei play an essential role.</description>
