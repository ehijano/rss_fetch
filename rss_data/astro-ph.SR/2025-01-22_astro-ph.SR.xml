      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Inferring Accretion Signatures in Young Stellar Objects: A Case Study with VIRUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass accretion rates of young stellar objects (YSOs) are key to understanding how stars form, how their circumstellar disks evolve, and even how planets form. We develop a Bayesian framework to determine the accretion rates of a sample of 15 YSOs using archival data from the VIRUS spectrograph ($R \sim 800$, 3500-5500\r{A}) on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. We are publicly releasing our developed tool, dubbed nuts-for-ysos, as a Python package which can also be applied to other spectroscopic datasets. The nuts-for-ysos code fits a simple accretion model to the near-UV and optical continuum of each VIRUS spectrum. Our Bayesian approach aims to identify correlations between model parameters using the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). Moreover, this approach self-consistently incorporates all parameter uncertainties, allowing for a thorough estimation of the probability distribution for accretion rate not accomplished in previous works. Using nuts-for-ysos, we derive accretion rates of each YSO. We then verify the reliability of our method by comparing to results separately derived from only the spectral emission lines, and to results from earlier studies of the Lupus, Chamaeleon I, and NGC1333 regions. Finally, we discuss what qualitative trends, covariances, and degeneracies were found among model parameters. The technique developed in this paper is a useful improvement that can be applied in the future to larger samples of YSOs observed by VIRUS or other spectrographs.</description>

      <title>Optical Flares Detected on a Contact Binary: The First Photometric and Spectroscopic Analysis of a Long-period Low Mass Ratio Contact Binary HAT 307-0007476</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of a long-period totally eclipsing contact binary (HAT 307-0007476) for the first time. This system is a low mass ratio ($q\sim0.114$) and medium contact binary ($f\sim37.1\%$). Two flare events were detected in multiple bands observations in December 2022. The interval between the two flare events is 4 days. The average duration of these two flares is about 2289s. Both the two flares achieve the energy levels of superflares. The excess emission of the H$_\alpha$ line in the LAMOST spectra of this object was analyzed, indicating its chromospheric activity. The $O-C$ diagram showed a long-term orbital period increase, which is due to the mass transfer between the two component stars. We conclude that HAT 307-0007476 is currently in a stable region based on both $J_{spin}/J_{orb}$ and the comparison between the instability parameters and its current values.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Jet/Outflow Shocks Heating the Environment Around the Class I Protostellar Source Elias 29: FAUST XXI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have observed the late Class I protostellar source Elias~29 at a spatial-resolution of 70~au with the Atacama~Large~Millimeter/submillimeter~Array (ALMA) as part of the FAUST Large Program. We focus on the line emission of SO, while that of $^{34}$SO, C$^{18}$O, CS, SiO, H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, and DCO$^{+}$ are used supplementally. The spatial distribution of the SO rotational temperature ($T_{\rm rot}$(SO)) is evaluated by using the intensity ratio of its two rotational excitation lines. Besides in the vicinity of the protostar, two hot spots are found at a distance of 500 au from the protostar; $T_{\rm rot}$(SO) locally rises to 53$^{+25}_{-15}$~K at the interaction point of the outflow and the southern ridge, and 72$^{+66}_{-29}$~K within the southeastern outflow probably due to a jet-driven bow shock. However, the SiO emission is not detected at these hot spots. It is likely that active gas accretion through the disk-like structure and onto the protostar still continues even at this evolved protostellar stage, at least sporadically, considering the outflow/jet activities and the possible infall motion previously reported. Interestingly, $T_{\rm rot}$(SO) is as high as 20$-$30~K even within the quiescent part of the southern ridge apart from the protostar by 500$-$1000~au without clear kinematic indication of current outflow/jet interactions. Such a warm condition is also supported by the low deuterium fractionation ratio of HCO$^+$ estimated by using the H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and DCO$^{+}$ lines. The B-type star HD147889 $\sim$0.5 pc away from Elias~29, previously suggested as a heating source for this region, is likely responsible for the warm condition of Elias~29.</description>

      <title>Preliminary results from 5 years' spectral monitoring of Antares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present preliminary results of 5 years' monitoring of the radial velocity of Alpha Sco, performed at the Astronomical Observatory of the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogot\'a, Colombia. The data include 580 spectra acquired on 153 nights between March 2015 and March 2020. The aim of this study is to probe the dynamics of the star's atmosphere on all possible time-scales through the variations in observed radial velocity. At present, our findings are consistent with previous results from other observers, and the combination of older and new data make it possible to assess the several periodicities. A detailed study of these results, including the convective motions in the photosphere, is still in progress.</description>

      <title>Some results of CCD-photometry of variable stars at the Astronomical Institute of Karazin Kharkiv National University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presented photometric observations for the one UV Ceti type and three W Ursae Majoris-type variable stars. The flare of the UV Ceti type star lasted about two hours, and the star changed magnitude to 3.9 within about two minutes. The values of color indices V-R, the rotational periods and the composite lightcurves have been obtained for the EW stars. Using a relation of an absolute magnitude-period obtained by Mateo and Rucinski (2017) and interstellar extinction from the three-dimensional map of Milky Way dust (http://argonaut.skymaps.info) and Green et al. (2019), we have calculated the absolute magnitudes of the EW stars and distances to them. The parallaxes obtained from our data differ from those given in Gaia DR 3, which may be due to insufficient quality calibration of the absolute magnitude-period relation and with the estimations of interstellar extinction.</description>

      <title>A Non-Stop Aurora? The Intriguing Radio Emission from the Rapidly Rotating Magnetic Massive Star HR 5907</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HR 5907 (HD 142184) stands out among magnetic OB stars for its rapid rotation, exceptionally hard X-ray emission, and strong magnetic field. High-frequency (&gt;5 GHz) radio emission from the star exhibits an approximately flat spectrum that can be attributed to gyrosynchrotron emission from a dense centrifugal magnetosphere. In a survey of radio emission from massive stars at sub-GHz frequencies, we noticed remarkable low-frequency radio emission from this star, characterized by high circular polarization and brightness temperature, which is inconsistent with the gyrosynchrotron model. We present a follow-up low-frequency radio study of this star with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in search of emission mechanisms that can go undiagnosed at higher frequencies. We detect variable radio emission characterized by varying degrees of circular polarization (15-45%) throughout the rotation cycle. The broad-band spectral fitting also suggests additional emission components at lower frequencies. We show that the observed emission is likely auroral emission via electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME), and identify this star as a Main-sequence Radio Pulse emitter (MRP). For MRPs, ECME is usually observed as short polarized enhancements near the magnetic nulls of the star. The detection of a high degree of circular polarization (&gt;15%) at all times makes HR 5907 unique among MRPs. This is only the second MRP after $\rho$ Oph C (detected polarization fraction: 0-60%) that exhibits persistent coherent radio emission attributed to the nearly aligned stellar magnetic and rotational axes.</description>

      <title>Solar oblateness &amp; asphericities temporal variations: outstanding some unsolved issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar oblateness has been the subject of several studies dating back to the nineteenth century. Despite diffculties, both theoretical and observational, tangible results have been achieved. However, variability of the solar oblateness with time is still poorly known. How the solar shape evolves with the solar cycle has been a challenging problem. Analysis of the helioseismic data, which are the most accurate measure of the solar structure up to now, leads to the determination of asphericity coeffcients which have been found to change with time. We show here that by inverting even coeffcients of f-mode oscillation frequency splitting to obtain the oblateness magnitude and its temporal dependence can be inferred. It is found that the oblateness variations lag the solar activity cycles by about 3 years. A major change occurred between solar cycles 23 and 24 is that the oblateness was greater in cycle 24 despite the lower solar activity level. Such results may help to better understand the near-subsurface layers as they strongly impacts the internal dynamics of the Sun and may induce instabilities driving the transport of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Christoph Scheiner's Sunspot Records: a New Perspective on Solar Activity of the Early Telescopic Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Christoph Scheiner was one of the most outstanding astronomers in the history of the sunspot observations. His book, Rosa Ursina, is the reference work regarding the study of the earliest sunspot records. The sunspot observations compiled by Scheiner in Rosa Ursina and Prodomus, including records made by other observers, forms one of the main references of the observations known for that period; particularly around the 1620s. Thus, his work is crucial to determine the solar activity level of the first solar cycles of the telescopic era. The number of sunspot groups recorded in Scheiner's documentary sources has been included in the existing sunspot group number databases. However, we have detected significant errors in the number of groups currently assigned to Scheiner's records. In this work, we reanalyze the information in Scheiner's source documents. Consequently, the standard 11-yr solar cycle shape for the second solar cycle of the telescopic era, which is not clear in previous studies, now becomes evident. In addition, the highest daily number of groups recorded during this cycle (8 groups) is 20% less than the one included in the existing sunspot group number databases. Using the hypergeometrical probability distribution, we find that solar minima in 2008-2009 and 2018-2019 are comparable to the most probable solar activity level of the minimum around 1632. In particular, the estimated lower limit for the solar activity in 1632 is even comparable with the solar activity level in 2008 and 2018.</description>

      <title>Data-Constrained Magnetohydrodynamics Simulation of a Confined X-class Flare in NOAA Active Region 11166</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a magnetohydrodynamics simulation of NOAA active region 11166 to understand the origin of a confined X-class flare that peaked at 23:23 UT on 2011 March 9. The simulation is initiated with a magnetic field extrapolated from the corresponding photospheric magnetogram using a non-force-free-field extrapolation technique. Importantly, the initial magnetic configuration identifies three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nulls and quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), which nearly agree with the bright structures appeared in multi-wavelength observations. The Lorentz force associated with the extrapolated field self-consistently generates the dynamics that leads to the magnetic reconnections at the 3D nulls and the QSLs. These reconnections are found to contribute to the pre-flare activities and, ultimately, lead to the development of the flare ribbons. Notably, the anchored spine of the 3D null and the complete absence of flux rope in the flaring region are congruent with the confined nature of the flare. Furthermore, the simulation also suggests the role of reconnections at the 3D null with an open spine in the onset of a jet away from the flaring site.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Solar Transition Region: Effects of Spatial Resolution on the Atmospheric Structure, Emission and Non-Equilibrium Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar transition region (TR) is a narrow interface between the chromosphere and corona, where emitted radiation contains critical information pertinent to coronal heating processes. We conducted 2-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations using adaptive mesh refinement to spatially resolve the fine structure of the TR while simultaneously capturing the larger-scale dynamics originating from surface convection. The time evolution of ionization fractions for oxygen ions is computed alongside the simulations. A minimum grid size of 1.25 km is achieved in the TR, enabling adequate resolution of the upper TR (log$_{10}T \gtrsim$ 5), although the lower TR (log$_{10}T \lesssim$ 5) remains under-resolved. Doppler shifts and nonthermal widths synthesized from TR lines exhibit convergence with grid sizes as coarse as 40 km, though some discrepancies persist between our results and observed TR line properties. A notable enhancement in emission from \ion{O}{6} lines, converging at a grid size of 2.5 km, shows an intensity 1.2 times that expected under ionization equilibrium, attributable to shock interactions with the TR. While model refinements are still required, our ability to resolve the TR offers critical insights into TR line characteristics arising from non-equilibrium ionization states, advancing our understanding of the coronal heating problem.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of mixing-induced cooling in the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cool ($\approx 10^4$K), dense material permeates the hot ($\approx 10^6$K), tenuous solar corona in form of coronal condensations, for example prominences and coronal rain. As the solar atmosphere evolves, turbulence can drive mixing between the condensations and the surrounding corona, with the mixing layer exhibiting an enhancement in emission from intermediate temperature ($\approx10^5$K) spectral lines, which is often attributed to turbulent heating within the mixing layer. However, radiative cooling is highly efficient at intermediate temperatures and numerical simulations have shown that radiative cooling can far exceed turbulent heating in prominence-corona mixing scenarios. As such the mixing layer can have a net loss of thermal energy, i.e., the mixing layer is cooling rather than heating. Here, we investigate the observational signatures of cooling processes in Kelvin-Helmholtz mixing between a prominence thread and the surrounding solar corona through 2D numerical simulations. Optically thin emission is synthesised for Si IV, along with optically thick emission for H$\alpha$, Ca II K and Mg II h using Lightweaver The Mg II h probes the turbulent mixing layer, whereas H$\alpha$ and Ca II K form within the thread and along its boundary respectively. As the mixing evolves, intermediate temperatures form leading to an increase in Si IV emission, which coincides with increased radiative losses. The simulation is dominated by cooling in the mixing layer, rather than turbulent heating, and yet enhanced emission in warm lines is produced. As such, an observational signature of decreased emission in cooler lines and increased emission in hotter lines may be a signature of mixing, rather than an implication of heating.</description>

      <title>CME Observations -- from Sun to Impact on Geospace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our Sun is an active star expelling dynamic phenomena known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The magnetic field configuration on the Sun and related solar wind structures affect the propagation behavior of CMEs, dominate its transit time and embedded magnetic field properties when impacting Earth. Since the conditions on the Sun constantly change, the impact of CMEs on the different regimes of geospace is quite variable and may differ significantly from event to event. This short review summarizes the different manifestations of CMEs on the Sun, their appearance in interplanetary space, and how CMEs trigger a cascade of reactions as they interact with Earth.</description>

      <title>GOTO065054+593624: a peculiar dwarf nova identified in real time via Kilonova Seekers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf novae are a crucial astrophysical laboratory for probing the nature of accretion, binary mass transfer, and binary evolution -- yet their diverse observational characteristics continue to challenge our theoretical understanding. We here present the discovery of, and subsequent observing campaign on GOTO065054+593624 (hereafter GOTO0650), a dwarf nova of the WZ Sge type, discovered in real-time by citizen scientists via the Kilonova Seekers citizen science project. An extensive dataset charts the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of this object, covering the first two months of its 2024 superoutburst. GOTO0650 shows a complete absence of visible emission lines during the high state, strong H and barely-detected He~II emission, and high-amplitude echo outbursts with a rapidly decreasing timescale that together do not neatly fit in with our current view of cataclysmic variables. The comprehensive dataset presented here not only underscores the uniqueness of this dwarf nova and marks it as a candidate period bouncer, but also highlights the important contribution that citizen scientists can make to the study of Galactic transients.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric dynamics of the hypergiant RW Cep during the Great Dimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypergiant RW Cep is one of the largest stars in our galaxy. The evolution and mass loss of such stars has profound effects on their surrounding regions and the galaxy as a whole. Between 2020 and 2024, RW Cep experienced a historic mass-loss event known as the Great Dimming. This study provides a spectroscopic analysis of RW Cep during the Great Dimming. We examine its atmospheric dynamics and place it in the context of the star's variability behaviour since the early 2000s. We conducted high-cadence spectroscopic observations of RW Cep during the dimming event using the Tartu Observatory 1.5-meter telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope. We analysed the atmospheric dynamics by measuring the radial velocities and line depths of Fe I and other spectral lines. The radial velocities of the Fe I lines reveal a vertical velocity gradient of 10-20 km/s in the atmosphere, correlating with the strength of the spectral lines. Stronger lines, formed in higher atmospheric layers, have higher radial velocities. We measured the systemic velocity at -50.3 km/s. During the dimming, radial velocities were affected by additional emission from the ejected gas, which was blue-shifted relative to the absorption lines. Post-dimming, we observed large-scale atmospheric motions with amplitude ~25 km/s. Strong resonance lines of Ba II, K I, Na I and Ca I showed stable central emission components at -56 km/s, likely of circumstellar origin.</description>

      <title>The TW Hydrae Association is a cluster chain of Sco-Cen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TW Hydrae Association (TWA) is a young local association (YLA) about 50 pc from the Sun, offering a unique opportunity to study star and planet formation processes in detail. We characterized TWA's location, kinematics, and age, investigating its origin within the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association. Using Gaia DR3 astrometric data and precise ground-based radial velocities, we identified substructures within TWA, tentatively dividing them into TWA-a and TWA-b. Sco-Cen's massive cluster $\sigma$ Cen (15 Myr, 1,805 members) may have influenced TWA's formation. The alignment of $\sigma$ Cen, TWA-a, and TWA-b in 3D positions, velocities, and ages resembles patterns in regions such as Corona Australis, suggesting that TWA is part of a cluster chain from sequential star formation induced by massive stars in Sco-Cen. TWA's elongation in the opposite direction to that produced by Galactic differential rotation indicates its shape is still influenced by its formation processes and will dissipate in less than 50 Myr due to Galactic forces. These findings unveil the nature of YLAs and low-mass clusters in a new light. We propose that clusters such as $\epsilon$ Chamaeleontis, $\eta$ Chamaeleontis, and TWA were forged by stellar feedback from massive stars in Sco-Cen, while others--such as $\beta$ Pictoris, Carina, Columba, and Tucana-Horologium--are older and formed differently. Remarkably, all these YLAs and Sco-Cen are part of the $\alpha$ Persei cluster family, a vast kiloparsec-scale star formation event active over the past 60 Myr. This suggests that YLAs are the smallest stellar structures emerging from major star formation episodes and should be common in the Milky Way. Crucially, their formation in regions with intense stellar feedback may have influenced planet formation in these systems.</description>

      <title>The present and the future of modeling eclipsing binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In September 2024, eclipsing binary star practitioners gathered in Litomysl, Czech Republic, the birth town of Zdenek Kopal, one of the most celebrated pioneers of our field, to discuss the latest developments and state-of-the-art. I was invited to present my own biased view of the present and the future of modeling eclipsing binary stars. In this contribution I attempt to make a clear distinction between approaches that are suited to individual objects and approaches that aim to deliver bulk results for large datasets. I stress that our motivation should be different: individual system analysis is warranted whenever there is potential to propose or improve our understanding of the underlying physics, while bulk analysis should be used to probe stellar formation and evolution channels. I briefly discuss two examples of tools to achieve the goals: PHOEBE for individual system analysis, and PHOEBAI for bulk analysis.</description>

      <title>The influence of chromospheric activity on line formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary sources of stellar spectral variability is magnetic activity. While our current understanding of chromospheric activity is largely derived from specific lines sensitive to chromospheric heating, such as the Ca II HK doublet, previous observational studies have shown that other spectral lines are also affected. To investigate the influence of activity on line formation in greater detail, we constructed a set of stellar models for hypothetical G2 dwarf stars with varying levels of activity and calculated their synthetic spectra. A comparison of these spectra revealed two spectral regions most significantly impacted by activity: approximately 3300-4400 A and 5250-5500 A. By calculating the total contribution function of the lines, we determined that the emergence of a secondary chromospheric contribution to line formation is the primary mechanism driving these changes. Based on our calculations and analysis, we compiled a list of transition lines and their corresponding changes due to chromospheric activity. This list could serve as a valuable tool for selecting spectral lines applicable to a wide range of astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>PyEMILI: A New Generation Computer-aided Spectral Line Identifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep high-dispersion spectroscopy of Galactic photoionized gaseous nebulae, mainly planetary nebulae and HII regions, has revealed numerous emission lines. As a key step of spectral analysis, identification of emission lines hitherto has mostly been done manually, which is a tedious task, given that each line needs to be carefully checked against huge volumes of atomic transition/spectroscopic database to reach a reliable assignment of identity. Using Python, we have developed a line-identification code PyEMILI, which is a significant improvement over the Fortran-based package EMILI introduced ~20 years ago. In our new code PyEMILI, the major shortcomings in EMILI's line-identification technique have been amended. Moreover, the atomic transition database utilized by PyEMILI was adopted from Atomic Line List v3.00b4 but greatly supplemented with theoretical transition data from the literature. The effective recombination coefficients of the CII, OII, NII and NeII nebular lines are collected from the literature to form a subset of the atomic transition database to aid identification of faint optical recombination lines in the spectra of PNe and HII regions. PyEMILI is tested using the deep, high-dispersion spectra of two Galactic PNe, Hf2-2 and IC418, and gives better results of line identification than EMILI does. We also ran PyEMILI on the optical spectrum of a late-type [WC11] star UVQS J060819.93-715737.4 recently discovered in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and our results agree well with the previous manual identifications. The new identifier PyEMILI is applicable to not only emission-line nebulae but also emission stars, such as Wolf-Rayet stars.</description>

      <title>A White Dwarf Binary Candidate Discovered by LAMOST Using Dynamical Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a binary system containing a white dwarf candidate using data from the LAMOST. Our analysis of the radial velocity data allowed us to determine an orbital period of approximately 0.953 days and a mass function of 0.129 $M_\odot$. Through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we obtained the stellar parameters of the visible star. By combining these results with the mass function, we established a relationship between the mass of the invisible star and the system's inclination angle, along with the Roche lobe radius. We find that the mass of the invisible star is below the Chandrasekhar limit when the inclination angle exceeds $35^\circ$. Given that systems with large variations in radial velocity typically have high inclination angles, we classify the invisible star as a white dwarf candidate. The Roche lobe radius exceeds the physical radius of the visible star, indicating that no mass transfer occurs, which results in a weak ellipsoidal modulation effect. Additionally, we obtained light curves from the TESS, ASAS-SN, and CRTS surveys. The light curves also exhibit a periodicity of approximately 0.95 days, with ellipsoidal modulation only in the 2019 TESS observations. Coupled with the strong $\rm H_{\alpha}$ emission line observed in the LAMOST MRS spectrum, we infer that the surface of the visible star contains significant hot spots. This obscures the system's inherently weak ellipsoidal modulation, resulting in a manifestation of rotational variables. Furthermore, an analysis of the dynamical characteristics of this system indicates that it has a high inclination angle ($&gt;60$ degrees) and its orbital properties are consistent with those of typical thin disk stars, supporting the hypothesis that the invisible object is a white dwarf.</description>

      <title>The Structure of the Molecular Envelope of the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first interferometric imaging of molecular line emission from the Ring Nebula, NGC~6720, in the form of Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of CO $J=2\rightarrow 1$ emission. The SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) mapping data, with $\sim$3$''$ spatial resolution and 2 km s$^{-1}$ velocity resolution, provide an unprecedentedly detailed, 3D view of the Ring's clumpy molecular envelope. The morphology of the velocity-integrated SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) image closely resembles those of near-IR H$_2$ and PAH emission in JWST/NIRCam imaging of NGC~6720, with the molecular gas forming a geometrically thin layer surrounding the ionized gas imaged by HST and JWST. A simple, geometrical model of the $^{12}$CO(2--1) data shows that the intrinsic structure of NGC~6720's molecular envelope closely resembles a truncated, triaxial ellipsoid that is viewed close to pole-on, and that the dynamical age of the molecular envelope is $\sim$6000 yr. The SMA $^{12}$CO(2--1) data furthermore reveal that filamentary features seen projected in the Ring's interior in JWST imaging are in fact fast-moving polar knots or bullets with radial velocities of $\pm$45--50 km s$^{-1}$ relative to systemic, and that the hot progenitor star remnant is positioned at the precise geometric center of the clumpy, ellipsoidal molecular shell. We assert that the Ring's molecular envelope was formed via a relatively sudden, AGB-terminating mass ejection event $\sim$6000 yr ago, and that this ellipsoidal envelope was then punctured by fast, collimated polar outflows resulting from interactions between the progenitor and one or more companion stars. Such an evolutionary scenario may describe most molecule-rich, ``Ring-like'' planetary nebulae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed a study of the orbital properties of seven eclipsing cataclysmic variable (CV) binary systems by analyzing photometric time series from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We employed Python code to determine the eclipse epochs and orbital periods for each system, and constructed O-C diagrams from observed and predicted eclipse epochs. By analyzing the O-C diagrams of our target CVs, we have constrained values for changes in orbital period with time. Our targets include a sample of sources from each class of non-magnetic, eclipsing CVs: dwarf novae variables, Z Cam type, and U Gem subclasses. We include in our study classical novae variables, nova-like variables (including the VY Scl and UX UMa subclasses), and recurrent novae variable stars. We approached this project with goals of developing time series analysis techniques for future undergraduate-level studies of eclipsing CVs, and how they may contribute to the understanding of their orbital evolution.</description>

      <title>Tracing magnetic switchbacks to their source: An assessment of solar coronal jets as switchback precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of large-amplitude magnetic field deflections in the solar wind, known as magnetic switchbacks, is still under debate. These structures, which are ubiquitous in the observations made by Parker Solar Probe, likely have their seed in the lower solar corona, where small-scale events driven by magnetic reconnection could provide conditions ripe for either direct or indirect generation. We investigated potential links between in situ measurements of switchbacks and eruptions originating from the clusters of small-scale coronal loops known as coronal bright points to establish whether these eruptions act as precursors to switchbacks. We traced solar wind switchbacks from PSP back to their source regions using the ballistic back-mapping and potential field source surface methods, and analyzed the influence of the source surface height and solar wind propagation velocity on magnetic connectivity. Using EUV images, we combined automated and visual approaches to identify small-scale eruptions in the source regions. We find that the source region connected to the spacecraft varies significantly depending on the source surface height, which exceeds the expected dependence on the solar cycle and cannot be detected via polarity checks. For two corotation periods that are straightforwardly connected, we find a matching level of activity (jets and switchbacks), which is characterized by the hourly rate of events and depends on the size of the region connected to PSP. However, no correlation is found between the two time series of hourly event rates. Modeling constraints and the event selection may be the main limitations in the investigation of a possible correlation. Evolutionary phenomena occurring during the solar wind propagation may also influence our results. These results do not allow us to conclude that the jets are the main switchback precursors, nor do they rule out this hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. III. Search for companions to members of young associations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Absolute astrometry with Gaia is expected to detect and characterize the orbits of thousands of exoplanets in the coming years. A tool, GaiaPMEX, was recently developed to characterize multiple systems based on Gaia-only data, and, when possible, the Gaia-Hipparcos proper motion anomaly. We compare the detection capabilities of absolute astrometry and spectroscopy (RV), and to detect and characterize planetary-mass companions, combining the astrometric data with direct imaging and RV data. For companion masses possibly in the planetary range, we use direct imaging and when possible, RV data as well, to further constrain their nature and orbital properties.
  For each target, a diagnosis on its binarity based on absolute astrometry is given. When no binary is detected, we provides detection limits in the (sma, mass) space. We identify several companions with possible masses down to the brown dwarfs (BD; 50+) or planetary masses (13). We detect a new giant planet at less than 1-2 au from the M-type star G80-21. For AB Pic and HD 14082 B, we confirm the presence of substellar companions, and provide robust solutions for their mass and orbital properties. We further identify 9 planetary mass companions candidates. Finally, a detailed treatment of noises in Gaia astrometric measurements shows that there are no evidence at a 2-sigma level of two exoplanet detections previously announced.
  Combining GaiaPMEX and RV data is therefore perfectly adaptIn the 0.5 to 5 au domain, GaiaPMEX has an excellent sensitivity to BDs, and a good sensitivity to planetary mass planets for this sample.</description>

Abstract: [Abbreviated] Context. Given their high luminosities (L&gt;~10^4Lsun), red supergiants (RSGs) are good tracers of the chemical abundances of the young stellar population in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. However, previous abundance analyses tailored to RSGs suffer some systematic uncertainties originating in, most notably, the synthesized molecular spectral lines for RSGs. Aims. We establish a new abundance analysis procedure for RSGs that circumvents difficulties faced in previous works, and test the procedure with ten nearby RSGs observed with the near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph WINERED (0.97--1.32 micron, R=28,000). Results. We determined the [X/Fe] of ten elements (Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I, K I, Ca I, Ti I, Cr I, Ni I, and Y II). We estimated the relative precision in the derived abundances to be 0.04--0.12 dex for elements with more than two lines analyzed (e.g., Fe I and Mg I) and up to 0.18 dex for the other elements (e.g., Y II). We compared the resultant abundances of RSGs with the well-established abundances of another type of young star, namely the Cepheids, in order to evaluate the potential systematic bias in our abundance measurements, assuming that the young stars (i.e., both RSGs and Cepheids) in the solar neighborhood have common chemical abundances. We find that the determined RSG abundances are highly consistent with those of Cepheids within &lt;~0.1 dex for some elements (notably [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]), which means the bias in the abundance determination for these elements is likely to be small. In contrast, the consistency is worse for some other elements (e.g., [Si/Fe] and [Y/Fe]). Nevertheless, the dispersion of the chemical abundances among our target RSGs is comparable with the individual statistical errors on the abundances. Hence, the procedure is likely to be useful to evaluate the relative difference in chemical abundances among RSGs.</description>

      <title>The rapid formation of macromolecules in irradiated ice of protoplanetary disk dust traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic macromolecular matter is the dominant carrier of volatile elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and noble gases in chondrites -- the rocky building blocks from which Earth formed. How this macromolecular substance formed in space is unclear. We show that its formation could be associated with the presence of dust traps, which are prominent mechanisms for forming planetesimals in planet-forming disks. We demonstrate the existence of heavily irradiated zones in dust traps, where small frozen molecules that coat large quantities of microscopic dust grains could be rapidly converted into macromolecular matter by receiving radiation doses of up to several 10s of eV molecule$^{-1}$ year$^{-1}$. This allows for the transformation of simple molecules into complex macromolecular matter within several decades. Up to roughly 4$\%$ of the total disk ice reservoir can be processed this way and subsequently incorporated into the protoplanetary disk midplane where planetesimals form. This finding shows that planetesimal formation and the production of organic macromolecular matter, which provides the essential elemental building blocks for life, might be linked.</description>

      <title>The bolometric light curve modeling of 98 Type I superluminous supernovae using the magnetar- and the circumstellar interaction models reveals surprisingly high ejecta masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the bolometric light curve modeling of 98 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) using three types of power inputs: the magnetar model and two kinds of circumstellar interaction models, applying the constant density and the steady wind scenario. The quasi-bolometric luminosities of the objects were calculated from the ZTF g- and r-band data using the methodology of \citet{chen23b}, and then they were modeled with the Minim code. It was found that the light curves of 45 SLSNe-I can be fitted equally well with both the magnetar and the CSM models, 14 objects prefer the magnetar model and 39 SLSNe-I favor the CSM model. The magnetar modeling yielded a mean spin period of $P~=~4.1 \pm 0.20$ ms and a magnetic field of $B~=~5.65 \pm 0.43 \cdot 10^{14}$ G, consistently with the literature. However, the ejected mass was estimated to be significantly larger compared to previous studies presenting either multi-color light curve modeling with MOSFiT or bolometric light curve modeling: we obtained a mean value and standard error of 34.26 and 4.67 $M_\odot$, respectively. The circumstellar interaction models resulted in even larger ejecta masses with a mean and standard error of 116.82 and 5.97 $M_\odot$ for the constant density model, and 105.99 and 4.50 $M_\odot$ for the steady wind model. Although the ejected mass depends strongly on the electron scattering opacity (assumed to be $\kappa~=~$0.2 in this work) and the ejecta velocity, which were estimated to be globally larger compared to earlier studies, our results suggest that SLSNe-I are indeed the explosions of the most massive stars.</description>

      <title>Classical waves and instabilities using the minimalist approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimalist approach in the study of perturbations in fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics involves describing their evolution in the linear regime using a single first-order ordinary differential equation, dubbed principal equation. The dispersion relation is determined by requiring that the solution of the principal equation be continuous and satisfy specific boundary conditions for each problem. The formalism is presented for flows in cartesian geometry and applied to classical cases such as the magnetosonic and gravity waves, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. For the latter, we discuss the influence of compressibility and the magnetic field, and also derive analytical expressions for the growth rates and the range of instability in the case of two fluids with the same characteristics.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: an extremely metal-poor galaxy at $z=8.271$ hosting an unusual population of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical ($\lambda \simeq 3100-5600 \,$\r{A}) spectrum of a $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 8.6$ star-forming galaxy at $z=8.271$ (EXCELS-63107) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. EXCELS-63107 is a compact object consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes ($r_e &lt; 200 \, \rm{pc}$) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry ($\beta=-3.3\pm0.3$). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5007$ forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff} \simeq 80 \, 000\,\rm{K}$ heating ionized gas with a density of $n_e &lt; 10^4 \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$ to a volume-averaged electron temperature of $T_e \simeq 34 \, 000\,\rm{K}$. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of ${12+\mathrm{log(O/H)}= 6.89^{+0.26}_{-0.21}}$ which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and $\simeq 10 \times$ lower than is typical for $z\simeq8$ galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a $\simeq 10-30 \, \times$ excess of $M &gt; 50 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$ stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. III. Astrophysical implications of second-order and dotriacontapole terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-term evolution of selected hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity. We employ analytic equations derived in Paper II for the evolution of orbit-averaged orbital elements for both inner and outer orbits, which include two classes of contributions. One class consists of linear-order contributions, including quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole and dotriacontapole orders, the latter scaling as $\epsilon^6$, where $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. The second class consists of contributions at {\em second} order in the fundamental perturbation parameter; they contribute at orders $\epsilon^{9/2}$, $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$ and $\epsilon^{6}$. For well studied triples such as star-planet systems perturbed by a low-mass third body (``hot Jupiters''), second-order and dotriacontapole (SOD) effects induce only small corrections. For stellar-mass binaries orbiting supermassive black holes, SOD corrections can suppress orbital flips that are generated by purely first-order effects. Planets orbiting binary star systems are susceptible to significant variations in the planetary semimajor axis, an effect that does not occur at first perturbative order. SOD effects in triple black hole systems can induce migrations of the eccentricity to significantly larger values than predicted by first-order perturbations, with implications for the gravitational-wave induced inspiral of the inner binary. We also show that in most cases, evolutions using our SOD equations are in better agreement with those from direct integration of the N-body equations of motion than those from first-order perturbations through hexadecapole order.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-Scale Physics of a Multi-Species Solar Wind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind affects the plasma environment around all solar system bodies. A strong solar wind dynamic pressure pushes plasma boundaries closer to these objects. For small objects kinetic effects on scales smaller than an ion gyroradius play an important role, and species with various mass-per-charge may act differently. In this case the solar wind composition can be important. Protons are the dominant ion species in the solar wind; however, sometimes the density of alpha particles increases significantly. We analyse the effect of different solar wind alpha-to-proton ratios on the plasma boundaries of the induced cometary magnetosphere. In addition, we investigate the energy transfer between the solar wind ions, the cometary ions, and the electromagnetic fields. Using the hybrid model Amitis, we simulate two different alpha-to-proton ratios and analyse the resulting plasma structures. We calculate the power density (E.J) of all three ion species (solar wind protons and alphas, and cometary ions) to identify load and generator regions. The integrated 1D power density shows the evolution of the power density from the upstream solar wind to downstream of the nucleus. A higher alpha-to-proton ratio leads to a larger comet magnetosphere but weaker magnetic field pile-up. The protons transfer energy to the fields and the cometary ions in the entire upstream region and the pile-up layer. Upstream of the nucleus, alphas are inefficient in transferring energy and can act as a load, especially for low alpha-to-proton ratios. The transfer of energy from alphas to cometary ions happens further downstream due to their larger inertia. For a multi-species solar wind the mass loading and energy transfer upstream of the pile-up layer will be most efficient for the species with the lowest inertia, typically protons, since different ion gyroradii give different flow patterns for the individual species.</description>

      <title>Where in the Milky Way Do Exoplanets Preferentially Form?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanets are detected around stars of different ages and birthplaces within the Galaxy. The aim of this work is to infer the Galactic birth radii ($r_\text{birth}$) of stars and, consequently, their planets, with the ultimate goal of studying the Galactic aspects of exoplanet formation. We used photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric data to estimate the stellar ages of two samples of stars hosting planets and, for comparison, a sample of stars without detected planets. The $r_\text{birth}$ of exoplanets were inferred by projecting stars back to their birth positions based on their estimated age and metallicity [Fe/H]. We find that stars hosting planets have higher [Fe/H], are younger, and have smaller $r_\text{birth}$ compared to stars without detected planets. In particular, stars hosting high-mass planets show higher [Fe/H], are younger, and have smaller $r_\text{birth}$ than stars hosting low-mass planets. We show that the formation efficiency of planets, calculated as the relative frequency of planetary systems, decreases with the galactocentric distance, which relationship is stronger for high-mass planets than for low-mass planets. Additionally, we find that (i) the formation efficiency of high-mass planets increases with time and encompasses a larger galactocentric distance over time; (ii) the formation efficiency of low-mass planets shows a slight increase between the ages of 4 and 8 Gyr and also encompasses a larger galactocentric distance over time; and (iii) stars without detected planets appear to form at larger galactocentric distances over time. We conclude that the formation of exoplanets throughout the Galaxy follows the Galactic chemical evolution, for which our results are in agreement with the observed negative interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient and its enrichment and flattening with time at any radius.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: OPTICAM Reveals the Hidden Spin of the WZ Sge Star GOTO 065054.49+593624.51</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WZ Sge stars are highly evolved accreting white dwarf systems (AWDs) exhibiting remarkably large amplitude outbursts (a.k.a. super-outbursts), typically followed by short rebrightenings/echo outbursts. These systems have some of the lowest mass transfer rates among AWDs, making even low magnetic fields dynamically important. Such magnetic fields are often invoked to explain the phenomenology observed in these systems, such as their X-ray luminosity and long periods of quiescence (30+ years). However, the detection of these is very elusive given the quenching of the accretion columns during outburst and the low luminosity of these systems during quiescence. Here we present high-cadence multi-band observations with {\it OPTICAM} of the recent outburst of the recently discovered WZ Sge star GOTO065054.49+593624.51, during the end of the main outburst and the dip in-between rebrightenings, covering 2 orders of magnitude in brightness. Our observations reveal the presence of a statistically significant signal with $P_{\omega}\simeq148$ seconds in the bluer ($g$) band which is detected only during the dip between the main outburst and the rebrigthenings. We interpret this signal as the spin period of the AWD. If confirmed, GOTO 0650 would bridge the gap between intermediate- and fast-rotating intermediate polars (IPs) below the period gap.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE: An ultra-faint $\simeq$ 10$^{5}$ $M_{\odot}$ Pop III Galaxy Candidate and First Constraints on the Pop III UV Luminosity Function at $z\simeq6-7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting the first generation of stars, Population III (PopIII), has been a long-standing goal in astrophysics, yet they remain elusive even in the JWST era. Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies, and carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations. We systematically search ~500 arcmin$^{2}$ across JWST legacy fields for PopIII candidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has produced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising PopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at $z=6.50^{+0.03}_{-0.24}$, a moderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{UV}$=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H$\alpha$ emission (rest-frame EW $2810\pm550$\AA); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope $\beta=-2.34\pm0.36$); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII]; [OIII]/H$\beta$&lt;0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun&lt;0.5%. These properties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar population (&lt;5Myr) with a stellar mass of $\simeq10^{5}M_{\odot}$. Intriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated UV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at $z=4-10$, consistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or the presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first observational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The volume density of GLIMPSE-16043 ($\approx10^{-4}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its plausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to finally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most metal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first generation of stars than we have ever been before.</description>

      <title>The centimeter emission from planet-forming disks in Taurus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed remarkable advances in the characterization of the (sub-)millimeter emission from planet-forming disks. Instead, the study of the (sub-)centimeter emission has made more limited progress, to the point that only a few exceptional disk-bearing objects have been characterized in the centimeter regime. This work takes a broad view of the centimeter emission from a large sample with VLA observations that is selected from previous ALMA surveys of more representative disks in brightness and extent. We report on the detection and characterization of flux at centimeter wavelengths from 21 sources in the Taurus star-forming region. Complemented by literature and archival data, the entire photometry from 0.85 mm to 6 cm is fitted by a two-component model that determines the ubiquitous presence of free-free emission entangled with the dust emission. The flux density of the free-free emission is found to scale with the accretion rate but is independent of the outer disk morphology depicted by ALMA. The dust emission at 2 cm is still appreciable, and offers the possibility to extract an unprecedented large set of dust spectral indices in the centimeter regime. A pronounced change between the median millimeter indices (2.3) and centimeter indices (2.8) suggests that a large portion of the disk emission is optically thick up to 3 mm. The comparison of both indices and fluxes with the ALMA disk extent indicates that this portion can be as large as 40 au, and suggests that the grain population within this disk region that emits the observed centimeter emission is similar in disks with different size and morphology. All these results await confirmation and dedicated dust modeling once facilities like ngVLA or SKA-mid are able to resolve the centimeter emission from planet-forming disks and disentangle the various components.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak dynamo regimes in Taylor-Couette flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal a nonlinear magnetic dynamo in a Taylor-Couette flow at small magnetic Prandtl numbers $Pm\leq 1$, which has been previously believed to exist only at higher $Pm\gtrsim 10$ in this flow. Both the amplitude of initial perturbations and $Pm$ play a critical role in its onset and evolution. It is shown that this dynamo exists in two main states -- a weak state dominated by large-scale modes and a strong, more turbulent state with higher amplitude dominated by small-scale modes. These findings can be important for dynamo processes in many astrophysical settings with small $Pm$.</description>

      <title>Disentangling stellar atmospheric parameters in astronomical spectra using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method based on Generative Adversaria! Networks (GANs) is developed for disentangling the physical (effective temperature and gravity) and chemical (metallicity, overabundance of a-elements with respect to iron) atmospheric properties in astronomical spectra. Using a projection of the stellar spectra, commonly called latent space, in which the contribution dueto one or several main stellar physicochemical properties is minimised while others are enhanced, it was possible to maximise the information related to certain properties, which can then be extracted using artificial neural networks (ANN) as regressors with higher accuracy than a reference method based on the use of ANN trained with the original spectra. Methods. Our model utilises autoencoders, comprising two artificial neural networks: an encoder anda decoder which transform input data into a low-dimensional representation known as latent space. It also uses discriminators, which are additional neural networks aimed at transforming the traditional autoencoder training into an adversaria! approach, to disentangle or reinforce the astrophysical parameters from the latent space. The GANDALF tool is described. It was developed to define, train, and test our GAN model with a web framework to show how the disentangling algorithm works visually. It is open to the community in Github. Results. The performance of our approach for retrieving atmospheric stellar properties from spectra is demonstrated using Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrograph (RVS) data from DR3. We use a data-driven perspective and obtain very competitive values, ali within the literature errors, and with the advantage of an important dimensionality reduction of the data to be processed.</description>

      <title>The SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE). V. Complete observations, data reduction and analysis, detection performances, and final results</title>

Abstract: During the past decade, state-of-the-art planet-finder instruments like SPHERE@VLT, coupling coronagraphic devices and extreme adaptive optics systems, unveiled, thanks to large surveys, around 20 planetary mass companions at semi-major axis greater than 10 astronomical units. Direct imaging being the only detection technique to be able to probe this outer region of planetary systems, the SPHERE infrared survey for exoplanets (SHINE) was designed and conducted from 2015 to 2021 to study the demographics of such young gas giant planets around 400 young nearby solar-type stars. In this paper, we present the observing strategy, the data quality, and the point sources analysis of the full SHINE statistical sample as well as snapSHINE. Both surveys used the SPHERE@VLT instrument with the IRDIS dual band imager in conjunction with the integral field spectrograph IFS and the angular differential imaging observing technique. All SHINE data (650 datasets), corresponding to 400 stars, including the targets of the F150 survey, are processed in a uniform manner with an advanced post-processing algorithm called PACO ASDI. An emphasis is put on the classification and identification of the most promising candidate companions. Compared to the previous early analysis SHINE F150, the use of advanced post-processing techniques significantly improved by one or 2 magnitudes (x3-x6) the contrast detection limits, which will allow us to put even tighter constraints on the radial distribution of young gas giants. This increased sensitivity directly places SHINE as the largest and deepest direct imaging survey ever conducted. We detected and classified more than 3500 physical sources. One additional substellar companion has been confirmed during the second phase of the survey (HIP 74865 B), and several new promising candidate companions are awaiting second epoch confirmations.</description>

      <title>Globular cluster formation from inertial inflows: accreting extremely massive stars as the origin of abundance anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the inertial-inflow model of massive star formation to describe the formation of globular clusters (GCs) in turbulent molecular clouds. A key aspect of this model is that the maximum stellar mass scales linearly with cloud mass, such that extremely massive stars (EMSs, $10^{3-4}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) form in massive GCs ($\gtrsim10^5\,M_\odot$). The total wind mass loss is dominated by accreting EMSs (aEMSs), whose wind mass-loss rates become comparable to their accretion rates ($\gtrsim10^{-2}\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$). These winds pollute the intra-cluster medium with hot-hydrogen burning yields during GC formation. We propose a parameterised model for the evolution of the stellar mass function during GC formation ($\sim 1-2\,{\rm Myr}$), accounting for gas inflow, wind mass loss and mixing of aEMS yields with pristine gas that has initial proto-GC abundances. Low-mass stars ($\lesssim1\,{\rm M}_\odot$) form continuously from this mixed gas and their abundances resemble observed abundance trends with GC mass and metallicity, specifically: (i) the helium spread in a typical GC is small ($\Delta Y \simeq 0.01$) and increases with GC mass; (ii) the fraction of polluted stars increases with GC mass and metallicity; (iii) the extent of the Mg-Al anticorrelations is more pronounced in metal-poor and massive GCs. We conclude that GCs formed with a population of EMSs, that may leave behind black holes with masses above the pair-instability gap ($\gtrsim120\,{\rm M}_\odot$) and that the nitrogen-rich galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) are in the first phase of galaxy evolution, when a large fraction of star formation occurs in the form of GCs.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic study of the Quiescent Stages in between the 2006 and 2021 outbursts of RS Ophiuchi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive spectroscopic analysis of the quiescent stage of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi between its 2006 and 2021 outbursts. The spectra shows prominent low-ionization emission features, including hydrogen, helium, iron emissions, and TiO absorption features. The \ion{H}{$\alpha$} and \ion{H}{$\beta$} lines showed double-peaked emission profiles, indicating that both originate from the accretion disc. The central peaks of the \ion{H}{$\alpha$} and \ion{H}{$\beta$} emission profiles exhibited subtle shifts towards the blue or red side, attributed to orbital motion and fluctuations in the accretion rate. Using the double-peak features observed in the \ion{H}{$\alpha$} and \ion{H}{$\beta$} lines, we have estimated the accretion disc size to be \( R_{AD} = 3.10 \pm 0.04 \times 10^{12} \, \text{cm} \). The \textsc{cloudy} photoionization code is employed to model the quiescent phase spectra, allowing us to study the evolution of various physical parameters such as temperature, luminosity, hydrogen density, elemental abundances, accreted mass, and accretion rate. The central ionizing sources exhibit temperatures in the range of $1.05 - 1.80~\times 10^4$ K and luminosities between $0.10 - 7.94~\times 10^{30}$ \ergs. The mean accretion rate, calculated from the model, is $\sim$ $1.25 \times 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The model results reveal that the accretion rate rose substantially in the later phase. The accreted mass in the 16 months, preceding the 2021 outburst exceeds 47\% of the critical mass, and more than 88\% of the critical mass was accreted in the last three years.</description>

      <title>A kinematical study of the launching region of the blueshifted HH 46/47 outflow with SINFONI K-band observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying outflows is important as they may significantly contribute to angular momentum removal from the star/disk system, affecting disk evolution and planet formation. To investigate the different outflow components; the collimated jet, wide-angled molecular outflow, and outflow cavity, of the Class I HH 46/47 outflow system. We focus on their kinematics. We present Near Infrared (NIR) K-band integral field observations of the blue-shifted HH 46/47 outflow base obtained using VLT/SINFONI with an angular resolution of 0".81. Our analysis focuses on [Fe II], H2 1-0 S(1), and, Br-gamma emission. We employ a wavelength recalibration technique based on OH telluric lines to probe the kinematics of the wide-angled flow with an accuracy of 1 km/s - 3 km/s. A velocity gradient of 10 km/s transverse to the outflow direction is confirmed in the wide-angled H2 outflow cavity. The H2 cavity peaks at radial velocities of -15 km/s to -30 km/s, and the atomic jet at v = -210 km/s. The outflow exhibits a layered structure; the high-velocity [Fe II] and Br-gamma jet is surrounded by a wide-angled H2 outflow cavity, which is in turn nested within the continuum emission and CO molecular outflow. The continuum emission and H2 outflow cavity are asymmetric with respect to the jet axis. We propose that the origin of the asymmetries and the velocity gradient detected in the wide-angled H2 cavity, is due to a wide-angled outflow or successive jet bowshocks expanding into an inhomogeneous ambient medium, or the presence of a secondary outflow. We eliminate outflow rotation as an exclusive origin of this velocity gradient due to large specific angular momenta values, J(r)= 3000 - 4000 km/s au calculated from 1" to 2" along the outflow. The observations reveal the complexities inherent in outflow systems, and the risk of attributing transverse velocity gradients solely to rotation.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Emission Line spectro-imaging of the RU Lupi jet and Low Velocity Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first images of the jet and low velocity component (LVC) from the strongly accreting classical T Tauri star RU Lupi are presented. Adaptive optics assisted spectro-imaging of forbidden emission lines was used. The main aim of the observations was to test the conclusion from a recent spectro-astrometric study that the narrow component of the LVC is tracing an MHD disk wind, and to estimate the mass loss rate in the wind. The structure and morphology of the component supports a wind origin for the NC. An upper limit to the launch radius and semi-opening angle of the wind in [O I]{\lambda}6300 emission are estimated to be 2 au and 19{\deg} in agreement with MHD wind models for high accretors. The height of the [O I]{\lambda}6300 wind emitting region, a key parameter for the derivation of the mass loss rate, is estimated for the first time at approximately 35 au giving M_out = 2.6 x 10^-11 M_sun/yr. When compared to the derived mass accretion rate of M_acc = 1.6 x 10^-7 M_sun/yr, the efficiency in the wind is too low for the wind to be significantly contributing to angular momentum removal.</description>

      <title>Predicting metallicities and carbon abundances from Gaia XP spectra for (carbon-enhanced) metal-poor stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carbon-rich (C-rich) stars can be found at all metallicities and evolutionary stages. They are often the result of mass-transfer from a companion, but some of the most metal-poor C-rich objects are likely carrying the imprint of the metal-free First Stars from birth. In this work, we employ a neural network to predict metallicities and carbon abundances for over 10 million stars with Gaia low-resolution XP spectra, down to [Fe/H] = -3.0 and up to [C/Fe] $\approx$ +2. We identify ~2000 high-confidence bright (G&lt;16) carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0 and [C/Fe] &gt; +0.7. The majority of our C-rich candidates have [Fe/H] &gt; -2.0 and are expected to be binary mass-transfer products, supported by high barium abundances in GALAH and/or their Gaia RUWE and radial velocity variations. We confirm previous findings of an increase in C-rich stars with decreasing metallicity, adopting a definition of $3\sigma$ outliers from the [C/Fe] distribution, although our frequency appears to flatten for -3.0 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -2.0 at a level of 6-7%. We also find that the fraction of C-rich stars is low among globular cluster stars (connected to their lower binary fraction), and that it decreases for field stars more tightly bound to the Milky Way. We interpret these last results as evidence that disrupted globular clusters contribute more in the inner Galaxy, supporting previous work. Homogeneous samples like these are key to understanding the full population properties of C-rich stars, and this is just the beginning.</description>

      <title>X-ray/Radio Quasi-periodic Pulsations Associated with Plasmoids in Solar Flare Current Sheets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmoids (or magnetic islands) are believed to play an important role in the onset of fast magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration during solar flares and eruptions. Direct imaging of flare current sheets and formation/ejection of multiple plasmoids in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images, along with simultaneous X-ray and radio observations, offers significant insights into the mechanisms driving particle acceleration in solar flares. Here we present direct imaging of the formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in flare plasma/current sheets and associated quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) observed in X-ray and radio wavelengths, using observations from SDO/AIA, RHESSI, and Fermi GBM. These plasmoids propagate bidirectionally upward and downward along the flare current sheet beneath the erupting flux rope during two successive flares associated with confined/failed eruptions. The flux rope exhibits evidence of helical kink instability with formation and ejection of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet, as predicted in an MHD simulation of a kink-unstable flux rope. RHESSI X-ray images show double coronal sources (``loop-top" and higher coronal sources) located at both ends of the flare current/plasma sheet. Moreover, we detected an additional transient faint X-ray source (6-12 keV) located between the double coronal sources, which was co-spatial with multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet. X-ray (soft and hard) and radio (decimetric) observations unveil QPPs (periods$\approx$10-s and 100-s) associated with the ejection and coalescence of plasmoids. These observations suggest that energetic electrons are accelerated during the ejection and coalescence of multiple plasmoids in the flare current sheet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bending waves are perhaps the most fundamental and analytically tractable phenomena in warped disc dynamics. In this work we conduct 3D grid-based, numerical experiments of bending waves in laminar, viscous hydrodynamic and turbulent, weakly magnetised discs, capturing their behaviour in unprecedented detail. We clearly elucidate the theory from first principles, wherein the general Fourier-Hermite formalism can be simplified to a reduced framework which extends previous results towards locally isothermal discs. We obtain remarkable agreement with our laminar simulations wherein the tilt evolution is well described by the reduced theory, whilst higher order vertical modes should be retained for capturing the detailed disc twisting and internal velocity profiles. We then relax this laminar assumption and instead launch bending waves atop a magnetorotationally turbulent disc. Although the turbulence can be quantified with an effective $\alpha$ parameter, the bending waves behave distinctly from a classical viscous evolution and are readily disrupted when the turbulent velocity is comparable to the induced warping flows. This may have implications for the inclination damping rates induced by planet-disc interactions, the capture rate of black holes in AGN discs or the warped shapes assumed by discs in misaligned systems.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the concept of relativity of simultaneity used in the theory of special relativity, a new approach is proposed to simulate future solar wind conditions at any point in the inner solar system. An important distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that the simulation in the solar corona is driven by hourly updated solar magnetograms and is continuously simulated in nearly real time. The model for the inner heliosphere is based on time transformation to a boosted frame of reverence (or spacetime coordinate system) in which the current state of the solar wind at the solar corona -- inner heliosphere boundary and future states of the solar wind are simultaneous. The predictive capability for tomorrow's parameters of the ambient solar wind at 1 AU is achieved by simulating them simultaneously with the current observations of the solar magnetic field, the time offset being due to the use of boosted frame.
  We derive the modified governing equations for both hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics and present a new numerical algorithm that solves the modified governing equations. The proposed method enables an efficient numerical implementation and thus a significantly longer forecast time than traditional solution methods. In the numerical test for transient propagation, the boosted solution for the CME-driven shock arrival at 1AU is 16 hours ahead of the solution at the solar corona -- inner heliosphere boundary.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>

Abstract: The (sub)millimeter sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub)millimeter telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>Flux-Rope Mediated Turbulent Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new model of magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence, applicable when the magnetic helicity is non-zero. The new model differs from the Lazarian-Vishniac turbulent reconnection theory by emphasizing the role of locally coherent magnetic structures, whose existence is shown to be permitted by the properties of magnetic field line separation in turbulent plasma. Local coherence allows storage of magnetic helicity inside the reconnection layer and we argue that helicity conservation produces locally coherent twisted flux ropes. We then introduce the "Alfv\'en horizon" to explain why the global reconnection rate can be governed by locally coherent magnetic field structure instead of by field line wandering, formally extending to 3D the principle that reconnection can be made fast by fragmentation of the global current layer. Coherence is shown to dominate over field line dispersion if the anisotropy of the turbulence at the perpendicular scale matching the thickness of a marginally stable current layer exceeds the aspect ratio of the current layer. Finally, we conjecture that turbulence generated within the reconnection layer may produce a balance of anisotropies that maintains the system in the flux-rope mediated regime. The new model successfully accounts for the major features of 3D numerical simulations of self-generated turbulent reconnection, including reconnection rates of 0.01 in resistive MHD and 0.1 with collisionless physics.</description>

      <title>Higher-order moment convergent method in weakly anisotropic plasma and the NLVFP code for solution of the 0D-2V Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation</title>

Abstract: Fusion plasma is a typical non-equilibrium and nonlinear system, with the interaction between different species well described by the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equations. The transport of mass, momentum, energy, and temperature relaxation are important issues, which are affected by the collision term of VFP even in so-called collision-less plasma domain. Hence, nonlinearity and collisions are crucial features in large regime. A successful numerical simulation for non-equilibrium plasma has to be able to conserve mass, momentum and energy, while to satisfy Boltzmann's H-theorem and higher-order moment convergence. An expansion of the distribution function in spherical harmonics (Legendre basis when the velocity space exhibits axisymmetry) in angle coordinate and in King basis in speed coordinate of velocity space is well suited to address these requirements. This paper reviews the formulation of the 0D-2V VFP equation in terms of spherical harmonics coupled with King function and its solution in our NLVFP code. In this topic review, we will introduce the background physics related to the nonlinear VFP simulation, then describe NLVFP for 0D-2V homogeneous, weakly anisotropic plasma with utilization of the Shkarofsky's form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth (FPRS) collision operator.</description>

      <title>The two-dimensional pressure structure of the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk as probed by multi-molecule kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05517</link>

Abstract: [Abridged] Gas kinematics is a new and unique way to study planet-forming environments by an accurate characterization of disk velocity fields. High angular resolution ALMA observations allow deep kinematical analysis of disks, by observing molecular line emission at high spectral resolution. In particular, rotation curves are key tools for studying the disk pressure structure and estimating fundamental disk parameters, such as mass and radius. In this work, we explore the potential of a multi-molecule approach to gas kinematics to provide a 2D characterization of the HD 163296 disk. From the high quality data of the MAPS Large Program we extracted the rotation curves of rotational lines from seven distinct molecular species, spanning a wide radial and vertical range. To obtain reliable rotation curves for hyperfine lines, we extended standard methodologies to fit multi-component line profiles. We then sampled the likelihood of a thermally stratified model that reproduces all the rotation curves simultaneously, taking into account the molecular emitting layers and disk thermal structure. We obtained dynamical estimates of the stellar mass $M_\star=1.89$ M$_\odot$, the disk mass $M_\text{d}=0.12$ M$_\odot$, and scale radius $R_\text{c}=143$ au. We also explore how rotation curves and the parameter estimates depend on the adopted emitting layers: the disk mass proves to be the most affected by these systematics, yet the main trends we find do not depend on the adopted parameterization. Finally, we investigated the impact of thermal structure on gas kinematics, showing that the thermal stratification can efficiently explain the measured rotation velocity discrepancies between tracers at different heights. Our results show that such a multi-molecule approach, tracing a large range of emission layers, can provide unique constraints on the ($R,z$) pressure structure of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Variation of the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the stellar mass functions obtained from 20 radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation in 500 M$_\odot$ molecular clouds with metallicities of 3, 1, 1/10 and 1/100 of the solar value, with the clouds subjected to levels of the cosmic microwave background radiation that are appropriate for star formation at redshifts z=0, 3, 5, 7, and 10. The calculations include a thermochemical model of the diffuse interstellar medium and treat dust and gas temperatures separately. We find that the stellar mass distributions obtained become increasingly bottom light as the redshift and/or metallicity are increased. Mass functions that are similar to a typical Galactic initial mass function are obtained for present-day star formation (z=0) independent of metallicity, and also for the lowest-metallicity (1/100 solar) at all redshifts up to z=10, but for higher metallicities there is a larger deficit of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars as the metallicity and redshift are increased. These effects are a result of metal-rich gas being unable to cool to as lower temperatures at higher redshift due to the warmer cosmic microwave background radiation. Based on the numerical results we provide a parameterisation that may be used to vary the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity; this could be used in simulations of galaxy formation. For example, a bottom-light mass function reduces the mass-to-light ratio compared to a typical Galactic stellar initial mass function, which may reduce the estimated masses of high-redshift galaxies.</description>
