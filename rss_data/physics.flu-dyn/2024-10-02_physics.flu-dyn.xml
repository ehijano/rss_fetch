      <title>Computational Investigation of Roughness Effects on Boundary Layer Transition for Stetson's Blunt Cone at Mach 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this aerothermal study, we performed a two-dimensional steady-state Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and heat conduction simulation at Mach 6. The key to our methodology was a one-way coupling between CFD surface temperature as a boundary condition and the calculation of the heat transfer flux and temperatures inside the solid stainless-steel body of a nose geometry. This approach allowed us to gain insight into surface heat transfer signatures with corresponding fluid flow regimes, such as the one experienced in laminar fluid flow. We have also examined this heat transfer under roughness values encountered in Stetson's studies at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Ludwig tube. To validate our findings, we have performed this type of work on a blunt cone, specifically for the U.S. Air Force.</description>

      <title>Turbulence suppression in plane Couette flow using reduced-order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a reduced-order model (ROM) of plane Couette flow with a view to performing turbulence control. The ROM is derived through Galerkin projections of the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) system onto a basis composed of controllability modes, truncated to a few streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers. Such ROMs were found to reproduce key aspects of nonlinear turbulence dynamics in Couette flow with only a few hundreds degrees of freedom. Here we use the ROM to devise a control strategy. For that, we consider a ROM with an extra forcing term, consisting in a steady body force. The spatial structure of the forcing is given by a linear combination of Stokes modes, optimised using a gradient-descent algorithm in order to minimise the total fluctuation energy. The optimisation is performed at different Reynolds numbers, with the optimal forcing leading to laminarisation of the flow in all cases. The forcing mechanism acts by strongly reducing the shear in a large central portion of the channel. This disrupts the dynamics of large-scale streaks and rolls and hinders the main energy input to the system. When the forcing is active, the flow reaches a new laminar state which is linearly stable and whose linear transient growth is substantially reduced with respect to that of laminar Couette flow. These features prompt the flow to return to the laminar Couette state when the forcing is switched off. Body forces optimised in the ROM are subsequently applied to the full NS system in direct numerical simulations (DNS) for the same flow configurations. The same control mechanisms are observed in the DNS, where laminarisation is also achieved. The present work opens up interesting possibilities for turbulence control. We show that the ROMs provide an effective framework to design turbulence control strategies, despite the high degree of truncation with respect to the full system.</description>

      <title>A theoretical model for compressible bubble dynamics considering phase transition and migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel theoretical model for bubble dynamics is established that simultaneously accounts for the liquid compressibility, phase transition, oscillation, migration, ambient flow field, etc. The bubble dynamics equations are presented in a unified and concise mathematical form with clear physical meanings and extensibility. The bubble oscillation equation can be simplified to the Keller-Miksis equation by neglecting the effects of phase transition and bubble migration. The present theoretical model effectively captures the experimental results for bubbles generated in free fields, near free surfaces, adjacent to rigid walls, and in the vicinity of other bubbles. Based on the present theoretical model, we explore the effect of the bubble content by changing the vapor proportion inside the cavitation bubble for an initial high-pressure bubble. It is found that the energy loss of the bubble shows a consistent increase with increasing Mach number and initial vapor proportion. However, the radiated pressure peak by the bubble at the collapse stage increases with the decreasing Mach number and increasing vapor proportion. The energy analyses of the bubble reveal that the presence of vapor inside the bubble not only directly contributes to the energy loss of the bubble through phase transition but also intensifies the bubble collapse, which leads to greater radiation of energy into the surrounding flow field due to the fluid compressibility.</description>

      <title>Investigation of shock-shock interaction in hypersonic rarefied flow using direct simulation Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rarefied flows encountered by the hypersonic vehicles in their high-altitude flights call for investigations coupling the shock-shock interaction and the rarefied-gas effect. An in-house direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solver is employed to simulate a series of hypersonic air flows over a wedge-cylinder configuration at the freestream Mach number of 10. The DSMC simulations cover 15 different Knudsen numbers, spanning from 0.006688 to 0.6688. At the lowest Knudsen number, the numerical results are validated by the corresponding wind-tunnel experiment, and demonstrate the features of an Edney type IV shock-shock interaction, including the type IV wave pattern, the supersonic jet impingement, the augmentations of surface shear stress, pressure and heat flux, as well as the shifts in the angular positions of the peak shear stress, pressure and heat flux over the cylinder surface. In ascending order of Knudsen number, the overviews and details of the flow fields with and without shock-shock interaction, as well as the distributions of the shear stress, pressure and heat flux over the cylinder surface are displayed and analyzed. The increase of flow rarefaction continuously alters the flow pattern of the shock-shock interaction, in which the wave system gradually losses the abilities to deflect the streamlines or to concentrate the energy in the flow. As the flow becomes more rarefied, the shock-shock interaction will result in smaller augmentation factors and less angular shifts of the peak aerodynamic/aerothermal loads. At the highest Knudsen number in this study, the augmentation factors for skin friction and heat flux are found to be less than unity. The existence/vanishment of the supersonic jet and its position relative to the cylinder account for the distribution characteristics of aerodynamic/aerothermal loads over the cylinder surface.</description>

      <title>Complete vortex shedding suppression in highly slender elliptical cylinders through deep reinforcement learning-driven flow control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By leveraging the high dimensional nonlinear mapping capabilities of artificial neural networks in conjunction with the powerful control mechanisms of reinforcement learning, we attain real-time, precise modulation of synthetic jet flow rates over elliptical cylinders with varying aspect ratios (Ar). The training outcomes for elliptical cylinders with a blockage ratio of 0.24 show that for Ar=1 and 0.75, the reward function gradually increases with decreasing oscillations before stabilizing. The agent's control strategy achieved drag reduction rates of 8% and 15%, while 99% of the lift coefficient is effectively suppressed. It deserves emphasis that vortex shedding is entirely eliminated with only 0.1% and 1% of the inlet flow rate. As Ar decreases, the reinforcement learning process slows and becomes less stable, with energy consumption surging to 14.5%, while lift and drag coefficients continue oscillating and vortex shedding remains uncontrolled. When blockage ratio is reduced to 0.12, the reinforcement learning training demonstrates robust convergence and consistent full suppression of vortex shedding across all Ar from 1 to 0.1. Furthermore, drag reduction rates are observed within the range of 6.1% to 32.3%, while the lift coefficient is effectively regulated to remain at zero. For cylinders with Ar between 1 and 0.25, external energy expenditure remains below 1.4% of the inlet flow rate, signifying the realization of both efficient and energy-conservative control strategies within this range. However, for the extremely slender elliptical cylinder with Ar=0.1, the energy cost escalates to 8.1%, underscoring the significantly higher energy expenditure required to fulfill the control objectives for such highly elongated geometries.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Balanced Flow Control Achieved through Optimization of Synthetic Jet Placement Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to train synthetic jet-based flow control strategies for circular and square cylinders. The central aim is to ascertain the optimal jet placements that strike an ideal balance between energy efficiency and control effectiveness, by formulating a cohesive strategy based on a comprehensive analysis of flow control performance and energy consumption across a range of configurations. First, the results from single-action training indicate that for circle cylinder, positioning the synthetic jet approximately 105{\deg} from the stagnation point achieves the most energy-efficient and effective control strategy. For square cylinder, placing the jet near the rear corner addresses the dual objectives of minimizing energy consumption and maximizing control performance. Second, compared to single-action control, multi-action control exhibits reduced convergence speed and stability. However, simultaneously activating synthetic jets at multiple locations significantly decreases initial energy consumption and enhances energy efficiency. The findings underscore the critical importance of accurately positioning the synthetic jet at the primary flow separation point, as this alignment not only enhances flow control performance but also establishes an optimal balance between energy efficiency and control effectiveness within the flow system. Furthermore, the interaction between synthetic jets and the flow system alters surface streamline patterns and local flow structures, resulting in effects that are considerably larger in scale than the jets themselves. This study crystallizes the potential of DRL algorithms to intelligently optimize intricate flow control strategies, effectively balancing energy efficiency with enhanced flow control performance through strategically optimized jet placement.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional simulation of film boiling on a horizontal surface with magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study conducts a numerical investigation into the three-dimensional film boiling of liquid under the influence of external magnetic fields. The numerical method incorporates a sharp phase-change model based on the volume-of-fluid approach to track the liquid-vapor interface. Additionally, a consistent and conservative scheme is employed to calculate the induced current densities and electromagnetic forces. We investigate the magnetohydrodynamic effects on film boiling, particularly examining the pattern transition of the vapor bubble and the evolution of heat transfer characteristics, exposed to either a vertical or horizontal magnetic field. In single-mode scenarios, film boiling under a vertical magnetic field displays an isotropic flow structure, forming a columnar vapor jet at higher magnetic field intensities. In contrast, horizontal magnetic fields result in anisotropic flow, creating a two-dimensional vapor sheet as the magnetic strength increases. In multi-mode scenarios, the patterns observed in single-mode film boiling persist, with the interaction of vapor bubbles introducing additional complexity to the magnetohydrodynamic flow. More importantly, our comprehensive analysis reveals how and why distinct boiling effects are generated by various orientations of magnetic fields, which induce directional electromagnetic forces to suppress flow vortices within the cross-sectional plane.</description>

      <title>Random large eddy simulation for 3-dimensional incompressible viscous flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for simulation of incompressible viscous flows by integrating the technology of random vortex method with the core idea of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Specifically, we utilize the filtering method in LES, interpreted as spatial averaging, along with the integral representation theorem for parabolic equations, to achieve a closure scheme which may be used for calculating solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. This approach circumvents the challenge associated with handling the non-locally integrable 3-dimensional integral kernel in the random vortex method and facilitates the computation of numerical solutions for flow systems via Monte-Carlo method. Numerical simulations are carried out for both laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating the validity and effectiveness of the method.</description>

      <title>On the conservation of helicity by weak solutions of the 3D Euler and inviscid MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations of an ideal incompressible fluid conserve the helicity. We introduce a new weak formulation of the vorticity formulation of the Euler equations in which (by implementing the Bony paradifferential calculus) the advection terms are interpreted as paraproducts for weak solutions with low regularity. Using this approach we establish an equation of local helicity balance, which gives a rigorous foundation to the concept of local helicity density and flux at low regularity. We provide a sufficient criterion for helicity conservation which is weaker than many of the existing sufficient criteria for helicity conservation in the literature.
  Subsequently, we prove a sufficient condition for the helicity to be conserved in the zero viscosity limit of the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, under additional assumptions we establish a relation between the defect measure (which is part of the local helicity balance) and a third-order structure function for solutions of the Euler equations. As a byproduct of the approach introduced in this paper, we also obtain a new sufficient condition for the conservation of magnetic helicity in the inviscid MHD equations, as well as for the kinematic dynamo model.
  Finally, it is known that classical solutions of the ideal (inviscid) MHD equations which have divergence-free initial data will remain divergence-free, but this need not hold for weak solutions. We show that weak solutions of the ideal MHD equations arising as weak-$*$ limits of Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the viscous and resistive MHD equations remain divergence-free in time.</description>

      <title>Statistics of drops generated from ensembles of randomly corrugated ligaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.16192v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The size of drops generated by the capillary-driven disintegration of liquid ligaments plays a fundamental role in several important natural phenomena, ranging from heat and mass transfer at the ocean-atmosphere interface to pathogen transmission. The inherent non-linearity of the equations governing the ligament destabilization leads to significant differences in the resulting drop sizes, owing to small fluctuations in the myriad initial conditions. Previous experiments and simulations reveal a variety of drop size distributions, corresponding to competing underlying physical interpretations. Here, we perform numerical simulations of individual ligaments, the deterministic breakup of which is triggered by random initial surface corrugations. The simulations are grouped in a large ensemble, each corresponding to a random initial configuration. The resulting probability distributions reveal three stable drop sizes, generated via a sequence of two distinct stages of breakup. Four different distributions are tested, volume-based Poisson, Gaussian, Gamma and Log-Normal. Depending on the time, range of droplet sizes and criteria for success, each distribution has successes and failures. However the Log-Normal distribution roughly describes the data when fitting both the primary peak and the tail of the distribution while the number of droplets generated is the highest, while the Gamma and Log-Normal distributions perform equally well when fitting the tail. The study demonstrates a precisely controllable and reproducible framework, which can be employed to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the polydispersity of drop sizes found in complex fluid fragmentation scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13698v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we established a novel theory for the dynamics of oscillating bubbles such as cavitation bubbles, underwater explosion bubbles, and air bubbles. For the first time, we proposed bubble dynamics equations that can simultaneously take into consideration the effects of boundaries, bubble interaction, ambient flow field, gravity, bubble migration, fluid compressibility, viscosity, and surface tension while maintaining a unified and elegant mathematical form. The present theory unifies different classical bubble equations such as the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, the Gilmore equation, and the Keller-Miksis equation. Furthermore, we validated the theory with experimental data of bubbles with a variety in scales, sources, boundaries, and ambient conditions and showed the advantages of our theory over the classical theoretical models, followed by a discussion on the applicability of the present theory based on a comparison to simulation results with different numerical methods. Finally, as a demonstration of the potential of our theory, we modeled the complex multi-cycle bubble interaction with wide ranges of energy and phase differences and gained new physical insights into inter-bubble energy transfer and coupling of bubble-induced pressure waves.</description>

      <title>Inertia induces strong orientation fluctuations of non-spherical atmospheric particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orientation of non-spherical particles in the atmosphere, such as volcanic ash and ice crystals, influences their residence times, and the radiative properties of the atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that the orientation of heavy submillimeter spheroids settling in still air exhibits decaying oscillations, whereas it relaxes monotonically in liquids. Theoretical analysis shows that these oscillations are due to particle inertia, caused by the large particle-fluid mass-density ratio. This effect must be accounted for to model solid particles in the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Structure and energy transfer in homogeneous turbulence below a free surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the turbulence below a quasi-flat free surface, focusing on the energy transport in space and across scales. We leverage a large zero-mean-flow tank where homogeneous turbulence is generated by randomly actuated jets. A wide range of Reynolds number is spanned, reaching sufficient scale separation for the emergence of an inertial sub-range. Unlike previous studies, the forcing extends through the source layer, though the surface deformation remains millimetric. Particle image velocimetry along a surface-normal plane resolves from the dissipative to the integral scales. The contributions to turbulent kinetic energy from both vertical and horizontal components of velocity approach the prediction based on rapid distortion theory as the Reynolds number is increased, indicating that discrepancies among previous studies are likely due to differences in the forcing. At odds with the theory, however, the integral scale of the horizontal fluctuations grows as the surface is approached. This is rooted in the profound influence exerted by the surface on the inter-scale energy transfer: along horizontal separations, the direct cascade of energy in horizontal fluctuations is hindered, while an inverse cascade of that in vertical fluctuations is established. This is connected to the structure of upwellings and downwellings. The former, characterized by somewhat larger spatial extent and stronger intensity, are associated to extensional surface-parallel motions. They thus transfer energy to the larger horizontal scales, prevailing over downwellings which favour the compression (and concurrent vertical stretching) of the eddies. Both types of structures extend to depths between the integral and Taylor microscales.</description>

Abstract: Multiphase flows are an important class of fluid flow and their study facilitates the development of diverse applications in industrial, natural and biomedical systems. Simulating such flows requires significant computational resources, making it prudent to devise an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method to mitigate this burden. We use a mathematical model that takes a continuum mechanical approach to describe multiphase mixture flows. The resulting system of equations poses numerical challenges due to the presence of multiple non-linear terms and a co-incompressibility condition, while the resulting fluid dynamics necessitate the development of an adaptive mesh refinement technique to accurately capture regions of interest while keeping computational costs low. We present an accurate, robust, and efficient computational method for simulating multiphase mixtures on adaptive grids, and utilize a multigrid solver to precondition the saddle-point system. We demonstrate that the AMR solver asymptotically approaches second order accuracy in $L^1$, $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms for all solution variables of the Newtonian and non-Newtonian models. All experiments demonstrate the solver is stable provided the time step size satisfies the imposed CFL condition. The solver can accurately resolve sharp gradients in the solution and, with the multigrid preconditioner, the solver behavior is independent of grid spacing. Our AMR solver offers a major cost savings benefit, providing up to 10x speedup in the numerical experiments presented here, with greater speedup possible depending on the problem set-up.</description>

Abstract: In the rapidly rotating limit, we derive a balanced set of reduced equations governing the strongly nonlinear development of the convective wall-mode instability in the interior of a general container. The model illustrates that wall-mode convection is a multiscale phenomenon where the dynamics of the bulk interior diagnostically determine the small-scale dynamics within Stewartson boundary layers at the sidewalls. The sidewall boundary layers feedback on the interior via a nonlinear lateral heat-flux boundary condition, providing a closed system. Outside the asymptotically thin boundary layer, the convective modes connect to a dynamical interior that maintains scales set by the domain geometry. In many ways, the final system of equations resembles boundary-forced planetary geostrophic baroclinic dynamics coupled with barotropic quasi-geostrophic vorticity. The reduced system contains the results from previous linear instability theory but captured in an elementary fashion, providing a new avenue for investigating wall-mode convection in the strongly nonlinear regime. We also derive the dominant Ekman-flux correction to the onset Rayleigh number for large Taylor number, Ra ~ 31.8 Ta^(1/2) - 4.43 Ta^(5/12) for no-slip boundaries. We demonstrate some of the reduced model's nonlinear dynamics with numerical simulations in a cylindrical container.</description>
