      <title>Poromechanical solution for one-dimensional large strain consolidation of modified cam clay soil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical model describing the one-dimensional large strain consolidation of the modified Cam Clay soil is presented in this paper. The model is based on the Lagrangian formulation, and is capable of featuring the variability of soil compressibility (inherently so due to the direct incorporation of the specific Cam Clay plasticity model) and permeability, as well as the impact of overconsolidation ratio. The derivation starts from the establishment of the incremental stress-strain relations for both purely elastic and elastoplastic deformations under one-dimensional compression condition, and thereafter the coefficients of compressibility/volume change that are essential to the consolidation analysis. The governing partial differential equation is then neatly deduced in conjunction with the continuity and equilibrium conditions for the soil, with the vertical effective stress being the privileged unknown to be solved for. Subsequently, semi-analytical solution to the developed rigorous poroelastoplastic large strain consolidation model is obtained and verified with the ABAQUS finite element numerical results. Parametric analyses are finally provided to investigate in detail the influences of the soil overconsolidation ratio, large strain configuration, and the variability of the soil permeability on the calculated one-dimensional consolidation response.</description>

      <title>How does surface wettability alter salt precipitation and growth dynamics during CO$_2$ injection into saline aquifers: A microfluidic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Salt precipitation triggered by the evaporation of formation brine into injected supercritical CO2 can cause injectivity and containment issues in near-wellbore regions. Predicting the distribution of precipitated salts and their impact on near-wellbore properties remains challenging. This study investigates the influence of surface wettability on CO2-induced halite precipitation and growth within hydrophilic and hydrophobic microfluidic chips designed to mimic rock-structure porous geometries. A series of high-pressure brine-CO2 flow experiments, direct microscopic observations, and detailed image processing were conducted to explore how substrate wettability affects salt precipitation. The experiments show that wettability markedly controls residual brine relocation, film flow movement, solute consumption, and salt formation. Tracking halite precipitation dynamics revealed distinct crystal formation signatures: hydrophilic chips exhibited irregular, larger aggregation patches, while the hydrophobic network showed more numerous, smaller, and limited aggregations. Large individual crystals were observed in both chips, with a notable dominance in the hydrophobic one. Crystallization dynamics varied, with nucleation and growth occurring earlier, progressing faster, and forming bulkier aggregates in the hydrophilic chip. Despite these differences, the three identified temporal stages of brine evaporation and halite surface coverage were comparable. Spatial analysis along the chips indicated that crystal aggregation properties, such as size and distribution, were position-dependent, with hydrophilic chips exhibiting greater probabilistic variability. These observations underscore the impact of surface wettability on salt precipitation through brine accessibility and capillarity, with implications for mitigating and remediating salt issues in saline aquifers.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Model for Induced Seismicity at the Geothermal Systems: A Case of the Geysers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Induced seismicity has emerged as a source of a significant earthquake hazard associated with recent development of unconventional energy resources. Therefore, it is imperative to develop stochastic models that can accurately describe the observed seismicity rate and forecast its evolution. In this study, a mechanism suggested by linear response theory is incorporated into a stochastic earthquake model to account for changes in the seismicity rate. It is derived that the induced rate can be modelled as a convolution of the forcing, related to fluid injection operations, and a specific response kernel. The model is incorporated into a Bayesian framework to compute the probabilities for the occurrence of the largest expected events during future time intervals. The applicability of the model is illustrated by analyzing the injection and seismicity data at the Geysers geothermal field in California. The suggested approach provides further insight into the probabilistic assessment of earthquake hazard associated with fluid injection operations. It also can be used for probing the rheological properties of the subsurface by analysing the inherent characteristic time-scales associated with the subsurface response to external forcing.</description>

      <title>High-resolution borehole earthquake monitoring at San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth, Parkfield, California</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downhole earthquake monitoring, without the complex effects from the near surface, can record more and better seismic data than monitoring on surface. The San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) is a borehole observatory equipped with different instruments inside to study the earthquake mechanism of the San Andreas fault at Parkfield, California. During April to May in 2005, Paulsson deployed an 80-level 3-component geophone array in the SAFOD main hole, and continuously recorded seismic data for about 13 days. We located 125 local earthquakes from the borehole earthquake monitoring data using a homogeneous velocity model and compared it with 35 earthquakes' locations from surface earthquake monitoring by the United State Geological Survey (USGS) during the same monitoring time. The borehole earthquake locating is assumably more accurate in the borehole's vicinity. We also compared the result with 1,074 earthquakes' locations from the surface earthquake monitoring in the last 9 years from 2015 to 2024. The hypocenters from our nearly 2 weeks' borehole earthquake monitoring form similar structures as that from the 9 years' surface earthquake monitoring by the USGS.</description>

      <title>An Attention-Based Algorithm for Gravity Adaptation Zone Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate calibration of gravity adaptation zones is of great significance in fields such as underwater navigation, geophysical exploration, and marine engineering. With the increasing application of gravity field data in these areas, traditional calibration methods based on single features are becoming inadequate for capturing the complex characteristics of gravity fields and addressing the intricate interrelationships among multidimensional data. This paper proposes an attention-enhanced algorithm for gravity adaptation zone calibration. By introducing an attention mechanism, the algorithm adaptively fuses multidimensional gravity field features and dynamically assigns feature weights, effectively solving the problems of multicollinearity and redundancy inherent in traditional feature selection methods, significantly improving calibration accuracy and robustness.In addition, a large-scale gravity field dataset with over 10,000 sampling points was constructed, and Kriging interpolation was used to enhance the spatial resolution of the data, providing a reliable data foundation for model training and evaluation. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative experiments on several classical machine learning models (such as SVM, GBDT, and RF), and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves performance across these models, outperforming other traditional feature selection methods. The method proposed in this paper provides a new solution for gravity adaptation zone calibration, showing strong generalization ability and potential for application in complex environments.

      <title>Dynamics of Chemical Orders in Formation of Striped Patterns in Metamorphic Rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The striped patterns in rocks, characterized by thin dark bands and thick light bands, are a result of the natural processes that have shaped the rocks through in situ metamorphism. Notably, the dark and light bands are composed of similar minerals, with the dark bands containing additional trapped materials such as fluid pockets or extra mineral grains. Here we employed the Gray-Scott Reaction Diffusion model to investigate the interaction between two sets of virtual chemicals, denoted as 'u' and 'v'. The differing diffusion and reaction rates of 'u' and 'v' chemical orders lead to the formation of 180 degree out-of-phase chemical domains, resulting in striped patterns. Utilizing the Gray-Scott model in this manner, we gain valuable insights into the early microscopic stages of these geologically significant striped patterns in metamorphic rocks.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically driven by buoyancy and strongly constrained at large scales by planetary rotation. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation rates (Ekman numbers $Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are orders of magnitude smaller. On the other hand, previously derived reduced equations of motion describing the leading-order behaviour in the limit of very rapid rotation ($Ek\to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, and the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $Ek$ has remained elusive. Here, we employ the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE) -- a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to 0$, recently introduced by Julien et al. (2024) -- to provide full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $Ek=10^{-15}$ and below, revealing the disappearance of cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry at previously unattainable Ekman numbers ($Ek \approx 10^{-9}$). We also identify an overshoot in the heat transport as $Ek$ is varied at fixed $\widetilde{Ra}= Ra Ek^{4/3}$, associated with dissipation due to ageostrophic motions in the boundary layers. The simulations validate theoretical predictions based on thermal boundary layer theory for RRRBC and show that the solutions of RiNSE agree with the reduced equations at very small $Ek$. These results represent a first foray into the vast, largely unexplored parameter space of very rapidly rotating convection rendered accessible by RiNSE.</description>
