      <title>Computation of leaky waves in layered structures coupled to unbounded media by exploiting multiparameter eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-analytical approach to compute quasi-guided elastic wave modes in horizontally layered structures radiating into unbounded fluid or solid media. This problem is of relevance, e.g., for the simulation of guided ultrasound in embedded plate structures or seismic waves in soil layers over an elastic half-space. We employ a semi-analytical formulation to describe the layers, thus discretizing the thickness direction by means of finite elements. For a free layer, this technique leads to a well-known quadratic eigenvalue problem for the mode shapes and corresponding horizontal wavenumbers. Rigorously incorporating the coupling conditions to account for the adjacent half-spaces gives rise to additional terms that are nonlinear in the wavenumber. We show that the resulting nonlinear eigenvalue problem can be cast in the form of a multiparameter eigenvalue problem whose solutions represent the wave numbers in the plate and in the half-spaces. The multiparameter eigenvalue problem is solved numerically using recently developed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Cell agglomeration strategy for cut cells in eXtended discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a cell agglomeration strategy for the cut cells arising in the extended discontinuous Galerkin (XDG) method is presented. Cut cells are a fundamental aspect of unfitted mesh approaches where complex geometries or interfaces separating sub-domains are embedded into Cartesian background grids to facilitate the mesh generation process. In such methods, arbitrary small cells occur due to the intersections of background cells with embedded geometries and lead to discretization difficulties due to their diminutive sizes. Furthermore, temporal evolutions of these geometries may lead to topological changes across different time steps. Both of these issues, i.e., small-cut cells and topological changes, can be addressed with a cell agglomeration technique. In this work, a comprehensive strategy for the typical issues associated with cell agglomeration in three-dimensional and multiprocessor simulations is provided. The proposed strategy is implemented into the open-source software package BoSSS and tested with 2- and 3-dimensional simulations of immersed boundary flows.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonalization is one of few mathematical methods conforming to mathematical standards for approximation. Finding a consistent PC matrix of a given an inconsistent PC matrix is the main goal of a pairwise comparisons method. We introduce an orthogonalization for pairwise comparisons matrix based on a generalized Frobenius inner matrix product. The proposed theory is supported by numerous examples and visualizations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid weakly over-penalised symmetric interior penalty method on anisotropic meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a hybrid-type anisotropic weakly over-penalised symmetric interior penalty method for the Poisson equation on convex domains. Compared with the well-known hybrid discontinuous Galerkin methods, our approach is simple and easy to implement. Our primary contributions are the proposal of a new scheme and the demonstration of a proof for the consistency term, which allows us to estimate the anisotropic consistency error. The key idea of the proof is to apply the relation between the Raviart--Thomas finite element space and a discontinuous space. In numerical experiments, we compare the calculation results for standard and anisotropic mesh partitions.</description>

      <title>A new modified highly accurate Laplace-Fourier method for linear neutral delay differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a new modified Laplace-Fourier method is developed in order to obtain the solutions of linear neutral delay differential equations. The proposed method provides a more accurate solution than the one provided by the pure Laplace method and the original Laplace-Fourier method. We develop and show the crucial modifications of the Laplace-Fourier method. As with the original Laplace-Fourier method, the new modified method combines the Laplace transform method with Fourier series theory. All of the beneficial features from the original Laplace-Fourier method are retained. The modified solution still includes a component that accounts for the terms in the tail of the infinite series, allowing one to obtain more accurate solutions. The Laplace-Fourier method requires us to approximate the formula for the residues with an asymptotic expansion. This is essential to enable us to use the Fourier series results that enable us to account for the tail. The improvement is achieved by deriving a new asymptotic expansion which minimizes the error between the actual residues and those which are obtained from this asymptotic expansion. With both the pure Laplace and improved Laplace-Fourier methods increasing the number of terms in the truncated series obviously increases the accuracy. However, with the pure Laplace, this improvement is small. As we shall show, with the improved Laplace-Fourier method the improvement is significantly larger. We show that the convergence rate of the new modified Laplace-Fourier solution has a remarkable order of convergence $O(N^{-3})$. The validity of the modified technique is corroborated by means of illustrative examples. Comparisons of the solutions of the new modified method with those generated by the pure Laplace method and the original/unmodified Laplace-Fourier approach are presented.</description>

      <title>Maximum Discrepancy Generative Regularization and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Single Channel Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of adversarial learning of regularization functionals has recently been introduced in the wider context of inverse problems. The intuition behind this method is the realization that it is not only necessary to learn the basic features that make up a class of signals one wants to represent, but also, or even more so, which features to avoid in the representation. In this paper, we will apply this approach to the training of generative models, leading to what we call Maximum Discrepancy Generative Regularization. In particular, we apply this to problem of source separation by means of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and present a new method for the adversarial training of NMF bases. We show in numerical experiments, both for image and audio separation, that this leads to a clear improvement of the reconstructed signals, in particular in the case where little or no strong supervision data is available.</description>

      <title>On the implementation in Abaqus of the global--local iterative coupling and acceleration techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents results and convergence study of the Global--Local Iterative Coupling through the implementation in the commercial software Abaqus making use of the co-simulation engine. A hierarchical modeling and simulation approach is often required to alleviate modeling burdens. Particular focus has been devoted here on convergence acceleration and performance optimization. Two applications in statics with nonlinear material behavior and geometrically nonlinear formulation are considered here: first a holed curved plate under traction with elastic--plastic material, then a pre-stressed bolted joint connecting two plates between each other and subjected to traction load. Three different convergence acceleration techniques are compared in terms of convergence performance and accuracy. An inexact solver strategy is proposed to improve computing time performance. The results show promising results for the coupling technology and constitute a step forward in the availability of non-intrusive multi-scale modeling capabilities for complex structures and assemblies.</description>

      <title>Variationally consistent Hamiltonian model reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though ubiquitous as first-principles models for conservative phenomena, Hamiltonian systems present numerous challenges for model reduction even in relatively simple, linear cases. Here, we present a method for the projection-based model reduction of canonical Hamiltonian systems that is variationally consistent for any choice of linear reduced basis: Hamiltonian models project to Hamiltonian models. Applicable in both intrusive and nonintrusive settings, the proposed method is energy-conserving and symplectic, with error provably decomposable into a data projection term and a term measuring deviation from canonical form. Examples from linear elasticity with realistic material parameters are used to demonstrate the advantages of a variationally consistent approach, highlighting the steady convergence exhibited by consistent models where previous methods reliant on inconsistent techniques or specially designed bases exhibit unacceptably large errors.</description>

      <title>A phase-field fracture model in thermo-poro-elastic media with micromechanical strain energy degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the hydro-mechanical phase-field fracture model to non-isothermal conditions with micromechanics based poroelasticity, which degrades Biot's coefficient not only with the phase-field variable (damage) but also with the energy decomposition scheme. Furthermore, we propose a new approach to update porosity solely determined by the strain change rather than damage evolution as in the existing models. As such, these poroelastic behaviors of Biot's coefficient and the porosity dictate Biot's modulus and the thermal expansion coefficient. For numerical implementation, we employ an isotropic diffusion method to stabilize the advection-dominated heat flux and adapt the fixed stress split method to account for the thermal stress. We verify our model against a series of analytical solutions such as Terzaghi's consolidation, thermal consolidation, and the plane strain hydraulic fracture propagation, known as the KGD fracture. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the stabilization method and intricate thermo-hydro-mechanical interactions during hydraulic fracturing with and without a pre-existing weak interface.</description>

      <title>Annealing approach to root-finding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Newton-Raphson method stands as the {\it ur}-root-finding technique. In this study, we propose a parameterized variant of the Newton-Raphson method, inspired by principles from physics. Through analytical and empirical validation, we demonstrate that this novel approach offers increased robustness and faster convergence during root-finding iterations. Furthermore, we establish connections to the Adomian series method and provide a natural interpretation within a series framework. Remarkably, the introduced parameter, akin to a temperature variable, enables an annealing approach. This advancement sets the stage for a fresh exploration of numerical iterative root-finding methodologies.</description>

      <title>Spatially dependent node regularity in meshless approximation of partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a way to reduce the total computational cost of meshless approximation by reducing the required stencil size through spatially varying computational node regularity. Rather than covering the entire domain with scattered nodes, only regions with geometric details are covered with scattered nodes, while the rest of the domain is discretized with regular nodes. A simpler approximation can be used in regions covered by regular nodes, effectively reducing the required stencil size and computational cost compared to the approximation on scattered nodes where a set of polyharmonic splines is added to ensure convergent behaviour.
  This paper is an extended version of conference paper entitled "Spatially-varying meshless approximation method for enhanced computational efficiency" [arXiv:2303.01760] presented at "International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS) 2023". The paper is extended with discussion on development and implementation of a hybrid regular-scattered node positioning algorithm (HyNP). The performance of the proposed HyNP algorithm is analysed in terms of separation distance and maximal empty sphere radius. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that HyNP nodes can be used for solving problems from fluid flow and linear elasticity, both in 2D and 3D, using meshless methods. The extension also provides additional analyses of computational efficiency and accuracy of the numerical solution obtained on the spatially-variable regularity of discretization nodes. In particular, different levels of refinement aggressiveness and scattered layer widths are considered to exploit the computational efficiency gains offered by such solution procedure.</description>

      <title>Determinants and Inverses of $k$-diagonal Toeplitz Matrices Are Periodic over F_p</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents explicit formulas and algorithms for the determinants and inverses of $k$-diagonal Toeplitz matrices. We have achieved a computational complexity of $O(k^3 \log n+k^5)+kn^2$ for their inverses. By considering the general case of $k$, we ensure versatility while remaining explicit and efficient compared to other algorithms. Furthermore, thanks to methodological innovation, we discovered that the determinants and inverses of $k$-diagonal Toeplitz matrices exhibit periodicity over finite fields. Over $\mathbb{F}_p$, the inverses of $n$th-ordered $k$-diagonal Toeplitz matrices can be solved in $O(k^3 \log c+k^3 \log p+k^5)+3kc^2$ where $c$ is the period. This complexity is independent of $n$ and therefore makes the computation of $k$-diagonal Toeplitz matrices over $\mathbb{F}_p$ effortless.</description>

      <title>High-accurate and efficient numerical algorithms for the self-consistent field theory of liquid-crystalline polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and investigate numerical methods for the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) of liquid crystalline polymers. Both the Flory-Huggins interaction potential and the Maier-Saupe orientational interaction are considered, enabling simultaneous exploration of microphase separation and liquid crystalline order in these systems. The main challenge in numerically solving this complex system lies in solving 6-dimensional (3D spatial + 2D orientation + 1D time) partial differential equations and performing nonlinear iterations to optimize the fields. We present ten numerical algorithms for solving high-dimensional PDEs and give an evaluation criterion of choosing the most appropriate PDE solver both from theoretical and numerical performance. Results demonstrate that coupling the fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme with Fourier pseudo-spectral methods and spherical harmonic transformations is superior compared to other algorithms. We develop two nonlinear iteration schemes, alternating direction iteration method and Anderson mixing method, and design an adaptive technique to enhance the stability of the Anderson mixing method. Moreover, the cascadic multi-level (CML) technique further accelerates the SCFT computation when applied to these iteration methods. Meanwhile, an approach to optimize the computational domain is developed. To demonstrate the power of our approaches, we investigate the self-assembled behaviors of flexible-semiflexible diblock copolymers in 4,5,6-dimensional simulations. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of our proposed method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel strategy is proposed for the coupling of field and circuit equations when modeling power devices in the low-frequency regime. The resulting systems of differential-algebraic equations have a particular geometric structure which explicitly encodes the energy storage, dissipation, and transfer mechanisms. This implies a power balance on the continuous level which can be preserved under appropriate discretization in space and time. The models and main results are presented in detail for linear constitutive models, but the extension to nonlinear elements and more general coupling mechanisms is possible. The theoretical findings are demonstrated by numerical results.</description>

      <title>Reducing polynomial degree by one for inner-stage operators affects neither stability nor accuracy of the Runge--Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Runge--Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is a mainstream numerical algorithm for solving hyperbolic equations. In this paper, we use the linear advection equation in one and two dimensions as a model problem to prove the following results: For an arbitrarily high-order RKDG scheme in Butcher form, as long as we use the $P^k$ approximation in the final stage, even if we drop the $k$th-order polynomial modes and use the $P^{k-1}$ approximation for the DG operators at all inner RK stages, the resulting numerical method still maintains the same type of stability and convergence rate as those of the original RKDG method. Numerical examples are provided to validate the analysis. The numerical method analyzed in this paper is a special case of the Class A RKDG method with stage-dependent polynomial spaces proposed in arXiv:2402.15150. Our analysis provides theoretical justifications for employing cost-effective and low-order spatial discretization at specific RK stages for developing more efficient DG schemes without affecting stability and accuracy of the original method.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Particle Filters for Partially Observed McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the filtering problem associated to partially observed McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The model consists of data that are observed at regular and discrete times and the objective is to compute the conditional expectation of (functionals) of the solutions of the SDE at the current time. This problem, even the ordinary SDE case is challenging and requires numerical approximations. Based upon the ideas in [3, 12] we develop a new particle filter (PF) and multilevel particle filter (MLPF) to approximate the afore-mentioned expectations. We prove under assumptions that, for $\epsilon&gt;0$, to obtain a mean square error of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ the PF has a cost per-observation time of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-5})$ and the MLPF costs $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ (best case) or $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4}\log(\epsilon)^2)$ (worst case). Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A new framework of high-order unfitted finite element methods using ALE maps for moving-domain problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a sequel to our previous work [C. Ma, Q. Zhang and W. Zheng, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 60 (2022)], [C. Ma and W. Zheng, J. Comput. Phys. 469 (2022)], this paper presents a generic framework of arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian unfitted finite element (ALE-UFE) methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) on time-varying domains. The ALE-UFE method has a great potential in developing high-order unfitted finite element methods. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by a variety of moving-domain problems, including a linear problem with explicit velocity of the boundary (or interface), a PDE-domain coupled problem, and a problem whose domain has a topological change. Numerical experiments show that optimal convergence is achieved by both third- and fourth-order methods on domains with smooth boundaries, but is deteriorated to the second order when the domain has topological changes.</description>

      <title>Two one-parameter families of nonconforming enrichments of the Crouzeix-Raviart finite element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two one-parameter families of quadratic polynomial enrichments designed to enhance the accuracy of the classical Crouzeix--Raviart finite element. These enrichments are realized by using weighted line integrals as enriched linear functionals and quadratic polynomial functions as enrichment functions. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct numerical experiments that confirm the improvement achieved by the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A least squares approach to Whitney forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we describe and test the construction of least squares Whitney forms based on weights. If, on the one hand, the relevance of such a family of differential forms is nowadays clear in numerical analysis, on the other hand the selection of performing sets of supports (hence of weights) for projecting onto high order Whitney forms turns often to be a rough task. As an account of this, it is worth mentioning that Runge-like phenomena have been observed but still not resolved completely. We hence move away from sharp results on unisolvence and consider a least squares approach, obtaining results that are consistent with the nodal literature and making some steps towards the resolution of the aforementioned Runge phenomenon for high order Whitney forms.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the SINDy approach with nested neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a widely studied field of research that aims to infer symbolic expressions from data. A popular approach for SR is the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (\sindy) framework, which uses sparse regression to identify governing equations from data. This study introduces an enhanced method, Nested SINDy, that aims to increase the expressivity of the SINDy approach thanks to a nested structure. Indeed, traditional symbolic regression and system identification methods often fail with complex systems that cannot be easily described analytically. Nested SINDy builds on the SINDy framework by introducing additional layers before and after the core SINDy layer. This allows the method to identify symbolic representations for a wider range of systems, including those with compositions and products of functions. We demonstrate the ability of the Nested SINDy approach to accurately find symbolic expressions for simple systems, such as basic trigonometric functions, and sparse (false but accurate) analytical representations for more complex systems. Our results highlight Nested SINDy's potential as a tool for symbolic regression, surpassing the traditional SINDy approach in terms of expressivity. However, we also note the challenges in the optimization process for Nested SINDy and suggest future research directions, including the designing of a more robust methodology for the optimization process. This study proves that Nested SINDy can effectively discover symbolic representations of dynamical systems from data, offering new opportunities for understanding complex systems through data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Error estimates of a regularized finite difference method for the Logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation with Dirac delta potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a conservative Crank-Nicolson-type finite difference schemes for the regularized logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation (RLSE) with Dirac delta potential in 1D. The regularized logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a small regularized parameter $0&lt;\eps \ll 1$ is adopted to approximate the logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation (LSE) with linear convergence rate $O(\eps)$. The numerical method can be used to avoid numerical blow-up and/or to suppress round-off error due to the logarithmic nonlinearity in LSE. Then, by using domain-decomposition technique, we can transform the original problem into an interface problem. Different treatments on the interface conditions lead to different discrete schemes and it turns out that a simple discrete approximation of the Dirac potential coincides with one of the conservative finite difference schemes. The optimal $H^1$ error estimates and the conservative properties of the finite difference schemes are investigated. The Crank-Nicolson finite difference methods enjoy the second-order convergence rate in time and space. Numerical examples are provided to support our analysis and show the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical method.</description>

      <title>Adapted Lie splitting method for convection-diffusion problems with singular convective term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Splitting methods are a widely used numerical scheme for solving convection-diffusion problems. However, they may lose stability in some situations, particularly when applied to convection-diffusion problems in the presence of an unbounded convective term. In this paper, we propose a new splitting method, called the "Adapted Lie splitting method", which successfully overcomes the observed instability in certain cases. Assuming that the unbounded coefficient belongs to a suitable Lorentz space, we show that the adapted Lie splitting converges to first-order under the analytic semigroup framework. Furthermore, we provide numerical experiments to illustrate our newly proposed splitting approach.</description>

      <title>Elevating Spectral GNNs through Enhanced Band-pass Filter Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted great attention due to their capacity to capture patterns in the frequency domains with essential graph filters. Polynomial-based ones (namely poly-GNNs), which approximately construct graph filters with conventional or rational polynomials, are routinely adopted in practice for their substantial performances on graph learning tasks. However, previous poly-GNNs aim at achieving overall lower approximation error on different types of filters, e.g., low-pass and high-pass, but ignore a key question: \textit{which type of filter warrants greater attention for poly-GNNs?} In this paper, we first show that poly-GNN with a better approximation for band-pass graph filters performs better on graph learning tasks. This insight further sheds light on critical issues of existing poly-GNNs, i.e., those poly-GNNs achieve trivial performance in approximating band-pass graph filters, hindering the great potential of poly-GNNs. To tackle the issues, we propose a novel poly-GNN named TrigoNet. TrigoNet constructs different graph filters with novel trigonometric polynomial, and achieves leading performance in approximating band-pass graph filters against other polynomials. By applying Taylor expansion and deserting nonlinearity, TrigoNet achieves noticeable efficiency among baselines. Extensive experiments show the advantages of TrigoNet in both accuracy performances and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are prevalent in numerous scientific and engineering disciplines, where the objective is to determine unknown parameters within a physical system using indirect measurements or observations. The inherent challenge lies in deducing the most probable parameter values that align with the collected data. This study introduces an algorithm for reconstructing parameters by addressing an inverse problem formulated through differential equations underpinned by uncertain boundary conditions or variant parameters. We adopt a Bayesian approach for parameter inference, delineating the establishment of prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions, and the subsequent resolution of the maximum a posteriori problem via numerical optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm is applied to the task of magnetic field reconstruction within a conical domain, demonstrating precise recovery of the true parameter values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) plays a pivotal role in describing the dynamics of plasma and conductive fluids, essential for understanding phenomena such as the structure and evolution of stars and galaxies, and in nuclear fusion for plasma motion through ideal MHD equations. Solving these hyperbolic PDEs requires sophisticated numerical methods, presenting computational challenges due to complex structures and high costs. Recent advances introduce neural operators like the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) as surrogate models for traditional numerical analyses. This study explores a modified Flux Fourier neural operator model to approximate the numerical flux of ideal MHD, offering a novel approach that outperforms existing neural operator models by enabling continuous inference, generalization outside sampled distributions, and faster computation compared to classical numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of Ergodic Dynamics in Unique Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) constitutes a highly dynamic subarea within computational complexity theory, intricately linked to the outstanding P versus NP problem. Despite multiple insightful results in the past few years, a proof for the conjecture remains elusive. In this work, we construct a novel dynamical systems-based approach for studying unique games and, more generally, the field of computational complexity. We propose a family of dynamical systems whose equilibria correspond to solutions of unique games and prove that unsatisfiable instances lead to ergodic dynamics. Moreover, as the instance hardness increases, the weight of the invariant measure in the vicinity of the optimal assignments scales polynomially, sub-exponentially, or exponentially depending on the value gap. We numerically reproduce a previously hypothesized hardness plot associated with the UGC. Our results indicate that the UGC is likely true, subject to our proposed conjectures that link dynamical systems theory with computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Quinpi: Integrating stiff hyperbolic systems with implicit high order finite volume schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many interesting physical problems described by systems of hyperbolic conservation laws are stiff, and thus impose a very small time-step because of the restrictive CFL stability condition. In this case, one can exploit the superior stability properties of implicit time integration which allows to choose the time-step only from accuracy requirements, and thus avoid the use of small time-steps. We discuss an efficient framework to devise high order implicit schemes for stiff hyperbolic systems without tailoring it to a specific problem. The nonlinearity of high order schemes, due to space- and time-limiting procedures which control nonphysical oscillations, makes the implicit time integration difficult, e.g.~because the discrete system is nonlinear also on linear problems. This nonlinearity of the scheme is circumvented as proposed in (Puppo et al., Comm.~Appl.~Math.~\&amp; Comput., 2023) for scalar conservation laws, where a first order implicit predictor is computed to freeze the nonlinear coefficients of the essentially non-oscillatory space reconstruction, and also to assist limiting in time. In addition, we propose a novel conservative flux-centered a-posteriori time-limiting procedure using numerical entropy indicators to detect troubled cells. The numerical tests involve classical and artificially devised stiff problems using the Euler's system of gas-dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We propose new linear combinations of compositions of a basic second-order scheme with appropriately chosen coefficients to construct higher order numerical integrators for differential equations. They can be considered as a generalization of extrapolation methods and multi-product expansions. A general analysis is provided and new methods up to order 8 are built and tested. The new approach is shown to reduce the latency problem when implemented in a parallel environment and leads to schemes that are significantly more efficient than standard extrapolation when the linear combination is delayed by a number of steps.</description>

Abstract: We consider fully discrete finite element approximations for a semilinear optimal control system of partial differential equations in two cases: for distributed and Robin boundary control. The ecological predator-prey optimal control model is approximated by conforming finite element methods mimicking the spatial part, while a discontinuous Galerkin method is used for the time discretization. We investigate the sensitivity of the solution distance from the target function, in cases with smooth and rough initial data. We employ low, and higher-order polynomials in time and space whenever proper regularity is present. The approximation schemes considered are with and without control constraints, driving efficiently the system to desired states realized using non-linear gradient methods.</description>

      <title>An Energy Stable High-Order Cut Cell Discontinuous Galerkin Method with State Redistribution for Wave Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cut meshes are a type of mesh that is formed by allowing embedded boundaries to "cut" a simple underlying mesh resulting in a hybrid mesh of cut and standard elements. While cut meshes can allow complex boundaries to be represented well regardless of the mesh resolution, their arbitrarily shaped and sized cut elements can present issues such as the small cell problem, where small cut elements can result in a severely restricted CFL condition. State redistribution, a technique developed by Berger and Giuliani [1], can be used to address the small cell problem. In this work, we pair state redistribution with a high-order discontinuous Galerkin scheme that is $L_2$ energy stable for arbitrary quadrature. We prove that state redistribution can be added to a provably $L_2$ energy stable discontinuous Galerkin method on a cut mesh without damaging the scheme's $L_2$ stability. We numerically verify the high order accuracy and stability of our scheme on two-dimensional wave propagation problems.</description>

      <title>The alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm for finding the best approximation pair for two disjoint intersections of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two nonempty and disjoint intersections of closed and convex subsets, we look for a best approximation pair relative to them, i.e., a pair of points, one in each intersection, attaining the minimum distance between the disjoint intersections. We propose an iterative process based on projections onto the subsets which generate the intersections. The process is inspired by the Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm and the classical alternating process of Cheney and Goldstein, and its advantage is that there is no need to project onto the intersections themselves, a task which can be rather demanding. We prove that under certain conditions the two interlaced subsequences converge to a best approximation pair. These conditions hold, in particular, when the space is Euclidean and the subsets which generate the intersections are compact and strictly convex. Our result extends the one of Aharoni, Censor and Jiang ["Finding a best approximation pair of points for two polyhedra", Computational Optimization and Applications 71 (2018), 509--523] who considered the case of finite-dimensional polyhedra.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Fokker-Planck equation via Schrodingerization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a quantum simulation technique for solving the Fokker-Planck equation. Traditional semi-discretization methods often fail to preserve the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics and may even modify the Hamiltonian structure, particularly when incorporating boundary conditions. We address this challenge by employing the Schrodingerization method-it converts any linear partial and ordinary differential equation with non-Hermitian dynamics into systems of Schrodinger-type equations. We explore the application in two distinct forms of the Fokker-Planck equation. For the conservation form, we show that the semi-discretization-based Schrodingerization is preferable, especially when dealing with non-periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, we analyze the Schrodingerization approach for unstable systems that possess positive eigenvalues in the real part of the coefficient matrix or differential operator. Our analysis reveals that the direct use of Schrodingerization has the same effect as a stabilization procedure. For the heat equation form, we propose a quantum simulation procedure based on the time-splitting technique. We discuss the relationship between operator splitting in the Schrodingerization method and its application directly to the original problem, illustrating how the Schrodingerization method accurately reproduces the time-splitting solutions at each step. Furthermore, we explore finite difference discretizations of the heat equation form using shift operators. Utilizing Fourier bases, we diagonalize the shift operators, enabling efficient simulation in the frequency space. Providing additional guidance on implementing the diagonal unitary operators, we conduct a comparative analysis between diagonalizations in the Bell and the Fourier bases, and show that the former generally exhibits greater efficiency than the latter.</description>

      <title>Quenching of stable pulses in slow-fast excitable media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop linear theory for the prediction of excitation wave quenching--the construction of minimal perturbations which return stable excitations to quiescence--for localized pulse solutions of models of excitable media. The theory requires accounting for an additional degree of freedom in the formulation of the linear theory, and a reconsideration of heuristics for choosing optimal reference states from their group representation. We compare the predictions made with the linear theory to direct numerical simulations across a family of perturbations and assess the accuracy of predictions for models with distinct stable excitation structures. We find that the theory achieves qualitative predictive power with only the effort of distinguishing a root from the asymptotic case, and achieves quantitative predictive power in many circumstances. Finally, we compare the computational cost of our prediction technique to other numerical methods for the determination of transitions in extended excitable systems.</description>
