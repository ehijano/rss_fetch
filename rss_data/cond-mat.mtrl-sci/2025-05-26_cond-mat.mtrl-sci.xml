      <title>Engineering Altermagnetism via Layer Shifts and Spin Order in Bilayer MnPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how stacking configuration and magnetic ordering determine the magnetic phases of bilayer MnPS$_3$, using density-functional theory and spin-Laue symmetry analysis. While monolayer MnPS$_3$ is a collinear antiferromagnet with no spin splitting, our calculations show that the bilayer can host either Type II (AFM) or Type III (altermagnetic) phases depending sensitively on stacking and spin alignment. We focus on two representative stackings: AA, where the top layer sits directly above the bottom one, and AA$^\prime$, its inversion-symmetric counterpart obtained by reflecting one layer about the out-of-plane axis. For each geometry, we consider two collinear spin alignments, $\uparrow\downarrow/\uparrow\downarrow$ and $\uparrow\downarrow/\downarrow\uparrow$, and explore lateral displacements to sample the full stacking landscape. Our results show that magnetic order and interlayer symmetry breaking jointly enable momentum-dependent spin polarization without net magnetization. These findings highlight stacking and spin alignment as coupled symmetry control parameters for engineering altermagnetism in van der Waals magnets, paving the way toward tunable spintronic functionality.</description>

      <title>Advancing Excited-State Properties of 2D Materials Using a Dielectric-Dependent Hybrid Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting accurate band gaps and optical properties of lower-dimensional materials, including two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials and their heterostructures, remains a challenge within density functional theory (DFT) due to their unique screening compared to their bulk counterparts. Additionally, accurate treatment of the dielectric response is crucial for developing and applying screened-exchange dielectric-dependent range-separated hybrid functionals (SE-DD-RSH) for vdW materials. In this work, we introduce a SE-DD-RSH functional to the 2D vdW materials like MoS2, WS2, hBN, black phosphorus (BP), and \b{eta}-InSe. By accounting for in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric responses, our method achieves accuracy comparable to advanced many-body techniques like G0 W0 and BSE@G0 W0 at a lower computational cost. We demonstrate improved band gap predictions and optical absorption spectra for both bulk and layered structures, including some heterostructures like MoS2/WS2 . This approach offers a practical and precise tool for exploring electronic and optical phenomena in 2D materials, paving the way for efficient computational studies of layered systems.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent layer-projected scissors operator for band structures of complex 2D van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient method to calculate the quasiparticle (QP) band structure of general van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. A layer-projected scissors (LAPS) operator, which depends on the one-body density matrix, is added to the density functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian. The LAPS operator corrects the band edges of the individual layers for self-energy effects (both intralayer and interlayer) and unphysical strain fields stemming from the use of model supercells. The LAPS operator is treated self-consistently whereby charge redistribution and interlayer hybridization occurring in response to the band energy corrections are properly accounted for. We present several examples illustrating both the qualitative and quantitative performance of the method, including MoS$_2$ films with up to 20 layers, bilayer MoS$_2$ in an electric field, lattice-matched MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ bilayers, and MoSe$_2$/WS$_2$ moir\'e structures. Our work opens the way for predictive modeling of electronic, optical, and topological properties of complex and experimentally relevant vdW materials.</description>

      <title>Non-excitonic mechanism for electronic and structural phase transitions in Ta2Ni(Se,S)5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles study based on density functional theory (DFT) on the electronic and structural properties of Ta2NiSe5, a layered transition metal chalcogenide that has been considered as a possible candidate for an excitonic insulator. Our systematic DFT results however provide a non-excitonic mechanism for the experimentally observed electronic and structural phase transitions in Ta2NiSe5, in particular explaining why sulfur substitution of selenium reduces the distortion angle in the low-temperature phase and potassium dosing closes the gap in the electronic structure. Moreover, the calculations show that these two effects couple to each other. Further, our first-principles calculations predict several changes in both the crystal structure and electronic structure under the effects of uniform charge dosing and uniaxial strain, which could be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Cubic ReSTe as a High-Performance Thermoelectric Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report thermoelectric properties of sintered samples of undoped, W-doped, and Sb-doped ReSTe crystallized in a cubic MoSBr-type structure. All samples exhibited p-type thermoelectric properties. ReSTe and Re0.993W0.007STe exhibited the largest dimensionless figure of merit ZT, reaching 0.4 at 660 K. This high performance is attributed to large power factor owing to the degenerate semiconducting state realized by the strong spin-orbit coupling and low lattice thermal conductivity of the sintered samples. Furthermore, electronic band dispersion of ReSTe is almost flat at the bottom of the conduction band, suggesting that n-type ReSTe is expected to exhibit much higher performance than p-type ReSTe.</description>

      <title>Improved imaging of magnetic domains with a photoelectron emission microscope by utilizing symmetry and momentum selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging of magnetic domains with a photoelectron emission microscope operated with photon energies in the threshold regime often suffers from low contrast. In this work we show by symmetry considerations, photoemission calculations, and imaging experiments, how the contrast can be improved significantly. The key to both domain selectivity and sizable intensity asymmetries is, guided by symmetry considerations, selecting the momenta of the photoelectrons by a properly positioned contrast aperture. By comparing computational with experimental results for an Fe(001) surface we prove the feasibility of the approach.</description>

      <title>Contribution of shears on vibrational entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating the vibrational entropy of an N-atom assembly in the harmonic approximation requires the diagonalisation of a large matrix. This operation becomes rapidly time consuming when increasing the dimensions of the simulation cell. In the studies of point defects, a widely used shortcut consists in calculating the eigen modes of the atoms contained in an inner region, called the defective region, while the atoms belonging to the outer region are held fixed, and in applying an elastic correction to account for the entropy stored in the distortion of the outer region. A recent paper proposed to base the correction on the local pressure change experienced by each lattice site. The present contribution is an extension in the sense that it includes the shears. We compared the two approximations for configurations which are currently encountered in defect studies, namely those pertaining to defect formation and migration. The studied defects are the single, di- and tri-vacancy as well as the dumbbell interstitial in a host matrix modelled by several empirical potentials mimicking pure copper. It is shown that the inclusion of shears brings a noticeable contribution to the elastic correction for all configurations of low symmetry.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of spin-orbit-torque-assisted magnetization dynamics in Co/Pt bilayers: Importance of the orbital torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism driving magnetization switching in spin-orbit-torque-assisted devices remains a subject of debate. While originally attributed to the spin Hall effect and spin Rashba-Edelstein effect, recent discoveries related to orbital moments induced by the orbital Hall effect and the orbital Rashba-Edelstein effect have added complexity to the comprehension of the switching process in non-magnet/ferromagnet bilayers. Addressing this challenge, we present a quantitative investigation of a Pt/Co bilayer by employing atomistic spin dynamics simulations, incorporating the proximity-induced moments of Pt, as well as electrically induced spin and orbital moments obtained from first-principles calculations. Our layer-resolved model elucidates the damping-like and field-like nature of the induced moments by separating them according to their even and odd magnetization dependence. In addition to demonstrating that a larger field-like spin-orbit torque contribution comes from previously disregarded induced orbital moments, our work highlights the necessity of considering interactions with Pt induced moments at the interface, as they contribute significantly to the switching dynamics.</description>

      <title>Inverse thermal anisotropy in CdMgO measured using photothermal infrared radiometry and thermoreflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study elucidates the intriguing phenomenon of inverse thermal anisotropy in cadmium magnesium oxide (CdMgO) thin films, characterized by cross-plane thermal conductivity being greater than in-plane thermal conductivity, essential for optimizing thermal management in next-generation optoelectronic devices. Herein, we utilized Photothermal Radiometry and Frequency Domain Thermoreflectance to precisely determine the thermal conductivity and diffusivity across various concentrations of magnesium in CdMgO alloys, thereby providing essential insights into thermophysical behavior. Atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction revealed a direct correlation between increasing magnesium content and progressive structural evolution within plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy-derived CdMgO alloys. Furthermore, heat transport mechanism, analyzed using Callaway and Abeles models, indicated key phonon interactions. This comprehensive investigation provides a framework for the precise control of CdMgO thin film thermal properties, paving the way for scalable fabrication strategies to optimize performance in high-power thermal management applications.</description>

      <title>Polarization Vortices in a Ferromagnetic Metal via Twistronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in moire engineering provide new pathways for manipulating lattice distortions and electronic properties in low-dimensional materials. Here, we demonstrate that twisted stacking can induce dipolar vortices in metallic SrRuO3 membranes, despite the presence of free charges that would normally screen depolarizing fields and dipole-dipole interactions. These polarization vortices are correlated with moire-periodic flexoelectricity induced by shear strain gradients, and exhibit a pronounced dependence on the twist angle. In addition, multiferroic behavior emerges below the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of the films, whereby polarization and ferromagnetism coexist and compete, showing opposite twist-angle dependencies of their respective magnitudes. Density functional theory calculations provide insights into the microscopic origin of these observations. Our findings extend the scope of polarization topology design beyond dielectric materials and into metals.</description>

Abstract: We propose an approach for exploring magnetic structures by using Liechtenstein's method for exchange couplings from the results of first-principles calculations. Our method enables efficient and accurate exploration of stable magnetic structures by greatly reducing the number of firstprinciples calculations required. We apply our method to the magnetic structures of MnO and hexagonal ferrite SrFe12O19. Our method correctly identifies the ground-state magnetic structure with a small number of first-principles calculations in these systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic spin-polarized conductivity in collinear altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The altermagnet exhibits the nonrelativistic spin splitting that enables all-electrical generation of spin-polarized currents beyond the spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report on a study on the anisotropic spin-polarized conductivity in collinear altermagnets. Based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we first study this effect using the general group-theoretical analysis and identify the spin point groups sustaining the finite spin polarization defined in terms of spin-polarized conductivity. We show that the spin polarization vanishes along any direction for the $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets while the spin polarization is significantly anisotropic for the $d$-wave altermagnet. We further derive the analytical expressions for the anisotropic spin polarization in the $d$-wave altermagnets. Then, we exemplify those phenomena in several representative altermagnets based on the density functional theory calculations. Our work enriches the altermagnetic spintronics and paves the practical way to produce large spin polarization in collinear altermagnets.</description>

      <title>In-plane polarization induced ferroelectrovalley coupling in a two-dimensional rare-earth halide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism where the valley splitting is caused by an in-plane electric polarization and the coupling between the two makes it possible for an electric field to control the valley degree of freedom. We demonstrate this by considering Gd-substituted EuCl$_2$ monolayer in its 1T-phase using first-principles calculations. This monolayer exhibits an in-plane polarization which breaks the inversion symmetry of the monolayer leading to a spontaneous valley splitting. The resulting valley polarization is strongly coupled with the electric polarization and, hence, the valley degree of freedom can be switched by an external electric field in this case, instead of the conventional magnetic field. We show that a similar ferroelectric-ferrovalley (FE-FV) coupling can also exist in the previously reported ferroelectric (CrBr$_3$)$_2$Li monolayer. This mechanism opens up a new avenue for electric field control of valley polarization in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Tunability of the magnetic properties in Ni intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ni$_{0.33}$NbSe$_2$ has been identified as an altermagnet with a Neel temperature of 84 K, although Ni$_{0.21}$NbSe$_2$ behaves like a nonmagnetic metal. In this work, we explore the magnetic phases of Ni-intercalated NbSe$_2$ with stoichiometry Ni$_{0.25}$NbSe$_2$, which lies between the two previously studied compositions. Our results reveal a transition in the ground state from a stripe antiferromagnetic phase with Kramers degeneracy to a ferromagnetic phase (above UC).In the Kramers antiferromagnetic state, the nearest-neighbour magnetic coupling is ferromagnetic between the layers and forms stripe-like patterns in the ab plane. This behavior contrasts with that of Ni$_{0.33}$NbSe$_2$ where the nearest-neighbour magnetic couplings are opposite, and the magnetic easy axis aligns along the z-axis. The strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the second-nearest neighbor coupling stabilize the Kramers antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases with spins aligned along the z-axis over the non-collinear 120 phase with in-plane spin orientations. Given the triangular lattice and the closeness to both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling, a metamagnetic transition is possible. Substantial modifications to the electronic structure accompany Ni intercalation in NbSe$_2$ with respect to the pristine phase. Compared to pristine NbSe$_2$, which features a hole pocket at the $\Gamma$ point, the stripe phase of Ni$_{0.25}$NbSe$_2$ instead exhibits an electron pocket at $\Gamma$. This pocket at $\Gamma$ has predominantly 3z$^2$-r$^2$ character, and derives its main spectral weight from the Nb atoms. Ni intercalation also shifts the Van Hove singularity away from the Fermi level, thereby suppressing potential electronic instabilities.</description>

      <title>Efficient local atomic cluster expansion for BaTiO$_3$ close to equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium titanate (BTO) is a representative perovskite oxide that undergoes three first-order ferroelectric phase transitions related to exceptional functional properties. In this work, we develop two atomic cluster expansion (ACE) models for BTO to reproduce fundamental properties of bulk as well as defective BTO phases. The two ACE models do not target full transferability but rather aim to examine the influence of implicit and explicit treatment of long-range Coulomb interactions. We demonstrate that both models describe equally well the temperature induced phase transitions as well as polarization switching due to applied electric field. Even though the parametrizations are based on a limited number of configurations that are mostly not far away from the equilibrium, the ACE models are able to capture also properties of important crystal defects, such as oxygen vacancies, stacking faults and domain walls. A systematic comparison shows that the phase transitions as well as the fundamental properties of the investigated defects can be described with similar accuracy with or without explicit treatment of charges and Coulomb interactions allowing for efficient short-range machine learning potentials.</description>

      <title>Emergent reactance induced by the deformation of a current-driven skyrmion lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between conduction electrons and spin textures gives rise to remarkable phenomena associated with the Berry phase. The Berry phase acquired by conduction electrons acts as an emergent electromagnetic field, facilitating phenomena analogous to classical electromagnetism, such as the Lorentz force and electromagnetic induction. Magnetic skyrmions, spin vortices with non-trivial topology, serve as a key platform for such studies. For example, non-trivial transport responses are recognized as being induced by the emergent Lorentz force and the emergent electromagnetic induction. Despite remarkable progress in skyrmion physics, emergent reactance, in which the phase of an applied AC current is modified by emergent electromagnetism, has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we report emergent reactance in the prototypical skyrmion-hosting material, MnSi. We observe longitudinal and Hall reactance signals as the skyrmion lattice undergoes creep motion, in which the skyrmions deform while moving. The Hall reactance is attributed to the emergent electric field associated with the inertial translational motion arising from the skyrmion effective mass. In contrast, the longitudinal reactance results from the emergent electric fields generated by the phason and spin-tilting modes excited by their deformation. Our findings shed light on the internal deformation degrees of freedom in skyrmions as a important factor for efficient generation of the emergent electric field.</description>

      <title>A new generation of effective core potentials: Selected lanthanides and heavy elements II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) for selected heavy $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$-block elements significant in materials science and chemistry (Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba, In, Sb, Pb, Ru, Cd, La, Ce, and Eu). The ccECPs are designed using minimal Gaussian parameterization to achieve smooth and bounded potentials. They are expressed as a combination of averaged relativistic effective potentials (AREP) and effective spin-orbit (SO) terms, developed within a relativistic coupled-cluster framework. The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin-orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cut-offs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. Transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects. These ccECPs provide accurate and transferable framework for valence-only calculations.</description>

      <title>Nucleation and Antiphase Twin Control in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via Step-Terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The epitaxial synthesis of high-quality 2D layered materials is an essential driver of both fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a prototypical 2D layered topological insulator, is sensitive to defects imparted during the growth, either thermodynamically or due to the film-substrates interaction. In this study, we demonstrate that step-terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates with a high miscut angle (3$^\circ$) can effectively suppress a particular hard-to-mitigate defect, the antiphase twin. Systematic investigations across a range of growth temperatures and substrate miscut angles confirm that atomic step edges act as preferential nucleation sites, stabilizing a single twin domain. First principles calculations suggest that there is a significant energy barrier for twin boundary formation at step edges, supporting the experimental observations. Detailed structural characterization indicates that this twin-selectivity is lost through the mechanism of the 2D layers overgrowing the step edges, leading to higher twin density as the thickness increases. These findings highlight the complex energy landscape unique to 2D materials that is driven by the interplay between substrate topology, nucleation dynamics, and defect formation, and overcoming and controlling these are critical to improve material quality for quantum and electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Tuning Thermal Conductivity and Electron-Phonon Interactions in Carbon and Boron Nitride Moir\'e Diamanes via Twist Angle Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the effect of interlayer twist angle on the in-plane lattice thermal conductivity and the band gap renormalization in diamane-like hydrogenated bilayer boron nitride (BN) and graphene Moir\'e lattices. Machine learning moment tensor potentials were used for calculating energies and forces of interatomic interactions. The methods based on the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for phonons and the Green-Kubo (GK) formula were utilized to obtain LTC values. The 20-40\% difference in LTC values obtained with GK and BTE-based methods showed the importance of high-order anharmonic contributions to LTC in the BN-based lattice with $\theta=21.8^\circ$ and all considered graphene-based structures. Significant reduction (by 4.5 - 9 times) of the in-plane LTC with the increase in the twist angle was observed in the Moir\'e lattices. This LTC reduction is caused by the decrease of phonon lifetimes. The phonon lifetimes decrease due to the growth of structural disorder in the Moir\'e lattices with the twist angle increase. We also show that the growth of disorder with increasing twist angle affects the electron-phonon interactions. This leads to higher band gap renormalization (induced by classical nuclei motion) at higher twist angles. High band gap renormalization (even at T = 0 K) values obtained considering the quantum nuclear effects are caused by the high frequencies of lattice vibrations in the Moir\'e lattices. These high frequencies are caused by the presence of light hydrogen atoms on the surfaces of the structures. Understanding of the twist-angle-induced disorder effect on phonon properties, LTC and electron-phonon coupling in the Moir\'e lattices provides a fundamental basis for manipulating the thermal and electronic properties of these structures, making them promising for applications in thermoelectrics, microelectronics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Effect of Fluorine doping on the electrocatalytic properties of Nb2O5 for H2O2 electrogeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via the 2-electron mechanism is an efficient way to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under mild conditions. This study examines the modification of Vulcan XC72 carbon with fluorine (F)-doped niobium oxide (Nb2O5) nanoparticles at varying molar ratios (0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02). The F-doped Nb2O5 nanoparticles were synthesized using the oxidizing peroxide method and then incorporated into Vulcan XC72 carbon via impregnation. Characterization techniques included X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), contact angle measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical evaluation using the rotating ring disk electrode method revealed that Vulcan XC72 modified with 1.0% F-doped Nb2O5 exhibited the best ORR performance. When used as a gas diffusion electrode, this electrocatalyst produced more H2O2 at all applied potentials than the pure and Nb2O5-modified Vulcan XC72 carbon. At potentials of -0.7 V and -1.3 V, the proposed electrocatalyst achieved H2O2 yields 65% and 98% higher than the Nb2O5-modified electrocatalyst. Furthermore, it presented lower energy consumption and higher current efficiency than the other electrocatalysts compared in this study. The enhanced performance is attributed to F doping, which increased Nb2O5 lattice distortion and disorder, improving electron availability for ORR. Additionally, F-doped electrocatalysts exhibited more oxygenated species and greater hydrophilicity, facilitating O2 adsorption, transport, and electron transfer. These properties significantly enhanced H2O2 electrogeneration efficiency while reducing energy consumption.</description>

      <title>INN-FF: A Scalable and Efficient Machine Learning Potential for Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to accurately model interatomic interactions in large-scale systems is fundamental to understanding a wide range of physical and chemical phenomena, from drug-protein binding to the behavior of next-generation materials. While machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have made it possible to achieve ab initio-level accuracy at significantly reduced computational cost, they still require very large training datasets and incur substantial training time and expense. In this work, we propose the Interpolating Neural Network Force Field (INN-FF), a novel framework that merges interpolation theory and tensor decomposition with neural network architectures to efficiently construct molecular dynamics potentials from limited quantum mechanical data. Interpolating Neural Networks (INNs) achieve comparable or better accuracy than traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters. On benchmark datasets such as liquid water and rMD17, INN-FF not only matches but often surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy by an order of magnitude, while achieving significantly lower error when trained on smaller datasets. These results suggest that INN-FF offers a promising path toward building efficient and scalable machine-learned force fields.</description>

      <title>Unconventional tunnel magnetoresistance scaling with altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches form a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomena is explained by adouble-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O-based AMTJ, where the TMR anomalously decreases from 220% to 40% as the layer number of Cr2Se2O increases from 1 to 5. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.</description>

      <title>Increasing the Resistance of Magnetic Flux Concentrator during Generation of Strong Pulsed Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of significant increase of generated pulsed magnetic fields by the inductor system of a single-turn solenoid and magnetic flux concentrator without initialization of low-cycle fatigue mechanism is theoretically studied by varying the size of the inductor system, the material of the concentrator and the parameters of the discharge circuit. The analysis is carried out on the basis of self-consistent solution of the equation, which describes dynamics of the discharge electric circuit, with equations describing spatial distributions of magnetic and temperature fields, mechanical stresses and deformations in the inductor and concentrator. It is shown that for traditionally used steel concentrators by varying the electrical resistance of the circuit it is possible to increase the amplitude of generated pulsed magnetic fields without the threat of concentrator destruction by about 25~\%, from 32 to 40~T.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite microwires are promising candidates for integrated photonic systems due to their strong nonlinear optical response and inherent waveguiding capabilities. In this study, we focus on the directional emission properties of exciton-polariton condensates formed within perovskite microwires, with emphasis on emission collected from the microwire end. We constructed a multi-angle optical detection setup that allows us to identify the exciton-polariton condensation threshold and track the evolution of the condensate for different excitation position along and across the microwire. We observe spectrally narrow exciton-polariton condensate emission from the microwire end even when the condensate is generated tens of micrometers away, which demonstrates the ability of the exciton-polariton condensate to propagate over long distances within the microwire. Furthermore, we find that the presence of structural defects near the condensate location can significantly enhance the emission from the microwire end due to aligning the condensate's momentum with the waveguide direction, thereby facilitating more efficient propagation.</description>

      <title>Pressure tuning of competing interactions on a honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic exchange interactions are mediated via orbital overlaps across chemical bonds. Thus, modifying the bond angles by physical pressure or strain can tune the relative strength of competing interactions. Here we present a remarkable case of such tuning between the Heisenberg (J) and Kitaev (K) exchange, which respectively establish magnetically ordered and spin liquid phases on a honeycomb lattice. We observe a rapid suppression of the Neel temperature (TN) with pressure in Ag3LiRh2O6, a spin-1/2 honeycomb lattice with both J and K couplings. Using a combined analysis of x-ray data and first-principles calculations, we find that pressure modifies the bond angles in a way that increases the |K/J| ratio and thereby suppresses TN. Consistent with this picture, we observe a spontaneous onset of muon spin relaxation (muSR) oscillations below TN at low pressure, whereas in the high-pressure phase, oscillations appear only when T &lt; TN/2. Unlike other candidate Kitaev materials, Ag3LiRh2O6 is tuned toward a quantum critical point by pressure while avoiding a structural dimerization in the relevant pressure range.</description>

      <title>Dilute Paramagnetism and Non-Trivial Topology in Quasicrystal Approximant Fe$_4$Al$_{13}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A very fundamental property of both weakly and strongly interacting materials is the nature of its magnetic response. In this work we detail the growth of crystals of the quasicrystal approximant Fe$_4$Al$_{13}$ with an Al flux solvent method. We characterize our samples using electrical transport and heat capacity, yielding results consistent with a simple non-magnetic metal. However, magnetization measurements portray an extremely unusual response for a dilute paramagnet and do not exhibit the characteristic Curie-Weiss behavior expected for a weakly interacting material at high temperature. Electronic structure calculations confirm metallic behavior, but also indicate that each isolated band near the Fermi energy hosts non-trivial topologies including strong, weak and nodal components, with resultant topological surface states distinguishable from bulk states on the (001) surface. With half-filled flat bands apparent in the calculation but absence of long-range magnetic order, the unusual paramagnetic response suggests the dilute paramagnetic behavior in this quasicrystal approximant is surprising and may serve as a test of the fundamental assumptions that are taken for granted for the magnetic response of weakly interacting systems.</description>

Abstract: A growing list of Ce-based magnets have shown an extra and heretofore unexplained crystal electric field (CEF) mode at high energies. We describe a process whereby an optical phonon can produce a split CEF mode well above the phonon energy. We use density functional theory and point-charge model calculations to estimate the phonon distortions and coupling to model this effect in KCeO$_2$, showing that it accounts for the extra CEF mode observed. This mechanism is generic, and may explain the extra modes observed on a variety of Ce$^{3+}$ compounds.</description>

      <title>F-ANcGAN: An Attention-Enhanced Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Architecture for Synthetic Image Generation of Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomaterial research is becoming a vital area for energy, medicine, and materials science, and accurate analysis of the nanoparticle topology is essential to determine their properties. Unfortunately, the lack of high-quality annotated datasets drastically hinders the creation of strong segmentation models for nanoscale imaging. To alleviate this problem, we introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative adversarial system that can be trained using a limited number of data samples and generates realistic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from segmentation maps. Our model uses a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net segmentation network equipped with self-attention to capture structural relationships and applies augmentation methods to increase the variety of the dataset. The architecture reached a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_2$ dataset generation, with a further reduction in FID score to nearly 10.39 by using efficient post-processing techniques. By facilitating scalable high-fidelity synthetic dataset generation, our approach can improve the effectiveness of downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues in nanoparticle analysis, thus extending its applications to resource-limited fields.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic reactive scattering of hydrogen on different surface facets of copper</title>

Abstract: Dissociative chemisorption is a key process in hydrogen-metal surface chemistry, where nonadiabatic effects due to low-lying electron-hole-pair excitations may affect reaction outcomes. Molecular dynamics with electronic friction simulations can capture weak nonadiabatic effects at metal surfaces, but require as input energy landscapes and electronic friction tensors. Here, we present full-dimensional machine learning surrogate models of the electronic friction tensor to study reactive hydrogen chemistry at the low-index surface facets Cu(100), Cu(110), Cu(111), and Cu(211). We combine these surrogate models with machine learning interatomic potentials to simulate quantum-state-resolved H$_2$ reactive scattering on pristine copper surfaces. The predicted sticking coefficient and survival probabilities are in excellent agreement with experiment. Comparison between adiabatic and nonadiabatic simulations reveals that the influence of electron-hole pair excitations on the scattering dynamics is weak and that the probability for dissociative adsorption is dominated by the shape of the underlying potential energy surface and the initial vibrational quantum state. Nonadiabatic effects only lead to subtle changes in rovibrationally inelastic state-to-state scattering probabilities. The differences between jellium-based isotropic local density friction and full ab-initio response-theory-based orbital-dependent friction are even more subtle. The presented machine learning models represent the most accurate publicly available, full-dimensional models for H$_2$ on copper to date.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stochastic 3D modeling of the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery cathodes</title>

Abstract: A stochastic 3D modeling approach for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by a Boolean model with spherical grains. The model parameters are calibrated to 3D image data of cathodes in lithium-ion batteries acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, model validation is performed by comparing model realizations with measured image data in terms of various morphological descriptors that are not used for model fitting. Finally, we use the stochastic 3D model for predictive simulations, where we generate virtual, yet realistic, image data of nanoporous binder-conductive additives with varying amounts of graphite particles. Based on these virtual nanostructures, we can investigate structure-property relationships. In particular, we quantitatively study the influence of graphite particles on effective transport properties in the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase, which have a crucial impact on electrochemical processes in the cathode and thus on the performance of battery cells.</description>

      <title>Light-induced inverse spin Hall effect and field-induced circular photogalvanic effect in GaAs revealed by two-dimensional terahertz Fourier analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromotive force transverse to a bias field under irradiation of circularly polarized light, namely the photovoltaic Hall response or light-induced anomalous Hall effect, has attracted considerable attention to investigate the topologically nontrivial states in Floquet engineering and the inverse spin Hall effect of spin-polarized carriers in spintronics. However, taking into account inversion symmetry breaking by the bias field, the circularly polarized light can excite photocarriers with asymmetric momentum distribution, which generates injection current transverse to the bias field. Therefore, the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect (FI-CPGE) should also emerge in the very same experimental configuration for light-induced anomalous Hall effect but has been overlooked in literature. In this work, using terahertz pulses as a bias field for a semiconductor GaAs, we conduct two-dimensional Fourier analysis and demonstrate that FI-CPGE can play a major role in the photovoltaic Hall response. Counterintuitively, FI-CPGE is significantly enhanced when the photocarriers are excited near the bandgap with small density of states and low group velocity, which can be explained by a three-level resonant nonlinear interaction near the band degeneracy point. We also clarified that FI-CPGE would be further largely detected in the contact-type measurement using electrodes because of the absence of a filtering effect inherent to terahertz pulses. This work provides a comprehensive, generalized view of the photovoltaic Hall response in biased materials, paving a new avenue for detecting topological monopoles in momentum space hidden in equilibrium using third-order nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>The Interplay Between Electron Localization, Magnetic Order, and Jahn-Teller Distortion that Dictates LiMnO$_2$ Phase Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of Mn-rich cathodes for Li-ion batteries promises to alleviate supply chain bottlenecks in battery manufacturing. Challenges in Mn-rich cathodes arise from Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions of Mn$^{3+}$, Mn migration, and phase transformations to spinel-like order, which can affect the electrochemical performance. These phenomena motivate an ab initio re-examination of the thermodynamics of the LiMnO2 polymorphs. It is found that the generalized gradient approximation (GGA - PBEsol) and meta-GGA (r2SCAN) density functionals with empirical on-site Hubbard U corrections yield spurious stable phases for LiMnO2, such as predicting a phase with gamma-LiFeO2-like order (g-LiMnO2) to be the ground state instead of the orthorhombic (Pmmn) phase, which is the experimentally known ground state. Accounting for the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in each structure has a substantial effect on the total energies and resulting phase stability. By using hybrid-GGA (HSE06) and GGA with self-consistent Hubbard parameters (on-site U and inter-site V), the experimentally observed LiMnO2 phase stability trends are recovered. The calculated Hubbard U in the experimentally observed orthorhombic, layered, and spinel phases are significantly smaller than U in g-LiMnO2 and disordered layered structures. The smaller values of U are correlated with a collinear ordering of JT distortions, in which all $e_g$ orbitals are oriented in the same direction. This cooperative JT effect leads to increased Mn-O covalency, which contributes to the greater electronic stability compared to the phases with noncollinear JT arrangements, and also generate greater vibrational entropy, which helps stabilize these phases at high temperature. These phases are shown to be strongly insulating with large calculated band gaps &gt; 3 eV, computed using HSE06 and $G_0W_0$.</description>

      <title>Direct derivation of anisotropic atomic displacement parameters from molecular dynamics simulations in extended solids with substitutional disorder using a neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) are crystallographic information that describe the statistical distribution of atoms around an atom site. Anisotropic ADPs by atom were directly derived from classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using a universal machine-learned potential. The (co)valences of atom positions were taken over recordings at different time steps in a single MD simulation. The procedure was demonstrated on extended solids, namely rocksalt structure MgO and three thermoelectric materials, Ag8SnSe6, Na2In2Sn4, and BaCu1.14In0.86P2. Unlike the very frequently used lattice dynamics approach, the MD approach can obtain ADPs in crystals with substitutional disorder and explicitly at finite temperature, but not under conditions where atoms migrate in the crystal. The calculated ADP becomes -&gt;0 at temperature -&gt;0 and the ADP is proportional to the temperature when the atom is in a harmonic potential and the sole contribution to the actual non-zero ADP is from the zero-point motion. The zero-point motion contribution can be estimated from the proportionality constant assuming this Einstein model. ADPs from MD simulations would act as a tool complementing experimental efforts to understand the crystal structure including the distribution of atoms around atom sites.</description>

      <title>Resolving the sodiation process in hard carbon anodes with nanostructure specific X-ray imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hard carbons show significant promise as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, monitoring the sodiation process in the hard carbon electrode during cycling and understanding the sodiation mechanism remain challenging. This article reports on operando 2D scanning small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) and ex situ 3D SAXS tomography of hard carbon electrodes during the sodiation process. Structural changes are monitored with spatial and temporal resolution during the electrochemical process and shows that sodiation through micropore filling is the more dominating mechanism in the later stages of sodiation, i.e. in the plateau region of the voltage profile, while intercalation occurs continuously. Spatial inhomogeneities are resolved over the electrode and reveal an increased level of inhomogeneity at higher degree of sodiation with regions of different degrees of micropore filling. Resolving the processes spatially enables us to correlate plating, starting from the interface between the electrode and the current collector, to a higher degree of micropore filling. The work demonstrates how SWAXS imaging can contribute to understanding the sodiation of hard carbon anodes, not only by spatially resolved analysis, but also as a method to decouple contributions from different components in a cell, enabling more accurate scattering analysis in in situ environments.</description>

      <title>High emissivity, thermally robust emitters for high power density thermophotovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal radiative energy transport is essential for high-temperature energy harvesting technologies, including thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) and grid-scale thermal energy storage. However, the inherently low emissivity of conventional high-temperature materials constrains radiative energy transfer, thereby limiting both system performance and technoeconomic viability. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast femtosecond laser-material interactions to transform diverse materials into near-blackbody surfaces with broadband spectral emissivity above 0.96. This enhancement arises from hierarchically engineered light-trapping microstructures enriched with nanoscale features, effectively decoupling surface optical properties from bulk thermomechanical properties. These laser blackened surfaces (LaBS) exhibit exceptional thermal stability, retaining high emissivity for over 100 hours at temperatures exceeding 1000{\deg}C, even in oxidizing environments. When applied as TPV thermal emitters, Ta LaBS double electrical power output from 2.19 to 4.10 W cm-2 at 2200{\deg}C while sustaining TPV conversion efficiencies above 30%. This versatile, largely material-independent technique offers a scalable and economically viable pathway to enhance emissivity for advanced thermal energy applications.</description>

      <title>Growth of Highly Conductive PtSe2 Films Controlled by Raman Metrics for High-Frequency Photodetectors and Optoelectronic Mixers at 1.55 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional PtSe2 exhibits outstanding intrinsic properties such as high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, broadband absorption and air stability, making it ideal for (opto)electronic applications. However, achieving films of high crystalline quality with controlled properties on low-cost and insulating substrates remains challenging. Here, highly crystalline semimetallic PtSe2 films are grown by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire substrates. It is shown that a post-growth annealing remarkably improves the out-of-plane crystallinity and leads to record sheet conductances, up to 1.6 mS. In-depth structural analyses reveal the strong influence of the domain arrangement within the films on their sheet conductance. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the A1g Raman peak width, in addition to the commonly used Eg peak width, are both effective metrics for evaluating the quality of PtSe2: films with narrower Eg and A1g peaks exhibit higher in-plane and out-of-plane crystalline quality, as well as higher sheet conductance. Finally, coplanar waveguides integrating a semimetallic PtSe2 channel are fabricated on a 2-inch sapphire substrate to demonstrate optoelectronic devices operating at the 1.55 um telecom wavelength. This includes photodetectors with a record bandwidth of 60 GHz and the first PtSe2-based optoelectronic mixer with a 30 GHz bandwidth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depending on multiple parameters, soft robots can exhibit different modes of locomotion that are difficult to model numerically. As a result, improving their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement. In this work, we optimize light-powered millimetre-scale underwater swimmer locomotion by applying experimental results - measured swimming speed - as the fitness function in two evolutionary algorithms: particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. As these soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using many competing robots to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including eight-fold increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.</description>

      <title>Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.</description>
