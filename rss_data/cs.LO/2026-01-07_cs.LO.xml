      <title>Bounded Rewriting Induction for LCSTRSs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rewriting Induction (RI) is a method to prove inductive theorems, originating from equational reasoning. By using Logically Constrained Simply-typed Term Rewriting Systems (LCSTRSs) as an intermediate language, rewriting induction becomes a tool for program verification, with inductive theorems taking the role of equivalence predicates. Soundness of RI depends on well-founded induction, and one of the core obstacles for obtaining a practically useful proof system is to find suitable well-founded orderings automatically. Using naive approaches, all induction hypotheses must be oriented within the well-founded ordering, which leads to very strong termination requirements. This, in turn, severely limits the proof capacity of RI. Here, we introduce Bounded RI: an adaption of RI for LCSTRSs where such termination requirements are minimized.</description>

      <title>Recursive querying of neural networks via weighted structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expressive querying of machine learning models - viewed as a form of intentional data - enables their verification and interpretation using declarative languages, thereby making learned representations of data more accessible. Motivated by the querying of feedforward neural networks, we investigate logics for weighted structures. In the absence of a bound on neural network depth, such logics must incorporate recursion; thereto we revisit the functional fixpoint mechanism proposed by Gr\"adel and Gurevich. We adopt it in a Datalog-like syntax; we extend normal forms for fixpoint logics to weighted structures; and show an equivalent "loose" fixpoint mechanism that allows values of inductively defined weight functions to be overwritten. We propose a "scalar" restriction of functional fixpoint logic, of polynomial-time data complexity, and show it can express all PTIME model-agnostic queries over reduced networks with polynomially bounded weights. In contrast, we show that very simple model-agnostic queries are already NP-complete. Finally, we consider transformations of weighted structures by iterated transductions.</description>

      <title>Proceedings 16th International Workshop on Graph Computation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This volume contains the post-proceedings of the Sixteenth International Workshop on Graph Computation Models (GCM 2025). The workshops took place in Koblenz, Germany on June 10 as part of STAF (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations).  
  Graphs are common mathematical structures that are visual and intuitive. They constitute a natural and seamless way for system modeling in science, engineering, and beyond, including computer science, biology, and business process modeling. Graph computation models constitute a class of very high-level models where graphs are first-class citizens. The aim of the International GCM Workshop series is to bring together researchers interested in all aspects of computation models based on graphs and graph transformation. It promotes the cross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and experiences among senior and young researchers from the different communities interested in the foundations, applications, and implementations of graph computation models and related areas. </description>

      <title>Inferring Causal Graph Temporal Logic Formulas to Expedite Reinforcement Learning in Temporally Extended Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-making tasks often unfold on graphs with spatial-temporal dynamics. Black-box reinforcement learning often overlooks how local changes spread through network structure, limiting sample efficiency and interpretability. We present GTL-CIRL, a closed-loop framework that simultaneously learns policies and mines Causal Graph Temporal Logic (Causal GTL) specifications. The method shapes rewards with robustness, collects counterexamples when effects fail, and uses Gaussian Process (GP) driven Bayesian optimization to refine parameterized cause templates. The GP models capture spatial and temporal correlations in the system dynamics, enabling efficient exploration of complex parameter spaces. Case studies in gene and power networks show faster learning and clearer, verifiable behavior compared to standard RL baselines.</description>

      <title>Logical Phase Transitions: Understanding Collapse in LLM Logical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic logical reasoning is a critical yet underexplored capability of large language models (LLMs), providing reliable and verifiable decision-making in high-stakes domains such as mathematical reasoning and legal judgment. In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions. Code and data are available at https://github.com/AI4SS/Logical-Phase-Transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boja\'nczyk, Pilipczuk, and Grohe [LICS '18] proved that for graphs of bounded linear clique-width, clique-decompositions of bounded width can be produced by a CMSO transduction. We show that in the case of tournaments, a first-order transduction suffices. This implies that the logics CMSO and existential MSO are equivalent over bounded linear clique-width tournaments.</description>

      <title>FlexProofs: A Vector Commitment with Flexible Linear Time for Computing All Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce FlexProofs, a new vector commitment (VC) scheme that achieves two key properties: (1) the prover can generate all individual opening proofs for a vector of size $N$ in optimal time ${\cal O}(N)$, and there is a flexible batch size parameter $b$ that can be increased to further reduce the time to generate all proofs; and (2) the scheme is directly compatible with a family of zkSNARKs that encode their input as a multi-linear polynomial. As a critical building block, we propose the first functional commitment (FC) scheme for multi-exponentiations with batch opening. Compared with HydraProofs, the only existing VC scheme that computes all proofs in optimal time ${\cal O}(N)$ and is directly compatible with zkSNARKs, FlexProofs may speed up the process of generating all proofs, if the parameter $b$ is properly chosen. Our experiments show that for $N=2^{16}$ and $b=\log^2 N$, FlexProofs can be $6\times$ faster than HydraProofs. Moreover, when combined with suitable zkSNARKs, FlexProofs enable practical applications such as verifiable secret sharing and verifiable robust aggregation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the last fifteen years, a program of establishing relationships between algorithmic randomness and almost-everywhere theorems in analysis and ergodic theory has developed. In harmonic analysis, Franklin, McNicholl, and Rute characterized Schnorr randomness using an effective version of Carleson's Theorem. We show here that, for computable $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, the reals at which the Fourier series of a weakly computable vector in $L^p[-\pi,\pi]$ converges are precisely the Martin-L\"{o}f random reals. Furthermore, we show that radial limits of the Poisson integral of an $L^1(\mathbb{R})$-computable function coincide with the values of the function at exactly the Schnorr random reals and that radial limits of the Poisson integral of a weakly $L^1(\mathbb{R})$-computable function coincide with the values of the function at exactly the Martin-L\"{o}f random reals.</description>

      <title>Model-checking real-time systems: revisiting the alternating automaton route</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alternating timed automata (ATA) are an extension of timed automata, that are closed under complementation and hence amenable to logic-to-automata translations. Several timed logics, including Metric Temporal Logic (MTL), can be converted to equivalent 1-clock ATAs (1-ATAs). Satisfiability of an MTL formula reduces to checking emptiness of a 1-ATA. A straightforward modification of the 1-ATA emptiness algorithm can be applied for model-checking timed automata models against 1-ATA specifications. However, existing emptiness algorithms for 1-ATA proceed by an extended region construction, and are not suitable for implementations. Our goal in this work is to initiate the study of zone-based methods directly for 1-ATAs. We first introduce a deactivation operation on the 1-ATA syntax to allow an explicit deactivation of the clock in transitions. Using the deactivation operation, we improve the existing MTL-to-1-ATA conversion and present a fragment of MTL for which the equivalent 1-ATA generate a bounded number of variables. Secondly, we develop the idea of zones for 1-ATA and present an emptiness algorithm which explores a corresponding zone graph. For termination, a special entailment check between zones is necessary. Our main technical contributions are: (1) an algorithm for the entailment check using simple zone operations and (2) an NP-hardness for the entailment check in the general case. Finally, we adapt our methods to the problem of model-checking timed automata models against 1-ATA specifications. We observe that when the timed automaton is strongly non-Zeno or when the 1-ATA generates a bounded number of variables, a modified entailment check with quadratic complexity can be applied.</description>

      <title>Cut-free Deductive System for Continuous Intuitionistic Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and develop propositional continuous intuitionistic logic and propositional continuous affine logic via complete algebraic semantics. Our approach centres on AC-algebras, which are algebras $USC(\mathcal{L})$ of sup-preserving functions from $[0,1]$ to an integral commutative residuated complete lattice $\mathcal{L}$ (in the intuitionistic case, $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale). We give an algebraic axiomatisation of AC-algebras in the language of continuous logic and prove, using the Macneille completion, that every Archimedean model embeds into some AC-algebra. We also show that (i) $USC(\mathcal{L})$ satisfies $v \dot + v = 2v$ exactly when $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale, (ii) involutiveness of negation in $USC(\mathcal{L})$ corresponds to that in $\mathcal{L} $, and that (iii) adding those conditions recovers classical continuous logic. For each variant -affine, intuitionistic, involutive, classical -we provide a sequent style deductive system and prove completeness and cut admissibility. This yields the first sequent style formulation of classical continuous logic enjoying cut admissibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In earlier work, we developed a modular approach for automatic complexity analysis of integer programs. However, these integer programs do not allow non-tail recursive calls or subprocedures. In this paper, we consider integer programs with function calls and present a natural extension of our modular complexity analysis approach to the recursive setting based on a new form of ranking functions. Hence, our approach combines already existing powerful techniques on the "imperative" parts of the program and our novel ranking functions on the recursive parts. The strength of this combination is demonstrated by our implementation in the complexity analysis tool KoAT.</description>

      <title>The structure of polynomial growth for tree automata/transducers and MSO set queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an $\mathbb{N}$-weighted tree automaton, we give a decision procedure for exponential vs polynomial growth (with respect to the input size) in quadratic time, and an algorithm that computes the exact polynomial degree of growth in cubic time. As a special case, they apply to the growth of the ambiguity of a nondeterministic tree automaton, i.e. the number of distinct accepting runs over a given input.
  We deduce analogous decidability results (ignoring complexity) for the growth of the number of results of set queries in Monadic Second-Order logic (MSO) over ranked trees. In the case of polynomial growth of degree $k$, we also prove a reparameterization theorem for such queries: their results can be mapped to $k$-tuples of input nodes in a finite-to-one and MSO-definable fashion.
  We then apply these tools to study growth rates and subclass membership problems for tree-to-tree functions. Using new proof strategies, we recover and generalize known results concerning polyregular functions, total deterministic macro tree transducers, and partial nondeterministic top-down tree transducers. In particular, we give a procedure to decide polynomial size-to-height increase for both macro tree transducers and MSO set interpretations, and compute the degree.
  The paper concludes with a survey of a wide range of related work.</description>

      <title>Deciding Serializability in Network Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the SER modeling language for automatically verifying serializability of concurrent programs, i.e., whether every concurrent execution of the program is equivalent to some serial execution. SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps. Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace. We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query. Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation. We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more.</description>
