      <title>Optimal Power Grid Operations with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy transition, crucial for tackling the climate crisis, demands integrating numerous distributed, renewable energy sources into existing grids. Along with climate change and consumer behavioral changes, this leads to changes and variability in generation and load patterns, introducing significant complexity and uncertainty into grid planning and operations. While the industry has already started to exploit AI to overcome computational challenges of established grid simulation tools, we propose the use of AI Foundation Models (FMs) and advances in Graph Neural Networks to efficiently exploit poorly available grid data for different downstream tasks, enhancing grid operations. For capturing the grid's underlying physics, we believe that building a self-supervised model learning the power flow dynamics is a critical first step towards developing an FM for the power grid. We show how this approach may close the gap between the industry needs and current grid analysis capabilities, to bring the industry closer to optimal grid operation and planning.</description>

      <title>Early Design Exploration of Aerospace Systems Using Assume-Guarantee Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compositional approach to early modeling and analysis of complex aerospace systems based on assume-guarantee contracts. Components in a system are abstracted into assume-guarantee specifications. Performing algebraic contract operations with Pacti allows us to relate local component specifications to that of the system. Applications to two aerospace case studies (the design of spacecraft to satisfy a rendezvous mission and the design of the thermal management system of a prototypical aircraft) show that this methodology provides engineers with an agile, early analysis and exploration process.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Maximum Likelihood Neural Distribution Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of steering the distribution of a discrete-time dynamical system from an initial distribution to a target distribution in finite time. The formulation is fully nonlinear, allowing the use of general control policies, parametrized by neural networks. Although similar solutions have been explored in the continuous-time context, extending these techniques to systems with discrete dynamics is not trivial. The proposed algorithm results in a regularized maximum likelihood optimization problem, which is solved using machine learning techniques. After presenting the algorithm, we provide several numerical examples that illustrate the capabilities of the proposed method. We start from a simple problem that admits a solution through semidefinite programming, serving as a benchmark for the proposed approach. Then, we employ the framework in more general problems that cannot be solved using existing techniques, such as problems with non-Gaussian boundary distributions and non-linear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Learning-Based Methods for Transient Stability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient stability and critical clearing time (CCT) are important concepts in power system protection and control. This paper explores and compares various learning-based methods for predicting CCT under uncertainties arising from renewable generation, loads, and contingencies. Specially, we introduce new definitions of transient stability (B-stablilty) and CCT from an engineering perspective. For training the models, only the initial values of system variables and contingency cases are used as features, enabling the provision of protection information based on these initial values. To enhance efficiency, a hybrid feature selection strategy combining the maximal information coefficient (MIC) and Spearman's Correlation Coefficient (SCC) is employed to reduce the feature dimension. The performance of different learning-based models is evaluated on a WSCC 9-bus system.</description>

      <title>Combined Plant and Control Co-design via Solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation Based on Physics-informed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02345v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses integrated design of engineering systems, where physical structure of the plant and controller design are optimized simultaneously. To cope with uncertainties due to noises acting on the dynamics and modeling errors, an Uncertain Control Co-design (UCCD) problem formulation is proposed. Existing UCCD methods usually rely on uncertainty propagation analyses using Monte Calro methods for open-loop solutions of optimal control, which suffer from stringent trade-offs among accuracy, time horizon, and computational time. The proposed method utilizes closed-loop solutions characterized by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) defined on the state space. A solution algorithm for the proposed UCCD formulation is developed based on PDE solutions of Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Numerical examples of regulator design problems are provided, and it is shown that simultaneous update of PINN weights and the design parameters effectively works for solving UCCD problems.</description>

      <title>Neighbourhood conditions for network stability with link uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result relates to structured robust stability analysis of an input-output model for networks with link uncertainty. It constitutes a collection of integral quadratic constraints, which together imply robust stability of the uncertain networked dynamics. Each condition is decentralized in the sense that it depends on model data pertaining to the neighbourhood of a specific agent. By contrast, pre-existing conditions for the network model are link-wise decentralized, with each involving conservatively more localized problem data. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the advantage of the new broader neighbourhood conditions.</description>

      <title>Upstream Allocation of Bidirectional Load Demand by Power Packetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power packet dispatching system has been studied for power management with strict tie to an accompanying information system through power packetization. In the system, integrated units of transfer of power and information, called power packets, are delivered through a network of apparatuses called power packet routers. This paper proposes upstream allocation of a bidirectional load demand represented by a sequence of power packets to power sources. We first develop a scheme of power packet routing for upstream allocation of load demand with full integration of power and information transfer. The routing scheme is then proved to enable packetized management of bidirectional load demand, which is of practical importance for applicability to, e.g., electric drives in motoring and regenerating operations. We present a way of packetizing the bidirectional load demand and realizing the power and information flow under the upstream allocation scheme. The viability of the proposed methods is demonstrated through experiments.</description>

      <title>Force-Limited Control of Wave Energy Converters using a Describing Function Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actuator saturation is a common nonlinearity. In wave energy conversion, force saturation conveniently limits drivetrain size and cost with minimal impact on energy generation. However, such nonlinear dynamics typically demand numerical simulation, which increases computational cost and diminishes intuition. This paper instead uses describing functions to approximate a force saturation nonlinearity as a linear impedance mismatch. In the frequency domain, the impact of controller impedance mismatch (such as force limit, finite bandwidth, or parameter error) on electrical power production is shown analytically and graphically for a generic nondimensionalized single degree of freedom wave energy converter in regular waves. Results are visualized with Smith charts. Notably, systems with a specific ratio of reactive to real mechanical impedance are least sensitive to force limits, a criteria which conflicts with resonance and bandwidth considerations. The describing function method shows promise to enable future studies such as large-scale design optimization and co-design.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Information Freshness: An AoI Optimized Markov Decision Process Dedicated In the Underwater Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean exploration utilizing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a significant research focus. However, underwater tasks have mostly failed due to the observation delay caused by acoustic communication in the Internet of underwater things. In this study, we present an AoI optimized Markov decision process (AoI-MDP) to improve the performance of underwater tasks. Specifically, AoI-MDP models observation delay as signal delay through statistical signal processing, and includes this delay as a new component in the state space. Additionally, we introduce wait time in the action space, and integrate AoI with reward functions to achieve joint optimization of information freshness and decision-making for AUVs leveraging RL for training. Finally, we apply this approach to the multi-AUV data collection task scenario as an example. Simulation results highlight the feasibility of AoI-MDP, which effectively minimizes AoI while showcasing superior performance in the task. To accelerate relevant research in this field, the code for simulation will be released as open-source in the future.</description>

      <title>A Variable Power Surface Error Function backstepping based Dynamic Surface Control of Non-Lower Triangular Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A control design for error reduction in the tracking control for a class of non-lower triangular nonlinear systems is presented by combining techniques of Variable Power Surface Error Function (VPSEF), backstepping, and dynamic surface control. At each step of design, a surface error is obtained, and based on its magnitude, the VPSEF technique decides the surface error to be used. Thus, the backstepping-based virtual and actual control law is designed to stabilize the corresponding subsystem. To address the issue of circular structure, a first-order low-pass filter is used to handle the virtual control signal at each intermediate stage of the recursive design. The stability analysis of the closed-loop system demonstrates that all signals indicate semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness. Moreover, by using the switching strategy of the control input using the VPSEF technique suitably, it is possible to ensure that the steady-state tracking error converges to a neighborhood of zero with an arbitrarily very small size. The effectiveness of the proposed concept has been verified using two different simulated demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Formation Learning Control for Cooperative AUVs under Complete Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a two-layer control framework for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) designed to handle uncertain nonlinear dynamics, including the mass matrix, previously assumed known. Unlike prior studies, this approach makes the controller independent of the robot's configuration and varying environmental conditions. The proposed framework applies across different environmental conditions affecting AUVs. It features a first-layer cooperative estimator and a second-layer decentralized deterministic learning controller. This architecture supports robust operation under diverse underwater scenarios, managing environmental effects like changes in water viscosity and flow, which impact the AUV's effective mass and damping dynamics. The first-layer estimator enables seamless inter-agent communication by sharing crucial system estimates without relying on global information. The second-layer controller uses local feedback to adjust each AUV's trajectory, ensuring accurate formation control and dynamic adaptability. Radial basis function neural networks enable local learning and knowledge storage, allowing AUVs to efficiently reapply learned dynamics after system restarts. Simulations validate the effectiveness of this framework, marking it as a significant advancement in distributed adaptive control systems for AUVs, enhancing operational flexibility and resilience in unpredictable marine environments.</description>

      <title>Open6G OTIC: A Blueprint for Programmable O-RAN and 3GPP Testing Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Softwarized and programmable Radio Access Networks (RANs) come with virtualized and disaggregated components, increasing the supply chain robustness and the flexibility and dynamism of the network deployments. This is a key tenet of Open RAN, with open interfaces across disaggregated components specified by the O-RAN ALLIANCE. It is mandatory, however, to validate that all components are compliant with the specifications and can successfully interoperate, without performance gaps with traditional, monolithic appliances. Open Testing &amp; Integration Centers (OTICs) are entities that can verify such interoperability and adherence to the standard through rigorous testing. However, how to design, instrument, and deploy an OTIC which can offer testing for multiple tenants, heterogeneous devices, and is ready to support automated testing is still an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce a blueprint for a programmable OTIC testing infrastructure, based on the design and deployment of the Open6G OTIC at Northeastern University, Boston, and provide insights on technical challenges and solutions for O-RAN testing at scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an inverse design scheme for resistive heaters. By adjusting the spatial distribution of a binary electrical resistivity map, the scheme enables objective-driven optimization of heaters to achieve pre-defined steady-state temperature profiles. The approach can be fully automated and is computationally efficient since it does not entail extensive iterative simulations of the entire heater structure. The design scheme offers a powerful solution for resistive heater device engineering in applications spanning electronics, photonics, and microelectromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-enabled Satellite Constellation Reconfiguration and Retasking for Mission-Critical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of satellite constellation applications is rapidly advancing due to increasing user demands, reduced operational costs, and technological advancements. However, a significant gap in the existing literature concerns reconfiguration and retasking issues within satellite constellations, which is the primary focus of our research. In this work, we critically assess the impact of satellite failures on constellation performance and the associated task requirements. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce a system modeling approach for GPS satellite constellations, enabling an investigation into performance dynamics and task distribution strategies, particularly in scenarios where satellite failures occur during mission-critical operations. Additionally, we introduce reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, specifically Q-learning, Policy Gradient, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), for managing satellite constellations, addressing the challenges posed by reconfiguration and retasking following satellite failures. Our results demonstrate that DQN and PPO achieve effective outcomes in terms of average rewards, task completion rates, and response times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-orbit servicing (OOS) activities will power the next big step for sustainable exploration and commercialization of space. Developing robotic capabilities for autonomous OOS operations is a priority for the space industry. Visual Servoing (VS) enables robots to achieve the precise manoeuvres needed for critical OOS missions by utilizing visual information for motion control. This article presents an overview of existing VS approaches for autonomous OOS operations with space manipulator systems (SMS). We divide the approaches according to their contribution to the typical phases of a robotic OOS mission: a) Recognition, b) Approach, and c) Contact. We also present a discussion on the reviewed VS approaches, identifying current trends. Finally, we highlight the challenges and areas for future research on VS techniques for robotic OOS.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Efficient Reward Function Searchers for Custom-Environment Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for designing reward functions demonstrates significant potential. However, achieving effective design and improvement of reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks with complex custom environments and multiple requirements presents considerable challenges. In this paper, we enable LLMs to be effective white-box searchers, highlighting their advanced semantic understanding capabilities. Specifically, we generate reward components for each explicit user requirement and employ the reward critic to identify the correct code form. Then, LLMs assign weights to the reward components to balance their values and iteratively search and optimize these weights based on the context provided by the training log analyzer, while adaptively determining the search step size. We applied the framework to an underwater information collection RL task without direct human feedback or reward examples (zero-shot). The reward critic successfully correct the reward code with only one feedback for each requirement, effectively preventing irreparable errors that can occur when reward function feedback is provided in aggregate. The effective initialization of weights enables the acquisition of different reward functions within the Pareto solution set without weight search. Even in the case where a weight is 100 times off, fewer than four iterations are needed to obtain solutions that meet user requirements. The framework also works well with most prompts utilizing GPT-3.5 Turbo, since it does not require advanced numerical understanding or calculation.</description>

      <title>USV-AUV Collaboration Framework for Underwater Tasks under Extreme Sea Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are valuable for ocean exploration due to their flexibility and ability to carry communication and detection units. Nevertheless, AUVs alone often face challenges in harsh and extreme sea conditions. This study introduces a unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-AUV collaboration framework, which includes high-precision multi-AUV positioning using USV path planning via Fisher information matrix optimization and reinforcement learning for multi-AUV cooperative tasks. Applied to a multi-AUV underwater data collection task scenario, extensive simulations validate the framework's feasibility and superior performance, highlighting exceptional coordination and robustness under extreme sea conditions. The simulation code will be made available as open-source to foster future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Mamba as a motion encoder for robotic imitation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in imitation learning, particularly with the integration of LLM techniques, are set to significantly improve robots' dexterity and adaptability. In this study, we propose using Mamba, a state-of-the-art architecture with potential applications in LLMs, for robotic imitation learning, highlighting its ability to function as an encoder that effectively captures contextual information. By reducing the dimensionality of the state space, Mamba operates similarly to an autoencoder. It effectively compresses the sequential information into state variables while preserving the essential temporal dynamics necessary for accurate motion prediction. Experimental results in tasks such as cup placing and case loading demonstrate that despite exhibiting higher estimation errors, Mamba achieves superior success rates compared to Transformers in practical task execution. This performance is attributed to Mamba's structure, which encompasses the state space model. Additionally, the study investigates Mamba's capacity to serve as a real-time motion generator with a limited amount of training data.</description>

      <title>Generalized Individual Q-learning for Polymatrix Games with Partial Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of limited observations in non-cooperative multi-agent systems where agents can have partial access to other agents' actions. We present the generalized individual Q-learning dynamics that combine belief-based and payoff-based learning for the networked interconnections of more than two self-interested agents. This approach leverages access to opponents' actions whenever possible, demonstrably achieving a faster (guaranteed) convergence to quantal response equilibrium in multi-agent zero-sum and potential polymatrix games. Notably, the dynamics reduce to the well-studied smoothed fictitious play and individual Q-learning under full and no access to opponent actions, respectively. We further quantify the improvement in convergence rate due to observing opponents' actions through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Recursively Feasible Probabilistic Safe Online Learning with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-based control has recently shown great efficacy in performing complex tasks for various applications. However, to deploy it in real systems, it is of vital importance to guarantee the system will stay safe. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer mathematical tools for designing safety-preserving controllers for systems with known dynamics. In this article, we first introduce a model-uncertainty-aware reformulation of CBF-based safety-critical controllers using Gaussian Process (GP) regression to close the gap between an approximate mathematical model and the real system, which results in a second-order cone program (SOCP)-based control design. We then present the pointwise feasibility conditions of the resulting safety controller, highlighting the level of richness that the available system information must meet to ensure safety. We use these conditions to devise an event-triggered online data collection strategy that ensures the recursive feasibility of the learned safety controller. Our method works by constantly reasoning about whether the current information is sufficient to ensure safety or if new measurements under active safe exploration are required to reduce the uncertainty. As a result, our proposed framework can guarantee the forward invariance of the safe set defined by the CBF with high probability, even if it contains a priori unexplored regions. We validate the proposed framework in two numerical simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Persuasion for Containing SIS Epidemics with Asymptomatic Infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the strategic behavior of a large population of agents who decide whether to adopt a costly partially effective protection or remain unprotected against the susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic. In contrast with most prior works on epidemic games, we assume that the agents are not aware of their true infection status while making decisions. We adopt the Bayesian persuasion framework where the agents receive a noisy signal regarding their true infection status, and maximize their expected utility computed using the posterior probability of being infected conditioned on the received signal. We characterize the stationary Nash equilibrium of this setting under suitable assumptions, and identify conditions under which partial information disclosure leads to a smaller proportion of infected individuals at the equilibrium compared to full information disclosure, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Fast System Level Synthesis: Robust Model Predictive Control using Riccati Recursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: System level synthesis enables improved robust MPC formulations by allowing for joint optimization of the nominal trajectory and controller. This paper introduces a tailored algorithm for solving the corresponding disturbance feedback optimization problem for linear time-varying systems. The proposed algorithm iterates between optimizing the controller and the nominal trajectory while converging q-linearly to an optimal solution. We show that the controller optimization can be solved through Riccati recursions leading to a horizon-length, state, and input scalability of $\mathcal{O}(N^2 ( n_x^3 +n_u^3))$ for each iterate. On a numerical example, the proposed algorithm exhibits computational speedups by a factor of up to $10^3$ compared to general-purpose commercial solvers.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Explainable Decisions in Dynamic Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic data-driven Digital Twins (DDTs) can enable informed decision-making and provide an optimisation platform for the underlying system. By leveraging principles of Dynamic Data-Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS), DDTs can formulate computational modalities for feedback loops, model updates and decision-making, including autonomous ones. However, understanding autonomous decision-making often requires technical and domain-specific knowledge. This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to provide an explainability platform for DDTs, generating natural language explanations of the system's decision-making by leveraging domain-specific knowledge bases. A case study from smart agriculture is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kalman filter is indispensable for state estimation across diverse fields but faces computational challenges with higher dimensions. Approaches such as Riccati equation approximations aim to alleviate this complexity, yet ensuring properties like bounded errors remains challenging. Yamada and Ohki introduced low-rank Kalman-Bucy filters for continuous-time systems, ensuring bounded errors. This paper proposes a discrete-time counterpart of the low-rank filter and shows its system theoretic properties and conditions for bounded mean square error estimation. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-agent Navigation with Lightweight DRL Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present an end-to-end collision avoidance policy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for multi-agent systems, demonstrating encouraging outcomes in real-world applications. In particular, our policy calculates the control commands of the agent based on the raw LiDAR observation. In addition, the number of parameters of the proposed basic model is 140,000, and the size of the parameter file is 3.5 MB, which allows the robot to calculate the actions from the CPU alone. We propose a multi-agent training platform based on a physics-based simulator to further bridge the gap between simulation and the real world. The policy is trained on a policy-gradients-based RL algorithm in a dense and messy training environment. A novel reward function is introduced to address the issue of agents choosing suboptimal actions in some common scenarios. Although the data used for training is exclusively from the simulation platform, the policy can be successfully transferred and deployed in real-world robots. Finally, our policy effectively responds to intentional obstructions and avoids collisions.
