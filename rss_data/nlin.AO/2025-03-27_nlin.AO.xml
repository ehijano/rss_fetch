      <title>Mathematical Models for Self-Adaptive Response to Cancer Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two minimal mathematical models for cancer dynamics and self-adaptation. We aim to capture the interplay between the rapid progression of cancer growth and the possibility to leverage and enhance self-adaptive defense mechanisms of an organism, e.g., motivated by immunotherapy. Yet, our two models are more abstract and generic encapsulating the essence of competition between rapid cancer growth and the speed of adaptation. First, we propose a four-dimensional ordinary differential equation model on a macroscopic level. The model has three main parameter regimes and its most important features can be studied analytically. At small external stimulation of adaptation, cancer progresses to a deadly level. At intermediate external input, a bifurcation is observed leaving behind only a locally stable cancer-free steady state. Unfortunately, in a large parameter regime after the bifurcation, a transient cancer density spike is observed. Only for a combination of external input and speeding up adaptation, cancer does not reach critical levels. To study the adaptation speed-up in the initial dynamics phase, we switch to a microscopic probabilistic model, which we study numerically. The microscopic model undergoes a sharp transition under variation of the self-adaptation probability. It is shown that a combination of temporal memory and rare stochastic positive adaptation events is crucial to move the sharp transition point to a desired regime. Despite their extreme simplicity, the two models already provide remarkably deep insight into the challenges one has to overcome to leverage/enhance the self-adaptation of an organism in fighting cancer.</description>

      <title>Human Brain State Analysis Unveils Complexity of Brain Dynamics: Insights from General Anesthesia and ADHD EEG signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19924v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex system exhibiting rich dynamical behavior across various states, including those induced by anesthesia or neurological disorders. Using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, our study investigates the underlying complexity and universal patterns in human brain dynamics across states induced by general anesthesia and neurological disorder of inattentive-type attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We extract relative phase dynamics time series, $\beta(t)$, from EEG signals and compute permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity across the different states using the framework of ordinal patterns. Our results reveal several key findings. First, different brain states exhibit distinct PE values, indicating distinct signatures of information content across states. We find an inverse correlation between entropy and the level of consciousness during general anesthesia. Further, when mapped onto the complexity-entropy causality plane, all brain states, regardless of condition, individual, or $\beta(t)$ time series, align along a single curve, suggesting an underlying universal pattern in brain dynamics. Moreover, compared to well-known stochastic processes (linear underdamped Langevin dynamics, active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and fractional Brownian motion), brain data consistently exhibits higher complexity for any given PE value. Multifractal analysis shows this enhanced complexity likely arises from greater multifractal scaling properties compared to stochastic processes. Our findings highlight the power of ordinal patterns in distinguishing various dynamic brain states and uncovering hidden universal patterns in brain dynamics. Our comprehensive characterization of human brain complexity across states offers valuable insights for future research into consciousness, attention disorders, and neural information processing.</description>

      <title>Self-construction and destruction of living transport networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological transport networks adapt through dynamic interactions between material transport and structural modification during growth and development. In this work, we present a model of transport network growth driven by local material concentration. Using an advection-diffusion framework on a metric graph with a tip growth rule, we investigate how successive construction and destruction influence network development. Our results reveal that while repeated cycles of elongation and retraction can facilitate growth enhancement, a network need to have a structure that mitigates material dissipation. This finding suggests that additional regulatory mechanisms are necessary for networks to efficiently redistribute resources following structural retraction.</description>

      <title>Supply chain network rewiring dynamics at the firm-level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supply chain networks (SCN) form the structural backbone of any society. They constitute the societal metabolism that literally produces everything for everybody by coordinating practically every single person on the planet. SCNs are by no means static but undergo permanent change through the entry and exit of firms and the re-arrangement of supply relations. Here we use a unique dataset to explore the temporal evolution of firms and their supplier-buyer relations of a national SCN. Monthly reported value added tax data from Hungary from 2014 to 2022 allows us to reconstruct the entire economy with 711,248 companies and 38,644,400 connections, covering practically every re-structuring event of an entire economy at firm-level resolution. We find that per year about 25\% of firms exit the SCN while 28\% new ones enter. On average, 55\% of all supply-links present in one year will not be present in the next. We report the half-life time of supply-links to be 13 months. New links attach super-preferentially to firms with a probability, $p(i)\propto k_i^{1.08}$, with $k_i$ firm $i$'s number of supply-connections. We calibrate a simple statistical network generation model that reproduces the stylized characteristics of the dominant Hungarian SCN. The model not only reproduces local network features such as in- and out-degree distributions, assortativity and clustering structure, but also captures realistic systemic risk profiles. We discuss the present model in how rewiring dynamics of the economy is essential for quantifying its resilience and to estimate shock propagation.</description>

      <title>Evolution of robust cell differentiation mechanisms under epigenetic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-cellular organisms, cells differentiate into multiple types as they divide. States of these cell types, as well as their numbers, are known to be robust to external perturbations; as conceptualized by Waddington's epigenetic landscape where cells embed themselves in valleys corresponding with final cell types. How is such robustness achieved by developmental dynamics and evolution? To address this question, we consider a model of cells with gene expression dynamics and epigenetic feedback, governed by a gene regulation network. By evolving the network to achieve more cell types, we identified three major differentiation mechanisms exhibiting different properties regarding their variance, attractors, stability, and robustness. The first of these mechanisms, type A, exhibits chaos and long-lived oscillatory dynamics that slowly transition until reaching a steady state. The second, type B, follows a channeled annealing process where the epigenetic changes in combination with noise shift the stable landscape of the cells towards varying final cell states. Lastly, type C exhibits a quenching process where cell fate is quickly decided by falling into pre-existing fixed points while cell trajectories are separated through periodic attractors or saddle points. We find types A and B to correspond well with Waddington's landscape while being robust. Finally, the dynamics of type B demonstrate a novel method through dimensional reduction of gene-expression states during differentiation. Correspondence with the experimental data of gene expression variance through differentiation is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Seasonal footprints on ecological time series and jumps in dynamic states of protein configurations from a non-linear forecasting method characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13811v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have analyzed phenology data and protein configurations from molecular dynamics simulations with the nonlinear forecasting method proposed by May and Sugihara. Our primary focus in this work is to characterize the dynamic state of a system by quantifying prediction quality from data. Full plots of prediction quality as a function of dimensionality $E$ and forecasting time $T_p$, the two basic parameters of the method, give fast and valuable information about Complex Systems dynamics. We detect changes in protein dynamics due to mutations and, regarding ecology data, we show how cycles and {\it rhythms} of the environment manifests in parameter space $(E,T_p)$ for some species.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian control to desynchronize Kuramoto oscillators with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. Although it is necessary for the functioning of many systems, too much synchronization can also be detrimental, e.g., (partially) synchronized brain patterns support high-level cognitive processes and bodily control, but hypersynchronization can lead to epileptic seizures and tremors, as in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease.
  Consequently, a critical research question is how to develop effective pinning control methods capable to reduce or modulate synchronization as needed.
  Although such methods exist to control pairwise-coupled oscillators, there are none for higher-order interactions, despite the increasing evidence of their relevant role in brain dynamics.
  In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a generalized control method designed to desynchronize Kuramoto oscillators connected through higher-order interactions. Our method embeds a higher-order Kuramoto model into a suitable Hamiltonian flow, and builds up on previous work in Hamiltonian control theory to analytically construct a feedback control mechanism.
  We numerically show that the proposed method effectively prevents synchronization in synthetics and empirical higher-order networks. Although our findings indicate that pairwise contributions in the feedback loop are often sufficient, the higher-order generalization becomes crucial when pairwise coupling is weak. Finally, we explore the minimum number of controlled nodes required to fully desynchronize oscillators coupled via an all-to-all hypergraphs.</description>
