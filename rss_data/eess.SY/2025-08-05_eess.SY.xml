      <title>State dimension reduction of recurrent equilibrium networks with contraction and robustness preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent equilibrium networks (RENs) are effective for learning the dynamics of complex dynamical systems with certified contraction and robustness properties through unconstrained learning. While this opens the door to learning large-scale RENs, deploying such large-scale RENs in real-time applications on resource-limited devices remains challenging. Since a REN consists of a feedback interconnection of linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamics and static activation functions, this article proposes a projection-based approach to reduce the state dimension of the LTI component of a trained REN. One of the two projection matrices is dedicated to preserving contraction and robustness by leveraging the already-learned REN contraction certificate. The other projection matrix is iteratively updated to improve the accuracy of the reduced-order REN based on necessary $h_2$-optimality conditions for LTI model reduction. Numerical examples validate the approach, demonstrating significant state dimension reduction with limited accuracy loss while preserving contraction and robustness.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Preventive and Reactive Defense Resource Allocation with Uncertain Sensor Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber attacks continue to be a cause of concern despite advances in cyber defense techniques. Although cyber attacks cannot be fully prevented, standard decision-making frameworks typically focus on how to prevent them from succeeding, without considering the cost of cleaning up the damages incurred by successful attacks. This motivates us to investigate a new resource allocation problem formulated in this paper: The defender must decide how to split its investment between preventive defenses, which aim to harden nodes from attacks, and reactive defenses, which aim to quickly clean up the compromised nodes. This encounters a challenge imposed by the uncertainty associated with the observation, or sensor signal, whether a node is truly compromised or not; this uncertainty is real because attack detectors are not perfect. We investigate how the quality of sensor signals impacts the defender's strategic investment in the two types of defense, and ultimately the level of security that can be achieved. In particular, we show that the optimal investment in preventive resources increases, and thus reactive resource investment decreases, with higher sensor quality. We also show that the defender's performance improvement, relative to a baseline of no sensors employed, is maximal when the attacker can only achieve low attack success probabilities.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of an Active Quarter Car Suspension with a Robust LQR Controller under Road Disturbance and Parameter Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle suspension is important for passengers to travel comfortably and to be less exposed to effects such as vibration and shock. A good suspension system in-creases the road holding of vehicles, allows them to take turns safely and reduces the risk of traffic accidents. Passive suspension system is the most widely used suspension system in vehicles due to its simple structure and low cost. Passive suspension systems do not have an actuator and therefore do not have a controller. Active suspension systems have an actuator and a controller. Although their structures are more complex and costly, they are safer. PID controller is widely used in active suspension systems due to its simple structure, reasonable cost and easy adjustment of coefficients. In this study, a more robust LQR controlled active suspension was designed than passive sus-pension and PID controlled active suspension. Robustness analyses were performed for passive suspension, PID controlled active suspension and LQR controlled active sus-pension. Suspension travel, sprung mass acceleration and sprung mass motion simulations were performed for all 3 suspensions under road disturbance and under simultaneous road disturbance and parameter uncertainty. A comparative analysis was performed by obtaining the suspension rise time, overshoot and settling time data. It was observed that the LQR controlled active suspension showed the least overshoot and had the shortest settling time. In this case, it was proven that the LQR controlled active suspension provided a more comfortable and safe ride compared to the other two suspension systems.</description>

      <title>Integrating Upstream Supply Chains into Generation Expansion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rising electricity demand underscores the need for secure and reliable generation expansion planning that accounts for upstream supply chain constraints. Traditional models often overlook limitations in materials, manufacturing capacity, lead times for deployment, and field availability, which can delay availability of planned resources and thus to threaten system reliability. This paper introduces a multi-stage supply chain-constrained generation expansion planning (SC-GEP) model that optimizes long-term investments while capturing material availability, production limits, spatial and temporal constraints, and material reuse from retired assets. A decomposition algorithm efficiently solves the resulting MILP. A Maryland case study shows that supply chain constraints shift technology choices, amplify deployment delays caused by lead times, and prompt earlier investment in shorter lead-time, low-material-intensity options. In the low-demand scenario, supply chain constraints raise investment costs by $1.2 billion. Under high demand, persistent generation and reserve shortfalls emerge, underscoring the need to integrate upstream constraints into long-term planning.</description>

      <title>Power System Voltage Stability Boundary: Computational Results and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to report some computational results for the theory of DAE stability boundary, with the aim of advancing applications in power system voltage stability studies. Firstly, a new regularization transformation for standard differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) is proposed. Then the existence of anchor points on voltage stability boundary is examined, and an optimization method for computing the controlling pseudo-saddle is suggested. Subsequently, a local representation of the stable manifold of the pseudo-saddle on the stability boundary is presented, and a voltage stability margin expression is obtained. Finally, the proposed results are verified using several examples, demonstrating the accuracy and effectiveness of the suggested methods.</description>

      <title>Filtering and 1/3 Power Law for Optimal Time Discretisation in Numerical Integration of Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the numerical integration of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) which govern diffusion processes driven by a standard Wiener process. With the latter being replaced by a sequence of increments at discrete moments of time, we revisit a filtering point of view on the approximate strong solution of the SDE as an estimate of the hidden system state whose conditional probability distribution is updated using a Bayesian approach and Brownian bridges over the intermediate time intervals. For a class of multivariable linear SDEs, where the numerical solution is organised as a Kalman filter, we investigate the fine-grid asymptotic behaviour of terminal and integral mean-square error functionals when the time discretisation is specified by a sufficiently smooth monotonic transformation of a uniform grid. This leads to constrained optimisation problems over the time discretisation profile, and their solutions reveal a 1/3 power law for the asymptotically optimal grid density functions. As a one-dimensional example, the results are illustrated for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>An Event-based State Estimation Approach for Positive Systems with Positive Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the problem of state observer design for continuous-time linear positive networked systems. Considering the bandwidth constraint in the communication network, an event-measurement-based positive observer design is proposed. The physical interpretation of a positive observer differs from that of a general observer. Its primary goal is to ensure that all state estimates remain non-negative at all times. Using output measurements, a law with weighted sampling error is used to determine the sampling sequence between the system and the observer. The observer dynamics are designed using the standard Luenberger structure with the event-based sampled output information, which is updated only when an event occurs. Assuming observability and sufficient conditions for the positivity of the system, the asymptotic stability of the observer dynamics with sampled information is established. Sufficient conditions of stability and positivity are derived using linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, the design ensures that the event-based architecture is free from Zeno behavior, ensuring a positive minimum bound on the inter-execution time. In addition, numerical simulations on a three-tank system having variable cross-sections are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed event-based positive observer.</description>

      <title>Grid-Forming Vector Current Control FRT Modes Under Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that operating grid-connected converters using the grid-forming vector current control (GFVCC) scheme offers significant benefits, including the simplicity and modularity of the control architecture, as well as enabling a seamless transition from PLL-based grid-following control to grid-forming. An important aspect of any grid-connected converter control strategy is the handling of grid-fault scenarios such as symmetrical and asymmetrical short-circuit faults. This paper presents several fault ride-through (FRT) strategies for GFVCC that enable the converter to provide fault current and stay synchronized to the grid while respecting the converter hardware limitations and retaining grid-forming behavior. The converter control scheme is extended in a modular manner to include negative-sequence loops, and the proposed FRT strategies address both symmetrical and asymmetrical faults. The proposed FRT strategies are analyzed through case studies, including infinite-bus setups and multi-unit grids.</description>

      <title>A Robust Cooperative Vehicle Coordination Framework for Intersection Crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative vehicle coordination at unsignalized intersections has garnered significant interest from both academia and industry in recent years, highlighting its notable advantages in improving traffic throughput and fuel efficiency. However, most existing studies oversimplify the coordination system, assuming accurate vehicle state information and ideal state update process. The oversights pose driving risks in the presence of state uncertainty and communication constraint. To address this gap, we propose a robust and comprehensive intersection coordination framework consisting of a robust cooperative trajectory planner and a context-aware status update scheduler. The trajectory planner directly controls the evolution of the trajectory distributions during frequent vehicle interactions, thereby offering probabilistic safety guarantees. To further align with coordination safety in practical bandwidth-limited conditions, we propose a context-aware status update scheduler that dynamically prioritizes the state updating order of vehicles based on their driving urgency. Simulation results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed coordination framework, showing that the collision probability can be significantly reduced while maintaining comparable coordination efficiency to state-of-theart strategies. Moreover, our proposed framework demonstrates superior effectiveness in utilizing wireless resources in practical uncertain and bandwidth-limited conditions.</description>

      <title>Improving Q-Learning for Real-World Control: A Case Study in Series Hybrid Agricultural Tractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variable and unpredictable load demands in hybrid agricultural tractors make it difficult to design optimal rule-based energy management strategies, motivating the use of adaptive, learning-based control. However, existing approaches often rely on basic fuel-based rewards and do not leverage expert demonstrations to accelerate training. In this paper, first, the performance of Q-value-based reinforcement learning algorithms is evaluated for powertrain control in a hybrid agricultural tractor. Three algorithms, Double Q-Learning (DQL), Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Double DQN (DDQN), are compared in terms of convergence speed and policy optimality. Second, a piecewise domain-specific reward-shaping strategy is introduced to improve learning efficiency and steer agent behavior toward engine fuel-efficient operating regions. Third, the design of the experience replay buffer is examined, with a focus on the effects of seeding the buffer with expert demonstrations and analyzing how different types of expert policies influence convergence dynamics and final performance. Experimental results demonstrate that (1) DDQN achieves 70\% faster convergence than DQN in this application domain, (2) the proposed reward shaping method effectively biases the learned policy toward fuel-efficient outcomes, and (3) initializing the replay buffer with structured expert data leads to a 33\% improvement in convergence speed.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Attention-Enhanced Architecture for Gravity Wave Localization in Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite images present unique challenges due to their high object variability and lower spatial resolution, particularly for detecting atmospheric gravity waves which exhibit significant variability in scale, shape, and pattern extent, making accurate localization highly challenging. This variability is further compounded by dominant unwanted objects such as clouds and city lights, as well as instrumental noise, all within a single image channel, while conventional detection methods struggle to capture the diverse and often subtle features of gravity waves across varying conditions. To address these issues, we introduce YOLO-DCAT incorporating Multi Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) and Simplified Spatial and Channel Attention (SSCA), an enhanced version of YOLOv5 specifically designed to improve gravity wave localization by effectively handling their complex and variable characteristics. MDRC captures multi-scale features through parallel dilated convolutions with varying dilation rates, while SSCA focuses on the most relevant spatial regions and channel features to enhance detection accuracy and suppress interference from background noise. In our experiments, the improved model outperformed state-of-the-art alternatives, improving mean Average Precision (mAP) by over 14% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by approximately 17%, demonstrating significantly improved localization accuracy for gravity waves in challenging satellite imagery and contributing to more precise climate research and modeling.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided denoiser network for enhanced additive manufacturing data quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern engineering systems are increasingly equipped with sensors for real-time monitoring and decision-making. However, the data collected by these sensors is often noisy and difficult to interpret, limiting its utility for control and diagnostics. In this work, we propose a physics-informed denoising framework that integrates energy-based model and Fisher score regularization to jointly reduce data noise and enforce physical consistency with a physics-based model. The approach is first validated on benchmark problems, including the simple harmonic oscillator, Burgers' equation, and Laplace's equation, across varying noise levels. We then apply the denoising framework to real thermal emission data from laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing experiments, using a trained Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) surrogate model of the LPBF process to guide denoising. Results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline neural network denoisers, effectively reducing noise under a range of LPBF processing conditions. This physics-guided denoising strategy enables robust, real-time interpretation of low-cost sensor data, facilitating predictive control and improved defect mitigation in additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Integrating Machine Learning with Multimodal Monitoring System Utilizing Acoustic and Vision Sensing to Evaluate Geometric Variations in Laser Directed Energy Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing struggles with consistent part quality due to complex melt pool dynamics and process variations. While much research targets defect detection, little work has validated process monitoring systems for evaluating melt pool dynamics and process quality. This study presents a novel multimodal monitoring framework, synergistically integrating contact-based acoustic emission (AE) sensing with coaxial camera vision to enable layer-wise identification and evaluation of geometric variations in DED parts. The experimental study used three part configurations: a baseline part without holes, a part with a 3mm diameter through-hole, and one with a 5mm through-hole to test the system's discerning capabilities. Raw sensor data was preprocessed: acoustic signals were filtered for time-domain and frequency-domain feature extraction, while camera data underwent melt pool segmentation and morphological feature extraction. Multiple machine learning algorithms (including SVM, random forest, and XGBoost) were evaluated to find the optimal model for classifying layer-wise geometric variations. The integrated multimodal strategy achieved a superior classification performance of 94.4%, compared to 87.8% for AE only and 86.7% for the camera only. Validation confirmed the integrated system effectively captures both structural vibration signatures and surface morphological changes tied to the geometric variations. While this study focuses on specific geometries, the demonstrated capability to discriminate between features establishes a technical foundation for future applications in characterizing part variations like geometric inaccuracies and manufacturing-induced defects.</description>

      <title>Tunable Leg Stiffness in a Monopedal Hopper for Energy-Efficient Vertical Hopping Across Varying Ground Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting leg stiffness.</description>

      <title>Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs for Sim2Real Edge Digital Twins of Hybrid Power Electronics Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs (PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics. This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75% reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control enhancement.</description>

      <title>Optimal control driven functional electrical stimulation: A scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Rehabilitation after a neurological impairment can be supported by functional electrical stimulation (FES). However, FES is limited by early muscle fatigue, slowing down the recovery progress. The use of optimal control to reduce overstimulation and improve motion precision is gaining interest. This review aims to map the current literature state meanwhile clarifying the best practices, identifying persistent challenges, and outlining directions for future research. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a search was conducted up to February 2024 using the combined keywords "FES", "optimal control" or "fatigue" across five databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Citation Index). Inclusion criteria included the use of optimal control with FES for healthy individuals and those with neuromuscular disorders. Results: Among the 44 included studies, half were in silico and half in vivo, involving 87 participants, predominantly healthy young men. Twelve different motor tasks were investigated, with a focus on single joint lower limb movements. These studies principally used simple FES models, modulating pulse width or intensity to track joint angle. Conclusions: Optimal control-driven FES can deliver precise motions and reduce fatigue. Yet clinical adoption is slowed down by the lack of consensus about modelling, inconvenient model identification protocol and limited validation. Additional barriers include insufficient open-science practices, computational performance reporting and the availability of customizable commercial hardware. Comparative FES model studies and longitudinal trials with large cohorts, among other efforts, are required to improve the technology readiness level. Such advances would help clinical adoption and improve patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Global Optimality in Multi-Flyby Asteroid Trajectory Optimization: Theory and Application Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing optimal trajectories for multi-flyby asteroid missions is scientifically critical but technically challenging due to nonlinear dynamics, intermediate constraints, and numerous local optima. This paper establishes a method that approaches global optimality for multi-flyby trajectory optimization under a given sequence. The original optimal control problem with interior-point equality constraints is transformed into a multi-stage decision formulation. This reformulation enables direct application of dynamic programming in lower dimensions, and follows Bellman's principle of optimality. Moreover, the method provides a quantifiable bound on global optima errors introduced by discretization and approximation assumptions, thus ensuring a measure of confidence in the obtained solution. The method accommodates both impulsive and low-thrust maneuver schemes in rendezvous and flyby scenarios. Several computational techniques are introduced to enhance efficiency, including a specialized solution for bi-impulse cases and an adaptive step refinement strategy. The proposed method is validated through three problems: 1) an impulsive variant of the fourth Global Trajectory Optimization competition problem (GTOC4), 2) the GTOC11 problem, and 3) the original low-thrust GTOC4 problem. Each case demonstrates improvements in fuel consumption over the best-known trajectories. These results give evidence of the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method in global trajectory optimization.</description>

      <title>Neural Approximators for Low-Thrust Trajectory Transfer Cost and Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Engineered over Emergent Communication in MARL for Scalable and Sample-Efficient Cooperative Task Allocation in a Partially Observable Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the efficacy of learned versus engineered communication strategies in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment. For the learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their success rates in cooperative tasks under fully and partially observable conditions. Our findings indicate that while emergent communication is viable, the engineered approach demonstrates superior performance and scalability, particularly as environmental complexity increases.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Optimal Control and Neural Networks in Asteroid Rendezvous Mission Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of the applicability and accuracy of optimal control methods and neural network-based estimators in the context of porkchop plots for preliminary asteroid rendezvous mission design. The scenario considered involves a deep-space CubeSat equipped with a low-thrust engine, departing from Earth and rendezvousing with a near-Earth asteroid within a three-year launch window. A low-thrust trajectory optimization model is formulated, incorporating variable specific impulse, maximum thrust, and path constraints. The optimal control problem is efficiently solved using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) combined with a solution continuation strategy. The neural network framework consists of two models: one predicts the minimum fuel consumption ($\Delta v$), while the other estimates the minimum flight time ($\Delta t$) which is used to assess transfer feasibility. Case results demonstrate that, in simplified scenarios without path constraints, the neural network approach achieves low relative errors across most of the design space and successfully captures the main structural features of the porkchop plots. In cases where the SCP-based continuation method fails due to the presence of multiple local optima, the neural network still provides smooth and globally consistent predictions, significantly improving the efficiency of early-stage asteroid candidate screening. However, the deformation of the feasible region caused by path constraints leads to noticeable discrepancies in certain boundary regions, thereby limiting the applicability of the network in detailed mission design phases. Overall, the integration of neural networks with porkchop plot analysis offers a effective decision-making tool for mission designers and planetary scientists, with significant potential for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Descent based Augmented Lagrangian Method for Constrained Nonconvex Nonlinear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear programming (NLP) plays a critical role in domains such as power energy systems, chemical engineering, communication networks, and financial engineering. However, solving large-scale, nonconvex NLP problems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of the solution landscape and the presence of nonlinear nonconvex constraints. In this paper, we develop a Quantum Hamiltonian Descent based Augmented Lagrange Method (QHD-ALM) framework to address largescale, constrained nonconvex NLP problems. The augmented Lagrange method (ALM) can convert a constrained NLP to an unconstrained NLP, which can be solved by using Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD). To run the QHD on a classical machine, we propose to use the Simulated Bifurcation algorithm as the engine to simulate the dynamic process. We apply our algorithm to a Power-to-Hydrogen System, and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Aerobatic maneuvers in insect-scale flapping-wing aerial robots via deep-learned robust tube model predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking, saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$ improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11 seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.</description>

      <title>Live Demonstration: Neuromorphic Radar for Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding. These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from seven users, our system achieves &gt; 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based HGR.</description>

      <title>Residual Neural Terminal Constraint for MPC-based Collision Avoidance in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time. We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF, resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties. The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.</description>

      <title>Streaming Generated Gaussian Process Experts for Online Learning and Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming \underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new distributed nonconvex stochastic optimization algorithm that can achieve privacy protection, communication efficiency and convergence simultaneously. Specifically, each node adds general privacy noises to its local state to avoid information leakage, and then quantizes its noise-perturbed state before transmitting to improve communication efficiency. By using a subsampling method controlled through the sample-size parameter, the proposed algorithm reduces cumulative differential privacy parameters {\epsilon}, {\delta}, and thus enhances the differential privacy level, which is significantly different from the existing works. By using a two-time-scale step-sizes method, the mean square convergence for nonconvex cost functions is given. Furthermore, when the global cost function satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, the convergence rate and the oracle complexity of the proposed algorithm are given. In addition, the proposed algorithm achieves both the mean square convergence and finite cumulative differential privacy parameters {\epsilon}, {\delta} over infinite iterations as the sample-size goes to infinity. A numerical example of the distributed training on the "MNIST" dataset is given to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Robust Sensor-Limited Control with Safe Input-Output Constraints for Hydraulic In-Wheel Motor Drive Mobility Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-wheel drive (IWD) systems enhance the responsiveness, traction, and maintenance efficiency of vehicles by enabling each wheel to operate independently. This paper proposes a novel robust torque-observed valve-based control (RTOVC) framework to address velocity tracking in hydraulic IWDs that actuate heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (HWMRs), considering such challenges as wheel slippages, sensor limitations, rough terrains, and modeling uncertainties. To overcome the sensor-dependent control systems associated with the closed-loop torque/pressure in hydraulic IWD-actuated HWMRs, a robust observer network based on an adaptive barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is proposed to estimate the required in-wheel motor torque to track the velocity references. Then, another adaptive BLF for valve control signals is employed to modulate the hydraulic fluid to generate the estimated torque for each IWD. The RTOVC strategy ensures user-defined safety within the logarithmic BLF framework by constraining the valve control signal, actual velocity, velocity tracking error, and torque of each hydraulic IWD in an HWMR to avoid exceeding specified limits. Despite its safety constraints, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties, robustness and uniformly exponential stability of the RTOVC-applied hydraulic IWD mechanism are ensured in HWMRs. Experimental investigations using a 6,500-kg HWMR, actuated by four independent IWDs under intense disturbances and safety-defined constraints, validate the performance of the RTOVC.</description>

      <title>Model Reference-Based Control with Guaranteed Predefined Performance for Uncertain Strict-Feedback Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the complexities posed by time- and state-varying uncertainties and the computation of analytic derivatives in strict-feedback form (SFF) systems, this study introduces a novel model reference-based control (MRBC) framework which applies locally to each subsystem (SS), to ensure output tracking performance within the specified transient and steady-state response criteria. This framework includes 1) novel homogeneous adaptive estimators (HAEs) designed to match the uncertain nonlinear SFF system to a reference model, enabling easier analysis and control design at the level, and 2) model-based homogeneous adaptive controllers enhanced by logarithmic barrier Lyapunov functions (HAC-BLFs), intended to control the reference model provided by HAEs in each SS, while ensuring the prescribed tracking responses under control amplitude saturation. The inherently robust MRBC achieves uniformly exponential stability using a generic stability connector term, which addresses dynamic interactions between the adjacent SSs. The parameter sensitivities of HAEs and HAC-BLFs in the MRBC framework are analyzed, focusing on the system's robustness and responsiveness. The proposed MRBC framework is experimentally validated through several scenarios involving an electromechanical linear actuator system with an uncertain SFF, subjected loading disturbance forces challenging 0-95% of its capacity.</description>

      <title>Semi-Data-Driven Model Predictive Control: A Physics-Informed Data-Driven Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) has emerged as a powerful technique to control complex systems without the need for extensive modeling efforts. However, relying solely on offline collected data trajectories to represent the system dynamics introduces certain drawbacks. Therefore, we present a novel semi-data-driven model predictive control (SD-MPC) framework that combines (limited) model information with DeePC to address a range of these drawbacks, including sensitivity to noisy data and a lack of robustness. In this work, we focus on the performance of DeePC in operating regimes not captured by the offline collected data trajectories and demonstrate how incorporating an underlying parametric model can counteract this issue. SD-MPC exhibits equivalent closed-loop performance as DeePC for deterministic linear time-invariant systems. Simulations demonstrate the general control performance of the proposed SD-MPC for both a linear time-invariant system and a nonlinear system modeled as a linear parameter-varying system. These results provide numerical evidence of the enhanced robustness of SD-MPC over classical DeePC.</description>

      <title>A Minimax Optimal Controller for Positive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit solution to the discrete-time Bellman equation for minimax optimal control of positive systems under unconstrained disturbances. The primary contribution of our result relies on deducing a bound for the disturbance penalty, which characterizes the existence of a finite solution to the problem class. Moreover, this constraint on the disturbance penalty reveals that, in scenarios where a solution is feasible, the problem converges to its equivalent minimization problem in the absence of disturbances.</description>

      <title>16 Ways to Gallop: Energetics and Body Dynamics of High-Speed Quadrupedal Gaits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galloping is a common high-speed gait in both animals and quadrupedal robots, yet its energetic characteristics remain insufficiently explored. This study systematically analyzes a large number of possible galloping gaits by categorizing them based on the number of flight phases per stride and the phase relationships between the front and rear legs, following Hildebrand's framework for asymmetrical gaits. Using the A1 quadrupedal robot from Unitree, we model galloping dynamics as a hybrid dynamical system and employ trajectory optimization (TO) to minimize the cost of transport (CoT) across a range of speeds. Our results reveal that rotary and transverse gallop footfall sequences exhibit no fundamental energetic difference, despite variations in body yaw and roll motion. However, the number of flight phases significantly impacts energy efficiency: galloping with no flight phases is optimal at lower speeds, whereas galloping with two flight phases minimizes energy consumption at higher speeds. We validate these findings using a quadratic programming (QP)-based controller, developed in our previous work, in Gazebo simulations. These insights advance the understanding of quadrupedal locomotion energetics and may inform future legged robot designs for adaptive, energy-efficient gait transitions.</description>

      <title>Self-sustained oscillations in discrete-time relay feedback systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining self-sustained oscillations in discrete-time linear time-invariant relay feedback systems. Concretely, we are interested in predicting when such a system admits unimodal oscillations, i.e., when the output has a single-peaked period. Under the assumption that the linear system is stable and has an impulse response that is strictly monotonically decreasing on its infinite support, we take a novel approach in using the framework of total positivity to address our main question. It is shown that unimodal self-oscillations can only exist if the number of positive and negative elements in a period coincides. Based on this result, we derive conditions for the existence of such oscillations, determine bounds on their periods, and address the question of uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Low-Bit Integerization of Vision Transformers using Operand Reordering for Efficient Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision transformers have achieved remarkable performance across various visual tasks but suffer from expensive computational and memory costs. While model quantization reduces memory usage by lowering precision, these models still incur significant computational overhead due to the dequantization before matrix operations. In this work, we analyze the computation graph and propose an integerization process based on operation reordering. Specifically, the process delays dequantization until after matrix operations. This enables integerized matrix multiplication and linear module by directly processing the quantized input. To validate our approach, we synthesize the self-attention module of ViT on a systolic array-based hardware. Experimental results show that our low-bit inference reduces per-PE power consumption for linear layer and matrix multiplication, bridging the gap between quantized models and efficient inference.</description>

      <title>Rethink Repeatable Measures of Robot Performance with Statistical Query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a specific aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly imposed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth reference) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equipment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject robot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expected value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We propose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenarios: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (ii) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracking performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing AI System Resiliency: Formulation and Guarantee for LSTM Resilience Based on Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17696v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for guaranteeing and evaluating the resilience of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in control systems. We introduce "recovery time" as a new metric of resilience in order to quantify the time required for an LSTM to return to its normal state after anomalous inputs. By mathematically refining incremental input-to-state stability ($\delta$ISS) theory for LSTM, we derive a practical data-independent upper bound on recovery time. This upper bound gives us resilience-aware training. Experimental validation on simple models demonstrates the effectiveness of our resilience estimation and control methods, enhancing a foundation for rigorous quality assurance in safety-critical AI applications.</description>

      <title>Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control for Enhanced Vehicle Dynamics with Small On-Track Data Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In vehicle trajectory tracking tasks, the simplest approach is the Pure Pursuit (PP) Control. However, this single-point preview tracking strategy fails to consider vehicle model constraints, compromising driving safety. Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control actions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its control performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling. Traditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between capturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often resulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework. This method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input based on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC calculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by adding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and interpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance optimization through residual modeling. This method has been validated on the Carsim-Matlab joint simulation platform and a physical 1:10 scale F1TENTH racing car. Experimental results show that RKMPC requires only 20% of the training data needed by traditional Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC) while delivering superior tracking performance. Compared to traditional LMPC, RKMPC reduces lateral error by 11.7%-22.1%, decreases heading error by 8.9%-15.8%, and improves front-wheel steering stability by up to 27.6%. The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/ZJU-DDRX/Residual Koopman.</description>

      <title>Improving Drone Racing Performance Through Iterative Learning MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous drone racing presents a challenging control problem, requiring real-time decision-making and robust handling of nonlinear system dynamics. While iterative learning model predictive control (LMPC) offers a promising framework for iterative performance improvement, its direct application to drone racing faces challenges like real-time compatibility or the trade-off between time-optimal and safe traversal. In this paper, we enhance LMPC with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights time-optimal tracking against centerline adherence, (2) a shifted local safe set to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates, and (3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints without the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame transformations. Results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our improved algorithm can optimize initial trajectories generated by a wide range of controllers with varying levels of tuning for a maximum improvement in lap time by 60.85%. Even applied to the most aggressively tuned state-of-the-art model-based controller, MPCC++, on a real drone, a 6.05% improvement is still achieved. Overall, the proposed method pushes the drone toward faster traversal and avoids collisions in simulation and real-world experiments, making it a practical solution to improve the peak performance of drone racing.</description>
