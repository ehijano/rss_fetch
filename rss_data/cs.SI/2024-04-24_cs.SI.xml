      <title>Mitigating Cascading Effects in Large Adversarial Graph Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant amount of society's infrastructure can be modeled using graph structures, from electric and communication grids, to traffic networks, to social networks. Each of these domains are also susceptible to the cascading spread of negative impacts, whether this be overloaded devices in the power grid or the reach of a social media post containing misinformation. The potential harm of a cascade is compounded when considering a malicious attack by an adversary that is intended to maximize the cascading impact. However, by exploiting knowledge of the cascading dynamics, targets with the largest cascading impact can be preemptively prioritized for defense, and the damage an adversary can inflict can be mitigated. While game theory provides tools for finding an optimal preemptive defense strategy, existing methods struggle to scale to the context of large graph environments because of the combinatorial explosion of possible actions that occurs when the attacker and defender can each choose multiple targets in the graph simultaneously. The proposed method enables a data-driven deep learning approach that uses multi-node representation learning and counterfactual data augmentation to generalize to the full combinatorial action space by training on a variety of small restricted subsets of the action space. We demonstrate through experiments that the proposed method is capable of identifying defense strategies that are less exploitable than SOTA methods for large graphs, while still being able to produce strategies near the Nash equilibrium for small-scale scenarios for which it can be computed. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates superior prediction accuracy on a validation set of unseen cascades compared to other deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Critical Infrastructure Facilities During Disasters Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical Infrastructure Facilities (CIFs), such as healthcare and transportation facilities, are vital for the functioning of a community, especially during large-scale emergencies. In this paper, we explore a potential application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to monitor the status of CIFs affected by natural disasters through information disseminated in social media networks. To this end, we analyze social media data from two disaster events in two different countries to identify reported impacts to CIFs as well as their impact severity and operational status. We employ state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to perform computational tasks including retrieval, classification, and inference, all in a zero-shot setting. Through extensive experimentation, we report the results of these tasks using standard evaluation metrics and reveal insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs. We note that although LLMs perform well in classification tasks, they encounter challenges with inference tasks, especially when the context/prompt is complex and lengthy. Additionally, we outline various potential directions for future exploration that can be beneficial during the initial adoption phase of LLMs for disaster response tasks.</description>

      <title>What Makes A Video Radicalizing? Identifying Sources of Influence in QAnon Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, radicalization is being increasingly attempted on video-sharing platforms. Previous studies have been proposed to identify online radicalization using generic social context analysis, without taking into account comprehensive viewer traits and how those can affect viewers' perception of radicalizing content. To address the challenge, we examine QAnon, a conspiracy-based radicalizing group, and have designed a comprehensive questionnaire aiming to understand viewers' perceptions of QAnon videos. We outline the traits of viewers that QAnon videos are the most appealing to, and identify influential factors that impact viewers' perception of the videos.</description>

      <title>Source Localization for Cross Network Information Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source localization aims to locate information diffusion sources only given the diffusion observation, which has attracted extensive attention in the past few years. Existing methods are mostly tailored for single networks and may not be generalized to handle more complex networks like cross-networks. Cross-network is defined as two interconnected networks, where one network's functionality depends on the other. Source localization on cross-networks entails locating diffusion sources on the source network by only giving the diffused observation in the target network. The task is challenging due to challenges including: 1) diffusion sources distribution modeling; 2) jointly considering both static and dynamic node features; and 3) heterogeneous diffusion patterns learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, namely CNSL, to handle the three primary challenges. Specifically, we propose to learn the distribution of diffusion sources through Bayesian inference and leverage disentangled encoders to separately learn static and dynamic node features. The learning objective is coupled with the cross-network information propagation estimation model to make the inference of diffusion sources considering the overall diffusion process. Additionally, we also provide two novel cross-network datasets collected by ourselves. Extensive experiments are conducted on both datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{CNSL} in handling the source localization on cross-networks.</description>

      <title>Deep Overlapping Community Search via Subspace Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community search (CS) aims to identify a set of nodes based on a specified query, leveraging structural cohesiveness and attribute homogeneity. This task enjoys various applications, ranging from fraud detection to recommender systems. In contrast to algorithm-based approaches, graph neural network (GNN) based methods define communities using ground truth labels, leveraging prior knowledge to explore patterns from graph structures and node features. However, existing solutions face three major limitations: 1) GNN-based models primarily focus on the disjoint community structure, disregarding the nature of nodes belonging to multiple communities. 2) These model structures suffer from low-order awareness and severe efficiency issues. 3) The identified community is subject to the free-rider and boundary effects. In this paper, we propose Simplified Multi-hop Attention Networks (SMN), which consist of three designs. First, we introduce a subspace community embedding technique called Sparse Subspace Filter (SSF). SSF enables the projection of community embeddings into distinct vector subspaces, accommodating the nature of overlapping and nesting community structures. In addition, we propose a lightweight model structure and a hop-wise attention mechanism to capture high-order patterns while improving model efficiency. Furthermore, two search algorithms are developed to minimize the latent space's community radius, addressing the challenges of free-rider and boundary effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based study of overlapping community search. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of SMN compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. SMN achieves 14.73% improvements in F1-Score and up to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration in model efficiency.</description>

      <title>Social Media and Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Cities and Societies: A Water Quality Analysis Use-case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a very important societal challenge of water quality analysis. Being one of the key factors in the economic and social development of society, the provision of water and ensuring its quality has always remained one of the top priorities of public authorities. To ensure the quality of water, different methods for monitoring and assessing the water networks, such as offline and online surveys, are used. However, these surveys have several limitations, such as the limited number of participants and low frequency due to the labor involved in conducting such surveys. In this paper, we propose a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to automatically collect and analyze water-related posts from social media for data-driven decisions. The proposed framework is composed of two components, namely (i) text classification, and (ii) topic modeling. For text classification, we propose a merit-fusion-based framework incorporating several Large Language Models (LLMs) where different weight selection and optimization methods are employed to assign weights to the LLMs. In topic modeling, we employed the BERTopic library to discover the hidden topic patterns in the water-related tweets. We also analyzed relevant tweets originating from different regions and countries to explore global, regional, and country-specific issues and water-related concerns. We also collected and manually annotated a large-scale dataset, which is expected to facilitate future research on the topic.</description>

      <title>Dynamicity-aware Social Bot Detection with Dynamic Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting social bots has evolved into a pivotal yet intricate task, aimed at combating the dissemination of misinformation and preserving the authenticity of online interactions. While earlier graph-based approaches, which leverage topological structure of social networks, yielded notable outcomes, they overlooked the inherent dynamicity of social networks -- In reality, they largely depicted the social network as a static graph and solely relied on its most recent state. Due to the absence of dynamicity modeling, such approaches are vulnerable to evasion, particularly when advanced social bots interact with other users to camouflage identities and escape detection. To tackle these challenges, we propose BotDGT, a novel framework that not only considers the topological structure, but also effectively incorporates dynamic nature of social network. Specifically, we characterize a social network as a dynamic graph. A structural module is employed to acquire topological information from each historical snapshot. Additionally, a temporal module is proposed to integrate historical context and model the evolving behavior patterns exhibited by social bots and legitimate users. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BotDGT against the leading methods that neglected the dynamic nature of social networks in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Visualization of Musical Structure using Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a framework for defining and analysing a family of graphs or networks from symbolic music information is discussed. Such graphs concern different types of elements, such as pitches, chords and rhythms, and the relations among them, and are built from quantitative or categorical data contained in digital music scores. They are helpful in visualizing musical features at once, thus leading to a computational tool for understanding the general structural elements of a music fragment. Data obtained from a digital score undergoes different analytical procedures from graph and network theory, such as computing their centrality measures and entropy, and detecting their communities. We analyze pieces of music coming from different styles, and compare some of our results with conclusions from traditional music analysis techniques.</description>

      <title>Teaching Network Traffic Matrices in an Interactive Game Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet has become a critical domain for modern society that requires ongoing efforts for its improvement and protection. Network traffic matrices are a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing networks and are broadly taught in online graph theory educational resources. Network traffic matrix concepts are rarely available in online computer network and cybersecurity educational resources. To fill this gap, an interactive game environment has been developed to teach the foundations of traffic matrices to the computer networking community. The game environment provides a convenient, broadly accessible, delivery mechanism that enables making material available rapidly to a wide audience. The core architecture of the game is a facility to add new network traffic matrix training modules via an easily editable JSON file. Using this facility an initial set of modules were rapidly created covering: basic traffic matrices, traffic patterns, security/defense/deterrence, a notional cyber attack, a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, and a variety of graph theory concepts. The game environment enables delivery in a wide range of contexts to enable rapid feedback and improvement. The game can be used as a core unit as part of a formal course or as a simple interactive introduction in a presentation.</description>

      <title>Graph Machine Learning in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs play an important role in representing complex relationships in various domains like social networks, knowledge graphs, and molecular discovery. With the advent of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a cornerstone in Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML), facilitating the representation and processing of graph structures. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in language tasks and are widely adopted in a variety of applications such as computer vision and recommender systems. This remarkable success has also attracted interest in applying LLMs to the graph domain. Increasing efforts have been made to explore the potential of LLMs in advancing Graph ML's generalization, transferability, and few-shot learning ability. Meanwhile, graphs, especially knowledge graphs, are rich in reliable factual knowledge, which can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and potentially alleviate their limitations such as hallucinations and the lack of explainability. Given the rapid progress of this research direction, a systematic review summarizing the latest advancements for Graph ML in the era of LLMs is necessary to provide an in-depth understanding to researchers and practitioners. Therefore, in this survey, we first review the recent developments in Graph ML. We then explore how LLMs can be utilized to enhance the quality of graph features, alleviate the reliance on labeled data, and address challenges such as graph heterogeneity and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Afterward, we delve into how graphs can enhance LLMs, highlighting their abilities to enhance LLM pre-training and inference. Furthermore, we investigate various applications and discuss the potential future directions in this promising field.</description>

      <title>Exploring Platform Migration Patterns between Twitter and Mastodon: A User Behavior Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent surge of users migrating from Twitter to alternative platforms, such as Mastodon, raised questions regarding what migration patterns are, how different platforms impact user behaviors, and how migrated users settle in the migration process. In this study, we elaborate on how we investigate these questions by collecting data over 10,000 users who migrated from Twitter to Mastodon within the first ten weeks following the ownership change of Twitter. Our research is structured in three primary steps. First, we develop algorithms to extract and analyze migration patterns. Second, by leveraging behavioral analysis, we examine the distinct architectures of Twitter and Mastodon to learn how user behaviors correspond with the characteristics of each platform. Last, we determine how particular behavioral factors influence users to stay on Mastodon. We share our findings of user migration, insights, and lessons learned from the user behavior study.</description>

      <title>Detection Method for Social Subsets Consisting of Anti-Network Construction for Unilateral Preference Behavior on Directed Temporal Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In existing research, as an example of one-sided preference, a conversation structure in which a person who is assumed to be an adult mainly sends one-sided messages to a person who is assumed to be a minor was observed. If subgraphs composed based on such unilateral preferences could be automatically extracted from the network structure, it would be possible to automatically detect communication conducted based on specific motivations from a vast amount of conversation data. In this study, we construct a bottom-up method to detect subgraphs composed of unilateral preferences in Greedy, and discuss the subset of unilateral preferences detected in this simulation.

      <title>Deciphering Unilateral Communication Patterns in Directed Temporal Networks: Network Role Distribution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the vast expanse of online communication, identifying unilateral preference patterns can be pivotal in understanding and mitigating risks such as predatory behavior. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to dissect and visualize such patterns in social networks. Through the lens of a directed network model, we simulate a scenario where a predominant cluster 'A' disperses information unilaterally towards a much larger, but passive, cluster 'B', while being overseen by a vigilant cluster 'C', restricted by an information blocking cluster 'D', and countered by an alerting cluster 'E'. Incorporated into this study is a simulation framework that models the flow of information across a directed network comprising various clusters with distinct roles and communication behaviors. The simulation employs a dynamic system where clusters 'A' through 'E' interact over a series of time steps, with each cluster's activity shaped by both intrinsic message-generation rules and external media influences. By tracking the accumulated media influence on each cluster, we gain a nuanced understanding of the long-term effects of media on communication patterns. The results provide a window into the cyclical nature of influence and the propagation of information, with potential applications in detecting and mitigating unilateral communication patterns that could signal harmful activities such as online predation.
  This study, therefore, presents a comprehensive approach that combines network theory, simulation modeling, and dynamic media influence analysis to explore and understand the complexities of unilateral preference communication within social networks.This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent. There are currently no plans for it to become a peer-reviewed paper.</description>

      <title>Phase Field Modeling in Social Media Dynamics:Simulation of Opinion Evolution with Feedback, Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new numerical model to simulate how information is comprehended and processed on social networks, using continuous "Phase Field Modeling" variables (phiA, phiB, phiC) to represent individual users' opinions. It captures the immediate and two-way nature of social media interactions, reproducing the spread and feedback of information. The model incorporates psychological and social factors like confirmation bias and opinion rigidity to analyze information processing and opinion development among users. It also explores the dynamics of opinion segregation and interaction in and out of filter bubbles, offering a quantitative view of opinion dynamics on platforms like social networking services (SNS). This approach combines theoretical models with real-world social network data to study the effects of information concentration on opinion formation and the phenome Phase Field Modeling of opinion polarization and echo chamber effects on SNS.

Abstract: Over the past century, the focus of scientific practices has shifted from purely intellectual exploration to problem-solving, leading to uneven development in scientific knowledge. Our analysis of 41 million research articles over the past six decades reveals this trend of uneven development, with atypical papers representing complementary innovation becoming the majority and displacement papers representing substitutive innovation decreasing to the minority. While AI can enhance human memory capacity, it may not necessarily accelerate progress in canonical concepts without changing the agenda of science and its organization.</description>

Abstract: Graph generation has emerged as a crucial task in machine learning, with significant challenges in generating graphs that accurately reflect specific properties. Existing methods often fall short in efficiently addressing this need as they struggle with the high-dimensional complexity and varied nature of graph properties. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Graph Generator (NGG), a novel approach which utilizes conditioned latent diffusion models for graph generation. NGG demonstrates a remarkable capacity to model complex graph patterns, offering control over the graph generation process. NGG employs a variational graph autoencoder for graph compression and a diffusion process in the latent vector space, guided by vectors summarizing graph statistics. We demonstrate NGG's versatility across various graph generation tasks, showing its capability to capture desired graph properties and generalize to unseen graphs. This work signifies a significant shift in graph generation methodologies, offering a more practical and efficient solution for generating diverse types of graphs with specific characteristics.</description>
