      <title>Chemotaxis models with signal-dependent sensitivity and a logistic-type source, I: Boundedness and global existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study, in Part I of this series, boundedness and global existence of positive classical solutions to a parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with signal-dependent sensitivity and a logistic-type source on a bounded smooth domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$: \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle u_t=\Delta u-\chi_0\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{u^m}{(1+v)^\beta}\nabla v\right)+au-bu^{1+\alpha}, &amp; x\in\Omega, \cr
  \displaystyle 0=\Delta v-\mu v+\nu u^\gamma, &amp; x\in\Omega, \cr
  \displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}=0, &amp; x\in\partial\Omega.
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} Here, $u$ denotes the population density and $v$ the chemical concentration. The parameters $\alpha,\gamma,m,\mu,\nu$ are positive, $\chi_0$ is real, and $a,b,\beta$ are nonnegative. We analyze boundedness from three viewpoints: negative chemotaxis ($\chi_0&lt;0$), the strength of the nonlinear cross diffusion rate $\frac{u^m}{(1+v)^\beta}$, and the strength of the logistic-type damping $u(a-bu^\alpha)$. Under explicit conditions reflecting these mechanisms, all positive classical solutions remain bounded. Moreover, when $m\ge 1$, boundedness implies global existence. Although the decay of $\chi(v) = \dfrac{\chi_0}{(1+v)^\beta}$ for large $v$ has a damping effect, it also introduces new analytical difficulties; our techniques yield, for example, global existence for $m=1$ provided that \begin{equation*}
  \beta&gt;\max\left\{1,\frac12+\frac{\chi_0}{4}\max\{2,\gamma N\}\right\}. \end{equation*} Several known results for special cases are recovered. Part II is devoted to the asymptotic behavior of globally defined solutions, including uniform persistence as well as stability and bifurcation of positive constant equilibria.</description>

      <title>Relations between principal eigenvalue and torsional rigidity with Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the torsional rigidity and the principal eigenvalue related to the Laplace operator with Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions. The goal is to find upper and lower bounds to products of suitable powers of the quantities above in the class of Lipschitz domains. The threshold exponent for the Robin case is explicitly recovered and shown to be strictly smaller than in the Dirichlet one.</description>

      <title>Moisture dynamics with phase changes coupled to heat-conducting, compressible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a model coupling the heat-conducting compressible Navier-Stokes equations to a micro-physics model of moisture in air is locally strongly well-posed for large data in suitable function spaces and strongly well-posed on $[0,\tau]$ for every $\tau &gt; 0$ for small initial data. This seems to be the first result on $[0,\tau]$ for arbitrary $\tau &gt; 0$ for a model coupling moisture dynamics to heat-conducting, compressible Navier-Stokes equations. A key feature of the micro-physics model is that it also includes phase changes of water in moist air. These phase changes are associated with large amounts of latent heat and thus result in a strong coupling to the thermodynamic equation. The well-posedness results are obtained by means of a Lagrangian approach, which allows to treat the hyperbolicity in the continuity equation. More precisely, optimal $\mathrm{L}^p$-$\mathrm{L}^q$ estimates are shown for the linearized system, leading to the local well-posedness result by a fixed point argument and suitable nonlinear estimates. For the well-posedness result on $[0,\tau]$ for arbitrary $\tau &gt; 0$, a refined analysis of the linearized problem close to equilibria is carried out, and the roughness of the source term, induced by the phase changes, requires to establish delicate a priori bounds.</description>

Abstract: The one-dimensional nonlocal Kirchhoff type bifurcation problems which are derived from logistic equation of population dynamics are studied. We obtain the precise asymptotic shapes of $L^2$ bifurcation curves $\lambda = \lambda(\alpha)$ as $\alpha \to \infty$, where $\alpha:= \Vert u_\lambda \Vert_2$.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Branches of Non-Radial Solutions to Semilinear Elliptic Systems on a Unit Ball in $\mathbb R^3$ and Their Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate symmetry-breaking phenomena in semilinear elliptic systems on the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$, focusing on the emergence of non-radial solution branches with prescribed spatial and internal symmetries. Extending previous scalar results, we develop a framework for systems equivariant under $G := O(3) \times \Gamma \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, where $\Gamma$ is a finite group encoding coupling symmetries. Using the $G$-equivariant Leray--Schauder degree and Burnside ring techniques, we derive computable criteria for the existence of unbounded branches of non-radial solutions and classify their isotropy types. Our approach accommodates non-simple eigenvalue multiplicities and provides explicit bifurcation conditions in terms of spectral resonance between coupling eigenvalues and spherical Laplacian modes. Applications to coupled spherical oscillators illustrate how Platonic symmetries and internal permutations interact to produce complex patterns. These results establish a general method for detecting and characterizing symmetry-breaking in high-dimensional elliptic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the solution structures of Serrin-type overdetermined problems with Kirchhoff-type nonlocal terms. We prove that the exact number of solutions is the same as those of some transcendental equations defined by the nonlocal terms. We also obtain the explicit form of solutions by using the unique solutions of the overdetermined problems without the nonlocal terms.</description>

      <title>On self-similar singular solutions to a vorticity stretching equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following model equation: \begin{equation}
  \omega_{t} = Z_{11}\omega\,\omega , \end{equation} where \begin{equation}
  Z_{11} = \partial_{11}\Delta^{-1} \end{equation} is a Calderon-Zygmond operator. We get the existence of self-similar singular solutions with a special form. The main difficulty is the degeneracy of the operator $Z_{11}$ that is overcome by the spectral uncertainty principle. We also show that the solution to this model blows up in finite time if the initial datum is compactly supported and has a positive integral.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the three-dimensional non-isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations under a scaling-invariant smallness condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem of the non-isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with far-field vacuum. By deriving delicate energy estimates and exploiting the intrinsic structure of the system, we establish the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions provided that the scaling-invariant quantity \begin{align*} (1+\bar{\rho}+\tfrac{1}{\bar{\rho}}) [\|\rho_{0}\|_{L^{3}}+ ( \bar{\rho}^{2}+\bar{\rho})( \| \sqrt{\rho_{0}}u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+\| b_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}) ] [\|\nabla u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+(\bar{\rho}+1)\|\sqrt{\rho_{0}} \theta_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+\| \nabla b_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}+\| b_{0}\|_{L^{4}}^{4} ] \end{align*} is sufficiently small, where $\bar{\rho}$ denotes the essential supremum of the initial density. Our result may be regarded as an improved version compared with that of Liu and the second author (J. Differential Equations 336 (2022), pp. 456--478) in the sense that an artificial condition $3\mu&gt;\lambda$ on the viscosity coefficients is removed. In particular, we provide a new scaling-invariant quantity regarding the initial data.</description>

      <title>On global classical and weak solutions with arbitrary large initial data to the multi-dimensional viscous Saint-Venant system and compressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to the BD entropy condition under spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1871, Saint-Venant introduced the renowned shallow water equations. Since then, for the two-dimensional viscous or inviscid shallow water equations, the global existence of smooth solutions with arbitrarily large initial data has remained a challenging and long-standing open problem. In this paper, we provide an affirmative resolution to the viscous problem under the assumption of two-dimensional radial symmetry. Specifically, we establish the global existence of smooth solutions for the two-dimensional radially symmetric viscous shallow water equations with arbitrary smooth initial data. To achieve this goal, our approach relies crucially on overcoming two major obstacles: first, treating the viscous Saint-Venant system as the endpoint case of the BD entropy condition for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations; and second, addressing the critical embedding imposed by the spatial dimension, which currently holds only in two dimensions. However, the same result can be extended to three dimension for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying general BD entropy conditions excluding the endpoint case. Indeed, under the same symmtric framework, we also prove the global existence of smooth solutions for arbitrarily large initial data for both the two- and three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to the BD entropy condition. It is particularly noteworthy that the aforementioned shallow water equations precisely correspond to the endpoint case of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying the BD entropy condition.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear asymptotic stability and optimal decay rate around the three-dimensional Oseen vortex filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the high-Reynolds-number regime, this work investigates the long-time dynamics of the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations near the Oseen vortex filament. The flow exhibits a strong interplay between vortex stretching, shearing, and mixing, which generates ever-smaller spatial scales and thereby significantly amplifies viscous effects. By adopting an anisotropic self-similar coordinate system adapted to the filament geometry, we establish the nonlinear asymptotic stability of the Oseen vortex filament. All non-axisymmetric perturbations are shown to decay at the optimal rate $t^{-\kappa |\alpha|^{1/2}}$. At the linear level, this decay mechanism corresponds to a sharp spectral lower bound $\Sigma(\alpha) \sim |\alpha|^{1/2}$ for the nonlocal Oseen operator $L_\perp - \alpha \Lambda_\perp$, and we identify an explicit spectral point attaining this optimal bound. Combined with the spectral estimates obtained in \cite{LWZ}, our analysis fully resolves the conjecture proposed in \cite{GM} concerning the asymptotic scaling laws for the spectral and pseudospectral bounds $\Sigma(\alpha)$ and $\Psi(\alpha)$. These results provide a rigorous mathematical explanation for the shear-mixing mechanism in the vicinity of the 3D Oseen vortex filament.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of Pseudo-Parabolic Gradient Systems with State-Dependent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a general mathematical framework for pseudo-parabolic gradient systems with state-dependent dynamics. The state dependence is induced by variable coefficient fields in the governing energy functional. Such coefficients arise naturally in scientific and technological models, including state-dependent mobilities in KWC-type grain boundary motion and variable orientation-adaptation operators in anisotropic image denoising. We establish two main results: the existence of energy-dissipating solutions, and the uniqueness and continuous dependence on initial data. The proposed framework yields a general well-posedness theory for a broad class of nonlinear evolutionary systems driven by state-dependent operators. As illustrative applications, we present an anisotropic image-denoising model and a new pseudo-parabolic KWC-type model for anisotropic grain boundary motion, and prove that both fit naturally within the abstract structure of $(\mathrm{S})_\nu$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the micropolar fluid flow through a thin domain assuming zero Dirichlet boundary condition on the top boundary, which is rapidly oscillating, and non-standard boundary conditions on the flat bottom. Assuming ``Reynolds roughness regime", in which the thickness of the domain is very small compared to the wavelenth of the roughness (i.e. a very slight roughness), we rigorously derive a generalized Reynolds equation for pressure clearly showing the roughness-induced effects. Moreover, we give expressions for the average velocity and microrotation.</description>

      <title>A multiscale framework integrating within-host infection kinetics with airborne transmission dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling within-host infection dynamics with population-level transmission remains a major challenge in infectious disease modeling, especially for airborne pathogens with potential to spread indoor. The frequent emergence of such diseases highlight the need for integrated frameworks that capture both individual-level infection kinetics and between-host transmission. While analytical models for each scale exist, tractable approaches that link them remain limited. In this study, we present a novel multiscale mathematical framework that integrates within-host infection kinetics with airborne transmission dynamics. The model represents each host as a patch and couples a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing in-host infection kinetics with a diffusion-based partial differential equation (PDE) for airborne pathogen movement in enclosed spaces. These scales are linked through boundary conditions on each patch boundary, representing viral shedding and inhalation. Using matched asymptotic analysis in the regime of intermediate diffusivity, we derived a nonlinear ODE model from the coupled ODE-PDE system that retains spatial heterogeneity through Neumann Green's functions. We established the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of solutions to the reduced model and analyzed within-host infection kinetics as functions of the airborne pathogen diffusion rate and host spatial configuration. In the well-mixed limit, the model recovers the classical target cell limited viral dynamics framework. Overall, the proposed multiscale modeling approach enables the simultaneous study of transient within-host infection dynamics and population-level disease spread, providing a tractable yet biologically grounded framework for investigating airborne disease transmission in indoor environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Schr\"{o}dinger equations with potentials which grow at most quadratically at spatial infinity, we prove Strichartz estimates in Wiener amalgam spaces. These estimates provide a stronger recovery of local-in-space regularity than the classical Strichartz estimates in Lebesgue spaces. Our result is a generalization of the results on Strichartz estimates in Wiener amalgam spaces by Cordero and Nicola, which are stated for the potentials $V(x) = 0,|x|^2/2, -|x|^2/2$.</description>

      <title>Linear systems, determinants and solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(-A,B,C)$ be a linear system in continuous time $t&gt;0$ with input and output space ${\mathbb C}$ and state space $H$. The scattering (or impulse response) functions $\phi_{(x)}(t)=Ce^{-(t+2x)A}B$ determines a Hankel integral operator $\Gamma_{\phi_{(x)}}$; if $\Gamma_{\phi_{(x)}}$ is trace class, then the Fredholm determinant $\tau (x)=\det (I+\Gamma_{\phi_{(x)}})$ determines the tau function of $(-A,B,C)$. The paper establishes properties of algebras including $R_x = \int_x^\infty e^{-tA}BCe^{-tA}\,dt$ on $H$, and obtains solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili PDE. P\"oppe's semi-additive operators are identified with orbits of a shift action on integral kernels, and P\"oppe's bracket operation is expressed in terms of the Fedosov product. The paper shows that the Fredholm determinant $\det (I+R_x)$ gives an effective method for numerical computation of solutions of $KP$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a local self-improving property for the gradient of very weak solutions to degenerate parabolic double-phase systems. The result is based on a reverse H\"older inequality with constants that are independent of the solution. Delicate methods are required to avoid a self-referential argument. In particular, we develop a new phase analysis method.</description>

      <title>Carleson-type removability for $p$-parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize removable sets for H\"older continuous solutions to degenerate parabolic equations of $p$-growth. A sufficient and necessary condition for a set to be removable is given in terms of an intrinsic parabolic Hausdorff measure, which depends on the considered H\"older exponent. We present a new method to prove the sufficient condition, which relies only on fundamental properties of the obstacle problem and supersolutions, and applies to a general class of operators. For the necessity of the condition, we establish the H\"older continuity of solutions with measure data, provided the measure satisfies a suitable decay property. The techniques developed in this article provide a new point of view even in the case $p=2$.</description>

      <title>Weak Error on the densities for the Euler scheme of stable additive SDEs with Besov drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the Euler-Maruyama dicretization of the formal SDE, $dX_t=b(t,X_t)dt+dZ_t$, where $Z$ is a symmetric isotropic d dimensional stable process of index $\alpha\in (1,2)$, and $b$ is distributional. It belongs to a mix Lebesgue-Besov space. The associated parameters satisfy some constraints which guarantee weak-well posedness. Defining an appropriate Euler scheme, we obtain a convergence rate for the weak error on the densities. The rate depends on the parameters.</description>

      <title>A Nonhomogeneous Boundary-Value Problem For The Nonlinear KdV Equation on Star Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a boundary-value problem for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation on a star-graph structure. We develop a unified framework introducing the notion of $s$-compatibility, which generalizes classical compatibility conditions to star-shaped and more complex graph configurations, inspired by the works of Bona, Sun, and Zhang [14]. By combining analytical techniques with a fixed-point argument, we establish sharp global well-posedness for both the linear and nonlinear problems at the $H^s$ level. In this setting, our results extend the classical analysis for a single KdV equation [14] to star-shaped graphs composed of $N$ equations. These results provide the first comprehensive well-posedness theory for KdV equations with coupled boundary conditions on graphs. Although control issues are not treated in this article, the analytic results obtained here address several open problems, which will be addressed in a forthcoming</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from pointwise gradient estimates for the heat semigroup, we study three characterizations of weak lower curvature bounds on metric graphs. More precisely, we prove the equivalence between a weak notion of the Bakry-\'Emery curvature condition, a weak Evolutionary Variational Inequality and a weak form of geodesic convexity. The proof is based on a careful regularization of absolutely continuous curves together with an explicit representation of the Cheeger energy. We conclude with a brief discussion on possible applications to the Schr\"odinger bridge problem on metric graphs.</description>

      <title>Trace theory for parabolic boundary value problems with rough boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the trace spaces arising from intersections of weighted, vector-valued Sobolev spaces, where the weights are powers of the distance to the boundary. These weighted function spaces are particularly suitable for treating boundary value problems where derivatives of the solution blow up at the boundary. As an application of our trace theory, we prove well-posedness for the heat equation with rough inhomogeneous boundary data in Sobolev spaces of higher regularity in domains of fixed regularity $C^{1,\kappa}$, with $\kappa \in [0,1)$.</description>

      <title>On a relaxed Cahn-Hilliard tumour growth model with single-well potential and degenerate mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a phase-field system modelling solid tumour growth. This system consists of a Cahn-Hilliard equation coupled with a nutrient equation. The former is characterised by a degenerate mobility and a singular potential. Both equations are subject to suitable reaction terms which model proliferation and nutrient consumption. Chemotactic effects are also taken into account. Adding an elliptic regularisation, depending on a relaxation parameter $\delta&gt;0$, in the equation for the chemical potential, we prove the existence of a weak solution to an initial and boundary value problem for the relaxed system. Then, we let $\delta$ go to zero, and we recover the existence of a weak solution to the original system.</description>

Abstract: We solve the capillary $L_p$-Christoffel--Minkowski problem in the half-space for $1&lt;p&lt;k+1$ in the class of even hypersurfaces. A crucial ingredient is a non-collapsing estimate that yields lower bounds for both the height and the capillary support function.

      <description>arXiv:2512.15475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ ($N \geq 3$) with smooth boundary $\partial \Omega$ and $\Sigma$ be a closed submanifold contained on $\partial \Omega$ and containing $0$. We are interesting in the existence of positive $H^1(\Omega)$-solution of the following Hardy-Sobolev trace type equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\Delta u+u=0 \qquad &amp; \textrm{ in $\Omega$}\\\\ \displaystyle\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}= \rho_{\Sigma}^{-s} u^{q_s-1} \qquad &amp; \textrm{ on $\partial \Omega$}, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\nu$ is the unit outer normal of $\partial \Omega$, $\rho_\Sigma: \partial \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is the distance function in $\partial \Omega$ to the curve $\Sigma$: $$ \rho_\Sigma(x):= \inf_{y \in \Sigma} d_{\tilde{g}}(x, y) $$ and for $0\leq s &lt;1$, $q_s:=\frac{2(N-s)}{N-1}$ is the critical Hardy-Sobolev exponent. The existence of solution may depend on the local geometry of the boundary $\partial \Omega$ and $\Sigma$ at $0$ or in the shapes of the domain $\Omega$ and its boundary $\partial \Omega$.</description>

      <title>A plethora of fully localised solitary waves for the full-dispersion Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KP-I equation arises as a weakly nonlinear model equation for gravity-capillary waves with Bond number $\beta&gt;1/3$, also called strong surface tension. This equation has recently been shown to have a family of nondegenerate, symmetric `fully localised' or `lump' solitary waves which decay to zero in all spatial directions. The full-dispersion KP-I equation is obtained by retaining the exact dispersion relation in the modelling from the water-wave problem. In this paper we show that the FDKP-I equation also has a family of symmetric fullly localised solitary waves which are obtained by casting it as a perturbation of the KP-I equation and applying a suitable variant of the implicit-function theorem.</description>

      <title>Effective Equations for a Compressible Liquid-Vapor Flow Model with Highly Oscillating Initial Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and justify a new effective model for a compressible viscous liquid-vapor flow on a spray-like scale, i.e., for settings with a large number of phase boundaries. As a model on the detailed scale, we start from a parabolic relaxation of the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system. We consider a sequence of initial data where the sequence of initial densities is assumed to be highly oscillating mimicking the high number of phase boundaries initially. Then, we consider a sequence of finite energy weak solutions corresponding to the sequence of initial data. Anticipating that the effective equations are found in the limit of infinitely many initial phase changes, we interpret the densities as Young measures and prove the convergence of the sequence of solutions to the effective model. The effective model consists of a deterministic part for the fluid's hydrodynamic quantities and a kinetic equation for the limit Young measure encoding the mixing dynamics. By characterizing the Young measure with the corresponding cumulative distribution function, we rewrite the kinetic equation for the Young measure into a kinetic equation for the cumulative distribution function such that the resulting equations are accessible by standard approximation methods.</description>

      <title>What does it mean for a 3D star-shaped scatterer to be small in the time domain?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the frequency domain wave scattering problems, obstacles can be effectively replaced by point scatterers as soon as the wavelength of the incident wave exceeds significantly their diameter. The situation is less clear in the time domain, where recent works suggest the presence of an additional temporal scale that quantifies the smallness of the obstacle. In this paper we argue that this is not necessarily the case, and that it is possible to construct asymptotic models with an error that does not deteriorate in time, at least in the case of a sound-soft scattering problem by a star-shaped obstacle in 3D.</description>

      <title>Variational solutions of the Dirichlet problem, Lebesgue's cusp and non-local properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent result from [AtES24] allows one to define variational solutions of the Dirichlet problem for general continuous boundary data. We establish basic properties of this notion of solution and show that it coincides with the Perron solution. Variational solutions can elegantly be characterised in terms of the given boundary function when the variational solution has finite energy. However, it is impossible to decide in terms of the regularity of the given boundary function when a classical solution exists. We demonstrate this by analysing Lebesgue's cusp, and more precisely Lebesgue's domain which is associated with the potential of a thin rod with mass density going to zero at one end. We also show that the non-continuity of the Perron solution at a singular point is a generic and non-local property.</description>

Under the assumption that the solution is nonsmooth at the initial time, we investigate the uniqueness, stability, and convergence of the scheme. Furthermore, we prove that the scheme achieves second-order convergence in both time and space. Finally, corresponding numerical examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Continuous data assimilation for 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous data assimilation methods, such as the nudging algorithm introduced by Azouani, Olson, and Titi (AOT) [2], are known to be highly effective in deterministic settings for asymptotically synchronizing approximate solutions with observed dynamics. In this work, we extend this framework to a stochastic regime by considering the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to either additive or multiplicative noise. We establish sufficient conditions on the nudging parameter and the spatial observation scale that guarantee convergence of the nudged solution to the true stochastic flow.
  In the case of multiplicative noise, convergence holds in expectation, with exponential or polynomial rates depending on the growth of the noise covariance. For additive noise, we obtain the exponential convergence both in expectation and pathwise. These results yield a stochastic generalization of the AOT theory, demonstrating how the interplay between random forcing, viscous dissipation and feedback control governs synchronization in stochastic fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Estimates for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations: the effects of forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical estimates for the Navier-Stokes equations are traditionally expressed in terms of the Grashof number, which is a dimensionless measure of the magnitude of the forcing and hence a control parameter of the system. However, experimental measurements and statistical theories of turbulence are based on the Reynolds number. Thus, a meaningful comparison between mathematical and physical results requires a conversion of the mathematical estimates to a Reynolds-dependent form. In two dimensions, this was achieved under the assumption that the second derivative of the forcing is square integrable. Nonetheless, numerical simulations have shown that the phenomenology of turbulence is sensitive to the degree of regularity of the forcing. Therefore, we extend the available estimates for the energy and enstrophy dissipation rates as well as the attractor dimension to forcings in the Sobolev space of order $s$; i.e. forcings whose Fourier coefficients decay with the wavenumber $k$ faster than $k^{-s-1}$. We consider the range $-1\leqslant s\leqslant 2$, where $s=2$ corresponds to the known estimates, and $s=-1$ is the smallest value of $s$ for which weak solutions are known to exist. The main result is the existence of three distinct regimes as a function of the regularity of the forcing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the a priori estimates and the existence results for solutions of a general class of fully non-linear equations on noncompact K\"{a}hler and Hermitian manifolds. As geometric applications, we can construct K\"{a}hler metrics with some prescribed volume forms on strictly pseudoconvex domains; and we can construct complete Chern-Einstein metrics on Hermitian manifolds with bounded geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider evolutionary equations as introduced by R.\ Picard in 2009 and develop a general theory for approximation which can be seen as a theoretical foundation for numerical analysis for evolutionary equations. To demonstrate the approximation result, we apply it to a spatial discretisation of the heat equation using spectral methods.</description>

      <title>A modified Bakry-\'Emery $\Gamma_2$ criterion inequality and the monotonicity of the Tsallis entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bakry-\'Emery $\Gamma_2$ criterion inequality provides a method for establishing the logarithmic Sobolev inequality. We prove a one-parameter family of weighted Bakry-\'Emery $\Gamma_2$ criterion inequalities which in the limit case yields the improved constant due to Ji \cite{Ji24}. Furthermore, we establish a modified weighted $\Gamma_2$ criterion inequality which could be interpreted as a monotonicity of the Tsallis entropy under the heat flow and yields a family of sharp Sobolev inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be sectorial operators in a Banach space $X$ of angles $\omega_A$ and $\omega_B$, respectively, where $\omega_A+\omega_B&lt;\pi$. We present a simple and common approach to results on closedness of the operator sum $A+B$, based on Littlewood-Paley type norms and tools from several interpolation theories. This allows us to give short proofs for the well-known results due to Da~Prato-Grisvard and Kalton-Weis. We prove a new result in $\ell^q$-interpolation spaces and illustrate it with a maximal regularity result for abstract parabolic equations. Our approach also yields a new proof for the Dore-Venni result.</description>

Abstract: We consider a nonlinear parabolic problem with nonlinear dynamical boundary conditions of pure-reactive type in a media perforated by periodically distributed holes of size $\varepsilon$. The novelty of our work is to consider a nonlinear model where the nonlinearity also appears in the boundary. The existence and uniqueness of solution is analyzed. Moreover, passing to the limit when $\varepsilon$ goes to zero, a new nonlinear parabolic problem defined on a unified domain without holes with zero Dirichlet boundary condition and with extra-terms coming from the influence of the nonlinear dynamical boundary conditions is rigorously derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.02445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the homogenization of the reaction-diffusion equations in a domain containing periodically distributed holes of size $\varepsilon$, with a dynamical boundary condition of reactive-diffusive type, i.e., we consider the following nonlinear boundary condition on the surface of the holes $$ \nabla u_\varepsilon \cdot \nu+\varepsilon\,\displaystyle\frac{\partial u_\varepsilon}{\partial t}=\varepsilon\,\delta \Delta_{\Gamma}u_\varepsilon-\varepsilon\,g(u_\varepsilon), $$ where $\Delta_{\Gamma}$ denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the surface of the holes, $\nu$ is the outward normal to the boundary, $\delta&gt;0$ plays the role of a surface diffusion coefficient and $g$ is the nonlinear term. We generalize our previous results established in the case of a dynamical boundary condition of pure-reactive type, i.e., with $\delta=0$. We prove the convergence of the homogenization process to a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation whose diffusion matrix takes into account the reactive-diffusive condition on the surface of the holes.</description>

Abstract: Loeper's condition in \cite{Loe09} and the quantitatively quasi-convex condition (QQconv) from \cite{GK15} are synthetic expressions of the analytic MTW condition from \cite{TW} since they only require $C^2$ differentiability of the cost function $c$. When the cost function $c$ is $C^4$, it is known that the two synthetic MTW conditions are equivalent to the analytic MTW condition. However, when the cost function has regularity weaker than $C^4$, it is not known that if the two synthetic MTW conditions are equivalent. In this paper, we show the equivalence of the synthetic MTW conditions when the cost function has only $C^2$ regularity.</description>

      <title>A complete characterization of sharp thresholds to spherically symmetric multidimensional pressureless Euler-Poisson systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euler-Poisson (EP) system models the dynamics of a variety of physical processes, including charge transport, collisional plasmas, and certain cosmological wave phenomena. In this work, we establish sharp critical threshold conditions that distinguish global-in-time regularity from finite-time breakdown for solutions of the radially symmetric, multidimensional pressureless EP system. Overall, there are two cases: with and without background ($c&gt;0, c=0$ respectively). For $c&gt;0$, we obtain precise thresholds assuming a periodicity condition. A key feature of our approach is that it extends seamlessly to the zero background case, where we obtain sharp thresholds without imposing any additional assumptions. In particular, the framework accommodates initial velocities that may be negative, allowing the flow to be directed toward the origin. The main analytical challenge of deriving threshold conditions for EP systems stems from the intricate coupling of various local/nonlocal forces. To overcome this, we identify a novel nonlinear quantity that plays a decisive role in the analysis and enables a unified treatment of all relevant scenarios. Our results provide a comprehensive characterization of critical thresholds for the pressureless EP system in multiple dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We study a model for lithium (Li) electrodeposition on Li-metal electrodes that leads to dendritic pattern formation. The model comprises of a system of three coupled PDEs, taking the form of an Allen--Cahn equation, a Nernst--Planck equation and a Poisson equation. We prove existence of a weak solution and stability results for this system and present numerical simulations resulting from a finite element approximation of the system, which illustrate the dendritic nature of solutions to the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the recovery of multi-layer structures in inverse conductivity problem by using one measurement. First, we define the concept of Generalized Polarization Tensors (GPTs) for multi-layered medium and show some important properties of the proposed GPTs. With the help of GPTs, we present the perturbation formula for general multi-layered medium. Then we derive the perturbed electric potential for multi-layer concentric disks structure in terms of the so-called generalized polarization matrix, whose dimension is the same as the number of the layers. By delicate analysis, we derive an algebraic identity involving the geometric and material configurations of multi-layer concentric disks. This enables us to reconstruct the multi-layer structures by using only one partial-order measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a fractional Plateau's problem dealing with sets with prescribed non-local mean curvature. This problem can be seen as a non-local counterpart of the classical Massari's Problem. We obtain existence and regularity results, relying on a suitable version of the non-local theory for almost minimal sets. In this framework, the fractional curvature term in the energy functional can be interpreted as a perturbation of the fractional perimeter. In addition, we also discuss stickiness phenomena for non-local almost minimal sets.</description>

      <title>The Nelson conjecture and chain rule property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p\ge 1$ and let $\boldsymbol{v} \colon \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R^d$ be a compactly supported vector field with $\boldsymbol{v} \in L^p(\mathbb R^d)$ and $\operatorname{div} \boldsymbol{v} = 0$ (in the sense of distributions). It was conjectured by Nelson that it $p=2$ then the operator $\mathsf{A}(\rho) := \boldsymbol{v} \cdot \nabla \rho$ with the domain $D(\mathsf A)=C_0^\infty(\mathbb R^d)$ is essentially skew-adjoint on $L^2(\mathbb R^d)$. A counterexample to this conjecture for $d\ge 3$ was constructed by Aizenmann. From recent results of Alberti, Bianchini, Crippa and Panov it follows that this conjecture is false even for $d=2$.
  Nevertheless, we prove that for $d=2$ the condition $p\ge 2$ is necessary and sufficient for the following chain rule property of $\boldsymbol{v}$: for any $\rho \in L^\infty(\mathbb R^2)$ and any $\beta\in C^1(\mathbb R)$ the equality $\operatorname{div}(\rho \boldsymbol{v}) = 0$ implies that $\operatorname{div}(\beta(\rho) \boldsymbol{v}) = 0$.
  Furthermore, for $d=2$ we prove that $\boldsymbol{v}$ has the renormalization property if and only if the stream function (Hamiltonian) of $\boldsymbol{v}$ has the weak Sard property, and that both of the properties are equivalent to uniqueness of bounded weak solutions to the Cauchy problem for the corresponding continuity equation. These results generalize the criteria established for $d=2$ and $p=\infty$ by Alberti, Bianchini and Crippa.</description>

      <title>Runge type approximation results for spaces of smooth Whitney jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Runge type approximation results for linear partial differential operators with constant coefficients on spaces of smooth Whitney jets. Among others, we characterize when for a constant coefficient linear partial differential operator $P(D)$ and for closed subsets $F_1\subset F_2$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ the restrictions to $F_1$ of smooth Whitney jets $f$ on $F_2$ satisfying $P(D)f=0$ on $F_2$ are dense in the space of smooth Whitney jets on $F_1$ satisfying the same partial differential equation on $F_1$. For elliptic operators we give a geometric evaluation of this characterization. Additionally, for differential operators with a single characteristic direction, like parabolic operators, we give a sufficient geometric condition for the above density to hold. Under mild additional assumptions on $\partial F_1$ and for $F_2=\mathbb{R}^d$ this sufficient conditions is also necessary. As an application of our work, we characterize those open subsets $\Omega$ of the complex plane satisfying $\Omega=\operatorname{int}\overline{\Omega}$ for which the set of holomorphic polynomials are dense in $A^\infty(\Omega)$, under the mild additional hypothesis that $\overline{\Omega}$ satisfies the strong regularity condition. Furthermore, for the wave operator in one spatial variable, a simple sufficient geometric condition on $F_1, F_2\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is given for the above density to hold. For the special case of $F_2=\mathbb{R}^2$ this sufficient condition is also necessary under mild additional hypotheses on $F_1$.</description>

      <title>On the global stability and large time behavior of solutions of the Boussinesq equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional viscous Boussinesq equations, which model the motion of stratified flows in a circular domain influenced by a general gravitational potential $f$. First, we demonstrate that the Boussinesq equations admit steady-state solutions only in the form of hydrostatic equilibria, given by $(\mathbf{u},\rho,p)=(0,\rho_s,p_s)$, where the pressure gradient satisfies $\nabla p_s=-\rho_s\nabla f$. Subsequently, we establish that any hydrostatic equilibrium satisfying the condition $\nabla \rho_s=\delta (x,y)\nabla f$ is linearly unstable if $\delta(x,y)$ is positive at some point $(x,y)=(x_0,y_0)$, This instability corresponds to the well-known Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Thirdly, by employing a series of regularity estimates, we reveal that although the presence of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability increases the velocity, the system ultimately converges to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This result is achieved by analyzing perturbations around any state of hydrostatic equilibrium, including both stable and unstable configurations. Specifically, the state of hydrostatic equilibrium can be expressed as $\rho=-\gamma f+\beta$,where $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are positive constants, provided that the global perturbation satisfies additional conditions. This highlights the system's tendency to stabilize into a hydrostatic state despite the presence of instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a general mathematical framework for analyzing electostatics within multi-layered metamaterial structures. The multi-layered structure can be designed by nesting complementary negative and regular materials together, and it can be easily achieved by truncating bulk metallic material in a specific configuration. Using layer potentials and symmetrization techniques, we establish the perturbation formula in terms of Neumann-Poincar\'e (NP) operator for general multi-layered medium, and obtain the spectral properties of the NP operator, which demonstrates that the number of plasmon modes increases with the number of layers. Based on Fourier series, we present an exact matrix representation of the NP operator in an apparently unsymmetrical structure, exemplified by multi-layered confocal ellipses. By highly intricate and delicate analysis, we establish a handy algebraic framework for studying the splitting of the plasmon modes within multi-layered structures. Moreover, the asymptotic profiles of the plasmon modes are also obtained. This framework helps reveal the effects of material truncation and rotational symmetry breaking on the splitting of the plasmon modes, thereby inducing desired resonances and enabling the realization of customized applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discrete regularity estimates for a broad class of temporal numerical schemes for parabolic stochastic evolution equations. We provide a characterization of discrete stochastic maximal $\ell^p$-regularity in terms of its continuous counterpart, thereby establishing a unified framework that yields numerous new discrete regularity results. Moreover, as a consequence of the continuous-time theory, we establish several important properties of discrete stochastic maximal regularity such as extrapolation in the exponent $p$ and with respect to a power weight. Furthermore, employing the $H^\infty$-functional calculus, we derive a powerful discrete maximal estimate in the trace space norm $D_A(1-\frac1p,p)$ for $p \in [2,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>A new proof on quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with prescribed mass and combined nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*} \aligned -\Delta u-\Delta(u^2)u=|u|^{p-2}u+|u|^{q-2}u+\lambda u,\,\, x\in\R^N, \endaligned \end{equation*} under the mass constraint \begin{equation*} \int_{\R^N}|u|^2\text{d}x=a, \end{equation*} where $N\geq2$, $2&lt;p&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;4+\frac{4}{N}&lt;q&lt;22^*$, $a&gt;0$ is a given mass and $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier. As a continuation of our previous work (Chen et al., 2025, arXiv:2506.07346v1), we establish some results by means of a suitable change of variables as follows:
  \begin{itemize} \item[{\bf(i) }] {\bf qualitative analysis of the constrained minimization}\\ For $2&lt;p&lt;4+\frac{4}{N}\leq q&lt;22^*$, we provide a detailed study of the minimization problem under some appropriate conditions on $a&gt;0$;
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{itemize} \item[{\bf(ii)}]{\bf existence of two radial distinct normalized solutions}\\ For $2&lt;p&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;4+\frac{4}{N}&lt;q&lt;22^*$, we obtain a local minimizer under the normalized constraint;\\ For $2&lt;p&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;4+\frac{4}{N}&lt;q\leq2^*$, we obtain a mountain pass type normalized solution distinct from the local minimizer.
  \end{itemize} Notably, the second result {\bf (ii)} resolves the open problem {\bf(OP1)} posed by (Chen et al., 2025, arXiv:2506.07346v1). Unlike previous approaches that rely on constructing Palais-Smale-Pohozaev sequences by [Jeanjean, 1997, Nonlinear Anal. {\bf 28}, 1633-1659], we obtain the mountain pass solution employing a new method, which lean upon the monotonicity trick developed by (Chang et al., 2024, Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'{e} C Anal. Non Lin\'{e}aire, {\bf 41}, 933-959).
  We emphasize that the methods developed in this work can be extended to investigate the existence of mountain pass-type normalized solutions for other classes of quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations.</description>

      <title>The local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for Cauchy problem of three-dimensional inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for Cauchy problem of three-dimensional inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations, which are influenced by Young-Pil Choi, Bongsuk Kwon [London Mathematical Society 28 (2015), pp. 3309-3336]\cite{12L}. As for the global well-posedness of the solution of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations, this paper first linearizes the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations, constructs the approximate solution of the linearized equation, and obtains the consistent estimation of the approximate solution. Then, the approximate solution is limited. The local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for Cauchy problem of inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations are obtained, which further enriches the existence results of strong solutions for Navier-Stokes-Vlasov equations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the adhesion model and the reconstruction problem in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cosmology, a basic explanation of the observed concentration of mass in singular structures is provided by the Zeldovich approximation, which takes the form of free-streaming flow for perturbations of a uniform Einstein-de Sitter universe in co-moving coordinates. The adhesion model suppresses multi-streaming by introducing viscosity. We study mass flow in this model by analysis of Lagrangian advection in the zero-viscosity limit. Under mild conditions, we show that a unique limiting Lagrangian semi-flow exists. Limiting particle paths stick together after collision and are characterized uniquely by a differential inclusion. The absolutely continuous part of the mass measure agrees with that of a Monge-Amp\`ere measure arising by convexification of the free-streaming velocity potential. But the singular parts of these measures can differ when flows along singular structures merge, as shown by analysis of a 2D Riemann problem. The use of Monge-Amp\`ere measures and optimal transport theory for the reconstruction of inverse Lagrangian maps in cosmology was introduced in work of Brenier &amp; Frisch et al. (Month. Not. Roy. Ast. Soc. 346, 2003). In a neighborhood of merging singular structures in our examples, however, we show that reconstruction yielding a monotone Lagrangian map cannot be exact a.e., even off of the singularities themselves.</description>

Abstract: Consider $J(\Omega):= \|\nabla u_\Omega\|_\infty/\sqrt{|\Omega|} $ and $J_P(\Omega):= \|\nabla u_\Omega\|_\infty/P(\Omega) $, where $\Omega$ is a planar convex domain, $u_\Omega$ is the torsion function, $P(\Omega)$ is the perimeter of $\Omega$ and $|\Omega|$ its area. We prove that there exist planar convex domains that maximize the functionals $J$ and $J_P$, and any maximizer has a $C^1$ boundary that contains a line segment on which $|\nabla u_\Omega|$ attains its maximum.</description>

      <title>Modeling of a non-Newtonian thin film passing a thin porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This theoretical study deals with asymptotic behavior of a coupling between a thin film of fluid and an adjacent thin porous medium. We assume that the size of the microstructure of the porous medium is given by a small parameter $0&lt;\varepsilon\ll 1$, the thickness of the thin porous medium is defined by a parameter $0&lt;h_\varepsilon\ll 1$, and the thickness of the thin film is defined by a small parameter $0&lt;\eta_\varepsilon\ll 1$, where $h_\varepsilon$ and $\eta_\varepsilon$ are devoted to tend to zero when $\varepsilon\to 0$. In this paper, we consider the case of a non-Newtonian fluid governed by the incompressible Stokes equations with power law viscosity of flow index $r\in (1, +\infty)$, and we prove that there exists a critical regime, which depends on $r$, between $\varepsilon$, $\eta_\varepsilon$ and $h_\varepsilon$. More precisely, in this critical regime given by $h_\varepsilon\approx \eta_\varepsilon^{2r-1\over r-1}\varepsilon^{-{r\over r-1}}$, we prove that the effective flow when $\varepsilon\to 0$ is described by a 1D Darcy law coupled with a 1D Reynolds law.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations in a thin domain with power law slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This theoretical study deals with the Navier-Stokes equations posed in a 3D thin domain with thickness $0&lt;\varepsilon\ll 1$, assuming power law slip boundary conditions, with an anisotropic tensor, on the bottom. This condition, introduced in (Djoko et al., Comput. Math. Appl., 128 (2022) 198-213), represents a generalization of the Navier slip boundary condition. The goal is to study the influence of the power law slip boundary conditions with an anisotropic tensor of order $\varepsilon^{\gamma\over s}$, with $\gamma\in \mathbb{R}$ and flow index $1&lt;s&lt;2$, on the behavior of the fluid with thickness $\varepsilon$ by using asymptotic analysis when $\varepsilon\to 0$, depending on the values of $\gamma$. As a result, we deduce the existence of a critical value of $\gamma$ given by $\gamma_s^*=3-2s$ and so, three different limit boundary conditions are derived. The critical case $\gamma=\gamma_s^*$ corresponds to a limit condition of type power law slip. The supercritical case $\gamma&gt;\gamma_s^*$ corresponds to a limit boundary condition of type perfect slip. The subcritical case $\gamma&lt;\gamma_s^*$ corresponds to a limit boundary condition of type no-slip.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and stability analysis of a third-order multiclass traffic flow model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic flow modeling spans a wide range of mathematical approaches, from microscopic descriptions of individual vehicle dynamics to macroscopic models based on aggregate quantities. A fundamental challenge in macroscopic modeling lies in the closure relations, particularly in the specification of a traffic hesitation function in second-order models like Aw-Rascle-Zhang. In this work, we propose a third-order hyperbolic traffic model in which the hesitation evolves as a driver-dependent dynamic quantity. Starting from a microscopic formulation, we relax the standard assumption by introducing an evolution law for the hesitation. This extension allows to incorporate hysteresis effects, modeling the fact that drivers respond differently when accelerating or decelerating, even under identical local traffic conditions. Furthermore, various relaxation terms are introduced. These allow us to establish relations to the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model and other traffic flow models.</description>

      <title>On the existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions of SDEs with state-dependent variable exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a time-inhomogeneous nonlinear SDE with drift and diffusion governed by state-dependent variable exponents. This framework generalizes models like the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the constant elasticity of variance (CEV), offering flexibility to capture complex dynamics while posing analytical challenges. Using a fixed-point approach, we prove existence and uniqueness, analyze higher-order moments, derive asymptotic estimates, and assess stability. Finally, we illustrate an application where the Poisson equation admits a probabilistic representation via a time-homogeneous nonlinear SDE with state-dependent variable exponents.</description>

      <title>Completeness of reparametrization-invariant Sobolev metrics on the space of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study reparametrization-invariant Sobolev-type Riemannian metrics on the space of immersed surfaces and establish conditions ensuring metric and geodesic completeness as well as the existence of minimizing geodesics. This provides the first extension of completeness results for immersed curves, originating from works of Bruveris, Michor, and Mumford, and validates an earlier conjecture of Mumford on completeness properties of general spaces of immersions in this important case.
  The result is obtained by recasting earlier approaches to completeness on manifolds of mappings as a general completeness criterion for infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds that are open subsets of a complete Riemannian manifold and by combining it with geometric estimates based on the Michael--Simon--Sobolev inequality to establish the completeness for specific Sobolev metrics on immersed surfaces.</description>
