      <title>Statistical inference of anomalous thermal transport with uncertainty quantification for interpretive 2-D SOL models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical task of inferring anomalous cross-field transport coefficients is addressed in simulations of boundary plasmas with fluid models. A workflow for parameter inference in the UEDGE fluid code is developed using Bayesian optimization with parallelized sampling and integrated uncertainty quantification. In this workflow, transport coefficients are inferred by maximizing their posterior probability distribution, which is generally multidimensional and non-Gaussian. Uncertainty quantification is integrated throughout the optimization within the Bayesian framework that combines diagnostic uncertainties and model limitations. As a concrete example, we infer the anomalous electron thermal diffusivity $\chi_\perp$ from an interpretive 2-D model describing electron heat transport in the conduction-limited region with radiative power loss. The workflow is first benchmarked against synthetic data and then tested on H-, L-, and I-mode discharges to match their midplane temperature and divertor heat flux profiles. We demonstrate that the workflow efficiently infers diffusivity and its associated uncertainty, generating 2-D profiles that match 1-D measurements. Future efforts will focus on incorporating more complicated fluid models and analyzing transport coefficients inferred from a large database of experimental results.</description>

      <title>Absolute constraints on the magnetic field evolution in tokamak power plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Issues of tokamak power plants, such as maximum possible length of a pulse of fusion power, the required time between fusion pulses, and the evolution of the current profile towards disruptive states, are tightly constrained by a simple evolution equation for the magnetic field. This equation follows from Faraday's Law and the mathematical relation between the magnetic and the electric fields. The validity of detailed simulations is tested by consistency with Faraday's Law, not the other way around. The evolution equation suggests methods of avoiding the limitations of these constraints. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) is proceeding on a fast timescale to operate a fusion power plant -- even writing contracts on the power to be produced by their ARC tokamak. This makes it important to determine the issues that should be studied by SPARC, which is the tokamak that CFS is building to address issues before ARC is built. The STEP prototype of a spherical tokamak power plant of Tokamak Energy is on a similar fast timescale. Feasible simulations from startup to shutdown for prototype plasmas could greatly clarify these constraints and the feasibility of their avoidance.</description>

      <title>Influence of Conical Wire Array Geometry on Flow and Temperature Profiles Measured via Thomson Scattering and Optical Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conical wire arrays with different opening angles are used as load of a 400kA, 1kA/ns generator. The differences in opening angle allow the study of the influence of the array geometry on the jet properties. The characterization of the jets is performed using a combination of advanced diagnostic techniques, including moir\'e schlieren deflectometry, visible self-emission spectroscopy, and optical Thomson scattering. The results reveal that, under the experimental conditions, the plasma jets exhibit electron temperatures ranging from $8$ to $17$ eV, increasing along the axial direction. In contrast, the ion temperature decreases from approximately $35$ eV near the base of the jet to about $20$ eV at higher axial positions. The electron density profile peaks at $\sim 4 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the central lower region of the jet and decreases with height exponentially with a characteristic lenght $L_n = $2.86 mm. This behavior is reproducible and independent of the conical array geometry. However, the cone opening angle significantly affect the jet propagation velocity, with larger opening angles producing higher axial velocities ($V_{\phi=40^\circ} \approx 125\pm3$ km/s, $V_{\phi=20^\circ} \approx 98\pm5$ km/s), demonstrating that the cone geometry provides effective control over the jet propagation velocity.</description>

      <title>Analysis of RF Sheath-Driven Tungsten Erosion at RF Antenna in the WEST Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study applies the newly developed STRIPE (Simulated Transport of RF Impurity Production and Emission) framework to interpret tungsten (W) erosion at RF antenna structures in the WEST tokamak. STRIPE integrates SolEdge3x for edge plasma backgrounds, COMSOL for 3D RF sheath potentials, RustBCA for sputtering yields, and GITR for impurity transport and ion energy-angle distributions. In contrast to prior work by Kumar et al. 2025 Nucl. Fusion 65, 076039, which focused on framework validation for WEST ICRH discharge 57877, the present study provides a spatially resolved analysis of gross W erosion at both Q2 antenna limiters under ohmic and ICRH conditions. Using 2D SolEdge3x profiles in COMSOL, STRIPE captures rectified sheath potentials exceeding 300 V, leading to strong upper-limiter localization. Both poloidal and toroidal asymmetries are observed and attributed to RF sheath effects, with modeled erosion patterns deviating from experiment - highlighting sensitivity to sheath geometry and plasma resolution. High-charge-state oxygen ions (O6+-O8+) dominate erosion, while D+ contributes negligibly. A plasma composition of 1 percent oxygen and 98 percent deuterium is assumed. STRIPE predicts a 30-fold increase in gross W erosion from ohmic to ICRH phases, consistent with W-I 400.9 nm brightness measurements. Agreement within 5 percent (ohmic) and 30 percent (ICRH) demonstrates predictive capability and supports STRIPE's application in reactor-scale antenna design.</description>

      <title>Simulation of surface x-ray emission from the ASTERICS ECR ion source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bremsstrahlung x-ray emission induced by the impact of plasma electrons de-confined on the chamber wall of the ASTERICS electron cyclotron resonance ion source is investigated through a suite of two simulation codes. The electron high energy temperature distribution tail at the wall is found to be anisotropic and increases with Bmin. The electrons impinge the walls with broad angular distribution peaking at angles ranging between 5-25{\deg} with respect to the surface, which has consequences on the x-ray emission directionality and on the yield of electrons bouncing back toward the plasma, reaching up to 50%. The x-ray dose is mapped inside and around the ion source for Bmin = 0.8 T and an electron temperature artificially increased to 120 keV to dimension with margin the cave shielding. The dose without shielding reaches 100 $\mu$Sv/h per kW of impacting electrons at 5 m. A set of internal and external shielding is presented to attenuate this dose and reduce it to less than 1 $\mu$Sv/h per kW of electrons. A parametric electron distribution temperature study with Fluka indicates that the deposition of 1 W of heat in the superconducting cold mass per kW of plasma electrons, as reported experimentally, is obtained when the temperature is set to 380 keV. The mechanism required to provide such a high electron temperature is unclear, but previous experiments on several ion sources reported an x-ray spectral temperature 3 to 4 times higher radially, compatible with this simulation result.</description>

      <title>Broadband coherent XUV light from $e^-/e^+$ microbunching in an intense laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond pulses of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light are instrumental for investigating subatomic dynamics and can be produced using a free-electron laser (FEL). It has been suggested that an optical FEL, which employs a laser pulse in place of a conventional undulator, could enable a dramatically more compact implementation of such a light source. Yet, the high electron density and subsequent high emittance implied by an optical FEL makes this concept challenging to realize with an electron beam. There has been impressive progress in recent years producing collimated dense and relativistic beams of electrons and positrons in the laboratory. As we demonstrate here, the inherent stability of a quasi-neutral electron-positron beam mitigates Coulomb expansion, and renders it a promising alternative source of coherent light. Specifically, we show via computer simulations that broadband coherent light in the XUV domain, which takes the form of 8-as pulses at 92-as intervals, can be generated by microbunching of relativistic electrons and positrons in a laser pulse. This process occurs over a sub-millimeter length scale, enabling the development of light sources which are orders-of-magnitude more compact than existing sources, with potential applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and industry.</description>

      <title>Interpreting AI for Fusion: an application to Plasma Profile Analysis for Tearing Mode Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI models have demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for various tokamak instabilities--including tearing modes (TM), ELMs, and disruptive event--but their opaque nature raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness when applied to fusion power plants. Here, we present a physics-based interpretation framework using a TM prediction model as a first demonstration that is validated through a dedicated DIII-D TM avoidance experiment. By applying Shapley analysis, we identify how profiles such as rotation, temperature, and density contribute to the model's prediction of TM stability. Our analysis shows that in our experimental scenario, a large density profile is lightly destabilizing, but core electron temperature and rotation peaking play the primary role in TM stability. This work offers a generalizable ML-based event prediction methodology, from training to physics-driven interpretability, bridging the gap between physics understanding and opaque ML models.</description>

      <title>Neural-Network solver of ideal MHD equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.</description>
