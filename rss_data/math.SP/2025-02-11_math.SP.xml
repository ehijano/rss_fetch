      <title>Biquadratic Tensors: Eigenvalues and Structured Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biquadratic tensors arise from solid mechanics, statistics, quantum physics, spectral graph theory and polynomial theory. M-eigenvalues of biquadratic {symmetric} tensors were introduced to study their properties. In this paper, we further study eigenvalues of biquadratic tensors, and some structured biquadratic tensors. In each row of a biquadratic tensor, there are several diagonal entries. Each of these diagonal entries are corresponding to a number of off-diagonal entries in that row. We present a Gershgorin-type theorem for biquadratic tensors, and show that (strictly) diagonally dominated {symmetric} biquadratic tensors are positive semi-definite (definite). We show that a nonnegative biquadratic tensor always has a nonnegative M-eigenvalue with nonnegative M-eigenvectors. We introduce Z-biquadratic tensors, M-biquadratic tensors, strong M-biquadratic tensors, B$_0$-biquadratic tensors and B-biquadratic tensors. We show that symmetric M-biquadratic tensors and symmetric B$_0$-biquadratic tensors are positive semi-definite, and that symmetric strong M-biquadratic tensors and symmetric B-biquadratic tensors are positive definite.</description>

      <title>Spectral and dynamical results related to certain non-integer base expansions on the unit interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider certain non-integer base $\beta$-expansions of Parry's type and we study various properties of the transfer (Perron-Frobenius) operator $\mathcal{P}:L^p([0,1])\mapsto L^p([0,1])$ with $p\geq 1$ and its associated composition (Koopman) operator, which are induced by a discrete dynamical system on the unit interval related to these $\beta$-expansions. We show that if $f$ is Lipschitz, then the iterated sequence $\{\mathcal{P}^N f\}_{N\geq 1}$ converges exponentially fast (in the $L^1$ norm) to an invariant state corresponding to the eigenvalue $1$ of $\mathcal{P}$. This "attracting" eigenvalue is not isolated: for $1\leq p\leq 2$ we show that the point spectrum of $\mathcal{P}$ also contains the whole open complex unit disk and we explicitly construct some corresponding eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of the Zeon Combinatorial Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite simple graph $G$ on $m$ vertices, the zeon combinatorial Laplacian $\Lambda$ of $G$ is an $m\times m$ graph having entries in the complex zeon algebra $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{Z}$. It is shown here that if the graph has a unique vertex $v$ of degree $k$, then the Laplacian has a unique zeon eigenvalue $\lambda$ whose scalar part is $k$. Moreover, the canonical expansion of the nilpotent (dual) part of $\lambda$ counts the cycles based at vertex $v$ in $G$. With an appropriate generalization of the zeon combinatorial Laplacian of $G$, all cycles in $G$ are counted by $\Lambda$. Moreover when a generalized zeon combinatorial Laplacian $\Lambda$ can be viewed as a self-adjoint operator on the $\mathbb{C}\mathfrak{Z}$-module of $m$-tuples of zeon elements, it can be interpreted as a quantum random variable whose values reveal the cycle structure of the underlying graph.</description>

      <title>An analysis of non-selfadjoint first-order differential operators with non-local point interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectra of non-selfadjoint first-order operators on the interval with non-local point interactions, formally given by ${i\partial_x+V+k\langle \delta,\cdot\rangle}$. We give precise estimates on the location of the eigenvalues on the complex plane and prove that the root vectors of these operators form Riesz bases of $L^2(0,2\pi)$. Under the additional assumption that the operator is maximally dissipative, we prove that it can have at most one real eigenvalue, and given any $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, we explicitly construct the unique operator realization such that $\lambda$ is in its spectrum. We also investigate the time-evolution generated by these maximally dissipative operators.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Spectral Moments of the Kernel Integral Operator from Finite Sample Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the structure of sampled features from an input data distribution is challenging when constrained by limited measurements in both the number of inputs and features. Traditional approaches often rely on the eigenvalue spectrum of the sample covariance matrix derived from finite measurement matrices; however, these spectra are sensitive to the size of the measurement matrix, leading to biased insights. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm that provides unbiased estimates of the spectral moments of the kernel integral operator in the limit of infinite inputs and features from finitely sampled measurement matrices. Our method, based on dynamic programming, is efficient and capable of estimating the moments of the operator spectrum. We demonstrate the accuracy of our estimator on radial basis function (RBF) kernels, highlighting its consistency with the theoretical spectra. Furthermore, we showcase the practical utility and robustness of our method in understanding the geometry of learned representations in neural networks.</description>
