      <title>Rust Barefoot Runtime (RBFRT): Fast Runtime Control for the Intel Tofino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of new network protocols and solutions requires extendable switches. With software-defined networking (SDN), the control plane and data plane are separated and the control plane can be programmed. Data plane programming further enables the programmability of network devices with domain-specific programming languages, like Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors (P4). One P4-programmable hardware target is the Intel Tofino switching ASIC. The Tofino can be configured with shell scripts or a Python library. Both are limited in their capabilities and usability. This work introduces the Rust Barefoot Runtime (RBFRT), a Rust-based control plane library for the Tofino. The RBFRT provides an easy-to-use interface while being fast and memory-safe. In our evaluation, we achieved a speedup factor of 1.33 for single-entry configuration and 60 for batch configuration compared to the Python library.</description>

      <title>Handover Delay Minimization in Non-Terrestrial Networks: Impact of Open RAN Functional Splits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing handover (HO) performance in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) to enhance user equipment (UE) effective service time, defined as the active service time excluding HO delays and radio link failure (RLF) periods. Availability is defined as the normalized effective service time which is effected by different HO scenarios: Intra-satellite HO is the HO from one beam to another within the same satellite; inter-satellite HO refers to the HO from one satellite to another where satellites can be connected to the same or different GSs. We investigate the impact of open radio access network (O-RAN) functional splits (FSs) between ground station (GS) and LEO satellites on HO delay and assess how beam configurations affect RLF rates and intra- and inter-satellite HO rates. This work focuses on three O-RAN FSs -- split 7.2x (low layer 1 functions on the satellite), split 2 (layer 1 and layer 2 functions on the satellite), and gNB onboard the satellite -- and two beam configurations (19-beam and 127-beam). In a realistic dynamic LEO satellite constellation where different types of HO scenarios are simulated, we maximize effective service time by tuning the time-to-trigger (TTT) and HO margin (HOM) parameters. Our findings reveal that the gNB onboard the satellite achieves the highest availability, approximately 95.4%, while the split 7.2x exhibits the lowest availability, around 92.8% due to higher intra-satellite HO delays.</description>

      <title>Wireless Network Topology Inference: A Markov Chains Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of inferring the topology of a wireless network using limited observational data. Specifically, we assume that we can detect when a node is transmitting, but no further information regarding the transmission is available. We propose a novel network estimation procedure grounded in the following abstract problem: estimating the parameters of a finite discrete-time Markov chain by observing, at each time step, which states are visited by multiple ``anonymous'' copies of the chain. We develop a consistent estimator that approximates the transition matrix of the chain in the operator norm, with the number of required samples scaling roughly linearly with the size of the state space. Applying this estimation procedure to wireless networks, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method accurately infers network topology across a wide range of parameters, consistently outperforming transfer entropy, particularly under conditions of high network congestion.</description>

      <title>Open-Source ESP32-C3 Wi-Fi Drivers for Static Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Battery-Free Internet of Things might revolutionize our understanding of sustainable communication, as these IoT devices operate on harvested energy. As this energy can change unpredictably, device operations, including those of its network stack, must be resilient to power loss. Transactional intermittency approaches break down tasks into atomic sub-tasks that can be executed free from power failures when sufficient energy is available. For this operation, static program-code analysis methods are required to analyse the worst-case energy consumption (WCEC) of transactions. However, static code analysis require the availability of all code and its semantics. In the case of Wi-Fi-capable devices, Wi-Fi drivers are closed-source and therefore the energy required for physical layer operations cannot be evaluated. In this work, we integrate a transactional network stack with reverse-engineered Wi-Fi drivers to enable WCEC analysis for physical transmission and reception of packets. Our evaluations with the RISC-V--based ESP32-C3 platform validate that we are able to give worst-case bounds with our static analysis for the operations of the Wi-Fi modem.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Wireless Communication Receiver: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of wireless communication receivers to enhance signal processing in complex and dynamic environments is going through a transformation by leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs). Traditional wireless receivers depend on mathematical models and algorithms, which do not have the ability to adapt or learn from data. In contrast, deep learning-based receivers are more suitable for modern wireless communication systems because they can learn from data and adapt accordingly. This survey explores various deep learning architectures such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and autoencoders, focusing on their application in the design of wireless receivers. Key modules of a receiver such as synchronization, channel estimation, equalization, space-time decoding, demodulation, decoding, interference cancellation, and modulation classification are discussed in the context of advanced wireless technologies like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), multiple input multiple output (MIMO), semantic communication, task-oriented communication, and next-generation (Next-G) networks. The survey not only emphasizes the potential of deep learning-based receivers in future wireless communication but also investigates different challenges of deep learning-based receivers, such as data availability, security and privacy concerns, model interpretability, computational complexity, and integration with legacy systems.</description>

      <title>Private Information Retrieval on Multigraph-Based Replicated Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the private information retrieval (PIR) problem for a multigraph-based replication system, where each set of $r$ files is stored on two of the servers according to an underlying $r$-multigraph. Our goal is to establish upper and lower bounds on the PIR capacity of the $r$-multigraph. Specifically, we first propose a construction for multigraph-based PIR systems that leverages the symmetry of the underlying graph-based PIR scheme, deriving a capacity lower bound for such multigraphs. Then, we establish a general upper bound using linear programming, expressed as a function of the underlying graph parameters. Our bounds are demonstrated to be tight for PIR systems on multipaths for even number of vertices.</description>

      <title>netFound: Foundation Model for Network Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17025v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing generalizable ML-based solutions for disparate learning problems in network security is highly desired. However, despite a rich history of applying ML to network security, most existing solutions lack generalizability. This lack of progress can be attributed to an overreliance on supervised learning techniques and the associated challenges of curating well-specified labeled training data. This paper addresses a fundamental gap by introducing a novel transformer-based network foundation model, netFound. We employ self-supervised learning techniques on abundant, unlabeled network telemetry data for pre-training. This pretrained model can subsequently be fine-tuned to create generalizable learning artifacts for disparate learning tasks, even when using commonly available but challenging labeled datasets that are sparse, noisy, and skewed. To realize this goal, netFound leverages various domain-specific attributes and constraints unique to network data (packet traces) by developing multi-modal embeddings, protocol-aware tokenization, data-driven token composition, and hierarchical transformers. Our results demonstrate that netFound's domain-specific design choices ensure that it (1) effectively captures the hidden networking context in production settings, (2) outperforms four different SOTA methods on five different learning tasks, and (3) is robust to both noisy labels and learning shortcuts -- critical for developing generalizable ML models in practical settings.</description>

      <title>FUSION: A Flexible Unified Simulator for Intelligent Optical Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demand for flexible and efficient optical networks has led to the development of Software-Defined Elastic Optical Networks (SD-EONs). These networks leverage the programmability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and the adaptability of Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) to optimize network performance under dynamic traffic conditions. However, existing simulation tools often fall short in terms of transparency, flexibility, and advanced functionality, limiting their utility in cutting-edge research. In this paper, we present a Flexible Unified Simulator for Intelligent Optical Networking (FUSION), a fully open-source simulator designed to address these limitations and provide a comprehensive platform for SD-EON research. FUSION integrates traditional routing and spectrum assignment algorithms with advanced machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques, including support for the Stable Baselines 3 library. The simulator also offers robust unit testing, a fully functional Graphical User Interface (GUI), and extensive documentation to ensure usability and reliability. Performance evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FUSION in modeling complex network scenarios, showcasing its potential as a powerful tool for advancing SD-EON research.</description>

      <title>The Spectre of Surveillance and Censorship in Future Internet Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent initiatives known as Future Internet Architectures (FIAs) seek to redesign the Internet to improve performance, scalability, and security. However, some governments perceive Internet access as a threat to their political standing and engage in widespread network surveillance and censorship. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the design principles of prominent FIAs in terms of their packet structure, addressing and naming schemes, and routing protocols to foster discussion on how these new systems interact with censorship and surveillance apparatuses. Further, we assess the extent to which existing surveillance and censorship mechanisms can successfully target FIA users while discussing privacy enhancing technologies to counter these mechanisms. We conclude by providing guidelines for future research into novel FIA-based privacy-enhancing technologies, and recommendations to guide the evaluation of these technologies.</description>

      <title>LayerPlexRank: Exploring Node Centrality and Layer Influence through Algebraic Connectivity in Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the calculation of centrality in complex networks becomes increasingly vital across technological, biological, and social systems, precise and scalable ranking methods are essential for understanding these networks. This paper introduces LayerPlexRank, an algorithm that simultaneously assesses node centrality and layer influence in multiplex networks using algebraic connectivity metrics. This method enhances the robustness of the ranking algorithm by effectively assessing structural changes across layers using random walk, considering the overall connectivity of the graph. We substantiate the utility of LayerPlexRank with theoretical analyses and empirical validations on varied real-world datasets, contrasting it with established centrality measures.</description>

      <title>DRACO: Decentralized Asynchronous Federated Learning over Row-Stochastic Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments and emerging use cases, such as smart Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge AI, have sparked considerable interest in the training of neural networks over fully decentralized (serverless) networks. One of the major challenges of decentralized learning is to ensure stable convergence without resorting to strong assumptions applied for each agent regarding data distributions or updating policies. To address these issues, we propose DRACO, a novel method for decentralized asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) over row-stochastic gossip wireless networks by leveraging continuous communication. Our approach enables edge devices within decentralized networks to perform local training and model exchanging along a continuous timeline, thereby eliminating the necessity for synchronized timing. The algorithm also features a specific technique of decoupling communication and computation schedules, which empowers complete autonomy for all users and manageable instructions for stragglers. Through a comprehensive convergence analysis, we highlight the advantages of asynchronous and autonomous participation in decentralized optimization. Our numerical experiments corroborate the efficacy of the proposed technique.</description>
