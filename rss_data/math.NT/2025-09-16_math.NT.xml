      <title>Effective Artin-Schreier-Witt theory for curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm which, given a connected smooth projective curve $X$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;0$ and its Hasse--Witt matrix, as well as a positive integer $n$, computes all \'etale Galois covers of $X$ with group $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$. We compute the complexity of this algorithm when $X$ is defined over a finite field, and provide a complete implementation in SageMath, as well as some explicit examples. We then apply this algorithm to the computation of the cohomology complex of a locally constant sheaf of $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$-modules on such a curve.</description>

      <title>Some Structures arising from the Farey Fractal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores new arithmetic and combinatorial structures arising from the interplay between Farey-type graphs, Fibonacci expansions, and operadic constructions. We introduce Fibonadic numbers, defined as an inverse limit under the Zeckendorf shift, equipped with a metric, order, and commutative rig structure. A normalization lemma provides canonical representatives, while quotients of the non-zero Fibonadic numbers under shifts and it's fundamental domain covering the circle via phi-values. Levels with associated functions encoding the decomposition of X into arithmetic layers. This research links number theory, combinatorics, discrete dynamics, operads, fractal geometry and the golden ratio.</description>

      <title>On the verification of a Nicolas inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nicolas inequality we deal can be written as \begin{equation}\label{Nicineq} e^\gamma \log\log N_x &lt; \dfrac{N_x}{\varphi(N_x)}\,, \end{equation} where $x\ge 2$, $N_x$ denotes the product of the primes less or equal than $x$, $\gamma$ is the Euler constant and $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. We show that there is a large $x_0&gt;0$ such that this inequality fails infinitely often for integers $x\ge x_0$. To this aim we analyze the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that, we see, becomes crucial.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Digit Map: Periodicity, Prouhet-Tarry-Escott Solutions, and Summation Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate arithmetic properties of the sequence b(n) = B_MN(n) mod M obtained from the base-M to base-N shift map B_MN.We prove that b(n) is ultimately periodic exactly when every prime divisor of M also divides N; in that case we bound (and, for prime powers, determine) the minimal period.When the condition fails, b(n) supplies new solutions to the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem.To analyze this situation we introduce a family of finite-difference identities and use them to evaluate two weighted multivariate polynomial sums, thereby extending identities that arise from the classical sum-of-digits function (N=1).</description>

      <title>Card Dealing Math</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various card tricks involve under-down dealing, where alternatively one card is placed under the deck and the next card is dealt. We study how the cards need to be prepared in the deck to be dealt in order. The order in which the $N$ cards are prepared defines a permutation.
  In this work, we analyze general dealing patterns, considering properties of the resulting permutations. We give recursive formulas for these permutations, their inverses, the final dealt card, and the dealing order of the first card. We discuss some particular examples of dealing patterns and conclude with an analysis of several existing and novel magic card tricks making use of dealing patterns. Our discussions involve 30 existing sequences in the OEIS, and we introduce 44 new sequences to that database.</description>

      <title>On integers with many representations as the sum of $k$th powers of primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a natural number $k&gt;1$, let $f_k(n)$ denote the number of distinct representations of a natural number $n$ of the form $p^k+q^k$ for primes $p,q$. We prove that, for all $k&gt;1$,
  $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}f_k(n)=\infty.$$
  This positively answers a conjecture of Erdos, which asks if there are natural numbers $n$ with arbitrarily many distinct representations of the form $p_1^k+p_2^k+\dots+p_k^k$ for primes $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k$.</description>

Abstract: We provide two new proofs of the infinitude of prime numbers, using the additive Ramsey-theoretic result known as Folkman's theorem (alternatively, one can think of these proofs as using Hindman's theorem). This adds to the existing literature deriving the infinitude of primes from Ramsey-type theorems.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic properties of generalized Frobenius partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramanujan proved three famous congruences for the partition function modulo 5, 7, and 11. The first author and Boylan proved that these congruences are the only ones of this type. In 1984 Andrews introduced the $m$-colored Frobenius partition functions $c\phi_m$; these are natural higher-level analogues of the partition function which have attracted a great deal of attention in the ensuing decades. For each $m\in \{5, 7, 11\}$ there are two analogues of Ramanujan's congruences for $c\phi_m$, and for these $m$ we prove there are no congruences like Ramanujan's other than these six. Our methods involve a blend of theory and computation with modular forms.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms of higher degrees and levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following statement about any Siegel modular form $F$ of degree $n$ and arbitrary odd level $N$ on the group $\Gamma_1^{(n)}(N)$. Let $A(F,T)$ denote the Fourier coefficients of $F$ and write $T=(T(i,j))$.
  Suppose that $F$ has a non-zero Fourier coefficient $A(F,T_0)$ such that $(T_0(n,n),N)=1$. Then there exist infinitely many odd and square-free (and thus fundamental) integers $m$ such that $m=\mathrm{discriminant}(T)$ and $A(F,T)\neq 0$. In the case of odd degrees, we prove a stronger result by replacing odd and square-free with odd and prime. We also prove quantitative results towards this.
  As a consequence, we can show in particular that the statement of the main result in arXiv:2408.03442 about the algebraicity of certain critical values of the spinor $L$-functions of holomorphic newforms (in the ambit of Deligne's conjectures) on congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{GSp}(3)$ is unconditional.</description>

      <title>On the Local Langlands Functoriality Transfer From $\text{SO}(5)$ to $\text{GL}(4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local Langlands functoriality transfer from $\text{SO}(5, F)$ to $\text{GL}(4, F)$ for arbitrary twists of several families of irreducible supercuspidal representations of $\text{GL}(4, F)$, where $F$ is a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero. In doing so, we give equivalent conditions for such representations to be functoriality transfers from $\text{SO}(5, F)$ in terms of the Bushnell-Kutzko construction of supercuspidal representations by studying poles of local exterior square $L$-functions and the existence of non-zero local Shalika models. This article provides a starting point for an explicit characterization of this functoriality transfer in terms of type theory.</description>

      <title>Log-Concavity and Log-Convexity of Restricted Infinite Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a classification on the sign distribution of $\Delta _{E,\ell}(n):= p_{E,\ell }(n)^2 - p_{E,\ell }(n-1) \, p_{E,\ell }(n+1)$, where \begin{equation*} \sum_{n =0}^{\infty} p_{E,\ell }(n) \, q^n := \prod_{n \in S}
  \left(1 - q^n \right)^{-f_{\ell}(n)},\quad (\ell \in \mathbb{N}, f_1\equiv 1). \end{equation*} We take the product over $1\in S \subset \mathbb{N}$ and denote the complement by $E$, the set of exceptions. In the case of $\ell=1$ and $E$ the multiples of $k$, $p_{E,1}\left( n\right) $ represents the number of $k$-regular partitions. More generally, let $f_{\ell}$ satisfy a certain growth condition. We determine the signs of $\Delta _{E,\ell }(n)$ for $\ell$ large. The signs mainly depend on the occurrence of subsets of $\{2,3,4,5\}$ as a part of the exception set and the residue class of $n$ modulo $ r$, where $r $ depends on $E$. For example, let $2,3 \in S$ and $4$ an exception. Let $n$ be large. Then for almost all $\ell$ we have \begin{equation*} \Delta _{E,\ell }(n) &gt;0 \,\,\, \text{ for } n\equiv 2 \pmod{3}. \end{equation*} If we assume $3,4 \in S$ and $2$ an exception. Let $n$ be large. Then for almost all $\ell$ we have \begin{equation*} \Delta _{E,\ell }(n) &lt; 0 \,\,\, \text{ for } n\equiv 2 \pmod{3}. \end{equation*} Note that this property is independent of the integers $k\in S,k&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Dual Shellability of Admissible Set and Cohen-Macaulayness of Local Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove G\"ortz's combinatorial conjecture \cite{Go01} on dual shellability of admissible sets in Iwahori-Weyl groups, proving that the augmented admissible set $\widehat{\mathrm{Adm}}(\mu)$ is dual shellable for any dominant coweight $\mu$. This provides a uniform, elementary approach to establishing Cohen-Macaulayness of the special fibers of the local models with Iwahori level structure for all reductive groups-including residue characteristic $2$ and non-reduced root systems-circumventing geometric methods. Local models, which encode singularities of Shimura varieties and moduli of shtukas, have seen extensive study since their introduction by Rapoport-Zink, with Cohen-Macaulayness remaining a central open problem. While previous work relied on case-specific geometric analyses (e.g., Frobenius splittings \cite{HR23} or compactifications \cite{He13}), our combinatorial proof yields an explicit labeling that constructs the special fiber by sequentially adding irreducible components while preserving Cohen-Macaulayness at each step, a new result even for split groups.</description>

      <title>On non-commutative Euler systems, I: preliminaries on `det' and `Fit'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.10564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend some classical constructions in commutative algebra to the setting of modules over orders in (non-commutative) semisimple algebras. Our theory incorporates, inter alia, `reduced' versions of the notions of higher Fitting invariants and higher exterior powers and of the Grothendieck-Knudsen-Mumford determinant functor on perfect complexes. In a companion article, these results are used to develop a theory of non-commutative Euler systems for $p$-adic representations.</description>

      <title>On non-commutative Iwasawa theory and derivatives of Euler systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the theory of reduced determinant functors from [24] to give a new, computationally useful, description of the relative $K_0$-groups of orders in finite dimensional separable algebras that need not be commutative. By combining this approach with a canonical generalization to non-commutative algebras of the notion of `zeta element' introduced by Kato [52], we then formulate, for each odd prime $p$, a natural main conjecture of non-commutative $p$-adic Iwasawa theory for $\mathbb{G}_m$ over arbitrary number fields. This conjecture predicts a simple relation between a canonical Rubin-Stark non-commutative Euler system that we introduce and the compactly supported $p$-adic cohomology of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and is shown to simultaneously extend both the higher rank (commutative) main conjecture for $\mathbb{G}_m$ formulated by Kurihara and the present authors [19] and the $K$-theoretical formalism of main conjectures in non-commutative Iwasawa theory developed by Ritter and Weiss [73] and by Coates, Fukaya, Kato, Sujatha and Venjakob [27]. In particular, via these links we obtain strong evidence in support of the conjecture in the setting of Galois CM extensions of totally real fields. Our approach also leads to the formulation over arbitrary number fields of a precise conjectural `higher derivative formula' for the Rubin-Stark non-commutative Euler system that is shown to recover upon appropriate specialisation the classical Gross-Stark Conjecture for Deligne-Ribet $p$-adic $L$-functions. We then show that this conjectural derivative formula can be combined with the main conjecture of non-commutative $p$-adic Iwasawa theory to give a strategy for obtaining evidence in support of the equivariant Tamagawa Number Conjecture for $\mathbb{G}_m$ over arbitrary finite Galois extensions of number fields, thereby obtaining a wide-ranging generalization of the main result of [19].</description>

      <title>Locally algebraic representations and integral structures on the cohomology of arithmetic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of locally algebraic representations and corresponding sheaves in the context of the cohomology of arithmetic groups. These representations are of relevance for the study of integral structures and special values of cohomological automorphic representations, as well as corresponding period relations. We introduce and investigate related concepts such as locally algebraic $({\mathfrak g},K)$-modules and cohomological types of automorphic representations. Applying the recently developed theory of tdos and twisted $\mathcal D$-modules over schemes by Hayashi and the author, we establish the existence of canonical global $1/N$-integral structures on spaces of automorphic cusp forms. As an application, we define canonical periods attached to regular algebraic automorphic representations, potentially related to the action of Venkatesh's derived Hecke algebra on cuspidal cohomology.</description>

Abstract: We study lattice sums $\sum 1/(|x||y||x+y|)^s$ taken over $SL_+(2,\ZZ)$, i.e. the set of pairs $(x,y)$ of primitive lattice vectors in $\ZZ_{\geq 0}^2$ with $\det(x, y) = 1$. We prove convergence of these and similar (determinant weighted) sums and introduce a new telescoping method on $SL_+(2,\ZZ)$ that yields, in particular, $$\sum_{(x,y)\in SL_+(2,\ZZ)} \frac{1}{|x|^2|y|^2|x+y|^2}=\frac{\pi}{4},$$ and a short proof of Zagier's identity $D_{1,1,1}=2E(z,3)+\pi^3\zeta(3)$.</description>

      <title>Jacobi forms of weight one on $\Gamma_0(N)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $J_{1,m}(N)$ be the vector space of Jacobi forms of weight one and index $m$ on $\Gamma_0(N)$. In 1985, Skoruppa proved that $J_{1,m}(1)=0$ for all $m$. In 2007, Ibukiyama and Skoruppa proved that $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$ and all squarefree $N$ with $\mathrm{gcd}(m,N)=1$. This paper aims to extend their results. We determine all levels $N$ separately, such that $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$; or $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$ with $\mathrm{gcd}(m,N)=1$. We also establish explicit dimension formulas of $J_{1,m}(N)$ when $m$ and $N$ are relatively prime or $m$ is squarefree. These results are obtained by refining Skoruppa's method and analyzing local invariants of Weil representations. As applications, we prove the vanishing of Siegel modular forms of degree two and weight one in some cases.</description>

Abstract: Assuming the Ramanujan conjecture, the zero density estimate and some subconvexity type bound, we describe a general method to obtain the log-saving upper bound for the second moment of standard twisted higher degree $L$-function in the $q$-aspect. Specifically, let $L(s, F)$ be a standard $L$-function of degree $d\geq3$. Under these foundational hypotheses. the bound \[ \sideset{}{^*}{\sum}_{\chi \pmod q}\Big|L\big(\frac{1}{2}, F\times \chi \big)\Big |^2\ll_{F,\eta} \frac{q^{\frac{d}{2}}}{\log^{\eta}q} \] holds for some small $\eta&gt;0$</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the following result advocating the importance of monomial quadratic relations between holomorphic CM periods. For any simple CM abelian variety $A$, we can construct a CM abelian variety $B$ such that all non-trivial Hodge relations between the holomorphic periods of the product $A\times B$ are generated by monomial quadratic ones which are also explicit. Moreover, $B$ splits over the Galois closure of the CM field associated with $A$.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative chaos measure for multiplicative functions: the $L^1$-regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10555v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we construct a multiplicative chaos measure arising from the Dirichlet series of $\alpha f$, in the whole $L^1$-regime. Our method does not rely on the thick point approach or Gaussian approximation, and uses a modified second moment method with the help of an approximate Girsanov theorem. We also employ the idea of weak convergence in $L^r$ to show that the limiting measure is independent of the choice of the approximation schemes, and this may be seen as a non-Gaussian analogue of Shamov's characterisation of multiplicative chaos.
  Our class of $f$-s consists of those for which the mean value of $|f(p)|^2$ lies in $(0,1)$. In particular, it includes the indicator of sums of two squares. As an application of our construction, we establish a generalised central limit theorem for the (normalised) sums of $\alpha f$, with random variance determined by the total mass of our measure.</description>

Abstract: This article contributes to the study of the generic part of the cohomology of Shimura varieties. Under a mild restriction of the characteristic of the coefficient field, we prove a torsion vanishing result for Shimura varieties of abelian type, confirming a conjecture by Hamann--Lee. Our proofs utilize the unipotent categorical local Langlands correspondence and, in contrast to previous works, do not rely on the endoscopic classification of representations or on other results established through trace formula techniques.</description>

      <title>Counting primes with a given primitive root, uniformly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Artin conjecture on primitive roots asserts that given any integer $g$ which is neither $-1$ nor a perfect square, there is an explicit constant $A(g)&gt;0$ such that the number $\Pi(x;g)$ of primes $p\le x$ for which $g$ is a primitive root is asymptotically $A(g)\pi(x)$ as $x\to\infty$, where $\pi(x)$ counts the number of primes not exceeding $x$. Artin's conjecture has remained unsolved since its formulation in 1927. Nevertheless, Hooley demonstrated in 1967 that Artin's conjecture is a consequence of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for Dedekind zeta functions of certain cyclotomic-Kummer extensions over $\mathbb{Q}$. In this paper, we use GRH to establish a uniform version of the Artin--Hooley asymptotic formula. Specifically, we prove that $\Pi(x;g) \sim A(g) x/\log{x}$ whenever $\log{x}/\log\log{2|g|} \to \infty$, i.e., whenever $x$ tends to infinity faster than any power of $\log{(2|g|)}$. Under GRH, we also show that the least prime $p_g$ possessing $g$ as a primitive root satisfies the upper bound $p_g=O(\log^{19}(2|g|))$ uniformly for all non-square $g\ne-1$. We conclude with an application to the average value of $p_g$ and a discussion of an analogue concerning the least "almost-primitive'' root.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrete model of quantum ergodicity of linear maps generated by symplectic matrices $A \in \mathrm{Sp}(2d,\mathbb{Z})$ modulo an integer $N\ge 1$, has been studied for $d=1$ and almost all $N$ by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). Their result has been strengthened by J. Bourgain (2005) and subsequently by A. Ostafe, I. E. Shparlinski, and J. F. Voloch (2023). For arbitrary $d$ this has been studied by P. Kurlberg, A. Ostafe, Z. Rudnick and I. E. Shparlinski (2024). The corresponding equidistribution results, for certain eigenfunctions, share the same feature: they apply to almost all moduli $N$ and are unable to provide an explicit construction of such ``good'' values of $N$. Here, using a bound of I. E. Shparlinski (1978) on exponential sums with linear recurrence sequences modulo a power of a fixed prime, we construct such an explicit sequence of $N$, with a power saving on the discrepancy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Eisenstein discriminants, which are squarefree integers $d \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$ such that the fundamental unit $\varepsilon_d$ of the real quadratic field $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ satisfies $\varepsilon_d \equiv 1 \pmod{2\mathcal{O}_K}$. These discriminants are related to a classical question of Eisenstein and have connections to the class groups of orders in quadratic fields as well as to real cubic fields. We present numerical computations of Eisenstein discriminants up to $10^{11}$, suggesting that their counting function up to $x$ is approximated by $\pi_{\mathcal{E}}(x) \approx \frac{1}{3\pi^2}x - 0.024x^{5/6}$. This supports a conjecture of Stevenhagen while revealing a surprising secondary term, which is similar to (but subtly different from) the secondary term in the counting function of real cubic fields.
  We include technical details of our computation method, which uses a modified infrastructure approach implemented on GPUs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a sequence of cyclotomic integers (Gaussian periods) of particularly small Mahler measure/height. We study the asymptotics of their Mahler measure as a function of their conductor, to find that the growth rate is the (multivariate) Mahler measure of a family of log Calabi-Yau varieties of increasing dimension. In turn, we study the asymptotics of some of these Mahler measures as the dimension increases, as well as properties of the associated algebraic dynamical system. We describe computational experiments that suggest that these cyclotomic integers realise the smallest non-zero logarithmic Mahler measure in the set of algebraic integers with cyclic Galois group of a given odd order. Finally, we discuss some precise conjectures that imply double logarithmic growth for those Mahler measures as a function of that order. The proofs use ideas from the theory of quantitative equidistribution, reflexive polytopes and toric varieties, the theory of random walks, Bessel functions, class field theory, and Linnik's constant.</description>

      <title>On 7-adic Galois representations for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made on Mazur's Program B, with many authors beginning a systematic classification of all possible images of $p$-adic Galois representations attached to elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. Currently, the classification is only complete for $p \in \{2,3,13,17\}$. The main difficulty for other primes arises from the need to understand elliptic curves whose mod-$p^n$ Galois representations are contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup. Equivalently, this amounts to determining the rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^+(p^n)$. Here, we consider the case $p=7$ and show that the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(49)$, of genus 69, has no non-CM rational points. To achieve this, we establish a correspondence between the rational points on $X_{ns}^+(49)$ and the primitive integer solutions of the generalised Fermat equation $a^2 + 28b^3 = 27 c^7$, the resolution of which can be reduced to determining the rational points of several genus-three curves. Furthermore, we reduce the complete classification of $7$-adic images to the determination of the rational points of a single plane quartic.</description>

Abstract: A scalar integer partition problem asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a linear Diophantine equation with integer positive coefficients. The manuscript discusses an algorithm of derivation of linear relations involving the finite number of scalar partitions. The algorithm employs the Cayley theorem about the reduction of a double partition to a sum of scalar partitions based on the variable elimination procedure.</description>

      <title>On the limiting distribution of sums of random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality.
  A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Large sieves for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{F}_n$ be the set of unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ over a number field $F$, and let $S\subseteq\mathfrak{F}_n$ be an arbitrary finite subset. Given $\pi_0\in\mathfrak{F}_{n_0}$, we establish large sieve inequalities for the families $\{L(s,\pi)\colon \pi\in S\}$ and $\{L(s,\pi\times\pi_0)\colon \pi\in S\}$ that, unlike previous results, are independent of progress towards the generalized Ramanujan conjecture, and simultaneously handle the Dirichlet coefficients of $L$, $L^{-1}$, and $\log L$. We also give the first such result that improves upon the trivial bound for short sums. We present several applications, including:
  (1) the strongest bound for $\sum_{\pi\in S}|L(\frac{1}{2},\pi)|^2$ that holds for arbitrary $S$,
  (2) significant improvements to zero density estimates for families of automorphic and Rankin--Selberg $L$-functions, counting violations to the generalized Riemann hypothesis near $\mathrm{Re}(s)=1$,
  (3) the removal of all unproven hypotheses in the conditional log-free zero density estimate for families of Rankin--Selberg $L$-functions proved by Brumley, Thorner, and Zaman, and
  (4) an improvement of the density theorem for non-archimedean Langlands parameters due to Lichtman and Pascadi, counting violations to the generalized Ramanujan conjecture.</description>

      <title>Centered Moments of Weighted One-Level Densities of $GL(2)$ $L$-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Katz and Sarnak conjectured that the behavior of zeros near the central point of any family of $L$-functions is well-modeled by the behavior of eigenvalues near $1$ of some classical compact group (either the symplectic, unitary, or even, odd, or full orthogonal group). In 2018, Knightly and Reno proved that the symmetry group can vary depending on how the $L$-functions in the family are weighted. They observed both orthogonal and symplectic symmetry in the one-level densities of families of cuspidal newform $L$-functions for different choices of weights. We observe the same dependence of symmetry on weights in the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments of these one-level densities, for smooth test functions whose Fourier transforms are supported in $\left(-\frac{1}{2n}, \frac{1}{2n}\right)$. To treat the new terms that emerge in our $n$-level calculations when $n&gt;1$, i.e., the cross terms that emerge from $n$-fold products of primes rather than individual primes, we generalize Knightly and Reno's weighted trace formula from primes to arbitrary positive integers. We then perform a delicate analysis of these cross terms to distinguish their contributions to the main and error terms of the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments. The final novelty here is an elementary combinatorial trick that we use to rewrite the main number theoretic terms arising from our analysis, facilitating comparisons with random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Contour Integrations and Parity Results of Cyclotomic Euler $T$-Sums and Multiple $t$-Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will employ the method of contour integration to investigate the parity results of non-embedded cyclotomic multiple $t$-values, which we refer to as cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums. We can provide explicit parity formulas for the linear and quadratic cases of cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums, as well as state a parity theorem for the general case. We also present illustrative examples and corollaries. From this, some parity results for classical cyclotomic multiple $t$-values can be derived. Furthermore, we present several general formulas for cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums with denominators involving arbitrary rational polynomials through residue computations. By evaluating these polynomials and computing residues, many other formulas analogous to cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums can be derived. In particular, we also obtain certain parity results for the cyclotomic versions of multiple $T$-values as defined by Kaneko and Tsumura. Finally, we propose some conjectures and questions regarding the parity of cyclotomic multiple $t$-values and cyclotomic multiple $T$-values.</description>

      <title>Rank of the family of elliptic curves $y^2 = x^3- 5px$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article considers the family of elliptic curves given by $E_{p}: y^2=x^3-5px$ and certain conditions on an odd prime $p$. More specifically, we have shown that if $p \equiv 7, 23 \pmod {40}$, then the rank of $E_{p}$ is zero for both $ \mathbb{Q} $ and $ \mathbb{Q}(i) $. Furthermore, if the prime $ p $ is of the form $ 40k_1 + 3 $ or $ 40k_2 + 27$, where $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(5k_1+1)$ or $(5k_2 +4)$ are perfect squares, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$. Moreover, if the prime $ p $ is of the form $ 40k_3 + 11 $ or $ 40k_4 + 19$ where $k_3 ~\text{and}~ k_4 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(160k_3+49)$ or $(160k_4 + 81) $ are perfect squares, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank at least one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank at least two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$.</description>

      <title>Almost all binary forms of degree $\geq 3$ fail to represent a fixed integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any fixed integer \( n \geq 3 \) and nonzero integer \( m \), the proportion of integral binary forms of degree \( n \) that represent \( m \) tends to zero as the height tends to infinity. In fact, almost all such forms fail to represent \( m \). Our method uses lattice point counting and geometric methods, including Davenport's lemma and estimates for volumes of hyperplane sections of cubes, together with an analysis of the distribution of rational points on such hyperplanes. The result also holds when restricted to irreducible forms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study principally polarized abelian varieties that admit an automorphism of prime order $p&gt;2$. It turns out that certain natural conditions on the multiplicities of its action on the differentials of the first kind do guarantee that those polarized varieties are not jacobians of curves.</description>

      <title>On integral local Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02829v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a construction of "integral local Shimura varieties" which are formal schemes that generalize the well-known integral models of the Drinfeld $p$-adic upper half spaces. The construction applies to all classical groups, at least for odd $p$. These formal schemes also generalize the formal schemes defined by Rapoport-Zink via moduli of $p$-divisible groups, and are characterized purely in group-theoretic terms. More precisely, for a local $p$-adic Shimura datum $(G, b, \mu)$ and a quasi-parahoric group scheme $\mathcal G$ for $G$, Scholze has defined a functor on perfectoid spaces which parametrizes $p$-adic shtukas. He conjectured that this functor is representable by a normal formal scheme which is locally formally of finite type and flat over $O_{\breve E}$. Scholze-Weinstein proved this conjecture when $(G, b, \mu)$ is of (P)EL type by using Rapoport-Zink formal schemes. We prove this conjecture for any $(G, \mu)$ of abelian type when $p\neq 2$, and when $p=2$ and $G$ is of type $A$ or $C$. We also relate the generic fiber of this formal scheme to the local Shimura variety, a rigid-analytic space attached by Scholze to $(G, b, \mu, {\mathcal G})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $F$-gauges for de Rham cohomology of smooth algebraic varieties in characteristic $p$. Applying to good reductions of Shimura varieties of Hodge type, we recover the Ekedahl-Oort stratifications by constructing universal de Rham $F$-gauges with $G$-structure. We also study the cohomology of de Rham $F$-gauges on these varieties. In particular, in the PEL type case and when the weights of the flat automorphic vector bundles are $p$-small, we determine the $F$-gauge structure on their de Rham cohomology by the associated dual BGG complexes.</description>

      <title>The Schur polynomials in all primitive $n$th roots of unity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schur polynomials in all primitive $n$th roots of unity are $1$, $0$, or $-1$, if $n$ has at most two distinct odd prime factors. This result can be regarded as a generalization of properties of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomial and its multiplicative inverse. The key to the proof is the concept of a unimodular system of vectors. Namely, this result can be reduced to the unimodularity of the tensor product of two maximal circuits (here we call a vector system a maximal circuit, if it can be expressed as $B \cup \{ -\sum B \}$ with some basis $B$).</description>

      <title>The Density Finite Sums Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density and any $k\geq 1$, we show the existence of an infinite set $B\subset{\mathbb N}$ and a shift $t\geq0$ such that $A-t$ contains all sums of $m$ distinct elements from $B$ for all $m\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. This can be viewed as a density analog of Hindman's finite sums theorem. Our proof reveals the natural relationships among infinite sumsets, the dynamics underpinning arithmetic progressions, and homogeneous spaces of nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Frobenius Number via Gomory's Relaxation and Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*}
  \exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*}
  \exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*}
  In this work, we show that \begin{equation*}
  F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$.
  From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$.
  Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to study basic structures and interrelations of $\delta$-rings, perfectoid towers, and lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences over Noetherian rings in positive or mixed characteristic. Then we discuss some methods for constructing perfectoid towers, dealing with $p$-torsion free and $p$-torsion cases, respectively. Some interesting examples arise as quotients by monomial or binomial ideals or determinantal rings. We also explain a geometric method with a view toward constructing rings with certain singularities.</description>
