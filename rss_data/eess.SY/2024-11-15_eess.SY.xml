      <title>Information-Optimal Multi-Spacecraft Positioning for Interstellar Object Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs), astronomical objects not gravitationally bound to the sun, could present valuable opportunities to advance our understanding of the universe's formation and composition. In response to the unpredictable nature of their discoveries that inherently come with large and rapidly changing uncertainty in their state, this paper proposes a novel multi-spacecraft framework for locally maximizing information to be gained through ISO encounters with formal probabilistic guarantees. Given some approximated control and estimation policies for fully autonomous spacecraft operations, we first construct an ellipsoid around its terminal position, where the ISO would be located with a finite probability. The large state uncertainty of the ISO is formally handled here through the hierarchical property in stochastically contracting nonlinear systems. We then propose a method to find the terminal positions of the multiple spacecraft optimally distributed around the ellipsoid, which locally maximizes the information we can get from all the points of interest (POIs). This utilizes a probabilistic information cost function that accounts for spacecraft positions, camera specifications, and ISO position uncertainty, where the information is defined as visual data collected by cameras. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using synthetic ISO candidates generated from quasi-realistic empirical populations. Our method allows each spacecraft to optimally select its terminal state and determine the ideal number of POIs to investigate, potentially enhancing the ability to study these rare and fleeting interstellar visitors while minimizing resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Enhancing reinforcement learning for population setpoint tracking in co-cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient multiple setpoint tracking can enable advanced biotechnological applications, such as maintaining desired population levels in co-cultures for optimal metabolic division of labor. In this study, we employ reinforcement learning as a control method for population setpoint tracking in co-cultures, focusing on policy-gradient techniques where the control policy is parameterized by neural networks. However, achieving accurate tracking across multiple setpoints is a significant challenge in reinforcement learning, as the agent must effectively balance the contributions of various setpoints to maximize the expected system performance. Traditional return functions, such as those based on a quadratic cost, often yield suboptimal performance due to their inability to efficiently guide the agent toward the simultaneous satisfaction of all setpoints. To overcome this, we propose a novel return function that rewards the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple setpoints and diminishes overall reward gains otherwise, accounting for both stage and terminal system performance. This return function includes parameters to fine-tune the desired smoothness and steepness of the learning process. We demonstrate our approach considering an $\textit{Escherichia coli}$ co-culture in a chemostat with optogenetic control over amino acid synthesis pathways, leveraging auxotrophies to modulate growth.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Physics-Informed Neural Network-based Nonlinear Observer design for autonomous systems using contraction analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contraction analysis offers, through elegant mathematical developments, a unified way of designing observers for a general class of nonlinear systems, where the observer correction term is obtained by solving an infinite dimensional inequality that guarantees global exponential convergence. However, solving the matrix partial differential inequality involved in contraction analysis design is both analytically and numerically challenging and represents a long-lasting challenge that prevented its wide use. Therefore, the present paper proposes a novel approach that relies on an unsupervised Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to design the observer's correction term by enforcing the partial differential inequality in the loss function. The performance of the proposed PINN-based nonlinear observer is assessed in numerical simulation as well as its robustness to measurement noise and neural network approximation error.</description>

      <title>Are the flows of complex-valued Laplacians and their pseudoinverses related?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laplacian flows model the rate of change of each node's state as being proportional to the difference between its value and that of its neighbors. Typically, these flows capture diffusion or synchronization dynamics and are well-studied. Expanding on these classical flows, we introduce a pseudoinverse Laplacian flow system, substituting the Laplacian with its pseudoinverse within complex-valued networks. Interestingly, for undirected graphs and unsigned weight-balanced digraphs, Laplacian and the pseudoinverse Laplacian flows exhibit an interdependence in terms of consensus. To show this relation, we first present the conditions for achieving consensus in the pseudoinverse Laplacian flow system using the property of real eventually exponentially positivity. Thereafter, we show that the pseudoinverse Laplacian flow system converges to consensus if and only if the Laplacian flow system achieves consensus in the above-mentioned networks. However, these are only the sufficient conditions for digraphs. Further, we illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach through examples, focusing primarily on power networks.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Electricity Consumption Flexibility in Different Industrial Plant Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flexibility of industrial power consumption plays a key role in the transition to renewable energy systems, contributing to grid stability, cost reduction and decarbonization efforts. This paper presents a novel methodology to quantify and optimize the flexibility of electricity consumption in manufacturing plants. The proposed model is applied to actual cement and steel plant configurations. Comparative simulations performed with the model reveal significant differences in flexibility and cost-effectiveness, driven by factors such as production capacity, downstream process demand, storage capacity, and operational constraints. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further clarifies the impact of various parameters on production optimization and flexibility savings. Specifically, as demand approaches production levels, flexibility decreases. Although increasing storage capacity typically reduces production costs, the benefits diminish above a certain threshold. The results provide valuable information for industrial operators wishing to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs and increase the flexibility of their operations.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Event-Triggered Implementation of Hybrid Controllers Using Finite-Time Convergent Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the conditions for asymptotic stability of the hybrid closed-loop system resulting from the interconnection of a nonlinear plant, an intelligent sensor that generates finite-time convergent estimates of the plant state, and a controller node that receives opportunistic samples from the sensor node when certain model-based event-triggering conditions are met. The proposed method is endowed with a degree of separation, in the sense that the controller design is independent of the sensor design. This is achieved under mild regularity conditions imposed on the hybrid closed-loop system and the existence of persistently flowing solutions. We demonstrate the versatility of the method by implementing it on: 1) a sampled-data controller for regulation of linear plants; 2) a synergistic controller for attitude stabilization of rigid bodies. The effectiveness of these novel controllers is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Remote Synchronization in Coupled Nonlinear Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates remote synchronization in scale-free networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators inspired by synchronization observed in the brain's cortical regions and power grid. We employ the Master Stability Function (MSF) approach to analyze network stability across various oscillator models. Synchronization results are obtained for a star network using linearization techniques and extended to arbitrary networks with benchmark oscillators, verifying consistent behavior. Stable synchronous solutions emerge as the Floquet multiplier decreases and the MSF becomes negative. Additionally, we demonstrate remote synchronization in a star network, where peripheral oscillators communicate exclusively through a central hub, drawing parallels to neuronal synchronization in the brain. Experimental validation is achieved through an electronic circuit testbed, supported by nonlinear ODE modeling and LTspice simulation. Future work will extend the investigation to arbitrary network topologies, further elucidating synchronization dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>A small-gain criterion for 2-contraction of large scale interconnected systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite modular conditions to guarantee stability for large-scale systems have been widely studied, few methods are available to tackle the case of networks with multiple equilibria. This paper introduces small-gain like sufficient conditions for 2-contraction of large-scale interconnected systems on the basis of a family of upper-bounds to the $L_2$ gains that arise from the gains computed on individual channels of the second additive variational equation. Such a condition guarantee the 2-additive compound of the system's Jacobian to be exponentially contractive, thus implying convergence towards equilibria of the system's solutions. The gains are obtained by solving suitable Linear Matrix Inequalities. Three interconnected Thomas' systems are considered in order to illustrate the application of the theory and the degree of conservatism.</description>

      <title>Safety Filter for Robust Disturbance Rejection via Online Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disturbance rejection in high-precision control applications can be significantly improved upon via online convex optimization (OCO). This includes classical techniques such as recursive least squares (RLS) and more recent, regret-based formulations. However, these methods can cause instabilities in the presence of model uncertainty. This paper introduces a safety filter for systems with OCO in the form of adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filtering to ensure robust disturbance rejection. The safety filter enforces a robust stability constraint on the FIR coefficients while minimally altering the OCO command in the $\infty$-norm cost. Additionally, we show that the induced $\ell_\infty$-norm allows for easy online implementation of the safety filter by directly limiting the OCO command. The constraint can be tuned to trade off robustness and performance. We provide a simple example to demonstrate the safety filter.</description>

      <title>How to implement the Bayes' formula in the age of ML?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter contains a self-contained introduction to the significance of Bayes' formula in the context of nonlinear filtering problems. Both discrete-time and continuous-time settings of the problem are considered in a unified manner. In control theory, the focus on optimization-based solution approaches is stressed together with a discussion of historical developments in this area (from 1960s onwards). The heart of this chapter contains a presentation of a novel optimal transportation formulation for the Bayes formula (developed recently by the first author) and its relationship to some of the prior joint work (feedback particle filter) from the authors. The presentation highlights how optimal transportation theory is leveraged to overcome some of the numerical challenges of implementing Bayes' law by enabling the use of machine learning (ML) tools.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Adaptive Metasurface in Complex Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The programmable metasurface is regarded as one of the most promising transformative technologies for next-generation wireless system applications. Due to the lack of effective perception ability of the external electromagnetic environment, there are numerous challenges in the intelligent regulation of wireless channels, and it still relies on external sensors to reshape electromagnetic environment as desired. To address that problem, we propose an adaptive metasurface (AMS) which integrates the capabilities of acquiring wireless environment information and manipulating reflected electromagnetic (EM) waves in a programmable manner. The proposed design endows the metasurfaces with excellent capabilities to sense the complex electromagnetic field distributions around them and then dynamically manipulate the waves and signals in real time under the guidance of the sensed information, eliminating the need for prior knowledge or external inputs about the wireless environment. For verification, a prototype of the proposed AMS is constructed, and its dual capabilities of sensing and manipulation are experimentally validated. Additionally, different integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios with and without the aid of the AMS are established. The effectiveness of the AMS in enhancing communication quality is well demonstrated in complex electromagnetic environments, highlighting its beneficial application potential in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>From Simulators to Digital Twins for Enabling Emerging Cellular Networks: A Tutorial and Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulators are indispensable parts of the research and development necessary to advance countless industries, including cellular networks. With simulators, the evaluation, analysis, testing, and experimentation of novel designs and algorithms can be executed in a more cost-effective and convenient manner without the risk of real network service disruption. Additionally, recent trends indicate that the advancement of these Digital System Models (DSM), such as system-level simulators, will hold a pivotal role in advancing cellular networks by facilitating the development of digital twins. Given this growing significance, in this survey and tutorial paper, we present an extensive review of the currently available DSMs for 5G and beyond (5G&amp;B) networks. Specifically, we begin with a tutorial on the fundamental concepts of 5G&amp;B network simulations, followed by an identification of the essential design requirements needed to model the key features of these networks. We also devised a taxonomy of different types of 5G&amp;B network simulators. In contrast to existing simulator surveys, which mostly leverage traditional metrics applicable to legacy networks, we devise and use 5G-specific evaluation metrics that capture three key facets of a network simulator, namely realism, completeness, and computational efficiency. We evaluate each simulator according to the devised metrics to generate an applicability matrix that maps different 5G&amp;B simulators vis-a-vis the different research themes they can potentially enable. We also present the current challenges in developing 5G&amp;B simulators while laying out several potential solutions to address the issues. Finally, we discuss the future challenges related to simulator design provisions that will arise with the emergence of 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Reliability, Resilience and Human Factors Engineering for Trustworthy AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems become integral to critical operations across industries and services, ensuring their reliability and safety is essential. We offer a framework that integrates established reliability and resilience engineering principles into AI systems. By applying traditional metrics such as failure rate and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) along with resilience engineering and human reliability analysis, we propose an integrate framework to manage AI system performance, and prevent or efficiently recover from failures. Our work adapts classical engineering methods to AI systems and outlines a research agenda for future technical studies. We apply our framework to a real-world AI system, using system status data from platforms such as openAI, to demonstrate its practical applicability. This framework aligns with emerging global standards and regulatory frameworks, providing a methodology to enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems. Our aim is to guide policy, regulation, and the development of reliable, safe, and adaptable AI technologies capable of consistent performance in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Control Barrier Function with Provably Safe Guarantees: Reducing Conservatism with Heading-Aware Safety Margin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a learning-based Control Barrier Function (CBF) to reduce conservatism in collision avoidance of car-like robots. Traditional CBFs often use Euclidean distance between robots' centers as safety margin, neglecting headings and simplifying geometries to circles. While this ensures smooth, differentiable safety functions required by CBFs, it can be overly conservative in tight environments. To address this limitation, we design a heading-aware safety margin that accounts for the robots' orientations, enabling a less conservative and more accurate estimation of safe regions. Since the function computing this safety margin is non-differentiable, we approximate it with a neural network to ensure differentiability and facilitate integration with CBFs. We describe how we achieve bounded learning error and incorporate the upper bound into the CBF to provide formal safety guarantees through forward invariance. We show that our CBF is a high-order CBF with relative degree two for a system with two robots whose dynamics are modeled by the nonlinear kinematic bicycle model. Experimental results in overtaking and bypassing scenarios reveal a 33.5 % reduction in conservatism compared to traditional methods, while maintaining safety.

      <title>AMARETTO: Enabling Efficient Quantum Algorithm Emulation on Low-Tier FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers and industries are increasingly drawn to quantum computing for its computational potential. However, validating new quantum algorithms is challenging due to the limitations of current quantum devices. Software simulators are time and memory-consuming, making hardware emulators an attractive alternative. This article introduces AMARETTO (quAntuM ARchitecture EmulaTion TechnOlogy), designed for quantum computing emulation on low-tier Field-Programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), supporting Clifford+T and rotational gate sets. It simplifies and accelerates the verification of quantum algorithms using a Reduced-Instruction-Set-Computer (RISC)-like structure and efficient handling of sparse quantum gates. A dedicated compiler translates OpenQASM 2.0 into RISC-like instructions. AMARETTO is validated against the Qiskit simulators.

      <title>Architectural Exploration of Application-Specific Resonant SRAM Compute-in-Memory (rCiM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While general-purpose computing follows Von Neumann's architecture, the data movement between memory and processor elements dictates the processor's performance. The evolving compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigm tackles this issue by facilitating simultaneous processing and storage within static random-access memory (SRAM) elements. Numerous design decisions taken at different levels of hierarchy affect the figure of merits (FoMs) of SRAM, such as power, performance, area, and yield. The absence of a rapid assessment mechanism for the impact of changes at different hierarchy levels on global FoMs poses a challenge to accurately evaluating innovative SRAM designs. This paper presents an automation tool designed to optimize the energy and latency of SRAM designs incorporating diverse implementation strategies for executing logic operations within the SRAM. The tool structure allows easy comparison across different array topologies and various design strategies to result in energy-efficient implementations. Our study involves a comprehensive comparison of over 6900+ distinct design implementation strategies for EPFL combinational benchmark circuits on the energy-recycling resonant compute-in-memory (rCiM) architecture designed using TSMC 28 nm technology. When provided with a combinational circuit, the tool aims to generate an energy-efficient implementation strategy tailored to the specified input memory and latency constraints. The tool reduces 80.9% of energy consumption on average across all benchmarks while using the six-topology implementation compared to baseline implementation of single-macro topology by considering the parallel processing capability of rCiM cache size ranging from 4KB to 192KB.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibrium seeking for a class of quadratic-bilinear Wasserstein distributionally robust games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of Wasserstein distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problems, where agents construct heterogeneous data-driven Wasserstein ambiguity sets using private samples and radii, in line with their individual risk-averse behaviour. By leveraging relevant properties of this class of games, we show that equilibria of the original seemingly infinite-dimensional problem can be obtained as a solution to a finite-dimensional Nash equilibrium problem. We then reformulate the problem as a finite-dimensional variational inequality and establish the connection between the corresponding solution sets. Our reformulation has scalable behaviour with respect to the data size and maintains a fixed number of constraints, independently of the number of samples. To compute a solution, we leverage two algorithms, based on the golden ratio algorithm. The efficiency of both algorithmic schemes is corroborated through extensive simulation studies on an illustrative example and a stochastic portfolio allocation game, where behavioural coupling among investors is modeled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the functional derivatives of a finite horizon error norm between a full-order and a reduced-order continuous-time linear time-varying (LTV) system. Based on the functional derivatives, first-order necessary conditions for optimality of the error norm are derived, and a projection-based iterative scheme for model reduction is proposed. The iterative scheme upon convergence produces reduced-order models satisfying the optimality conditions. Finally, through a numerical example, we demonstrate the better performance of the proposed model reduction scheme in comparison to the finite horizon balanced truncation algorithm for continuous-time LTV systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Control Synthesis from Global Temporal Logic Tasks with Synchronous Satisfaction Requirements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the multi-agent control problem under global temporal logic tasks, considering agents with heterogeneous capabilities. These global tasks involve not only absolute and relative temporal and spatial constraints, but also group behaviors, including task completion times, agent capabilities, and task interdependencies such as the need for synchronous execution. The global tasks are formally formulated into global signal temporal logic (STL) formulae, and a synchronous robustness metric is designed to evaluate the synchronization quality with real values. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) encoding method is further proposed to realize task-satisfied motion planning with high synchronicity and minimum control efforts. The encoding method uses a logarithmic number of binary variables to fully capture synchronous robustness, leading to only linear computational complexity. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a moving horizon estimation scheme to estimate the states and the unknown constant parameters of general nonlinear uncertain discrete-time systems. The proposed framework and analysis explicitly do not involve the a priori verification of a particular excitation condition for the parameters. Instead, we use online information about the actual excitation of the parameters at any time during operation and ensure that the regularization term in the cost function is always automatically selected appropriately. This ensures that the state and parameter estimation error is bounded for all times, even if the parameters are never (or only rarely) excited during operation. Robust exponential stability of the state and parameter estimation error emerges under an additional uniform condition on the maximum duration of insufficient excitation. The theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear system identification (NL-SI) has proven to be effective in obtaining accurate models for highly complex systems. Especially, recent encoder-based methods for artificial neural networks state-space (ANN-SS) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, while offering consistency and computational efficiency. The inclusion of prior knowledge of the system can be exploited to increase (i) estimation speed, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) interpretability of the resulting models. This paper proposes an encoder based model augmentation method incorporating prior knowledge from first-principles (FP) models. We introduce a novel linear-fractional-representation (LFR) model structure that allows for the unified representation of various augmentation structures including the ones that are commonly used in the literature, and an identification algorithm for estimating the proposed structure together with appropriate initialization methods. The performance and generalization capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated on a hardening mass-spring-damper simulation.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Model Order Reduction for Nonlinear DAE Models of Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the joint reduction of the number of dynamic and algebraic states of a nonlinear differential-algebraic equation (NDAE) model of a power network. The dynamic states depict the internal states of generators, loads, renewables, whereas the algebraic ones define network states such as voltages and phase angles. In the current literature of power system model order reduction (MOR), the algebraic constraints are usually neglected and the power network is commonly modeled via a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) instead of NDAEs. Thus, reduction is usually carried out for the dynamic states only and the algebraic variables are kept intact. This leaves a significant part of the system's size and complexity unreduced. This paper addresses this aforementioned limitation by jointly reducing both dynamic and algebraic variables. As compared to the literature the proposed MOR techniques are endowed with the following features: (i) no system linearization is required, (ii) require no transformation to an equivalent or approximate ODE representation, (iii) guarantee that the reduced order model to be NDAE-structured and thus preserves the differential-algebraic structure of original power system model, and (iv) can seamlessly reduce both dynamic and algebraic variables while maintaining high accuracy. Case studies performed on a 2000-bus power system reveal that the proposed MOR techniques are able to reduce system order while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Attack Resilience in Real-Time Systems through Variable Control Task Sampling Rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in modern real-time applications integrate numerous control units linked through communication networks, each responsible for executing a mix of real-time safety-critical and non-critical tasks. To ensure predictable timing behaviour, most safety-critical tasks are scheduled with fixed sampling periods, which supports rigorous safety and performance analyses. However, this deterministic execution can be exploited by attackers to launch inference-based attacks on safety-critical tasks. This paper addresses the challenge of preventing such timing inference or schedule-based attacks by dynamically adjusting the execution rates of safety-critical tasks while maintaining their performance. We propose a novel schedule vulnerability analysis methodology, enabling runtime switching between valid schedules for various control task sampling rates. Leveraging this approach, we present the Multi-Rate Attack-Aware Randomized Scheduling (MAARS) framework for preemptive fixed-priority schedulers, designed to reduce the success rate of timing inference attacks on real-time systems. To our knowledge, this is the first method that combines attack-aware schedule randomization with preserved control and scheduling integrity. The framework's efficacy in attack prevention is evaluated on automotive benchmarks using a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) setup.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Highway Ramp Merge Safety and Efficiency via Spatio-Temporal Cooperative Control and Vehicle-Road Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In view of existing automatic driving is difficult to accurately and timely obtain the status and driving intention of other vehicles and the safety risk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are evaluated. As a result, while vehicles generally maintain safe distances, accidents still frequently occur, particularly in merging areas. To ensure safety, improve road efficiency, this paper presents a pre-programmed technique for managing vehicles' spatiotemporal trajectories to proactively mitigate conflicts among vehicles. Firstly, the study focuses on the calculation of safe distances under varying spatiotemporal conditions, taking into account differences in vehicle speed. Subsequently, an evaluation model for vehicle conflict risk is developed, which incorporates critical parameters such as collision acceleration and emergency acceleration. The methodology further identifies the main line vehicles that are potentially in conflict with on-ramp vehicles and determines the target gap for the latter. Based on this selected target gap, a cooperative control method is formulated, enabling the pre-programming of vehicle trajectories. Using highway ramp merging as a case study, the paper introduces a mainline priority spatiotemporal cooperative control method and validates its efficacy through rigorous simulations. The analysis indicates that the average delay time can be reduced by 97.96%, and fuel consumption by 6.01%. The mainline priority strategy demonstrates increased speed, low latency and low fuel consumption.</description>

      <title>How many autonomous vehicles are required to stabilize traffic flow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collective behavior of human-driven vehicles (HVs) produces the well-known stop-and-go waves potentially leading to higher fuel consumption and emissions. This paper investigates the stabilization of traffic flow via a minimum number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) subject to constraints on the control parameters aiming to reduce the number of vehicles on the road while achieving lower fuel consumption and emissions. The unconstrained scenario has been well-studied in recent studies. The main motivation to investigate the constrained scenario is that, in realistic engineering applications, lower and upper bounds exist on the control parameters. For the constrained scenario, we optimally find the minimum number of required AVs (via computing the optimal lower bound on the AV penetration rate) to stabilize traffic flow for a given number of HVs. As an immediate consequence, we conclude that for a given number of AVs, the number of HVs in the stabilized traffic flow may not be arbitrarily large in the constrained scenario unlike the unconstrained scenario studied in the literature. We systematically propose a procedure to compute the optimal lower bound on the AV penetration rate using nonlinear optimization techniques. Finally, we validate the theoretical results via numerical simulations. Numerical simulations suggest that enlarging the constraint intervals makes a smaller optimal lower bound on the AV penetration rate attainable. However, it leads to a slower transient response due to a dominant pole closer to the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies the robustness properties of discrete-time stochastic optimal control under Wasserstein model approximation for both discounted cost and average cost criteria. Specifically, we study the performance loss when applying an optimal policy designed for an approximate model to the true dynamics compared with the optimal cost for the true model under the sup-norm-induced metric, and relate it to the Wasserstein-1 distance between the approximate and true transition kernels. A primary motivation of this analysis is empirical model learning, as well as empirical noise distribution learning, where Wasserstein convergence holds under mild conditions but stronger convergence criteria, such as total variation, may not. We discuss applications of the results to the disturbance estimation problem, where sample complexity bounds are given, and also to a general empirical model learning approach, obtained under either Markov or i.i.d.~learning settings. Further applications regarding the continuity of invariant probability measures with respect to transition kernels are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) represent a compelling and under-explored category of celestial bodies, providing physical laboratories to understand the formation of our solar system and probe the composition and properties of material formed in exoplanetary systems. In this work, we investigate existing approaches to designing successful flyby missions to ISOs, including a deep learning-driven guidance and control algorithm for ISOs traveling at velocities over 60 km/s. We have generated spacecraft trajectories to a series of synthetic representative ISOs, simulating a ground campaign to observe the target and resolve its state, thereby determining the cruise and close approach delta-Vs required for the encounter. We discuss the accessibility of and mission design to ISOs with varying characteristics, with special focuses on 1) state covariance estimation throughout the cruise, 2) handoffs from traditional navigation approaches to novel autonomous navigation for fast flyby regimes, and 3) overall recommendations about preparing for the future in situ exploration of these targets. The lessons learned also apply to the fast flyby of other small bodies, e.g., long-period comets and potentially hazardous asteroids, which also require tactical responses with similar characteristics.</description>

      <title>CaRL: Cascade Reinforcement Learning with State Space Splitting for O-RAN based Traffic Steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture empowers intelligent and automated optimization of the RAN through applications deployed on the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform, enabling capabilities beyond what is achievable with traditional RAN solutions. Within this paradigm, Traffic Steering (TS) emerges as a pivotal RIC application that focuses on optimizing cell-level mobility settings in near-real-time, aiming to significantly improve network spectral efficiency. In this paper, we design a novel TS algorithm based on a Cascade Reinforcement Learning (CaRL) framework. We propose state space factorization and policy decomposition to reduce the need for large models and well-labeled datasets. For each sub-state space, an RL sub-policy will be trained to learn an optimized mapping onto the action space. To apply CaRL on new network regions, we propose a knowledge transfer approach to initialize a new sub-policy based on knowledge learned by the trained policies. To evaluate CaRL, we build a data-driven and scalable RIC digital twin (DT) that is modeled using important real-world data, including network configuration, user geo-distribution, and traffic demand, among others, from a tier-1 mobile operator in the US. We evaluate CaRL on two DT scenarios representing two network clusters in two different cities and compare its performance with the business-as-usual (BAU) policy and other competing optimization approaches using heuristic and Q-table algorithms. Benchmarking results show that CaRL performs the best and improves the average cluster-aggregated downlink throughput over the BAU policy by 24% and 18% in these two scenarios, respectively.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Power Flow Approximations with Second-Order Sensitivity Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power flow equations are fundamental to power system planning, analysis, and control. However, the inherent non-linearity and non-convexity of these equations present formidable obstacles in problem-solving processes. To mitigate these challenges, recent research has proposed adaptive power flow linearizations that aim to achieve accuracy over wide operating ranges. The accuracy of these approximations inherently depends on the curvature of the power flow equations within these ranges, which necessitates considering second-order sensitivities. In this paper, we leverage second-order sensitivities to both analyze and improve power flow approximations. We evaluate the curvature across broad operational ranges and subsequently utilize this information to inform the computation of various sample-based power flow approximation techniques. Additionally, we leverage second-order sensitivities to guide the development of rational approximations that yield linear constraints in optimization problems. This approach is extended to enhance accuracy beyond the limitations of linear functions across varied operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Power Scheduling: A User-Centric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00476</link>

Abstract: While traditional optimization and scheduling schemes are designed to meet fixed, predefined system requirements, future systems are moving toward user-driven approaches and personalized services, aiming to achieve high quality-of-experience (QoE) and flexibility. This challenge is particularly pronounced in wireless and digitalized energy networks, where users' requirements have largely not been taken into consideration due to the lack of a common language between users and machines. The emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) marks a radical departure from traditional system-centric methods into more advanced user-centric approaches by providing a natural communication interface between users and devices. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a novel architecture for resource scheduling problems by constructing three LLM agents to convert an arbitrary user's voice request (VRQ) into a resource allocation vector. Specifically, we design an LLM intent recognition agent to translate the request into an optimization problem (OP), an LLM OP parameter identification agent, and an LLM OP solving agent. To evaluate system performance, we construct a database of typical VRQs in the context of electric vehicle (EV) charging. As a proof of concept, we primarily use Llama 3 8B. Through testing with different prompt engineering scenarios, the obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed architecture. The conducted performance analysis allows key insights to be extracted. For instance, having a larger set of candidate OPs to model the real-world problem might degrade the final performance because of a higher recognition/OP classification noise level. All results and codes are open source.</description>

      <title>Is Linear Feedback on Smoothed Dynamics Sufficient for Stabilizing Contact-Rich Plans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing planners and controllers for contact-rich manipulation is extremely challenging as contact violates the smoothness conditions that many gradient-based controller synthesis tools assume. Contact smoothing approximates a non-smooth system with a smooth one, allowing one to use these synthesis tools more effectively. However, applying classical control synthesis methods to smoothed contact dynamics remains relatively under-explored. This paper analyzes the efficacy of linear controller synthesis using differential simulators based on contact smoothing. We introduce natural baselines for leveraging contact smoothing to compute (a) open-loop plans robust to uncertain conditions and/or dynamics, and (b) feedback gains to stabilize around open-loop plans. Using robotic bimanual whole-body manipulation as a testbed, we perform extensive empirical experiments on over 300 trajectories and analyze why LQR seems insufficient for stabilizing contact-rich plans.
