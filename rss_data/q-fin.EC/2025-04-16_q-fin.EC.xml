      <title>Artificial Intelligence and the Dual Paradoxes: Examining the Interplay of Efficiency, Resource Consumption, and Labor Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence's (AI) rapid development and growth not only transformed industries but also fired up important debates about its impacts on employment, resource allocation, and the ethics involved in decision-making. It serves to understand how changes within an industry will be able to influence society with that change. Advancing AI technologies will create a dual paradox of efficiency, greater resource consumption, and displacement of traditional labor. In this context, we explore the impact of AI on energy consumption, human labor roles, and hybrid roles widespread human labor replacement. We used mixed methods involving qualitative and quantitative analyses of data identified from various sources. Findings suggest that AI increases energy consumption and has impacted human labor roles to a minimal extent, considering that its applicability is limited to some tasks that require human judgment. In this context, the</description>

      <title>Short-Term Effects of COVID-19 on Wages: Empirical Evidence and Underlying Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the causal relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and wage levels, aiming to provide a quantified assessment of the impact. While no significant evidence is found for long-term effects, the analysis reveals a statistically significant positive influence on wages in the short term, particularly within a one-year horizon. Contrary to common expectations, the results suggest that COVID-19 may have led to short-run wage increases. Several potential mechanisms are proposed to explain this counterintuitive outcome. The findings remain robust when controlling for other macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, considered here as a proxy for aggregate demand. The paper also addresses issues of external validity in the concluding section.</description>

      <title>Who is More Bayesian: Humans or ChatGPT?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the performance of human and artificially intelligent (AI) decision makers in simple binary classification tasks where the optimal decision rule is given by Bayes Rule. We reanalyze choices of human subjects gathered from laboratory experiments conducted by El-Gamal and Grether and Holt and Smith. We confirm that while overall, Bayes Rule represents the single best model for predicting human choices, subjects are heterogeneous and a significant share of them make suboptimal choices that reflect judgement biases described by Kahneman and Tversky that include the ``representativeness heuristic'' (excessive weight on the evidence from the sample relative to the prior) and ``conservatism'' (excessive weight on the prior relative to the sample). We compare the performance of AI subjects gathered from recent versions of large language models (LLMs) including several versions of ChatGPT. These general-purpose generative AI chatbots are not specifically trained to do well in narrow decision making tasks, but are trained instead as ``language predictors'' using a large corpus of textual data from the web. We show that ChatGPT is also subject to biases that result in suboptimal decisions. However we document a rapid evolution in the performance of ChatGPT from sub-human performance for early versions (ChatGPT 3.5) to superhuman and nearly perfect Bayesian classifications in the latest versions (ChatGPT 4o).</description>

      <title>Geographic Variation in Multigenerational Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using complete-count register data spanning three generations, we compare inter- and multigenerational transmission processes across municipalities in Sweden. We first document spatial patterns in intergenerational (parent-child) mobility, and study whether those patterns are robust to the choice of mobility statistic and the quality of the underlying microdata. We then ask whether there exists similar geographic variation in multigenerational mobility. Interpreting those patterns through the lens of a latent factor model, we identify which features of the transmission process vary across places.</description>

      <title>Shifting Work Patterns with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present evidence on how generative AI changes the work patterns of knowledge workers using data from a 6-month-long, cross-industry, randomized field experiment. Half of the 6,000 workers in the study received access to a generative AI tool integrated into the applications they already used for emails, document creation, and meetings. We find that access to the AI tool during the first year of its release primarily impacted behaviors that could be changed independently and not behaviors that required coordination to change: workers who used the tool spent 3 fewer hours, or 25% less time on email each week (intent to treat estimate is 1.4 hours) and seemed to complete documents moderately faster, but did not significantly change time spent in meetings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in generative AI have rapidly expanded the potential of computers to perform or assist in a wide array of tasks traditionally performed by humans. We analyze a large, real-world randomized experiment of over 6,000 workers at 56 firms to present some of the earliest evidence on how these technologies are changing the way knowledge workers do their jobs. We find substantial time savings on common core tasks across a wide range of industries and occupations: workers who make use of this technology spent half an hour less reading email each week and completed documents 12% faster. Despite the newness of the technology, nearly 40% of workers who were given access to the tool used it regularly in their work throughout the 6-month study.</description>

      <title>Advancing the Economic and Environmental Sustainability of Rare Earth Element Recovery from Phosphogypsum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transitioning to green energy technologies requires more sustainable and secure rare earth elements (REE) production. The current production of rare earth oxides (REOs) is completed by an energy and chemically intensive process from the mining of REE ores. Investigations into a more sustainable supply of REEs from secondary sources, such as toxic phosphogypsum (PG) waste, is vital to securing the REE supply chain. However, conventional solvent extraction to recover dilute REEs from PG waste is inefficient and has high environmental impact. In this work, we propose a treatment train for the recovery of REEs from PG which includes a bio-inspired adsorptive separation to generate a stream of pure REEs, and we assess its financial viability and environmental impacts under uncertainties through a "probabilistic sustainability" framework integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA). Results show that in 87% of baseline scenario simulations, the internal rate of return (IRR) exceeded 15%, indicating that this system has the potential to be profitable. However, environmental impacts of the system are mixed. Specifically, the proposed system outperforms conventional systems in ecosystem quality and resource depletion, but has higher human health impacts. Scenario analysis shows that the system is profitable at capacities larger than 100,000 kg*hr-1*PG for PG with REE content above 0.5 wt%. The most dilute PG sources (0.02-0.1 wt% REE) are inaccessible using the current process scheme (limited by the cost of acid and subsequent neutralization) requiring further examination of new process schemes and improvements in technological performance. Overall, this study evaluates the sustainability of a first-of-its-kind REE recovery process from PG and uses these results to provide clear direction for advancing sustainable REE recovery from secondary sources.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Trade? Testing Financial Theories with LLM Agents in Market Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a realistic simulated stock market where large language models (LLMs) act as heterogeneous competing trading agents. The open-source framework incorporates a persistent order book with market and limit orders, partial fills, dividends, and equilibrium clearing alongside agents with varied strategies, information sets, and endowments. Agents submit standardized decisions using structured outputs and function calls while expressing their reasoning in natural language. Three findings emerge: First, LLMs demonstrate consistent strategy adherence and can function as value investors, momentum traders, or market makers per their instructions. Second, market dynamics exhibit features of real financial markets, including price discovery, bubbles, underreaction, and strategic liquidity provision. Third, the framework enables analysis of LLMs' responses to varying market conditions, similar to partial dependence plots in machine-learning interpretability. The framework allows simulating financial theories without closed-form solutions, creating experimental designs that would be costly with human participants, and establishing how prompts can generate correlated behaviors affecting market stability.</description>

      <title>Fusion for high-value heat production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global consumption of heat is vast and difficult to decarbonise, but it could present an opportunity for commercial fusion energy technology.
  The economics of supplying heat with fusion energy are explored in context of a future decarbonised energy system. A simple, generalised model is used to estimate the impact of selling heat on profitability, and compare it to selling electricity, for a variety of fusion proposed power plant permutations described in literature.
  Heat production has the potential to significantly improve the financial performance of fusion over selling electricity. Upon entering a highly electrified energy system, fusion should aim to operate as a grid-scale heat pump, avoiding both electrical conversion and recirculation costs whilst exploiting firm demand for high-value heat. This strategy is relatively high-risk, high-reward, but options are identified for hedging these risks. We also identify and discuss new avenues for competition in this domain, which would not exist if fusion supplies electricity only.</description>
