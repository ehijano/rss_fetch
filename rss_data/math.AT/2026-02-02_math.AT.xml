      <title>The Homology of Complex Equivariant Bordism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an abelian compact Lie group and let $E$ be an oriented $A$-spectrum. We compute the $E$-homology of tom Dieck's homotopical $A$-equivariant complex bordism spectrum $MU_A$ in two ways, correcting an error in Cole-Greenlees-Kriz (2002). Additionally, we calculate the $E$-homology of the geometric $A$-equivariant complex bordism spectrum $mU_A$.</description>

      <title>Reducibility of self-maps in monoid and its related invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a positive integer $k$, we investigate the $k$-redcibility of self-maps in the monoid $\AA^k(X\vee Y)$, consisting of self-maps that induce isomorphisms on homology groups up to degree $k$. In general, verifying $k$-reducibility is a subtle problem. We show that the $k$-reducibility of a self-map is determine through its induced endomorphisms on homology or cohomology groups. Moreover, under the k-reducibility assumption, the computation of the homology self-closeness number of the wedge sum of spaces essentially reduces to the computation of the homology self-closeness numbers of the individual wedge summands. We generalize the notion of an atomic space to that of an $n$-atomic space and establish some of its fundamental properties. We show that the $k$-reducibility criteria for self-maps in a monoid $\AA^k(X)$ is satisfied when the space $X$ decomposes as a wedge sum of distinct $n$-atomic spaces. Finally, we determine the homology self-closeness numbers of wedge sums of distinct $n$-atomic spaces.</description>

      <title>On polynomial functors and polynomial comonads over infinity groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that single-variable polynomial functors over the category $\mathcal{S}$ of infinity groupoids, as defined by Gepner-Haugseng-Kock, are exactly colimits of representable copresheaves indexed by infinity groupoid. This allows us to establish certain categorical properties of the $\infty$-category $Poly_{\mathcal{S}}$, in parallel with the case of the ordinary category $Poly$. We define the notion of polynomial comonad under the monoidal structure of $Poly_{\mathcal{S}}$ induced by composition of polynomials, and describe a construction toward exploring the connection between polynomial comonads and complete Segal spaces. This construction partially generalizes the classical one given in the proof of a theorem of Ahman-Uustalu.</description>

      <title>Radicals and Nilpotents in Equivariant Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Associated to each Tambara functor $T$ is its Nakaoka spectrum $\mathrm{Spec}(T)$, analogous to the Zariski spectrum of a commutative ring. We establish that this topological space is spectral. This result follows from an analysis of the notion of nilpotence in Tamabra functors. We prove that the nilradical of a Tambara functor $T$ (the intersection of all of its prime ideals) is computed levelwise, i.e. consists precisely of the nilpotent elements in $T$. In contrast to ordinary commutative algebra, the nilpotents of $T$ are not the same as the elements $x$ such that $T[1/x] = 0$; we therefore also give a classification of these elements. As a corollary, we observe that the set of these elements in $\pi_\star^s$ (the equivariant stable stems, viewed as an $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded Tambara functor) forms an ideal.</description>

      <title>Cubical approximation for directed topology I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0509</link>
      <description>arXiv:1012.0509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological spaces - such as classifying spaces, configuration spaces and spacetimes - often admit extra temporal structure. Qualitative invariants on such directed spaces often are more informative yet more difficult to calculate than classical homotopy invariants on underlying spaces because directed spaces rarely decompose as homotopy colimits of simpler directed spaces. Directed spaces often arise as geometric realizations of simplicial sets and cubical sets equipped with temporal structure encoding the orientations of simplices and 1-cubes. In an attempt to develop calculational tools for directed homotopy theory, we prove appropriate simplicial and cubical approximation theorems. We consequently show that geometric realization induces an equivalence between weak homotopy diagram categories of cubical sets and directed spaces and that its right adjoint satisfies an excision theorem. Along the way, we give criteria for two different homotopy relations on directed maps in the literature to coincide.</description>

      <title>Higher topological complexity of Seifert fibered manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the higher topological complexity of oriented Seifert fibered manifolds that are Eilenberg--MacLane spaces $K(G,1)$ with infinite fundamental group $G$. We first refine the cohomological lower bounds for higher topological complexity by introducing the notion of higher topological complexity weights. As an application, we show that the $r^{\text{th}}$ topological complexity of these manifolds lies in $\{3r-1, 3r, 3r+1\}$, and characterize large families where the value is $3r$ or $3r+1$. Additionally, we establish a sufficient condition for higher topological complexity to be exactly $3r$ when the base surface is orientable and aspherical. Finally, we show that the higher topological complexity of the wedge of finitely many closed, orientable, aspherical $3$-manifolds is exactly $3r+1$.</description>

      <title>A linearization map for genuine equivariant algebraic $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08025v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a version of algebraic $K$-theory for coefficient systems of rings which is valued in genuine $G$-spectra for a finite group $G$. We use this construction to build a genuine $G$-spectrum $K_G(\mathbb{Z}[\underline{\pi_1(X)}])$ associated to a $G$-space $X$, which provides a home for equivariant versions of classical invariants like the Wall finiteness obstruction and Whitehead torsion. We provide a comparison between our $K$-theory spectrum and the equivariant $A$-theory of Malkiewich--Merling via a genuine equivariant linearization map.</description>

      <title>Cubical Approximation for Directed Topology II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16619v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper establishes an equivalence between directed homotopy categories of (diagrams of) cubical sets and (diagrams of) directed topological spaces. This equivalence both lifts and extends an equivalence between classical homotopy categories of cubical sets and topological spaces. Some simple applications include combinatorial descriptions and subsequent calculations of directed homotopy monoids and directed singular 1-cohomology monoids. Another application is a characterization of isomorphisms between small categories up to zig-zags of natural transformations as directed homotopy equivalences between directed classifying spaces. Cubical sets throughout the paper are taken to mean presheaves over the minimal symmetric monoidal variant of the cube category. Along the way, the paper characterizes morphisms in this variant as the interval-preserving lattice homomorphisms between finite Boolean lattices.</description>

      <title>Families of singular algebraic varieties that are rationally elliptic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss families of hypersurfaces with isolated singularities in projective space with the property that the sum of the ranks of the rational homotopy and the homology groups is finite. They represent infinitely many distinct homotopy types with all hypersurfaces having a nef canonical or anti-canonical class. In the appendix we show that such an infinite family of smooth rationally elliptic 3-folds does not exist.</description>
