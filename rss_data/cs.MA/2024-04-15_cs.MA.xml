      <title>An Agent-Based Model of Elephant Crop Raid Dynamics in the Periyar-Agasthyamalai Complex, India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-wildlife conflict poses significant challenges to conservation efforts around the world and requires innovative solutions for effective management. We developed an agent-based model to simulate complex interactions between humans and Asian elephants (particularly solitary bull elephants) in the Periyar-Agasthyamalai complex of the Western Ghats in Kerala, India. Incorporating factors such as crop habituation, thermoregulation needs, and aggression models, this framework enables the evaluation of various experimental scenarios to quantify elephant behaviors and the resulting conflict situations. The ODD protocol, the various cognition models and environmental factors are provided in detail. We simulate different scenarios of food availability to analyze the behavior of elephant agents and assess the influence of environmental factors on space use and emergent conflict patterns. Validation is performed using field data from the region, and elephant movement parameters are tuned using relocation data. Through extensive experimentation, we show that wet months consistently exhibit increased conflict. Furthermore, the experiments reveal that thermoregulation requirements act as a crucial driver of elephant space use, which subsequently influences crop raid patterns. Our findings show how starvation drives wildlife toward crop damage, while crop habituation further exacerbates raid patterns, particularly in regions with limited forest food resources. This agent-based model offers valuable information to develop an intelligent decision support system for wildlife management and decision-making. This is the first step towards development of such a tool, specifically, a primary model that can, over time, be enhanced with layers of complexity and subtlety across various dimensions.</description>

      <title>Correlated Mean Field Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate multi-agent imitation learning (IL) within the framework of mean field games (MFGs), considering the presence of time-varying correlated signals. Existing MFG IL algorithms assume demonstrations are sampled from Mean Field Nash Equilibria (MFNE), limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios. For example, in the traffic network equilibrium influenced by public routing recommendations, recommendations introduce time-varying correlated signals into the game, not captured by MFNE and other existing correlated equilibrium concepts. To address this gap, we propose Adaptive Mean Field Correlated Equilibrium (AMFCE), a general equilibrium incorporating time-varying correlated signals. We establish the existence of AMFCE under mild conditions and prove that MFNE is a subclass of AMFCE. We further propose Correlated Mean Field Imitation Learning (CMFIL), a novel IL framework designed to recover the AMFCE, accompanied by a theoretical guarantee on the quality of the recovered policy. Experimental results, including a real-world traffic flow prediction problem, demonstrate the superiority of CMFIL over state-of-the-art IL baselines, highlighting the potential of CMFIL in understanding large population behavior under correlated signals.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based learning with guarantees for multi-agent applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a kernel-based learning problem for a network of agents locally observing a latent multidimensional, nonlinear phenomenon in a noisy environment. We propose a learning algorithm that requires only mild a priori knowledge about the phenomenon under investigation and delivers a model with corresponding non-asymptotic high probability error bounds. Both non-asymptotic analysis of the method and numerical simulation results are presented and discussed in the paper.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Mitigation of Insufficiencies in Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Driving (AD) systems have the potential to increase safety, comfort and energy efficiency. Recently, major automotive companies have started testing and validating AD systems (ADS) on public roads. Nevertheless, the commercial deployment and wide adoption of ADS have been moderate, partially due to system functional insufficiencies (FI) that undermine passenger safety and lead to hazardous situations on the road. FIs are defined in ISO 21448 Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF). FIs are insufficiencies in sensors, actuators and algorithm implementations, including neural networks and probabilistic calculations. Examples of FIs in ADS include inaccurate ego-vehicle localization on the road, incorrect prediction of a cyclist maneuver, unreliable detection of a pedestrian, etc.
  The main goal of our study is to formulate a generic architectural design pattern, which is compatible with existing methods and ADS, to improve FI mitigation and enable faster commercial deployment of ADS. First, we studied the 2021 autonomous vehicles disengagement reports published by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The data clearly show that disengagements are five times more often caused by FIs rather than by system faults. We then made a comprehensive list of insufficiencies and their characteristics by analyzing over 10 hours of publicly available road test videos. In particular, we identified insufficiency types in four major categories: world model, motion plan, traffic rule, and operational design domain. The insufficiency characterization helps making the SOTIF analyses of triggering conditions more systematic and comprehensive.
  Based on our FI characterization, simulation experiments and literature survey, we define a novel generic architectural design pattern Daruma to dynamically select the channel that is least likely to have a FI at the moment.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Second-Order Hyperproperties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperproperties express the relationship between multiple executions of a system. This is needed in many AI-related fields, such as knowledge representation and planning, to capture system properties related to knowledge, information flow, and privacy. In this paper, we study the monitoring of complex hyperproperties at runtime. Previous work in this area has either focused on the simpler problem of monitoring trace properties (which are sets of traces, while hyperproperties are sets of sets of traces) or on monitoring first-order hyperproperties, which are expressible in temporal logics with first-order quantification over traces, such as HyperLTL. We present the first monitoring algorithm for the much more expressive class of second-order hyperproperties. Second-order hyperproperties include system properties like common knowledge, which cannot be expressed in first-order logics like HyperLTL.
  We introduce Hyper$^2$LTL$_f$, a temporal logic over finite traces that allows for second-order quantification over sets of traces. We study the monitoring problem in two fundamental execution models: (1) the parallel model, where a fixed number of traces is monitored in parallel, and (2) the sequential model, where an unbounded number of traces is observed sequentially, one trace after the other. For the parallel model, we show that the monitoring of the second-order hyperproperties of Hyper$^2$LTL$_f$ can be reduced to monitoring first-order hyperproperties. For the sequential model, we present a monitoring algorithm that handles second-order quantification efficiently, exploiting optimizations based on the monotonicity of subformulas, graph-based storing of executions, and fixpoint hashing. We present experimental results from a range of benchmarks, including examples from common knowledge and planning.</description>

      <title>Higher Replay Ratio Empowers Sample-Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the notorious issues for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is poor sample efficiency. Compared to single agent RL, the sample efficiency for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is more challenging because of its inherent partial observability, non-stationary training, and enormous strategy space. Although much effort has been devoted to developing new methods and enhancing sample efficiency, we look at the widely used episodic training mechanism. In each training step, tens of frames are collected, but only one gradient step is made. We argue that this episodic training could be a source of poor sample efficiency. To better exploit the data already collected, we propose to increase the frequency of the gradient updates per environment interaction (a.k.a. Replay Ratio or Update-To-Data ratio). To show its generality, we evaluate $3$ MARL methods on $6$ SMAC tasks. The empirical results validate that a higher replay ratio significantly improves the sample efficiency for MARL algorithms. The codes to reimplement the results presented in this paper are open-sourced at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/rr_for_MARL-0D83/.</description>

      <title>GOV-REK: Governed Reward Engineering Kernels for Designing Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For multi-agent reinforcement learning systems (MARLS), the problem formulation generally involves investing massive reward engineering effort specific to a given problem. However, this effort often cannot be translated to other problems; worse, it gets wasted when system dynamics change drastically. This problem is further exacerbated in sparse reward scenarios, where a meaningful heuristic can assist in the policy convergence task. We propose GOVerned Reward Engineering Kernels (GOV-REK), which dynamically assign reward distributions to agents in MARLS during its learning stage. We also introduce governance kernels, which exploit the underlying structure in either state or joint action space for assigning meaningful agent reward distributions. During the agent learning stage, it iteratively explores different reward distribution configurations with a Hyperband-like algorithm to learn ideal agent reward models in a problem-agnostic manner. Our experiments demonstrate that our meaningful reward priors robustly jumpstart the learning process for effectively learning different MARL problems.</description>

      <title>Approximating Nash Equilibria in Normal-Form Games via Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the first loss function for approximate Nash equilibria of normal-form games that is amenable to unbiased Monte Carlo estimation. This construction allows us to deploy standard non-convex stochastic optimization techniques for approximating Nash equilibria, resulting in novel algorithms with provable guarantees. We complement our theoretical analysis with experiments demonstrating that stochastic gradient descent can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Connected Fermat Spiral Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Multi-Robot Connected Fermat Spiral (MCFS), a novel algorithmic framework for Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) that adapts Connected Fermat Spiral (CFS) from the computer graphics community to multi-robot coordination for the first time. MCFS uniquely enables the orchestration of multiple robots to generate coverage paths that contour around arbitrarily shaped obstacles, a feature that is notably lacking in traditional methods. Our framework not only enhances area coverage and optimizes task performance, particularly in terms of makespan, for workspaces rich in irregular obstacles but also addresses the challenges of path continuity and curvature critical for non-holonomic robots by generating smooth paths without decomposing the workspace. MCFS solves MCPP by constructing a graph of isolines and transforming MCPP into a combinatorial optimization problem, aiming to minimize the makespan while covering all vertices. Our contributions include developing a unified CFS version for scalable and adaptable MCPP, extending it to MCPP with novel optimization techniques for cost reduction and path continuity and smoothness, and demonstrating through extensive experiments that MCFS outperforms existing MCPP methods in makespan, path curvature, coverage ratio, and overlapping ratio. Our research marks a significant step in MCPP, showcasing the fusion of computer graphics and automated planning principles to advance the capabilities of multi-robot systems in complex environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/reso1/MCFS.</description>
