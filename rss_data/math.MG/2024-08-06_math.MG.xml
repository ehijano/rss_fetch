      <title>Cobordism of domes over curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integral curve is a closed piecewise linear curve comprised of unit intervals. A dome is a polyhedral surface whose faces are equilateral triangles and whose boundary is an integral curve. Glazyrin and Pak showed that not every integral curve can be domed by analyzing the case of unit rhombi, and conjectured that every integral curve is cobordant to a unit rhombus. We show that this is false for oriented domes, but that every integral curve is cobordant to the union of finitely many unit rhombi.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the 3-dimensional Space with a Set of 6 Polycubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the undecidability of translational tiling of $n$-dimensional space $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a set of $k$ tiles. It is known that tiling $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with translated copies with a set of $8$ tiles is undecidable. Greenfeld and Tao gave strong evidence in a series of works that for sufficiently large dimension $n$, the translational tiling problem for $\mathbb{Z}^n$ might be undecidable for just one tile. This paper shows the undecidability of translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^3$ with a set of $6$ tiles.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of Dirichlet boundary value problems for reflected fractional $p$-Laplace-type inhomogeneous equations in compact doubling metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the setting of a locally compact, non-complete metric measure space $(Z,d,\nu)$ equipped with a doubling measure $\nu$, under the condition that the boundary $\partial Z:=\overline{Z}\setminus Z$ (obtained by considering the completion of $Z$) supports a Radon measure $\pi$ which is in a $\sigma$-codimensional relationship to $\nu$ for some $\sigma&gt;0$. We explore existence, uniqueness, comparison property, and stability properties of solutions to inhomogeneous Dirichlet problems associated with certain nonlinear nonlocal operators on $Z$. We also establish interior regularity of solutions when the inhomogeneity data is in an $L^q$-class for sufficiently large $q&gt;1$, and verify a Kellogg-type property when the inhomogeneity data vanishes and the Dirichlet data is continuous.</description>

      <title>Coarse entropy of metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.15172v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse geometry studies metric spaces on the large scale. The recently introduced notion of coarse entropy is a tool to study dynamics from the coarse point of view. We prove that all isometries of a given metric space have the same coarse entropy and that this value is a coarse invariant. We call this value the coarse entropy of the space and investigate its connections with other properties of the space. We prove that it can only be either zero or infinity, and although for many spaces this dichotomy coincides with the subexponential--exponential growth dichotomy, there is no relation between coarse entropy and volume growth more generally. We completely characterise this dichotomy for spaces with bounded geometry and for quasi-geodesic spaces. As an application, we provide an example where coarse entropy yields an obstruction for a coarse embedding, where such an embedding is not precluded by considerations of volume growth.</description>

      <title>A note on faces of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The faces of a convex set owe their relevance to an interplay between convexity and topology that is systematically studied in the work of Rockafellar. Infinite-dimensional convex sets are excluded from this theory as their relative interiors may be empty. Shirokov and the present author answered this issue by proving that every point in a convex set lies in the relative algebraic interior of the face it generates. This theorem is proved here in a simpler way, connecting ideas scattered throughout the literature. This article summarizes and develops methods for faces and their relative algebraic interiors and applies them to spaces of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Concurrent normals problem for convex polytopes and Euclidean distance degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is conjectured since long that for any convex body $P\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ there exists a point in its interior which belongs to at least $2n$ normals from different points on the boundary of $P$. The conjecture is known to be true for $n=2,3,4$.
  We treat the same problem for convex polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It turns out that the PL concurrent normals problem differs a lot from the smooth one. One almost immediately proves that a convex polytope in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has $8$ normals to its boundary emanating from some point in its interior. Moreover, we conjecture that each simple polytope in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has a point in its interior with $10$ normals to the boundary. We confirm the conjecture for all tetrahedra and triangular prisms and give a sufficient condition for a simple polytope to have a point with $10$ normals.
  Other related topics (average number of normals, minimal number of normals from an interior point, other dimensions) are discussed.</description>
