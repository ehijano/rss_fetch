      <title>Machine learning from limited data: Predicting biological dynamics under a time-varying external input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is known as a powerful machine learning approach for learning complex dynamics from limited data. Here, we use RC to predict highly stochastic dynamics of cell shapes. We find that RC is able to predict the steady state climate from very limited data. Furthermore, the RC learns the timescale of transients from only four observations. We find that these capabilities of the RC to act as a dynamic twin allows us to also infer important statistics of cell shape dynamics of unobserved conditions.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy models for patterns of gene expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New experimental methods make it possible to measure the expression levels of many genes, simultaneously, in snapshots from thousands or even millions of individual cells. Current approaches to analyze these experiments involve clustering or low-dimensional projections. Here we use the principle of maximum entropy to obtain a probabilistic description that captures the observed presence or absence of mRNAs from hundreds of genes in cells from the mammalian brain. We construct the Ising model compatible with experimental means and pairwise correlations, and validate it by showing that it gives good predictions for higher-order statistics. We notice that the probability distribution of cell states has many local maxima. By labeling cell states according to the associated maximum, we obtain a cell classification that agrees well with previous results that use traditional clustering techniques. Our results provide quantitative descriptions of gene expression statistics and interpretable criteria for defining cell classes, supporting the hypothesis that cell classes emerge from the collective interaction of gene expression levels.</description>

      <title>Perspectives: Comparison of Deep Learning Segmentation Models on Biophysical and Biomedical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning based approaches are now widely used across biophysics to help automate a variety of tasks including image segmentation, feature selection, and deconvolution. However, the presence of multiple competing deep learning architectures, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages, makes it challenging to select an architecture best suited for a specific application. As such, we present a comprehensive comparison of common models. Here, we focus on the task of segmentation assuming the typically small training dataset sizes available from biophysics experiments and compare the following four commonly used architectures: convolutional neural networks, U-Nets, vision transformers, and vision state space models. In doing so, we establish criteria for determining optimal conditions under which each model excels, thereby offering practical guidelines for researchers and practitioners in the field.</description>

      <title>Active Liquid-Liquid Phase-Separation in a Confining Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in a confining environment is believed to play an important role in cell biology. Recently, it was shown that when active noise at the microscopic level is included in the classical theory of nucleation and growth then this does not cause the breakdown of detailed balance at the \textit{macroscopic} level provided that the droplet radius is the only collective coordinate. Here, we present a simple model for active LLPS in a confining environment, with the droplet location in a confining potential as a second collective coordinate, and find that detailed balance \textit{is} broken at the macroscopic level in an unusual fashion, using the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem as a diagnostic.</description>

      <title>Noise robustness and metabolic load determine the principles of central dogma regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The processes of gene expression are inherently stochastic, even for essential genes required for growth. How does the cell maximize fitness in light of noise? To answer this question, we build a mathematical model to explore the trade-off between metabolic load and growth robustness. The model predicts novel principles of central dogma regulation: Optimal protein expression levels for many genes are in vast overabundance. Essential genes are transcribed above a lower limit of one message per cell cycle. Gene expression is achieved by load balancing between transcription and translation. We present evidence that each of these novel regulatory principles is observed. These results reveal that robustness and metabolic load determine the global regulatory principles that govern gene expression processes, and these principles have broad implications for cellular function.</description>
