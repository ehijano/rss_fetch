      <title>High quality Fe1+yTe synthesized by chemical vapor deposition with conspicuous vortex flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials provide an ideal platform to explore novel superconducting behavior including Ising superconductivity, topological superconductivity and Majorana bound states in different 2D stoichiometric Ta-, Nb-, and Fe-based crystals. However, tuning the element content in 2D compounds for regulating their superconductivity has not been realized. In this work, we report the synthesis of high quality Fe1+yTe with tunable Fe content by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The quality and composition of Fe1+yTe are characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The superconducting behavior of Fe1+yTe crystals with varying Fe contents is observed. The superconducting transition of selected Fe1.13Te sample is sharp ({\Delta}Tc = 1 K), while Fe1.43Te with a high-Fe content shows a relative broad superconducting transition ({\Delta}Tc = 2.6 K) at zero magnetic field. Significantly, the conspicuous vortex flow and a transition from a 3D vortex liquid state to a 2D vortex liquid state is observed in Fe1.43Te sample. Our work highlights the tunability of the superconducting properties of Fe1+yTe and sheds light on the vortex dynamics in Fe-based superconductors, which facilitates us to understand the intrinsic mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Terahertz channel modeling based on surface sensing characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dielectric properties of environmental surfaces, including walls, floors and the ground, etc., play a crucial role in shaping the accuracy of terahertz (THz) channel modeling, thereby directly impacting the effectiveness of communication systems. Traditionally, acquiring these properties has relied on methods such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) or vector network analyzers (VNA), demanding rigorous sample preparation and entailing a significant expenditure of time. However, such measurements are not always feasible, particularly in novel and uncharacterized scenarios. In this work, we propose a new approach for channel modeling that leverages the inherent sensing capabilities of THz channels. By comparing the results obtained through channel sensing with that derived from THz-TDS measurements, we demonstrate the method's ability to yield dependable surface property information. The application of this approach in both a miniaturized cityscape scenario and an indoor environment has shown consistency with experimental measurements, thereby verifying its effectiveness in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>AlN/Si interface engineering to mitigate RF losses in MOCVD grown GaN-on-Si substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrication of low-RF loss GaN-on-Si HEMT stacks is critical to enable competitive front-end-modules for 5G and 6G applications. The main contribution to RF losses is the interface between the III-N layer and the HR Si wafer, more specifically the AlN/Si interface. At this interface, a parasitic surface conduction layer exists in Si, which decreases the substrate effective resistivity sensed by overlying circuitry below the nominal Si resistivity. However, a clear understanding of this interface with control of the parasitic channel is lacking. In this letter, a detailed physical and electrical description of MOCVD-grown AlN/Si structures is presented. The presence of a $\text{SiC}_\text{x}\text{N}_\text{y}$ interfacial layer is revealed and its importance for RF losses is shown. Through C-V and I-V characterisation, an increase in the C concentration of this interfacial layer is linked to the formation of negative charge at the AlN/Si interface, which counteracts the positive charge present in the 0-predose limit. The variation of TMAl predose is shown to allow precise tuning of the C composition and, consequently, the resulting interface charge. Notably, a linear relationship between predose and net interface charge is observed and confirmed by the fabrication of an AlN/Si sample with close to zero net charge. In addition, a higher $D_{it}$ ($\sim 2\times 10^{12}$ cm$^\text{-2}$) for such compensated samples is observed and can contribute to low RF loss. An exceptionally high effective resistivity of above 8 k$\Omega\cdot$cm is achieved, corresponding to an RF loss below 0.3 dB/mm at 10 GHz.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Orbital Hall Effect in Spin-Orbit Torque MRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) Magnetic Random-Access Memory (MRAM) devices offer improved power efficiency, nonvolatility, and performance compared to static RAM, making them ideal, for instance, for cache memory applications. Efficient magnetization switching, long data retention, and high-density integration in SOT MRAM require ferromagnets (FM) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) combined with large torques enhanced by Orbital Hall Effect (OHE). We have engineered PMA [Co/Ni]$_3$ FM on selected OHE layers (Ru, Nb, Cr) and investigated the potential of theoretically predicted larger orbital Hall conductivity (OHC) to quantify the torque and switching current in OHE/[Co/Ni]$_3$ stacks. Our results demonstrate a $\sim$30\% enhancement in damping-like torque efficiency with a positive sign for the Ru OHE layer compared to a pure Pt, accompanied by a $\sim$20\% reduction in switching current for Ru compared to pure Pt across more than 250 devices, leading to more than a 60\% reduction in switching power. These findings validate the application of Ru in devices relevant to industrial contexts, supporting theoretical predictions regarding its superior OHC. This investigation highlights the potential of enhanced orbital torques to improve the performance of orbital-assisted SOT-MRAM, paving the way for next-generation memory technology.</description>

      <title>Non-Destructive, High-Resolution, Chemically Specific, 3D Nanostructure Characterization using Phase-Sensitive EUV Imaging Reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation nano and quantum devices have increasingly complex 3D structure. As the dimensions of these devices shrink to the nanoscale, their performance is often governed by interface quality or precise chemical or dopant composition. Here we present the first phase-sensitive extreme ultraviolet imaging reflectometer. It combines the excellent phase stability of coherent high-harmonic sources, the unique chemical- and phase-sensitivity of extreme ultraviolet reflectometry, and state-of-the-art ptychography imaging algorithms. This tabletop microscope can non-destructively probe surface topography, layer thicknesses, and interface quality, as well as dopant concentrations and profiles. High-fidelity imaging was achieved by implementing variable-angle ptychographic imaging, by using total variation regularization to mitigate noise and artifacts in the reconstructed image, and by using a high-brightness, high-harmonic source with excellent intensity and wavefront stability. We validate our measurements through multiscale, multimodal imaging to show that this technique has unique advantages compared with other techniques based on electron and scanning-probe microscopies.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Oscillations Arising in Thermally Induced Convective Systems through Homodyne Dynamic Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Homodyne Dynamic Light Scattering (HDLS) with a dual-laser beam setup to investigate the drift velocities of colloidal particles immersed in a solvent exposed to thermally-induced convection. Our investigation reveals the appearance of oscillations of a well-defined frequency in the intensity autocorrelation function, which are linked to the particle drift velocities. In addition to this non-equilibrium oscillations, we report an enhanced decay of the intensity correlation function attributable to the loss of correlation as particles depart from the scattering volume due to prevailing convective flow. A pivotal discovery of our research is the identification of a specific temperature gradient threshold, beyond which pronounced velocity fluctuations ensue as a consequence of the establishment of a non-stationary flow within the measurement cell. The experimental results, obtained for different colloidal systems, are corroborated by a theoretical model and thoroughly validated with fluid dynamics simulations and Brownian dynamics simulations, yielding excellent agreement with the experimental data, and providing a robust and complete explanation of the observed phenomena. This study presents an insight in the field of non-equilibrium particle dynamics, offering a reliable method to study complex behaviors in convective systems through advanced HDLS techniques and multidisciplinary simulations.</description>

      <title>Factors Affecting Terahertz Emission from InGaN Quantum Wells under Ultrafast Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InGaN quantum wells (QWs) grown on c-plane sapphire substrate experience strain due to the lattice mismatch. The strain generates a strong piezoelectric field in QWs that contributes to THz emission under ultrafast excitation. Physical parameters such as QW width, period number, and Indium concentration can affect the strength of the piezoelectric field and result in THz emission. Experimental parameters such as pump fluence, laser energy, excitation power, pump polarization angle, and incident angle can be tuned to further optimize the THz emission. This review summarizes the effects of physical and experimental parameters of THz emission on InGaN QWs. Comparison and relationship between photoluminescence properties and THz emission in QWs are given, which further explains the origin of THz emission in InGaN QWs.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunable giant electrical anisotropy in a grating gated AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with in-plane electrical anisotropy have great potential for designing artificial synaptic devices. However, natural materials with strong intrinsic in-plane electrical anisotropy are rare. We introduce a simple strategy to produce extremely large electrical anisotropy via grating gating of a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of AlGaN/GaN. We show that periodically modulated electric potential in the 2DEG induces in-plane electrical anisotropy, which is significantly enhanced in a magnetic field, leading to an ultra large electrical anisotropy. This is induced by a giant positive magnetoresistance and a giant negative magnetoresistance under two orthogonally oriented in-plane current flows, respectively. This giant electrical anisotropy is in-situ tunable by tailoring both the grating gate voltage and the magnetic field. Our semiconductor device with controllable giant electrical anisotropy will stimulate new device applications, such as multi-terminal memtransistors and bionic synapses.</description>

      <title>Spin-NeuroMem: A Low-Power Neuromorphic Associative Memory Design Based on Spintronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biologically-inspired computing models have made significant progress in recent years, but the conventional von Neumann architecture is inefficient for the large-scale matrix operations and massive parallelism required by these models. This paper presents Spin-NeuroMem, a low-power circuit design of Hopfield network for the function of associative memory. Spin-NeuroMem is equipped with energy-efficient spintronic synapses which utilize magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) to store weight matrices of multiple associative memories. The proposed synapse design achieves as low as 17.4% power consumption compared to the state-of-the-art synapse designs. Spin-NeuroMem also encompasses a novel voltage converter with 60% less transistor usage for effective Hopfield network computation. In addition, we propose an associative memory simulator for the first time, which achieves a 5.05Mx speedup with a comparable associative memory effect. By harnessing the potential of spintronic devices, this work sheds light on the development of energy-efficient and scalable neuromorphic computing systems. The source code will be publicly available after the manuscript is reviewed.</description>

      <title>Nanophotonic inspection of deep-subwavelength integrated optoelectronic chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial nanostructures with ultrafine and deep-subwavelength feature sizes have emerged as a paradigm-shifting platform to advanced light field management, becoming a key building block for high-performance integrated optoelectronics and flat optics. However, direct optical inspection of such integrated chips with densely packed complex and small features remains a missing metrology gap that hinders quick feedback between design and fabrications. Here, we demonstrate that photothermal nonlinear scattering microscopy can be utilized for direct imaging and resolving of integrated optoelectronic chips beyond the diffraction limit. We reveal that the inherent coupling among deep-subwavelength nanostructures supporting leaky resonances allows for the pronounced heating effect to access reversible nonlinear modulations of the confocal reflection intensity, leading to optical resolving power down to 80 nm (~lambda/7). The versatility of this approach has been exemplified by direct imaging of silicon grating couplers and metalens with a minimum critical dimension of 100 nm, as well as central processing unit (CPU) chip with 45 nm technology, unfolding the long-sought possibility of in-situ, non-destructive, high-throughput optical inspection of integrated optoelectronic chips and nanophotonic chips.</description>

Abstract: Feasibility of two-line design of Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier aimed at increase of the allowed pump wave energy and hence the gain growth is analyzed and discussed. Serious restrictions follow from both the cyclic energy transfer of the pump, signal and idler waves in the coupled waveguide lines and the phase mismatch of the waves. Besides, impact of the artificial line discreteness on the phase mismatch is considered as well.</description>

      <title>Utilizing the Janus MoSSe surface polarization property in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (JTMDs) have attracted much attention because of their outstanding electronic and optical properties. The additional out-of-plane dipole in JTMDs can form n- and p-like Ohmic contacts, and this may be used in device applications such as pin diodes and photovoltaic cells. In this study, we exploit this property to design n- and p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). First, we use density-functional theory calculations to study the inherent dipole field strength in the trilayer JTMD MoSSe. The intrinsic dipole of MoSSe causes band bending at both the metal/MoSSe and MoSSe/metal interfaces, resulting in electron and hole accumulation to form n- and p-type Ohmic contact regions. We incorporate this property into a 2D finite-element-based Poisson-drift-diffusion solver to perform simulations, on the basis of which we design complementary MOSFETs. Our results demonstrate that JTMDs can be used to make n- and p-MOSFETs in the same layer without the need for any extra doping.</description>
