      <title>Microscopic study of the low-energy enhancement in the gamma-decay strength of \(^{50}\)V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the microscopic origin of the low-energy enhancement (LEE) in \(^{50}\)V with large-scale shell-model calculations to obtain $E1$ and $M1$ transitions within the same theoretical framework. The valence space spans the three major shells $sd$, $pf$ and $sdg$ and is treated with the SDPFSDG-MU interaction using the KSHELL code. With a \(1 \hbar \omega\) truncation, 3600 energy eigenstates and a basis of $7.02\times10^{6}$ positive and $5.94\times10^{8}$ negative parity states, the calculations yield nearly two million individual dipole transitions. The fourteen lowest experimental levels are reproduced within $0.30$~MeV, the calculated total level density excellently reproduces Oslo-method data up to $E \approx 7.5$~MeV, and the calculated dipole gamma strength function follows the experimental shape -- including the LEE -- for the full gamma-energy range covered by the Oslo experiment. The LEE is shown to be entirely magnetic dipole in origin. Both spin and orbital parts of the \(\hat{M}1\) operator are required to reproduce the LEE, with constructive interference between the spin and orbital parts giving an extra enhancement to the LEE. Reduced one-body transition densities identify $0f_{7/2} \rightarrow 0f_{7/2}$ proton transitions as the principal driver of the LEE.</description>

      <title>Multi-peak structure of meson spectral function in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral functions of neutral and charged mesons in a hot dense medium under a external magnetic field using the two-flavor quark-meson model within the functional renormalization group (FRG) framework. Our results show that the spectral functions of {\sigma} and {\pi}0 mesons develop new structures due to decay channels into quarks occupying different Landau levels. By consistently incorporating the momentum relations at vertices for charged particles in a magnetic field, we further show that the {\pi}+ spectral function develops a multi-peak structure at finite temperatures, resulting from the various annihilation and decay channels available to {\pi}+ in the magnetic environment. This multi-peak structure is further enhanced in a finite-density medium, causing the {\pi}+ meson to become a broad resonance at lower temperatures and densities compared to neutral mesons. Such a multi-peak pattern is expected to be universal for charged mesons under magnetic fields and carries significant implications for understanding transport properties in magnetized strongly interacting fluids</description>

      <title>Symmetry Energy of 2+1-flavor dense quark matter from perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry energy expansion was developed to connect isospin symmetric matter probed in nuclear experiments to asymmetric matter found in neutron stars. Using the isospin asymmetry derived from the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula, we derive the symmetry energy expansion for quark matter that has unique properties compared to hadronic matter. To test our methods, we use perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations at next-to-leading-order, where realistic quark masses can be included. We find that pQCD at electroweak equilibrium is not isospin symmetric but rather obtains a small skewness term in the symmetry energy expansion. We predict that if equations of state for nuclear matter must match pQCD results, then a non-monotonic dip in the symmetry energy would appear.</description>

      <title>Emergent Bell-Triplet State in Proton-Proton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental resource in quantum information science, with profound implications for computing, communication, and metrology. Nuclear scattering processes, dominated by rich spin-dependent interactions, offer a natural platform for generating complex spin entanglement. Here, using proton-proton scattering as a quantum laboratory, we report the emergence of a near-pure Bell-triplet state at a laboratory energy of 151 MeV and a center-of-mass scattering angle of 90 degrees, with the spin amplitude a transition operator connecting two different Bell states. In contrast to the low-energy singlet state governed by the Pauli principle and the S-wave dominance, this second maximally entangled state is directly shaped by tensor forces beyond leading-order chiral effective field theory, providing a distinct quantum-information signature for realistic nuclear forces. These findings, invisible to traditional scattering observables, establish proton-proton scattering as a robust source of triplet entanglement and pave the way for next-generation nuclear Bell tests.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and electromagnetic properties of $^{24}\mathrm{Mg}$ in the Geometric $\alpha$-cluster Model with $\mathcal{D}_{4h}$ symmetry at leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relevance of the point-symmetry group $\mathcal{D}_{4h}$ for the prediction of spectrum and electromagnetic properties of the $^{24}\mathrm{Mg}$ nucleus is discussed in the framework of the geometric $\alpha$-cluster model at leading order. The latter represents a macroscopic $\alpha$-cluster framework wherein nuclear excitations are described in terms of rotations and vibrations of $^4\mathrm{He}$ clusters about their equilibrium positions, at the vertices of a square bipyramid. The finite group associated with the latter regulates the composition of the rotational bands as well as the transitions between the energy levels, by means of additional selection rules, of molecular nature. A sample of reduced electric multipole transition probabilities of intraband nature is provided.</description>

      <title>Study of Neutron Star Properties under the Two-Flavor Quark NJL Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Equation of State (EOS) of matter within neutron stars is a central topic in nuclear physics and astrophysics. A precise understanding of the composition and phase behavior of matter under such extreme conditions is crucial for uncovering the fundamental laws of the strong interaction. This study investigates hadron-quark hybrid stars using a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. As an effective theory, this model can describe the generation of dynamical quark masses and chiral symmetry restoration characteristic of dense quark matter.
  We construct the hybrid EOS by joining the BSR6 relativistic mean-field model for hadronic matter with the NJL model for quark matter. A quintic polynomial interpolation ensures a smooth ($C^2$ continuity) and thermodynamically consistent crossover between the phases. Based on this hybrid EOS, we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to calculate macroscopic properties of neutron stars, such as the mass-radius ($M-R$) relationship and the tidal deformability parameter ($\Lambda$).
  By exploring key model parameters, we identify a region satisfying a wide range of multi-messenger constraints. Our resulting EOS supports a maximum mass consistent with PSR J0740+6620, while simultaneously predicting radii and tidal deformabilities for a $1.4M_{\odot}$ star that agree with NICER observations and limits from GW170817. This work thus presents a self-consistent model that resolves the tension between high-mass pulsars and small tidal deformabilities, deepening our understanding of the hadron-quark crossover.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum-information-theoretic observables in electron-proton scattering at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Our analysis focuses on entanglement and magic, two complementary indicators of non-classicality in quantum states. We show that while unpolarized and longitudinally polarized beams yield unentangled separable outcomes, transverse beam polarization enables the generation of entangled and non-stabilizer states. This result holds for both elastic and deep inelastic electron-proton scattering in QED. In the deep inelastic regime, the degree of quantum correlation is governed by the transversity parton distribution functions, providing a novel perspective on spin dynamics within QCD. These results establish the EIC as a promising environment for generating entangled and non-stabilizer states in high-energy physics, and they highlight opportunities for future lepton-hadron colliders to extend such studies into new kinematic domains.</description>

      <title>Thermal nature of confining strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum statistical properties of the confining string connecting a static fermion-antifermion pair in the massive Schwinger model. By analyzing the reduced density matrix of the subsystem located in between the fermion and antifermion, we demonstrate that as the interfermion separation approaches the string-breaking distance, the overlap between the microscopic density matrix and an effective thermal density matrix exhibits a pronounced, narrow peak, approaching unity at the onset of string breaking. This behavior reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality, and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization transition within the flux tube.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Constraints on Pion Valence Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The profile of the pion valence quark distribution function (DF) remains controversial. Working from the concepts of QCD effective charges and generalised parton distributions, we show that since the pion elastic electromagnetic form factor is well approximated by a monopole, then, at large light-front momentum fraction, the pion valence quark DF is a convex function described by a large-$x$ power law that is practically consistent with expectations based on quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Vortex Creep Heating in Neutron Star Cooling: New Insights into Thermal Evolution of Heavy Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide unique laboratories for probing physics of dense nuclear matter under extreme conditions. Their thermal and luminosity evolution reflects key internal properties such as the equation of state (EoS), nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity, envelope composition, and magnetic field, and so on. Recent observations [\textit{e.g.}, V. Abramkin \textit{et al.,} ApJ \textbf{924}, 128 (2022)] have revealed unexpectedly warm old neutron stars, which cannot be explained by standard neutrino-photon cooling models. The failure of the standard cooling models implies the presence of additional internal heating mechanism. Building on the previous study [M. Fujiwara \textit{et al}., JCAP \textbf{03}, 051 (2024)], which proposed vortex creep heating (VCH) from the frictional motion of superfluid vortices as a viable mechanism, we extend the cooling framework to include both VCH and direct Urca (DUrca) processes. These are implemented in our code to explore their combined impact, particularly for massive neutron stars where DUrca operates. By varying rotational parameters ($P$, $\dot{P}$, $P_0$), EoS models (APR, BSk24), pairing gaps, and envelope compositions, we examine how heating-cooling interplay shapes the temperature evolution. Our results show that VCH can substantially mitigate the rapid cooling driven by DUrca, offering new evolutionary pathways for massive neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Diffractive deep inelastic scattering in the dipole picture: the $q\bar{q}g$ contribution in exact kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the $q\bar{q}g$ contribution to the diffractive structure functions in high-energy deep inelastic scattering. The obtained result corresponds to a finite part of the next-to-leading-order contribution to the diffractive cross section. Previous phenomenological applications have included this contribution only in the high-$Q^2$ or high-$M_X^2$ limits in the case of a soft gluon, and we numerically demonstrate that these existing estimates do not provide a good approximation for the full $q\bar{q}g$ contribution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in addition to the soft gluon contribution, there is an equally important soft quark contribution to the diffractive structure functions at high $Q^2$.</description>

      <title>Probing the nonstrange quark star equation of state with compact stars and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent study shows that incorporating a new term into the thermodynamic potential density, as required by the thermodynamic consistency criterion, can effectively resolve the thermodynamic inconsistency problems of the conventional perturbative QCD model. This additional term plays a crucial role in resolving inconsistencies at relatively low densities and becomes negligible at extremely high densities. Within this revised perturbative QCD model, we find that if we require only that the energy per baryon of up-down ($ud$) quark matter exceeds 930 MeV so as not to contradict the standard nuclear physics, the maximum mass of an $ud$ quark star allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model can reach up to 2.17 $M_{\odot}$. From this perspective, the observed 2.14 $M_{\odot}$ pulsar PSR J0740+6620 may be an $ud$ quark star. However, if we further impose the constraint that the tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ $ud$ quark star must be consistent with the GW170817 event, the maximum mass allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model would decrease to no more than 2.08 $M_{\odot}$. Consequently, our results suggest that the compact object with a mass of 2.50-2.67 $M_{\odot}$, as observed in the GW190814 event, cannot be an $ud$ quark star, according to the revised perturbative QCD model.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Inclusion of Higher-order Ca$^+$ Isotope Shifts in the King's Plot Yields an Order Improvement on the $e^- - n$ Coupling Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By critically evaluating higher-order nonlinear effects to the isotope shifts (ISs) in the low-lying transition frequencies of the singly charged calcium ion, stringent constraint on the electron-neutron coupling due to a hypothetical boson describing physics beyond the Standard Model is inferred. It shows an order magnitude difference compared to the previously reported limit demonstrating importance of higher-order effects in the analysis of nonlinearity in the King's plot. The first-order IS parameters and enhancement factor ($D$) were evaluated using two complementary approaches in the relativistic coupled-cluster theory framework: namely finite-field (FF) and analytical response (AR) approaches. Extraction of the second-order IS parameters in the FF approach show numerical instabilities, so they are determined in the AR approach. Comparison of these factors with previous calculation shows substantial differences in the magnitudes. However, $D$ values from both the FF and AR approaches display excellent agreement. We also show explicitly roles of electron correlation effects in the evaluation of $D$ values accurately.</description>

      <title>Low-lying baryon resonances from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculating the properties of baryon resonances from quantum chromodynamics requires evaluating the temporal correlations between hadronic operators using integrations over field configurations weighted by a phase associated with the action. By formulating quantum chromodynamics on a space-time lattice in imaginary time, such integrations can be carried out non-perturbatively using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo method with importance sampling. The energies of stationary states in the finite volume of the lattice can be extracted from the temporal correlations. A quantization condition involving the scattering $K$-matrix and a complicated ``box matrix'' also yields a finite-volume energy spectrum. By appropriately parametrizing the scattering $K$-matrix, the best-fit values of the $K$-matrix parameters are those that produce a finite-volume spectrum which most closely matches that obtained from the Monte Carlo computations. Results for the $\Delta$ resonance are presented, and a study of scattering for energies near the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance is outlined, showing a two pole structure. The prospects for applying this methodology to the Roper resonance are discussed.</description>

      <title>Learning nuclear cross sections across the chart of nuclides with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02332v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the use of deep learning techniques to learn how nuclear cross sections change as we add or remove protons and neutrons. As a proof of principle, we focus on the neutron-induced reactions in the fast energy regime. Our approach follows a two-stage learning framework. First, we apply representation learning to encode cross section data into a latent space using either variational autoencoders (VAEs) or implicit neural representations (INRs). Then, we train graph neural networks (GNNs) on the resulting embeddings to predict missing values across the nuclear chart by leveraging the topological structure of neighboring isotopes. We demonstrate accurate cross section predictions within a 9x9 block of missing nuclei. We also find that the optimal GNN training strategy depends on the type of latent representation used, with VAE embeddings performing best under end-to-end optimization in the original space, while INR embeddings achieve better results when the GNN is trained only in the latent space. Furthermore, using clustering algorithms, we map groups of latent vectors into regions of the nuclear chart and show that VAEs and INRs can discover some of the neutron magic numbers. These findings suggest that deep-learning models based on the representation encoding of cross sections combined with graph neural networks holds significant potential in augmenting nuclear theory models, e.g., by providing reliable estimates of covariances of cross sections, including cross-material covariances.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Center of Mass Fluctuations on the Ground State Properties of Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09470v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground state properties across the entire nuclear chart are described predominantly and rather accurately within the density functional theory (DFT). DFT however breaks many symmetries, among them the most important being the translational, rotational, and gauge symmetries. The translational symmetry breaking is special, since it is broken for all nuclei, unlike the rotational and gauge symmetries. The center-of-mass (CoM) correction most commonly used in the literature, see \textcite{Vautherin:1972} and \textcite{Bender:2003} leads to a gain of 15,...,19 MeV, which varies rather weakly for medium and heavy mass nuclei. A better approximation to the CoM correction was suggested by \textcite{Butler:1984} and its magnitude varies between 10 and 5 MeV from light to heavy nuclei, a correction which is also significantly larger than the RMS energy error in the Bethe-Weizs\"acker mass formula, initially proposed by \textcite{Gamow:1930}, which is at most 3.5 MeV, and which for heavy nuclei corresponds to about 0.2\% of their mass. The CoM energy correction due Butler {\it et al.} is also significantly larger than the RMS energy deviation achieved in any DFT evaluations of the nuclear masses performed without any symmetry restoration or zero-point energy fluctuations, with an energy RMS typically between 2 and 3 MeV. Here we analyze the CoM projection method suggested by \textcite{Peierls:1957} (PY), which leads to a translationally invariant many-body wave function, in a procedure fully equivalent to those suggested for restoring rotational and gauge symmetries. This is the only approach for the evaluation of the CoM energy correction to the mean field binding energies, which is not contaminated by contributions from excited states.</description>

      <title>Learning about neutron star composition from the slope of the mass-radius diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The slope of the neutron star mass-radius curve, $dM/dR$, is studied to understand the information it may carry about the composition of neutron stars, particularly with regard to the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom. This study uses two large sets of relativistic mean-field equations of state with either nucleonic or nucleonic and hyperonic degrees of freedom, and imposes constraints obtained from GW170817 and the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. It is shown that: i) some mass-radius curves are characterized by a negative slope from one solar mass up to the maximum mass; ii) other equations of state (EoS) have a positive slope for a given range of masses below the maximum star mass. Within the set of models considered, the first set includes only a very small number of hyperonic EoS: less than 0.5\% of the total number of hyperonic stars and approximately one third of the nucleonic EoS. We have also analyzed the sign of the slope for neutron star masses of 1.2, 1.4 and 1.8$M_\odot$. Only approximately 1\% of hyperonic equations of state (EoS) predict a negative slope for 1.4$M_\odot$ stars, whereas over 90\% of nucleonic stars have a negative slope at this mass. Finally, almost all stars have a negative slope at 1.8$M_\odot$. A positive slope at 1.4$M_\odot$ may indicate the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom within neutron stars. The nuclear matter property that distinguishes the different scenarios most clearly is the curvature of the symmetry energy. Nucleonic EoSs with a positive slope $dM/dR$ predict the highest values, which can exceed 100 MeV.</description>

      <title>Collective effects in O-O and Ne-Ne collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$=5.36 TeV from a hybrid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many features of heavy-ion collisions are well described by hybrid approaches, where the droplet of strongly coupled quark gluon plasma (QGP) is modeled by hydrodynamics and the subsequent dilute stage is performed with a hadronic transport model. Conventionally, the formation of a QGP is well established in larger collision systems like Lead and Gold. However, hints of collectivity were found even in proton-proton collisions, raising the question where the onset of QGP formation lays. This study aims at making predictions for the light ions run at the LHC in July 2025, in order to explore the applicability of hybrid approaches in smaller collision systems. We employ three different models, the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid, the pure hadronic cascade of SMASH and Angantyr to simulate O-O collisions at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$=5.36 TeV. This setup allows us to compare evolutions with and without a hydrodynamic description on an equal basis, while Angantyr serves as a baseline for no collective effects.</description>

      <title>Born series for s-wave scattering length and some exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes the Born series for the $s$-wave scattering $a_0$ is calculated for a class of central potentials $V(r)$ up to sixth order in a dimensionless coupling strength $g$. Examples of exponentially decaying potentials as well truncated potentials involving a single length-scale $a$ are considered. In certain favorable cases the exact result for the $g$-dependent $s$-wave scattering length $a_0=A_0(g) a$ can be given in terms of special functions. The poles of $A_0(g)$ at increasing positive values of $g$ correspond to the thresholds, where $s$-wave bound-states occur successively. A scattering problem, where $A_0(g)$ is solvable in terms of elementary functions, is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated both by classical physics problems associated with ``Newton's bucket'' and recent developments related to QCD in rotating frames of reference relevant to heavy ion collisions, we discuss the difference between ``active'' and ``passive'' rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis and Analytic Continuation of Scattering Amplitudes from Lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel procedure for analyzing the lattice-QCD spectrum via the finite-volume formalism to obtain constraints on multi-hadron scattering amplitudes at both real and complex energies. This approach combines a Bayesian reconstruction of the scattering amplitude on the real axis with Nevanlinna interpolation for analytic continuation to complex-valued energies. The method is non-parametric, inherently accounting for parametrization dependence within the uncertainty. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach using both toy data and real lattice-QCD data in resonant systems from the HadSpec and BaSc collaborations.</description>

      <title>Vector meson dominance in photon structure functions at small $x$ from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the photon structure functions via the photon-photon and photon-vector meson scattering within the framework of holographic QCD, focusing on the small Bjorken $x$ region and assuming that the Pomeron exchange dominates. The quasi-real photon structure functions are formulated as the convolution of the known U(1) vector field wave function with the Brower-Polchinski-Strassler-Tan (BPST) Pomeron exchange kernel in the five-dimensional AdS space. Assuming the vector meson dominance, the photon structure functions can be calculated in a different way with the BPST kernel and vector meson gravitational form factor, which can be obtained in a bottom-up AdS/QCD model, for the Pomeron-vector meson coupling. It is shown that the obtained $F_2$ structure functions in the both ways agree with the experimental data, which implies the realization of the vector meson dominance within the present model setup. Calculations for the longitudinal structure function and the longitudinal-to-transverse ratio are also presented.</description>

      <title>Thermal quarks and Polyakov loops in two-color dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study confinement and deconfinement in dense two color QCD by analyzing the dynamics of thermal quarks and gluons. The Polyakov loop is used as a probe of the relevant thermal excitations, distinguishing quark and hadron dominated regimes in dense matter. To describe the Polyakov loop, we adopt both lattice informed phenomenological models and the massive Yang Mills framework. After calibrating these models at zero density, we investigate in medium modifications of the Polyakov loops and gluon propagators at finite temperature and density. Diquark gaps control the screening at zero temperature, whereas the screening due to thermal quarks is sensitive to the Polyakov loop. Inclusion of the Polyakov loop helps to reproduce lattice data at low temperature, suggesting that thermal excitations are predominantly hadronic rather than uncorrelated quarks.</description>
