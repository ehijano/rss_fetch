      <title>To Stay or to Bypass: Unraveling Mainline Vehicles' Aggregate Strategic Decision-Making at Highway Weaving Ramps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weaving ramp scenario is a critical bottleneck in highway networks due to conflicting flows and complex interactions among merging, exiting, and through vehicles. In this work, we propose a game-theoretic model to capture and predict the aggregate lane choice behavior of mainline through vehicles as they approach the weaving zone. Faced with potential conflicts from merging and exiting vehicles, mainline vehicles can either bypass the conflict zone by changing to an adjacent lane or stay steadfast in their current lane. Our model effectively captures these strategic choices using a small set of parameters, requiring only limited traffic measurements for calibration. The model's validity is demonstrated through SUMO simulations, achieving high predictive accuracy. The simplicity and flexibility of the proposed framework make it a practical tool for analyzing bottleneck weaving scenarios and informing traffic management strategies.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation with Multi-Team Collaboration Based on Hamilton's Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a multi-team collaboration strategy based on Hamilton's rule from ecology that facilitates resource allocation among multiple teams, where agents are considered as shared resource among all teams that must be allocated appropriately. We construct an algorithmic framework that allows teams to make bids for agents that consider the costs and benefits of transferring agents while also considering relative mission importance for each team. This framework is applied to a multi-team coverage control mission to demonstrate its effectiveness. It is shown that the necessary criteria of a mission evaluation function are met by framing it as a function of the locational coverage cost of each team with respect to agent gain and loss, and these results are illustrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Offline Data from Similar Systems for Online Linear Quadratic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Sim2real gap", in which the system learned in simulations is not the exact representation of the real system, can lead to loss of stability and performance when controllers learned using data from the simulated system are used on the real system. In this work, we address this challenge in the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider an LQR problem for a system with unknown system matrices. Along with the state-action pairs from the system to be controlled, a trajectory of length $S$ of state-action pairs from a different unknown system is available. Our proposed algorithm is constructed upon Thompson sampling and utilizes the mean as well as the uncertainty of the dynamics of the system from which the trajectory of length $S$ is obtained. We establish that the algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({f(S,M_{\delta})\sqrt{T/S}})$ Bayes regret after $T$ time steps, where $M_{\delta}$ characterizes the \emph{dissimilarity} between the two systems and $f(S,M_{\delta})$ is a function of $S$ and $M_{\delta}$. When $M_{\delta}$ is sufficiently small, the proposed algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({\sqrt{T/S}})$ Bayes regret and outperforms a naive strategy which does not utilize the available trajectory.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Internal Model Control for Output Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Output regulation is a fundamental problem in control theory, extensively studied since the 1970s. Traditionally, research has primarily addressed scenarios where the system model is explicitly known, leaving the problem in the absence of a system model less explored. Leveraging the recent advancements in Willems et al.'s fundamental lemma, data-driven control has emerged as a powerful tool for stabilizing unknown systems. This paper tackles the output regulation problem for unknown single and multi-agent systems (MASs) using noisy data. Previous approaches have attempted to solve data-based output regulation equations (OREs), which are inadequate for achieving zero tracking error with noisy data. To circumvent the need for solving data-based OREs, we propose an internal model-based data-driven controller that reformulates the output regulation problem into a stabilization problem. This method is first applied to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, demonstrating exact solution capabilities, i.e., zero tracking error, through solving a straightforward data-based linear matrix inequality (LMI). Furthermore, we extend our approach to solve the $k$th-order output regulation problem for nonlinear systems. Extensions to both linear and nonlinear MASs are discussed. Finally, numerical tests validate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed controllers.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Multi-Valve Disturbance-Rejection Pressure Control for High-Altitude Test Stands via Exterior Penalty Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High altitude simulation test benches for aero engines employ multi chamber, multi valve intake systems that demand effective decoupling and strong disturbance rejection during transient tests. This paper proposes a coordinated active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) scheme based on an external penalty function. The chamber pressure safety limit is reformulated as an inequality constrained optimization problem, and an exponential penalty together with a gradient based algorithm is designed for dynamic constraint relaxation, with global convergence rigorously proven. A coordination term is then integrated into a distributed ADRC framework to yield a multi valve coordinated LADRC controller, whose asymptotic stability is established via Lyapunov theory. Hardware in the loop simulations using MATLAB/Simulink and a PLC demonstrate that, under $\pm$3 kPa pressure constraints, chamber V2's maximum error is 1.782 kPa (77.1\% lower than PID control), and under a 180 kg/s^2 flow rate disturbance, valve oscillations decrease from $\pm$27\% to $\pm$5\% (an 81.5\% reduction). These results confirm the proposed method's superior disturbance rejection and decoupling performance.</description>

      <title>Regulation without calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article revisits the importance of the internal model principle in the literature of regulation and synchronization. Trajectory regulation, the task of regulating continuous-time signals generated by differential equations, is contrasted with event regulation, the task of only regulating discrete events associated with the trajectories. In trajectory regulation, the internal model principle requires an exact internal generator of the continuous-time trajectories, which translates into unrealistic calibration requirements. Event regulation is envisioned as a way to relieve calibration of the continuous behavior while ensuring reliability of the discrete events.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Road Anomaly Detection with Real-time Notification System for Enhanced Road Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to improve transportation safety, especially traffic safety. Road damage anomalies such as potholes and cracks have emerged as a significant and recurring cause for accidents. To tackle this problem and improve road safety, a comprehensive system has been developed to detect potholes, cracks (e.g. alligator, transverse, longitudinal), classify their sizes, and transmit this data to the cloud for appropriate action by authorities. The system also broadcasts warning signals to nearby vehicles warning them if a severe anomaly is detected on the road. Moreover, the system can count road anomalies in real-time. It is emulated through the utilization of Raspberry Pi, a camera module, deep learning model, laptop, and cloud service. Deploying this innovative solution aims to proactively enhance road safety by notifying relevant authorities and drivers about the presence of potholes and cracks to take actions, thereby mitigating potential accidents arising from this prevalent road hazard leading to safer road conditions for the whole community.</description>

      <title>Multi-step manipulation task and motion planning guided by video demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to leverage instructional video to solve complex multi-step task-and-motion planning tasks in robotics. Towards this goal, we propose an extension of the well-established Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner, which simultaneously grows multiple trees around grasp and release states extracted from the guiding video. Our key novelty lies in combining contact states and 3D object poses extracted from the guiding video with a traditional planning algorithm that allows us to solve tasks with sequential dependencies, for example, if an object needs to be placed at a specific location to be grasped later. We also investigate the generalization capabilities of our approach to go beyond the scene depicted in the instructional video. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed video-guided planning approach, we design a new benchmark with three challenging tasks: (I) 3D re-arrangement of multiple objects between a table and a shelf, (ii) multi-step transfer of an object through a tunnel, and (iii) transferring objects using a tray similar to a waiter transfers dishes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our planning algorithm on several robots, including the Franka Emika Panda and the KUKA KMR iiwa. For a seamless transfer of the obtained plans to the real robot, we develop a trajectory refinement approach formulated as an optimal control problem (OCP).</description>

      <title>Model-free Online Learning for the Kalman Filter: Forgetting Factor and Logarithmic Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online prediction for an unknown, non-explosive linear stochastic system. With a known system model, the optimal predictor is the celebrated Kalman filter. In the case of unknown systems, existing approaches based on recursive least squares and its variants may suffer from degraded performance due to the highly imbalanced nature of the regression model. This imbalance can easily lead to overfitting and thus degrade prediction accuracy. We tackle this problem by injecting an inductive bias into the regression model via {exponential forgetting}. While exponential forgetting is a common wisdom in online learning, it is typically used for re-weighting data. In contrast, our approach focuses on balancing the regression model. This achieves a better trade-off between {regression} and {regularization errors}, and simultaneously reduces the {accumulation error}. With new proof techniques, we also provide a sharper logarithmic regret bound of $O(\log^3 N)$, where $N$ is the number of observations.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Multi-Stage Cascading Failure Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cascading failures in power grids can lead to grid collapse, causing severe disruptions to social operations and economic activities. In certain cases, multi-stage cascading failures can occur. However, existing cascading-failure-mitigation strategies are usually single-stage-based, overlooking the complexity of the multi-stage scenario. This paper treats the multi-stage cascading failure problem as a reinforcement learning task and develops a simulation environment. The reinforcement learning agent is then trained via the deterministic policy gradient algorithm to achieve continuous actions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems.</description>

      <title>Aging-Aware Battery Control via Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of controlling a battery while balancing two competing objectives that evolve over different time scales. The short-term objective, such as arbitrage or load smoothing, improves with more battery cycling, while the long-term objective is to maximize battery lifetime, which discourages cycling. Using a semi-empirical aging model, we formulate this problem as a convex optimization problem. We use model predictive control (MPC) with a convex approximation of aging dynamics to optimally manage the trade-off between performance and degradation. Through simulations, we quantify this trade-off in both economic and smoothing applications.</description>

      <title>Reach-Avoid-Stabilize Using Admissible Control Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) analysis has been successfully used in many robotics and control tasks, and is especially effective in computing reach-avoid sets and control laws that enable an agent to reach a goal while satisfying state constraints. However, the original HJR formulation provides no guarantees of safety after a) the prescribed time horizon, or b) goal satisfaction. The reach-avoid-stabilize (RAS) problem has therefore gained a lot of focus: find the set of initial states (the RAS set), such that the trajectory can reach the target, and stabilize to some point of interest (POI) while avoiding obstacles. Solving RAS problems using HJR usually requires defining a new value function, whose zero sub-level set is the RAS set. The existing methods do not consider the problem when there are a series of targets to reach and/or obstacles to avoid. We propose a method that uses the idea of admissible control sets; we guarantee that the system will reach each target while avoiding obstacles as prescribed by the given time series. Moreover, we guarantee that the trajectory ultimately stabilizes to the POI. The proposed method provides an under-approximation of the RAS set, guaranteeing safety. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Solving Reach- and Stabilize-Avoid Problems Using Discounted Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the infinite-horizon reach-avoid (RA) and stabilize-avoid (SA) zero-sum game problems for general nonlinear continuous-time systems, where the goal is to find the set of states that can be controlled to reach or stabilize to a target set, without violating constraints even under the worst-case disturbance. Based on the Hamilton-Jacobi reachability method, we address the RA problem by designing a new Lipschitz continuous RA value function, whose zero sublevel set exactly characterizes the RA set. We establish that the associated Bellman backup operator is contractive and that the RA value function is the unique viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi variational inequality. Finally, we develop a two-step framework for the SA problem by integrating our RA strategies with a recently proposed Robust Control Lyapunov-Value Function, thereby ensuring both target reachability and long-term stability. We numerically verify our RA and SA frameworks on a 3D Dubins car system to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Model Identification Adaptive Control with $\rho$-POMDP Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate system modeling is crucial for safe, effective control, as misidentification can lead to accumulated errors, especially under partial observability. We address this problem by formulating informative input design (IID) and model identification adaptive control (MIAC) as belief space planning problems, modeled as partially observable Markov decision processes with belief-dependent rewards ($\rho$-POMDPs). We treat system parameters as hidden state variables that must be localized while simultaneously controlling the system. We solve this problem with an adapted belief-space iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (BiLQR). We demonstrate it on fully and partially observable tasks for cart-pole and steady aircraft flight domains. Our method outperforms baselines such as regression, filtering, and local optimal control methods, even under instantaneous disturbances to system parameters.</description>

      <title>Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface Using Error-State Kalman Filter and Receding Horizon Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering a drone on a disturbed water surface remains a significant challenge in maritime robotics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface that addresses two major tasks: Firstly, accurate prediction of a moving drone's position under wave-induced disturbances using an Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF), and secondly, effective motion planning for a manipulator via Receding Horizon Control (RHC). Specifically, the ESKF predicts the drone's future position 0.5s ahead, while the manipulator plans a capture trajectory in real time, thus overcoming not only wave-induced base motions but also limited torque constraints. We provide a system design that comprises a manipulator subsystem and a UAV subsystem. On the UAV side, we detail how position control and suspended payload strategies are implemented. On the manipulator side, we show how an RHC scheme outperforms traditional low-level control algorithms. Simulation and real-world experiments - using wave-disturbed motion data - demonstrate that our approach achieves a high success rate - above 95% and outperforms conventional baseline methods by up to 10% in efficiency and 20% in precision. The results underscore the feasibility and robustness of our system, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and offers a practical solution for maritime drone operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how certified computational tools can be used to address various problems in control theory. In particular, we introduce PACE.jl, a Julia package that implements symbolic elimination techniques, including (among others) discriminant varieties and Rational Univariate Representation, while also supporting multi-precision interval computations. We showcase its applications to key control theory problems, including identification, stability analysis, and optimization, for both parameter-dependent and parameter-free systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive control for multi-scale stochastic dynamical systems with stochastic next generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of neuroscience and machine learning has established data-driven stochastic dynamical system modeling as a powerful tool for understanding and controlling high-dimensional, spatio-temporal processes. We introduce the stochastic next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) controller, a framework that integrates the computational efficiency of NG-RC with stochastic analysis to enable robust event-triggered control in multiscale stochastic systems. The asymptotic stability of the controller is rigorously proven via an extended stochastic LaSalle theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for amplitude regulation in nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments on a stochastic Van-der-Pol system subject to both additive and multiplicative noise validate the algorithm, demonstrating its convergence rate across varying temporal scales and noise intensities. To bridge theoretical insights with real-world applications, we deploy the controller to modulate pathological dynamics reconstructed from epileptic EEG data. This work advances a theoretically guaranteed scalable framework for adaptive control of stochastic systems, with broad potential for data-driven decision making in engineering, neuroscience, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Improved Corner Cutting Constraints for Mixed-Integer Motion Planning of a Differential Drive Micro-Mobility Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of motion planning for differential drive micro-mobility platforms. This class of vehicle is designed to perform small-distance transportation of passengers and goods in structured environments. Our approach leverages mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to compute global optimal collision-free trajectories taking into account the kinematics and dynamics of the vehicle. We propose novel constraints for intersample collision avoidance and demonstrate its effectiveness using pick-up and delivery missions and statistical analysis of Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the novel formulation provides the best trajectories in terms of time expenditure and control effort when compared to two state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-Based Flock Navigation with Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance in Unknown Obstructed Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work extends our prior work on the distributed nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for navigating a robot fleet following a certain flocking behavior in unknown obstructed environments with a more realistic local obstacle avoidance strategy. More specifically, we integrate the local obstacle avoidance constraint using point clouds into the NMPC framework. Here, each agent relies on data from its local sensor to perceive and respond to nearby obstacles. A point cloud processing technique is presented for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional point clouds to minimize the computational burden during the optimization. The process consists of directional filtering and down-sampling that significantly reduce the number of data points. The algorithm's performance is validated through realistic 3D simulations in Gazebo, and its practical feasibility is further explored via hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations on embedded platforms.</description>

      <title>Design of a Formation Control System to Assist Human Operators in Flying a Swarm of Robotic Blimps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formation control is essential for swarm robotics, enabling coordinated behavior in complex environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel formation control system for an indoor blimp swarm using a specialized leader-follower approach enhanced with a dynamic leader-switching mechanism. This strategy allows any blimp to take on the leader role, distributing maneuvering demands across the swarm and enhancing overall formation stability. Only the leader blimp is manually controlled by a human operator, while follower blimps use onboard monocular cameras and a laser altimeter for relative position and altitude estimation. A leader-switching scheme is proposed to assist the human operator to maintain stability of the swarm, especially when a sharp turn is performed. Experimental results confirm that the leader-switching mechanism effectively maintains stable formations and adapts to dynamic indoor environments while assisting human operator.</description>

      <title>Correct-by-construction requirement decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.02070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In systems engineering, accurately decomposing requirements is crucial for creating well-defined and manageable system components, particularly in safety-critical domains. Despite the critical need, rigorous, top-down methodologies for effectively breaking down complex requirements into precise, actionable sub-requirements are scarce, especially compared to the wealth of bottom-up verification techniques. Addressing this gap, we introduce a formal decomposition for contract-based design that guarantees the correctness of decomposed requirements if specific conditions are met. Our (semi-)automated methodology augments contract-based design with reachability analysis and constraint programming to systematically identify, verify, and validate sub-requirements representable by continuous bounded sets -- continuous relations between real-valued inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of a correct-by-construction approach through a comprehensive case study on a cruise control system, highlighting how our methodology improves the interpretability, tractability, and verifiability of system requirements.</description>

      <title>Systematic interval observer design for linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06445v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first develop systematic and comprehensive interval observer designs for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, under standard assumptions of observability and interval bounds on the initial condition and uncertainties. Traditionally, such designs rely on specific transformations into Metzler (in continuous time) or non-negative (in discrete time) forms, which may impose limitations. We demonstrate that these can be effectively replaced by an LTI transformation that is straightforward to compute offline. Subsequently, we extend the framework to time-varying systems, overcoming the limitations of conventional approaches that offer no guarantees. Our method utilizes dynamic transformations into higher-dimensional target systems, for which interval observers can always be constructed. These transformations become left-invertible after a finite time, provided the system is observable and the target dynamics are sufficiently high-dimensional and fast, thereby enabling the recovery of interval bounds in the original coordinates. Academic examples are provided to illustrate the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Resolver Model Generalization for Fault Condition Modeling: A Promising Tool for Reliability Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolvers, like all electromagnetic devices, are constantly under investigation, both operationally and structurally. In this regard, proposing a modeling methodology that can save significant time without compromising accuracy is a big honor. In this study, a generalized hybrid model is suggested that, in addition to the above benefits, has sufficient capability to ease reliability study in the field of resolvers, where a large number of faulty conditions must be investigated under different operating conditions, including changes in angular velocity, voltage, and frequency of excitation; all of which are highlighted in the context of fault coverage. This model also serves as a promising tool for generating large datasets, which is advantageous for fault diagnosis. A resolver with a non-uniform air gap is chosen as a case study to challenge the suggested model, particularly in relation to eccentricity faults. We generalize the suggested model to account for the most common faulty conditions of resolvers: in-turn short circuits in signal and excitation windings, as well as static and dynamic eccentricity faults. The close agreement between the results of the suggested model and those from Time-Stepping Finite Element Analysis (TS-FEA), along with significant time savings in both healthy and faulty conditions, highlights the generality and proficiency of the suggested model. Finally, the case study is prototyped, and we verify the accuracy of the suggested model experimentally.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based error bounds of bilinear Koopman surrogate models for nonlinear data-driven control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive novel deterministic bounds on the approximation error of data-based bilinear surrogate models for unknown nonlinear systems. The surrogate models are constructed using kernel-based extended dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the Koopman operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Unlike previous methods that require restrictive assumptions on the invariance of the dictionary, our approach leverages kernel-based dictionaries that allow us to control the projection error via pointwise error bounds, overcoming a significant limitation of existing theoretical guarantees. The derived state- and input-dependent error bounds allow for direct integration into Koopman-based robust controller designs with closed-loop guarantees for the unknown nonlinear system. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Spectrum-based Filter Design for Periodic Control of Systems with Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fully analytical controller design is proposed to tackle a periodic control problem for stable linear systems with an input delay. Applying the internal model control scheme, the controller design reduces to designing a filter, which is done through the placement of poles and zeros. The zeros are placed to compensate for the harmonics and to achieve the desired degree of properness for the filter. For placing the poles, a quasi-optimal procedure is proposed utilizing the standard LQR method. Given the high-dimensionality of the filter due to targeting a large number of harmonics, the design, as well as controller implementation, is performed over a state-space representation. A thorough experimental case study is included to demonstrate both the practical feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control design. The experimental validation is performed on a physical system, the goal of which is to reject periodic vibrations acting on a mass-spring-damper setup where the sensor and the actuator are non-collocated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, existence conditions and a design procedure of reduced-order switched positive observers for continuous- and discrete-time switched positive linear systems with uncertainty are established. In the analyzed class, arbitrary switching is permitted, whereas the uncertainty expressed via matrix inequalities concerns both the initial state and system parameters. Positive lower and positive upper interval switched observers are obtained. The proposed observers are of (n - p) order, where n is the dimension of the state vector and p is the rank of the output matrix, i.e., p-dimensional measurement information. Moreover, as a special case, existence conditions and a design procedure of reduced-order positive observers for uncertain positive linear systems without switching are provided. The theoretical findings are illustrated by two numerical examples for continuous- and discrete-time systems.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Rejection-free Sampling Method Using Past Behaviours for Motion Planning of Autonomous Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a novel learning-based sampling strategy that guarantees rejection-free sampling of the free space under both biased and approximately uniform conditions, leveraging multivariate kernel densities. Historical data from a given autonomous system is leveraged to estimate a non-parametric probabilistic description of the domain, which also describes the free space where feasible solutions of the motion planning problem are likely to be found. The tuning parameters of the kernel density estimator, the bandwidth and the kernel, are used to alter the description of the free space so that no samples can fall outside the originally defined space.The proposed method is demonstrated in two real-life case studies: An autonomous surface vessel (2D) and an autonomous drone (3D). Two planning problems are solved, showing that the proposed approximately uniform sampling scheme is capable of guaranteeing rejection-free samples of the considered workspace. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is statistically validated using Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>On Using Curved Mirrors to Decrease Shadowing in VLC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visible light communication (VLC) complements radio frequency in indoor environments with large wireless data traffic. However, VLC is hindered by dramatic path losses when an opaque object is interposed between the transmitter and the receiver. Prior works propose the use of plane mirrors as optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) to enhance communications through non-line-of-sight links. Plane mirrors rely on their orientation to forward the light to the target user location, which is challenging to implement in practice. This paper studies the potential of curved mirrors as static reflective surfaces to provide a broadening specular reflection that increases the signal coverage in mirror-assisted VLC scenarios. We study the behavior of paraboloid and semi-spherical mirrors and derive the irradiance equations. We provide extensive numerical and analytical results and show that curved mirrors, when developed with proper dimensions, may reduce the shadowing probability to zero, while static plane mirrors of the same size have shadowing probabilities larger than 65%. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio offered by curved mirrors may suffice to provide connectivity to users deployed in the room even when a line-of-sight link blockage occurs.</description>

      <title>Is Linear Feedback on Smoothed Dynamics Sufficient for Stabilizing Contact-Rich Plans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06542v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing planners and controllers for contact-rich manipulation is extremely challenging as contact violates the smoothness conditions that many gradient-based controller synthesis tools assume. Contact smoothing approximates a non-smooth system with a smooth one, allowing one to use these synthesis tools more effectively. However, applying classical control synthesis methods to smoothed contact dynamics remains relatively under-explored. This paper analyzes the efficacy of linear controller synthesis using differential simulators based on contact smoothing. We introduce natural baselines for leveraging contact smoothing to compute (a) open-loop plans robust to uncertain conditions and/or dynamics, and (b) feedback gains to stabilize around open-loop plans. Using robotic bimanual whole-body manipulation as a testbed, we perform extensive empirical experiments on over 300 trajectories and analyze why LQR seems insufficient for stabilizing contact-rich plans. The video summarizing this paper and hardware experiments is found here: https://youtu.be/HLaKi6qbwQg?si=_zCAmBBD6rGSitm9.</description>

Abstract: In this work, an experimental characterization of the configuration space of a soft, pneumatically actuated morphing quadrotor is presented, with a focus on precise thrust characterization of its flexible arms, considering the effect of downwash. Unlike traditional quadrotors, the soft drone has pneumatically actuated arms, introducing complex, nonlinear interactions between motor thrust and arm deformation, which make precise control challenging. The silicone arms are actuated using differential pressure to achieve flexibility and thus have a variable workspace compared to their fixed counter-parts. The deflection of the soft arms during compression and expansion is controlled throughout the flight. However, in real time, the downwash from the motor attached at the tip of the soft arm generates a significant and random disturbance on the arm. This disturbance affects both the desired deflection of the arm and the overall stability of the system. To address this factor, an experimental characterization of the effect of downwash on the deflection angle of the arm is conducted.</description>

      <title>Triple-identity Authentication: The Future of Secure Access</title>

Abstract: In a typical authentication process, the local system verifies the user's identity using a stored hash value generated by a cross-system hash algorithm. This article shifts the research focus from traditional password encryption to the establishment of gatekeeping mechanisms for effective interactions between a system and the outside world. Here, we propose a triple-identity authentication system to achieve this goal. Specifically, this local system opens the inner structure of its hash algorithm to all user credentials, including the login name, login password, and authentication password. When a login credential is entered, the local system hashes it and then creates a unique identifier using intermediate hash elements randomly selected from the open algorithm. Importantly, this locally generated unique identifier (rather than the stored hash produced by the open algorithm) is utilized to verify the user's combined identity, which is generated by combining the entered credential with the International Mobile Equipment Identity and the International Mobile Subscriber Identity. The verification process is implemented at each interaction point: the login name field, the login password field, and the server's authentication point. Thus, within the context of this triple-identity authentication system, we establish a robust gatekeeping mechanism for system interactions, ultimately providing a level of security that is equivalent to multi-factor authentication.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Distributed Online Nonconvex Optimization with Time-Varying Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers distributed online nonconvex optimization with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents, where the nonconvex local loss and convex local constraint functions can vary arbitrarily across iterations, and the information of them is privately revealed to each agent at each iteration. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, we propose two distributed bandit online primal--dual algorithm with compressed communication to efficiently utilize communication resources in the one-point and two-point bandit feedback settings, respectively. In nonconvex optimization, finding a globally optimal decision is often NP-hard. As a result, the standard regret metric used in online convex optimization becomes inapplicable. To measure the performance of the proposed algorithms, we use a network regret metric grounded in the first-order optimality condition associated with the variational inequality. We show that the compressed algorithms establish sublinear network regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>
