      <title>Optimal Ratcheting of Dividends with Irreversible Reinsurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an insurance company that faces two key constraints: a ratcheting dividend constraint and an irreversible reinsurance constraint. The company allocates part of its reserve to pay dividends to its shareholders while strategically purchasing reinsurance for its claims. The ratcheting dividend constraint ensures that dividend cuts are prohibited at any time. The irreversible reinsurance constraint ensures that reinsurance contracts cannot be prematurely terminated or sold to external entities. The dividend rate level and the reinsurance level are modelled as nondecreasing processes, thereby satisfying the constraints. The incurred claims are modelled via a Brownian risk model. The main objective is to maximize the cumulative expected discounted dividend payouts until the time of ruin. The reinsurance and dividend levels belong to either a finite set or a closed interval. The optimal value functions for the finite set case and the closed interval case are proved to be the unique viscosity solutions of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and the convergence between these optimal value functions is established. For the finite set case, a threshold strategy is proved to be optimal, while for the closed interval case, an $\epsilon$-optimal strategy is constructed. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the optimality conditions and optimal strategies.</description>

      <title>ECC Analyzer: Extract Trading Signal from Earnings Conference Calls using Large Language Model for Stock Performance Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of financial analytics, leveraging unstructured data, such as earnings conference calls (ECCs), to forecast stock volatility is a critical challenge that has attracted both academics and investors. While previous studies have used multimodal deep learning-based models to obtain a general view of ECCs for volatility predicting, they often fail to capture detailed, complex information. Our research introduces a novel framework: \textbf{ECC Analyzer}, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to extract richer, more predictive content from ECCs to aid the model's prediction performance. We use the pre-trained large models to extract textual and audio features from ECCs and implement a hierarchical information extraction strategy to extract more fine-grained information. This strategy first extracts paragraph-level general information by summarizing the text and then extracts fine-grained focus sentences using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These features are then fused through multimodal feature fusion to perform volatility prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional analytical benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of advanced LLM techniques in financial analysis.</description>
