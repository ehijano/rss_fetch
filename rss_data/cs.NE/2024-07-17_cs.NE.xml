      <title>BMR and BWR: Two simple metaphor-free optimization algorithms for solving real-life non-convex constrained and unconstrained problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two simple yet powerful optimization algorithms named Best-Mean-Random (BMR) and Best-Worst-Randam (BWR) algorithms to handle both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. These algorithms are free of metaphors and algorithm-specific parameters. The BMR algorithm is based on the best, mean, and random solutions of the population generated for solving a given problem; and the BWR algorithm is based on the best, worst, and random solutions. The performances of the proposed two algorithms are investigated by implementing them on 26 real-life non-convex constrained optimization problems given in the Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2020 competition and comparisons are made with those of the other prominent optimization algorithms. Furthermore, computational experiments are conducted on 30 unconstrained standard benchmark optimization problems including 5 recently developed benchmark problems having distinct characteristics. The results proved the better competitiveness and superiority of the proposed simple algorithms. The optimization research community may gain an advantage by adapting these algorithms to solve various constrained and unconstrained real-life optimization problems across various scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>Navigating the swarm: Deep neural networks command emergent behaviours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting individuals in complex systems often give rise to coherent motion exhibiting coordinated global structures. Such phenomena are ubiquitously observed in nature, from cell migration, bacterial swarms, animal and insect groups, and even human societies. Primary mechanisms responsible for the emergence of collective behavior have been extensively identified, including local alignments based on average or relative velocity, non-local pairwise repulsive-attractive interactions such as distance-based potentials, interplay between local and non-local interactions, and cognitive-based inhomogeneous interactions. However, discovering how to adapt these mechanisms to modulate emergent behaviours remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to generate coordinated structures in collective behavior at desired moments with intended global patterns by fine-tuning an inter-agent interaction rule. Our strategy employs deep neural networks, obeying the laws of dynamics, to find interaction rules that command desired collective structures. The decomposition of interaction rules into distancing and aligning forces, expressed by polynomial series, facilitates the training of neural networks to propose desired interaction models. Presented examples include altering the mean radius and size of clusters in vortical swarms, timing of transitions from random to ordered states, and continuously shifting between typical modes of collective motions. This strategy can even be leveraged to superimpose collective modes, resulting in hitherto unexplored but highly practical hybrid collective patterns, such as protective security formations. Our findings reveal innovative strategies for creating and controlling collective motion, paving the way for new applications in robotic swarm operations, active matter organisation, and for the uncovering of obscure interaction rules in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-tunnelling deep neural networks for sociophysical neuromorphic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum tunnelling effect -- the transmission of particles through a high potential barrier -- was one of the most impressive achievements of quantum mechanics made in the 1920s. Responding to the contemporary challenges, I introduce a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture that processes information using the effect of quantum tunnelling. I demonstrate the ability of the quantum tunnelling DNN (QT-DNN) to recognise optical illusions like a human. Hardware implementation of QT-DNN is expected to result in an inexpensive and energy-efficient neuromorphic chip suitable for applications in autonomous vehicles. The optical illusions recognition tests developed in this paper should lay foundations for cognitive benchmarking tasks for AI systems of the future, benefiting the fields of sociophysics and behavioural science.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks for Industrial Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel neuro-fuzzy model, termed fuzzy recurrent stochastic configuration networks (F-RSCNs), for industrial data analytics. Unlike the original recurrent stochastic configuration network (RSCN), the proposed F-RSCN is constructed by multiple sub-reservoirs, and each sub-reservoir is associated with a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy rule. Through this hybrid framework, first, the interpretability of the model is enhanced by incorporating fuzzy reasoning to embed the prior knowledge into the network. Then, the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy model are determined by the recurrent stochastic configuration (RSC) algorithm. This scheme not only ensures the universal approximation property and fast learning speed of the built model but also overcomes uncertain problems, such as unknown dynamic orders, arbitrary structure determination, and the sensitivity of learning parameters in modelling nonlinear dynamics. Finally, an online update of the output weights is performed using the projection algorithm, and the convergence analysis of the learning parameters is given. By integrating TSK fuzzy inference systems into RSCNs, F-RSCNs have strong fuzzy inference capability and can achieve sound performance for both learning and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed F-RSCNs outperform other classical neuro-fuzzy and non-fuzzy models, demonstrating great potential for modelling complex industrial systems.</description>

      <title>Learning by the F-adjoint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent paper by Boughammoura (2023) describes the back-propagation algorithm in terms of an alternative formulation called the F-adjoint method. In particular, by the F-adjoint algorithm the computation of the loss gradient, with respect to each weight within the network, is straightforward and can simply be done. In this work, we develop and investigate this theoretical framework to improve some supervised learning algorithm for feed-forward neural network. Our main result is that by introducing some neural dynamical model combined by the gradient descent algorithm, we derived an equilibrium F-adjoint process which yields to some local learning rule for deep feed-forward networks setting. Experimental results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, demonstrate that the proposed approach provide a significant improvements on the standard back-propagation training procedure.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Dimension Wrapping (DDW) Algorithm: A Novel Approach for Efficient Cross-Dimensional Search in Dynamic Multidimensional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the real world, as the complexity of optimization problems continues to increase, there is an urgent need to research more efficient optimization methods. Current optimization algorithms excel in solving problems with a fixed number of dimensions. However, their efficiency in searching dynamic multi-dimensional spaces is unsatisfactory. In response to the challenge of cross-dimensional search in multi-dimensional spaces with varying numbers of dimensions, this study proposes a new optimization algorithm-Dynamic Dimension Wrapping (DDW) algorithm. Firstly, by utilizing the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm and Euclidean distance, a mapping relationship between different time series across dimensions is established, thus creating a fitness function suitable for dimensionally dynamic multi-dimensional space. Additionally, DDW introduces a novel, more efficient cross-dimensional search mechanism for dynamic multidimensional spaces. Finally, through comparative tests with 31 optimization algorithms in dynamic multidimensional space search, the results demonstrate that DDW exhibits outstanding search efficiency and provides search results closest to the actual optimal solution.</description>

      <title>NITRO-D: Native Integer-only Training of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization has become increasingly pivotal in addressing the steadily increasing computational and memory requirements of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By reducing the number of bits used to represent weights and activations (typically from 32-bit floating-point to 16-bit or 8-bit integers), quantization reduces the memory footprint, energy consumption, and execution time of DNN models. However, traditional quantization methods typically focus on the inference of DNNs, while the training process still relies on floating-point operations. To date, only one work in the literature has addressed integer-only training for Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures. This work introduces NITRO-D, a new framework for training arbitrarily deep integer-only Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that operate entirely&lt; in the integer-only domain for both training and inference. NITRO-D is the first framework in the literature enabling the training of integer-only CNNs without the need to introduce a quantization scheme. Specifically, NITRO-D introduces a novel architecture integrating multiple integer local-loss blocks, which include the proposed NITRO Scaling Layer and the NITRO-ReLU activation function. Additionally, it introduces a novel integer-only learning algorithm derived from Local Error Signals (LES), utilizing IntegerSGD, an optimizer specifically designed to operate in an integer-only context. NITRO-D is implemented in an open-source Python library. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness across several state-of-the-art image recognition datasets. Results show significant performance improvements from 2.47% to 5.96% for integer-only MLP architectures over the state-of-the-art solution, and the capability of training integer-only CNN architectures with minimal accuracy degradation from -0.15% to -4.22% compared to floating-point LES.</description>

      <title>Distributed Representations Enable Robust Multi-Timescale Symbolic Computation in Neuromorphic Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programming recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) to robustly perform multi-timescale computation remains a difficult challenge. To address this, we describe a single-shot weight learning scheme to embed robust multi-timescale dynamics into attractor-based RSNNs, by exploiting the properties of high-dimensional distributed representations. We embed finite state machines into the RSNN dynamics by superimposing a symmetric autoassociative weight matrix and asymmetric transition terms, which are each formed by the vector binding of an input and heteroassociative outer-products between states. Our approach is validated through simulations with highly non-ideal weights; an experimental closed-loop memristive hardware setup; and on Loihi 2, where it scales seamlessly to large state machines. This work introduces a scalable approach to embed robust symbolic computation through recurrent dynamics into neuromorphic hardware, without requiring parameter fine-tuning or significant platform-specific optimisation. Moreover, it demonstrates that distributed symbolic representations serve as a highly capable representation-invariant language for cognitive algorithms in neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation through space, time, and the brain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements.
  We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.</description>
