      <title>Aerodynamic Significance of Mass Distribution on Samara Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Samaras, a distinct category of fruit, are composed of heavier seeds and lighter wings. Diversity in morphologies and structures subtly contributes to the flight patterns of various seeds, thereby serving as a key factor in the reproductive strategies of plants. To explore the mechanisms underlying various samara flight behaviors, we proposed an effective scheme by manipulating the mass distribution on a plate to mimic various three-dimensional descent behaviors of samaras. Through this framework, we experimentally identified and characterized four distinct flight modes. The three-dimensional vortical structures were then numerically analyzed to gain insights into the samara-inspired flight behaviors. Our study demonstrates how strategic mass distribution in samaras leads to diverse flight behaviors that leverage vortices to enhance seed dispersal, offering a fresh perspective for the design of biomimetic fliers.</description>

      <title>Modeling time-delayed acoustic interactions of cavitation bubbles and bubble clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a low-dimensional modeling approach to simulate the dynamics, acoustic emissions and interactions of cavitation bubbles, based on a quasi-acoustic assumption. This quasi-acoustic assumption accounts for the compressibility of the medium surrounding the bubble and its finite speed of sound, whereby the potential of the acoustic wave emitted by the bubble propagates along outgoing characteristics. With these ingredients, a consistent set of equations describing the radial bubble dynamics as well as the resulting acoustic emissions and bubble-bubble interactions is obtained, which is accurate to the first order of the Mach number. This model is tested by considering several representative test cases, including the resonance behavior of multiple interacting bubbles and the response of dense mono- and polydisperse bubble clusters to a change in ambient pressure. The results are shown to be in excellent agreement with results reported in the literature. The differences associated with the finite propagation speed of the acoustic waves are observed to be most pronounced for the pressure-driven bubble dynamics in dense bubble clusters and the onset of cavitation in response to a change in ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Irrotationality of Water Waves and Topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most theoretical and numerical results regarding water waves rely on the irrotationality of the flow in order to simplify significantly the mathematical formulation. This assumption is rarely discussed in details. In this work we investigate the well-foundedness of this important hypothesis using numerical simulations of the free-surface Navier-Stokes equation, using a scheme introduced in Riquier and Dormy (2024). We show that, in the presence of an irregular bottom, a gravity wave of non-negligible height can effectively destabilise the bottom boundary layer, stripping off vortices into the main flow. As a vortex approaches the surface the solution of the Navier-Stokes flow in the limit of vanishing viscosity is shown to differ from the inviscid Euler solution.</description>

      <title>A machine learning enhanced discontinuous Galerkin method for simulating transonic airfoil flow-fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and rapid prediction of flow-fields is crucial for aerodynamic design. This work proposes a discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) whose performance enhances with increasing data, for rapid simulation of transonic flow around airfoils under various flow conditions. A lightweight and continuously updated data-driven model is built offline to predict the roughly correct flow-field, and the DGM is then utilized to refine the detailed flow structures and provide the corrected data. During the construction of the data-driven model, a zonal proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is designed to reduce the dimensionality of flow-field while preserving more near-wall flow features, and a weighted-distance radial basis function (RBF) is constructed to enhance the generalization capability of flow-field prediction. Numerical results demonstrate that the lightweight data-driven model can predict the flow-field around a wide range of airfoils at Mach numbers ranging from 0.7 to 0.95 and angles of attack from -5 to 5 degrees by learning from sparse data, and maintains high accuracy of the location and essential features of flow structures (such as shock waves). In addition, the machine learning (ML) enhanced DGM is able to significantly improve the computational efficiency and simulation robustness as compared to normal DGMs in simulating transonic inviscid/viscous airfoil flow-fields on arbitrary grids, and further enables rapid aerodynamic evaluation of numerous sample points during the surrogate-based aerodynamic optimization.</description>

      <title>CaLES: A GPU-accelerated solver for large-eddy simulation of wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CaLES, a GPU-accelerated finite-difference solver designed for large-eddy simulations (LES) of incom- pressible wall-bounded flows in massively parallel environments. Built upon the existing direct numerical simulation (DNS) solver CaNS, CaLES relies on low-storage, third-order Runge-Kutta schemes for temporal discretization, with the option to treat viscous terms via an implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme in one or three directions. A fast direct solver, based on eigenfunction expansions, is used to solve the discretized Poisson/Helmholtz equations. For turbu- lence modeling, the classical Smagorinsky model with van Driest near-wall damping and the dynamic Smagorinsky model are implemented, along with a logarithmic law wall model. GPU acceleration is achieved through OpenACC directives, following CaNS-2.3.0. Performance assessments were conducted on the Leonardo cluster at CINECA, Italy. Each node is equipped with one Intel Xeon Platinum 8358 CPU (2.60 GHz, 32 cores) and four NVIDIA A100 GPUs (64 GB HBM2e), interconnected via NVLink 3.0 (200 GB/s). The inter-node communication bandwidth is 25 GB/s, supported by a DragonFly+ network architecture with NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand HDR. Results indicate that the computational speed on a single GPU is equivalent to approximately 15 CPU nodes, depending on the treat- ment of viscous terms and the subgrid-scale model, and that the solver efficiently scales across multiple GPUs. The predictive capability of CaLES has been tested using multiple flow cases, including decaying isotropic turbulence, tur- bulent channel flow, and turbulent duct flow. The high computational efficiency of the solver enables grid convergence studies on extremely fine grids, pinpointing non-monotonic grid convergence for wall-modeled LES.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Feature Extraction: a novel approach for enhancing data-driven surrogate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate model can replace the parametric full-order model (FOM) by an approximation model, which can significantly improve the efficiency of optimization design and reduce the complexity of engineering systems. However, due to limitations in efficiency and accuracy, the applications of high-dimensional surrogate models are still challenging. In the present study, we propose a method for extracting hidden features to simplify high-dimensional problems, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of surrogate models. We establish a goal-oriented feature extraction (GFE) neural network through indirect supervised learning. We constrained the distance between hidden features based on the differences in the target output. This means that in the hidden feature space, cases that are closer in distance output approximately the same, and vice versa. The proposed hidden feature learning method can significantly reduce the dimensionality and nonlinearity of the surrogate model, thereby improving modeling accuracy and generalization capability. To demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed ideas, We conducted numerical experiments on three popular surrogate models. The modeling results of typical high-dimensional mathematical cases and aerodynamic performance cases of ONERA M6 wings show that goal-oriented feature extraction significantly improves the modeling accuracy. Goal-oriented feature extraction can effectively reduce the error distribution of predicting cases and reduce the convergence and robustness differences caused by various data-driven surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks and Differential Equations: A hybrid approach for data assimilation of fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel hybrid approach that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations to enhance the accuracy of mean flow reconstruction across a range of fluid dynamics applications. Traditional purely data-driven Neural Networks (NNs) models, often struggle maintaining physical consistency. Moreover, they typically require large datasets to achieve reliable performances. The GNN framework, which naturally handles unstructured data such as complex geometries in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is here integrated with RANS equations as a physical baseline model. The methodology leverages the adjoint method, enabling the use of RANS-derived gradients as optimization terms in the GNN training process. This ensures that the learned model adheres to the governing physics, maintaining physical consistency while improving the prediction accuracy. We test our approach on multiple CFD scenarios, including cases involving generalization with respect to the Reynolds number, sparse measurements, denoising and inpainting of missing portions of the mean flow. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of the reconstructed mean flow compared to purely data-driven models, using limited amounts of data in the training dataset. The key strengths of this study are the integration of physical laws into the training process of the GNN, and the ability to achieve high-accuracy predictions with a limited amount of data, making this approach particularly valuable for applications in fluid dynamics where data is often scarce.</description>

      <title>Equation-informed data-driven identification of flow budgets and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an indispensable method of fluid modelling in engineering applications, reducing the need for physical prototypes and testing for tasks such as design optimisation and performance analysis. Depending on the complexity of the system under consideration, models ranging from low to high fidelity can be used for prediction, allowing significant speed-up. However, the choice of model requires information about the actual dynamics of the flow regime. Correctly identifying the regions/clusters of flow that share the same dynamics has been a challenging research topic to date. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid approach to flow clustering. It consists of characterising each sample point of the system with equation-based features, i.e. features are budgets that represent the contribution of each term from the original governing equation to the local dynamics at each sample point. This was achieved by applying the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical systems (SINDy) method pointwise to time evolution data. The method proceeds with equation-based clustering using the Girvan-Newman algorithm. This allows the detection of communities that share the same physical dynamics. The algorithm is implemented in both Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks. In the Lagrangian, i.e. dynamic approach, the clustering is performed on the trajectory of each point, allowing the change of clusters to be represented also in time. The performance of the algorithm is first tested on a flow around a cylinder. The construction of the dynamic clusters in this test case clearly shows the evolution of the wake from the steady state solution through the transient to the oscillatory solution. Dynamic clustering was then successfully tested on turbulent flow data. Two distinct and well-defined clusters were identified and their temporal evolution was reconstructed.</description>

      <title>Melting of floating ice cylinders in fresh and saline environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigated the melting of floating ice cylinders. Experiments were carried out in an aquarium, with ice cylinders with radii between 5 cm and 12 cm, floating horizontally with their axis perpendicular to gravity. The water in the aquarium was at room temperature, with salinities ranging from 0 g/L to 35 g/L. These conditions correspond to Rayleigh numbers in the range 10^5 &lt;= Ra &lt;= 10^9. The relative density and thus the floating behaviour could be varied by employing ice made of H2O-D2O mixtures. In addition, we explored a two-layer stable stratification. We studied the morphological evolution of the cross section of the cylinders, and explained it through the interaction with the convective flow. The cylinders only capsize in fresh water but not when the ambient is saline. This behaviour can be explained using geometrical arguments. We modelled the oscillatory motion of the cylinders after a capsize as a damped non-linear oscillator. The downward plume of the ice cylinders follows the expected scalings for a line-source plume. The plume's Reynolds number scales with Rayleigh number in two regimes, namely Re scales as Ra^1/2 for Ra &lt; O(10^7) and Re scales as Ra^1/3 for Ra &gt; O(10^7), and the heat transfer (nondimensional as Nusselt number) scales as Nu scales as Ra^1/3. These scaling relations hold irrespectively of the initial size or the water salinity. Our results can qualitatively be connected to natural phenomena occurring in fjords and around isolated icebergs.</description>

      <title>Fiber bundle topology optimization for mass and heat transfer in laminar flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents fiber bundle topology optimization for mass and heat transfer in surface and volume flows in the laminar region, to optimize the matching between the pattern of a surface structure and the implicit 2-manifold on which the surface pattern is defined. The fiber bundle concept is used to describe the pattern of the surface structure together with the implicit 2-manifold as an ensemble defined on the preset base manifold. Topology optimization of the pattern of the surface structure for mass and heat transfer in fluid flow is then implemented on the variable curved surface expressed as the implicit 2-manifold. For surface flow, fiber bundle topology optimization for mass and heat transfer is implemented based on the porous medium model by using the material distribution method, where the material density is used to interpolate the impermeability of the porous medium filled on the implicit 2-manifold. For volume flow, fiber bundle topology optimization for mass and heat transfer is implemented based on the mixed boundary condition interpolated by the material density used to represent the pattern of thin walls defined on the implicit 2-manifold, which is embedded in the three dimensional domain occupied by the volume flow. For both cases, two sets of design variables are defined for the pattern of the surface structure and the implicit 2-manifold, which is defined on the preset base manifold by using a differentiable homeomorphism. The fiber bundle topology optimization problems are analyzed by using the continuous adjoint method to derive the gradient information of the design objectives and constraints. They are then solved by using the gradient based iterative procedures.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.</description>

      <title>Unstable gas flow in a flat channel under the influence of a transverse force field: self-oscillations of the jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subsonic flow of an ideal gas through a flat channel in the presence of a mass force field is considered. The forces acting on the gas are reduced to the attraction to the channel axis in a certain region of the channel. It has been shown that the occurrence of a zone of increased pressure along the axis of a channel leads to the formation of a pressure gradient, which acts as an effective force which opposes the flow. As a result, the flow becomes unstable. For a weak field, this instability is symmetric, while for strong fields it is asymmetric. The characteristics of this instability have been studied numerically in the present work. Possible astrophysical implications of this phenomenon are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A trade-off between hydrodynamic performance and morphological bias limits the evolution of symmetric lattice animal wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bristled and membranous insect wings have co-evolved despite apparently serving the same functionality. We emulate flight physics using an automated free-fall experiment to better understand how and why several distinct wing forms may have developed. Biomimetic two-dimensional lattice animals were laser cut from a continuous sheet of paper, and their descent in a settling tank was tracked using a camera. Data from 31 generic symmetric polyominos (1,692 experiments) reveal that morphology impacts the drag coefficient $C_D$ and hence flight efficiency. Some polyominos rapidly sediment while others remain suspended for longer. Positioning the search for an optimal shape within an evolutionary context, we relinquished control of the automated setup to a genetic algorithm. Hereditary information passes between generations in proportion to fitness and is augmented by rare mutations. High-performing morphologies are observed, but {experimental repeats do} not re-evolve the same shapes. Adaptation rates also differ if the selective pressure is reversed from suspension to sedimentation. Our data (50,086 experiments) reveal several physical sources of indeterminism in the simulated natural selection process, including fluid flow variability and morphological entropy. This provides experimental support for the idea that the lack of convergence in insect wing shape may partly reflect the competition between fitness and entropy, making it nearly impossible to achieve unique optimal forms.</description>

      <title>The interplay of inertia and elasticity in polymeric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addition of polymers modifies a turbulent flow in a manner that depends non-trivially on the interplay of fluid inertia, quantified by the Reynolds number $Re$, and the elasticity of the dissolved polymers, given by the Deborah number $De$. We use direct numerical simulations to study polymeric flows at different $Re$ and $De$ numbers, and uncover various features of their dynamics. Polymeric flows exhibit a multiscaling energy spectrum that is a function of $Re$ and $De$, owing to different dominant contributions to the total energy flux across scales. This behaviour is also manifested in the real space scaling of structure functions. We also shed light on how the addition of polymers results in slowing down the fluid non-linear cascade resulting in a depleted flux, as velocity fluctuations with less energy persist for longer times in polymeric flows. These velocity fluctuations exhibit intermittent, large deviations similar to that in a Newtonian flow at large $Re$, but differ more and more as $Re$ becomes smaller. This observation is further supported by the statistics of fluid energy dissipation in polymeric flows, whose distributions collapse on to the Newtonian at large $Re$, but increasingly differ from it as $Re$ decreases. We also show that polymer dissipation is significantly less intermittent compared to fluid dissipation, and even less so when elasticity becomes large. Polymers, on an average, dissipate more energy when they are stretched more, which happens in extensional regions of the flow. However, owing to vortex stretching, regions with large rotation rates also correlate with large polymer extensions, albeit to a relatively less degree than extensional regions.</description>

      <title>Development of a Generalizable Data-driven Turbulence Model: Conditioned Field Inversion and Symbolic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16355v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of predicting separated flows with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, which are essential for many engineering tasks. Traditional RANS models usually struggle with this task, so recent efforts have focused on data-driven methods such as field inversion and machine learning (FIML) to correct this issue by adjusting the baseline equations. However, these FIML methods often reduce accuracy in attached boundary layers. To address this issue, we developed a "conditioned field inversion" technique. This method adjusts the corrective factor \b{eta} (used by FIML) in the shear-stress transport (SST) model. It multiplies \b{eta} with a shield function f_d that is off in the boundary layer and on elsewhere. This maintains the accuracy of the baseline model for the attached flows. We applied both conditioned and classic field inversion to the NASA hump and a curved backward-facing step (CBFS), creating two datasets. These datasets were used to train two models: SR-CND (from our new method) and SR-CLS (from the traditional method). The SR-CND model matches the SR-CLS model in predicting separated flows in various scenarios, such as periodic hills, the NLR7301 airfoil, the 3D SAE car model, and the 3D Ahmed body, and outperforms the baseline SST model in the cases presented in the paper. Importantly, the SR-CND model maintains accuracy in the attached boundary layers, whereas the SR-CLS model does not. Therefore, the proposed method improves separated flow predictions while maintaining the accuracy of the original model for attached flows, offering a better way to create data-driven turbulence models.</description>

      <title>Group cohesion and passive dynamics of a pair of inertial swimmers with three-dimensional hydrodynamic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When swimming animals form cohesive groups, they can reap several benefits. Our understanding of collective animal motion has traditionally been driven by models based on phenomenological behavioral rules, but more recent work has highlighted the critical importance of hydrodynamic interactions among a group of inertial swimmers. To study how hydrodynamic interactions affect group cohesion, we develop a three-dimensional, inviscid, far-field model of a swimmer. In a group of two model swimmers, we observe several dynamical phases, including following, divergence, collision, and cohesion. Our results illustrate when cohesive groups can passively form through hydrodynamic interactions alone, and when other action is needed to maintain cohesion. We find that misalignment between swimmers makes passive cohesion less likely; nevertheless, it is possible for a cohesive group to form through passive hydrodynamic interactions alone. We also find that the geometry of swimmers critically affects the group dynamics due to its role in how swimmers sample the velocity gradient of the flow.</description>

      <title>Cross-variable amplitude-frequency coupling during intermittency in a turbulent thermoacoustic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate flame-acoustic interactions in a turbulent combustor during the state of intermittency before the onset of thermoacoustic instability using complex networks. Experiments are performed in a turbulent bluff-body stabilized dump combustor where the inlet airflow rate is varied quasi-statically and continuously. We construct a natural visibility graph from the local heat release rate fluctuations at each location. Comparing the average degree during epochs of high and low amplitude acoustic pressure oscillations during the state of intermittency, we detect frequency modulation in local heat release rate signals. Through this approach, we discover unique spatial patterns of cross-variable coupling between the frequency of heat release rate fluctuations and the amplitude of acoustic pressure fluctuations. The frequency of heat release rate lfuctuations increases in regions of flame anchoring owing to high-frequency excitation of the flow and flame during epochs of high-amplitude acoustic pressure dynamics. On the other hand, the frequency of heat release rate fluctuations decreases in regions associated with flame front distortions by large coherent vortices. In experiments with continuously varying airflow rates, the spatial pattern of frequency modulation varies with an increase in the average amplitude of acoustic pressure fluctuations owing to an increase in the epochs of periodic acoustic pressure dynamics and the size of vortices forming in the flow. Dynamic shifts in the location of flame anchoring induce low-frequency fluctuations in heat release rate fluctuations during very high-amplitude intermittent acoustic pressure dynamics. Our approach using conditional natural visibility graphs thus reveals the spatial pattern of amplitude-frequency coupling between the co-evolving flame and the acoustic field dynamics in turbulent reacting flows.</description>

      <title>Transition reversal over a blunt plate at Mach 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the stability and transition to turbulence over a blunt flat plate with different leading-edge radii are investigated computationally. The freestream Mach number is 5, the unit Reynolds number is $6\times10^7$ m$^{-1}$, and the maximum nose-tip radius 3 mm exceeds the experimental reversal value. High-resolution numerical simulation and stability analysis are performed. Three-dimensional broadband perturbation is added on the farfield boundary to initiate the transition. The highlight of this work is that the complete physical process is considered, including the three-dimensional receptivity, linear and nonlinear instabilities, and transition. The experimental reversal phenomenon is favourably reproduced in the numerical simulation for the first time. Linear stability analysis shows that unstable first and second modes are absent in the blunt-plate flows owing to the presence of the entropy layer, although these modes are evident in the sharp-leading-edge case. Therefore, the transition on the blunt plate is due to nonmodal instabilities. Numerical results for all the blunt-plate cases reveal the formation of streamwise streaky structures downstream of the nose (stage I) and then the presence of intermittent turbulent spots in the transitional region (stage II). In stage I, a preferential spanwise wavelength of around 0.9 mm is selected for all the nose-tip radii, and low-frequency components are dominant. In stage II, high-frequency secondary instabilities appear to grow, which participate in the eventual breakdown. By contrast, leading-edge streaks are not remarkable in the sharp-leading-edge case, where transition is induced by oblique first and Mack second modes. The transition reversal beyond the critical nose-tip radius arises from an increasing magnitude of the streaky response in the early stage, while the transition mechanism keeps similar qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the checkerboard problem to reduce numerical dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides a comprehensive exploration of various methods in solving incompressible flows using a projection method, and their relation to the occurrence and management of checkerboard oscillations. It employs an algebraic symmetry-preserving framework, clarifying the derivation and implementation of discrete operators while also addressing the associated numerical errors. The lack of a proper definition for the checkerboard problem is addressed by proposing a physics-based coefficient. This coefficient, rooted in the disparity between the compact- and wide-stencil Laplacian operators, is able to quantify oscillatory solution fields with a physics-based, global, normalised, non-dimensional value. The influence of mesh and time-step refinement on the occurrence of checkerboarding is highlighted. Therefore, single measurements using this coefficient should be considered with caution, as the value presents little use without any context and can either suggest mesh refinement or use of a different solver. In addition, an example is given on how to employ this coefficient, by establishing a negative feedback between the level of checkerboarding and the inclusion of a pressure predictor, to dynamically balance the checkerboarding and numerical dissipation. This method is tested for laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating its capabilities in obtaining this dynamical balance, without requiring user input. The method is able to achieve low numerical dissipation in absence of oscillations or diminish oscillation on skew meshes, while it shows minimal loss in accuracy for a turbulent test case. Despite its advantages, the method exhibits a slight decrease in the second-order relation between time-step size and pressure error, suggesting that other feedback mechanisms could be of interest.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical model of optothermal fluidics in a confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the semi-analytical solution of the temperature and flow fields of a fluid confined in a narrow space between two parallel plates. The temperature increase is triggered by photothermal effects of fluids and/or boundaries due to the absorption of a focused Gaussian beam irradiated perpendicular to the fluid film, and then the temperature variation induces the flow fields through a buoyancy force and/or thermo-osmotic slip. The semi-analytical solution to this optothermal fluidic system is validated by comparing with the results of numerical simulation, and is applied to typical optothermal fluidic problems. In particular, the optothermal trap of nanoparticles observed in our previous experiment [T. Tsuji, et al., Electrophoresis, 42, 2401 (2021)] is investigated in terms of thermophoretic force and flow drag that are obtained semi-analytically. The semi-analytical solution can be shared through open-source codes that are available to researchers without the background of fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Highly deformable flapping membrane wings suppress the leading edge vortex in hover to perform better</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Airborne insects generate a leading edge vortex when they flap their wings. This coherent vortex is a low pressure region that enhances the lift of flapping wings compared to fixed wings. Insect wings are thin membranes strengthened by a system of veins that does not allow large wing deformations. Bat wings are thin compliant skin membranes stretched between their limbs, hand, and body that show larger deformations during flapping wing flight. This study examines the role of the leading edge vortex on highly deformable membrane wings that passively change shape under fluid dynamic loading maintaining a positive camber throughout the hover cycle. Our experiments reveal that unsteady wing deformations suppress the formation of a coherent leading edge vortex as flexibility increases. At lift and energy optimal aeroelastic conditions, there is no more leading edge vortex. Instead, vorticity accumulates in a bound shear layer covering the wing's upper surface from the leading to the trailing edge. Despite the absence of a leading edge vortex, the optimal deformable membrane wings demonstrate enhanced lift and energy efficiency compared to their rigid counterparts. It is possible that small bats rely on this mechanism for efficient hovering. We relate the force production on the wings with their deformation through scaling analyses. Additionally, we identify the geometric angles at the leading and trailing edges as observable indicators of the flow state and use them to map out the transitions of the flow topology and their aerodynamic performance for a wide range of aeroelastic conditions.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of buoyancy-aided mixed convective flow past a square cylinder inclined at 45 degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study numerically investigates two-dimensional mixed convective flow of air past a square cylinder placed at an angle of incidence of $\alpha = 45^{\circ}$ to the free-stream. We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) for a Reynolds number (Re) of 100 and a range of Richardson numbers (Ri) between 0.0 and 1.0 and a Prandtl number (Pr) of 0.7. The critical Richardson number at which the near-field becomes a steady flow from an unsteady one, using Stuart-Landau analysis, is found to be Ri $=0.68$, and simultaneously, the far-field unsteadiness emerges. There is no range of Ri for which the entire flow field is seen to be steady. At a relatively moderate Ri, the flow field reveals the presence of vorticity inversion through the momentum deficit/addition in the downstream region. We discuss the dual wake-plume nature of the flow beyond the cylinder. The wake exhibits characteristics similar to those of a buoyant jet in the far-field at increased buoyancy. We explore the cause of the far-field unsteadiness, and discuss the mechanism of the observed flow physics using instantaneous and time-averaged flow fields. The important flow quantities, such as force coefficients, vortex shedding frequency, and Nusselt number, are discussed at various Richardson numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of thermoacoustic shocks is studied in a fluid complex plasma. The thermoacoustic wave mode can be damped (or anti-damped) when the contribution from the thermoacoustic interaction is lower (or higher) than that due to the particle collision and/or the kinematic viscosity. In the nonlinear regime, the thermoacoustic wave, propagating with the acoustic speed, can evolve into small amplitude shocks whose dynamics are governed by the Bateman-Burgers equation with an additional nonlinear term that appears due to the particle collision and nonreciprocal interactions of charged particles providing the thermal feedback. The appearance of such nonlinearity can cause the shock fronts to be stable (or unstable) depending on the collision frequency remains below (or above) a critical value and the thermal feedback is positive. The existence of different kinds of shocks and their characteristics are analyzed analytically and numerically with the system parameters that characterize the thermal feedback, thermal diffusion, heat capacity per fluid particle, the particle collision and the fluid viscosity. A good agreement between analytical and numerical results is also noticed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global climate models typically operate at a grid resolution of hundreds of kilometers and fail to resolve atmospheric mesoscale processes, e.g., clouds, precipitation, and gravity waves (GWs). Model representation of these processes and their sources is essential to the global circulation and planetary energy budget, but subgrid scale contributions from these processes are often only approximately represented in models using parameterizations. These parameterizations are subject to approximations and idealizations, which limit their capability and accuracy. The most drastic of these approximations is the "single-column approximation" which completely neglects the horizontal evolution of these processes, resulting in key biases in current climate models. With a focus on atmospheric GWs, we present the first-ever global simulation of atmospheric GW fluxes using machine learning (ML) models trained on the WINDSET dataset to emulate global GW emulation in the atmosphere, as an alternative to traditional single-column parameterizations. Using an Attention U-Net-based architecture trained on globally resolved GW momentum fluxes, we illustrate the importance and effectiveness of global nonlocality, when simulating GWs using data-driven schemes.</description>
