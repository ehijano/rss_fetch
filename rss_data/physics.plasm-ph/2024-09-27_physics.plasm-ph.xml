      <title>Particle-in-cell simulations of expanding high energy density plasmas with laser ray tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and analysis of high energy density (HED) laser experiments typically rely on radiation hydrodynamics simulations. However, some laser-plasma interaction regimes are not collisional and cannot be adequately modeled with hydrodynamics. For example, strongly driven magnetic reconnection and magnetized collisionless shock experiments possess extended hydrodynamic or even kinetic properties, necessitating first-principles kinetic simulations. In this paper, we present the benchmarking and first results obtained with a laser-ray-tracing and inverse Bremsstrahlung absorption module implemented in the particle-in-cell code PSC. The simulation results are compared to radiation hydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code as well as analytical estimates. We successfully benchmark the energy deposition model and overall hydrodynamic evolution of the systems. We also consider possible kinetic effects that may be expected from laser-target ablation in the HED regime, including non-local transport and two-temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Simulated annealing of reduced magnetohydrodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory of simulated annealing (SA), a method for equilibrium and stability analyses for Hamiltonian systems, is reviewed. The SA explained in this review is based on a double bracket formulation that derives from Hamiltonian structure. In addition to general theoretical aspects, the explicit formulation as well as numerical applications are presented. Both finite and infinite degree-of-freedom systems are treated, in particular, the heavy top, a toy model mimicking low-beta reduced magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and low- and high-beta reduced MHD. Numerical results successfully demonstrate the usefulness of SA for equilibrium and stability analyses. At the same time, the results raise some future issues that are discussed in the paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Madelung transformation on a generalized scalar Gross-Pitaevski equation, a nonlinear continuum fluid equations are derived for a classical fluid. A unitary quantum lattice algorithm is then determined as a second order discrete representation of this Gross-Pitaevski equation and the simulations are compared to those using classical fluid dynamic techniques.</description>

      <title>Force Fields for Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Charged Dust Particles with Finite Size in Complex Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To exclude collisions leading to the overlap of finite-sized charged particles in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in systems like complex (dusty) plasmas, we developed a scheme to generate a pair interaction force functionally depending on the pair distribution of particles. This ensures that the pair distribution function drops to zero at distances between particles corresponding to the point where the surfaces of two particles come into contact. The presented model has a wide utility for the description of various processes in dusty plasmas. As an example, using the non-equilibrium MD method, we performed calculations of the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity of charged spherical particles interacting via screened Yukawa potential. The role of finite particle size was found to be particularly important for small values of the coupling parameter, i.e., for gas-like and weakly correlated liquid-like systems. Furthermore, we have analyzed the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field.</description>

      <title>A scaling law of the neutral opacity and Balmer-$\alpha$ wing shape in high-temperature plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen atoms penetrating deep inside high-temperature magnetically confined plasmas by repetitive charge-exchange collisions result in a particle source, which affects the plasma performance significantly. In this \textit{Letter}, we present an approximate solution of the fluid equations for neutral transport and the analytical representation of the neutral opacity, in a simplified plasma geometry. This analysis predicts a power-law decay in the Balmer-$\alpha$ line wings which reflects the velocity distribution of the neutral atoms, with the power-law index analytically represented as well. These scaling laws are validated by the comparison with a simple Monte-Carlo simulation and spectroscopic observations of Large Helical Device plasmas. Since the Balmer-$\alpha$ line wings are experimentally accessible, our formulation opens the door to directly observe the neutral opacity and thus the particle source distribution in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic simulations of A-type stars: Long-term evolution of core dynamo cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early-type stars have convective cores due to a steep temperature gradient produced by the CNO cycle. These cores can host dynamos, and the generated magnetic fields can be relevant to explain the magnetism observed in Ap/Bp stars. Our main objective is to characterise the convective core dynamos and differential rotation, and to do the first quantitative analysis of the relation between magnetic activity cycle and rotation period. We use numerical 3D star-in-a-box simulations of a $2.2~M_\odot$ A-type star with a convective core of roughly $20\%$ of the stellar radius surrounded by a radiative envelope. Rotation rates from 8 to 20 days are explored. We use two models of the entire star, and an additional zoom set, where $50\%$ of the radius is retained. The simulations produce hemispheric core dynamos with cycles and typical magnetic field strengths around 60 kG. However, only a very small fraction of the magnetic energy is able to reach the surface. The cores have solar-like differential rotation, and a substantial part of the radiative envelope has quasi-rigid rotation. In the most rapidly rotating cases the magnetic energy in the core is roughly 40\% of the kinetic energy. Finally, we find that the magnetic cycle period $P_\mathrm{cyc}$ increases with decreasing the rotation period $P_\mathrm{rot}$ which is also observed in many simulations of solar-type stars. Our simulations indicate that a strong hemispherical core dynamo arises routinely, but that it is not enough the explain the surface magnetism of Ap/Bp stars. Nevertheless, as the core dynamo produces dynamically relevant magnetic fields it should not be neglected when other mechanisms are explored.</description>

      <title>IDP-PGFE: An Interpretable Disruption Predictor based on Physics-Guided Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disruption prediction has made rapid progress in recent years, especially in machine learning (ML)-based methods. Understanding why a predictor makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy for future tokamak disruption predictors. The purpose of most disruption predictors is accuracy or cross-machine capability. However, if a disruption prediction model can be interpreted, it can tell why certain samples are classified as disruption precursors. This allows us to tell the types of incoming disruption and gives us insight into the mechanism of disruption. This paper designs a disruption predictor called Interpretable Disruption Predictor based On Physics-guided feature extraction (IDP-PGFE) on J-TEXT. The prediction performance of the model is effectively improved by extracting physics-guided features. A high-performance model is required to ensure the validity of the interpretation results. The interpretability study of IDP-PGFE provides an understanding of J-TEXT disruption and is generally consistent with existing comprehension of disruption. IDP-PGFE has been applied to the disruption due to continuously increasing density towards density limit experiments on J-TEXT. The time evolution of the PGFE features contribution demonstrates that the application of ECRH triggers radiation-caused disruption, which lowers the density at disruption. While the application of RMP indeed raises the density limit in J-TEXT. The interpretability study guides intuition on the physical mechanisms of density limit disruption that RMPs affect not only the MHD instabilities but also the radiation profile, which delays density limit disruption.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamics of Magneto-Inertial, Differentially Rotating Laboratory Plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed characterization of the structure and evolution of differentially rotating plasmas driven on the MAGPIE pulsed-power generator (1.4 MA peak current, 240 ns rise-time). The experiments were designed to simulate physics relevant to accretion discs and jets on laboratory scales. A cylindrical aluminium wire array Z pinch enclosed by return posts with an overall azimuthal off-set angle was driven to produce ablation plasma flows that propagate inwards in a slightly off-radial trajectory, injecting mass, angular momentum, and confining ram pressure to a rotating plasma column on the axis. However, the plasma is free to expand axially, forming a collimated, differentially rotating axial jet that propagates at $\approx 100$ km/s. The density profile of the jet corresponds to a dense shell surrounding a low-density core, which is consistent with the centrifugal barrier effect being sustained along the jet's propagation. We show analytically that, as the rotating plasma accretes mass, conservation of mass and momentum implies plasma radial growth scaling as $r \propto t^{1/3}$. As the characteristic moment of inertia increases, the rotation velocity is predicted to decrease and settle on a characteristic value $\approx 20$ km/s. We find that both predictions are in agreement with Thomson scattering and optical self-emission imaging measurements.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability of Geodesic-Acoustic-Mode packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isolated, undamped geodesic-acoustic-mode (GAM) packets have been demonstrated to obey a (focusing) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) [E. Poli, Phys. Plasmas 2021]. This equation predicts susceptibility of GAM packets to the modulational instability (MI). The necessary conditions for this instability are analyzed analytically and numerically using the NLSE model. The predictions of the NLSE are compared to gyrokinetic simulations performed with the global particle-in-cell code ORB5, where GAM packets are created from initial perturbations of the axisymmetric radial electric field $E_r$. An instability of the GAM packets with respect to modulations is observed both in cases in which an initial perturbation is imposed and when the instability develops spontaneously. However, significant differences in the dynamics of the small scales are discerned between the NLSE and gyrokinetic simulations. These discrepancies are mainly due to the radial dependence of the strength of the nonlinear term, which we do not retain in the solution of the NLSE, and to the damping of higher spectral components. The damping of the high-$k_r$ components, which develop as a consequence of the nonlinearity, can be understood in terms of Landau damping. The influence of the ion Larmor radius $\rho_i$ as well as the perturbation wavevector $k_{\text{pert}}$ on this effect is studied. For the parameters considered here the aforementioned damping mechanism hinders the MI process significantly from developing to its full extent and is strong enough to stabilize some of the (according to the undamped NLSE model) unstable wavevectors.</description>

      <title>Does Magnetic Reconnection Change Topology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that magnetic reconnection and topology-change can be understood, and distinguished, in terms of trajectories of Alfv\'enic wave-packets ${\bf x}(t)$ moving along the magnetic field ${\bf B(x}, t)$ with Alfv\'en velocity $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf V}_A({\bf x},t)$, i.e. adopting a Lagrangian formalism for virtual particles. A considerable simplification is attained, in fact, by directly employing elementary concepts from hydrodynamic turbulence without appealing to the fictitious and complicated notion of magnetic field lines moving through plasma. In incompressible flows, Alfv\'enic trajectories correspond to the dynamical system $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf B}$, where $\bf B$ solves the induction equation, with phase space $(\bf x,B)$. Metric topology of this phase space, at any time $t$, captures the intuitive notion that nearby wave-packets should remain nearby at a slightly different time $t\pm \delta t$, unless topology changes e.g., by dissipation. In fact, continuity conditions for magnetic field allow rapid but continuous divergence of these trajectories, i.e., reconnection, but not discontinuous divergence which would change magnetic topology. Thus topology can change only due to time-reversal symmetry breaking e.g., by dissipation or turbulence. In laminar and even chaotic flows, the separation of Alfv\'enic trajectories at all times remains proportional to their initial separation, i.e., slow reconnection, and topology changes by dissipation with a rate proportional to resistivity. In turbulence, trajectories diverge super-linearly with time independent of their initial separation, i.e., fast reconnection, and magnetic topology changes by turbulent diffusion with a rate independent of small-scale plasma effects. Our results strongly support the Lazarian-Vishniac model of stochastic reconnection and its reformulation by Eyink in terms of stochastic flux-freezing.</description>
