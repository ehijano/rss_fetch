      <title>Slowing translation to avoid ribosome population extinction and maintain stable allocation at slow growth rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To double the cellular population of ribosomes, a fraction of the active ribosomes is allocated to synthesize ribosomal proteins. Subsequently, these ribosomal proteins enter the ribosome self-assembly process, synthesizing new ribosomes and forming the well-known ribosome autocatalytic subcycle. Neglecting ribosome lifetime and the duration of the self-assembly process, the doubling rate of all cellular biomass can be equated with the fraction of ribosomes allocated to synthesize an essential ribosomal protein times its synthesis rate. However, ribosomes have a finite lifetime, and the assembly process has a finite duration. Furthermore, the number of ribosomes is known to decrease with slow growth rates. The finite lifetime of ribosomes and the decline in their numbers present a challenge in sustaining slow growth solely through controlling the allocation of ribosomes to synthesize more ribosomal proteins. When the number of ribosomes allocated per mRNA of an essential ribosomal protein is approximately one, the resulting fluctuations in the production rate of new ribosomes increase, causing a potential risk that the actual production rate will fall below the ribosome death rate. Thus, in this regime, a significant risk of extinction of the ribosome population emerges. To mitigate this risk, we suggest that the ribosome translation speed is used as an alternative control parameter, which facilitates the maintenance of slow growth rates with a larger ribosome pool. We clarify the observed reduction in translation speed at harsh environments in E. coli and C. Glutamicum, explore other mitigation strategies, and suggest additional falsifiable predictions of our model.</description>

      <title>Identification and Removal of System-Induced Autofluorescence in Miniaturized Fiber-optic Fluorescence Endoscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniaturized fiber-optic fluorescence endoscopes play a crucial role in medical diagnostics and research, but system-induced autofluorescence remains a significant challenge, particularly in single-fiber setups. While recent advances, such as double-clad fiber (DCF) and DCF couplers, have reduced background noise, complete elimination remains challenging. Research on the various sources of system-induced autofluorescence and the methods to remove them are scarce. This study seeks to fulfill this need by proposing practical approaches to removal of system-induced autofluorescence. This study presents the methods to suppress static background noise and proposes an algorithm based on least-squares linear spectral unmixing to remove variable system-induced autofluorescence artifacts. The algorithm was evaluated on a single-fiber DCF intravascular imaging system, with phantom and rodent in vivo experiments confirming its effectiveness. Results showed accurate differentiation between true sample fluorescence and system-induced autofluorescence artifacts through the validation with optical coherence tomography images and histology results, further verified by statistical analysis. Unlike simple background subtraction, the method addresses dynamic variations in background noise and incidental artifacts, providing robust performance under varying conditions. Our method may be adapted to various fiber-based endoscopy setups and be compatible with different fluorescent agents and autofluorescence imaging, broadening its applicability in biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Charge Transport at Atomic Scales in 1D-Semiconductors: A Quantum Statistical Model Allowing Rigorous Numerical Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in understanding charge transport at atomic scales. The motivations are myriad, including understanding the conductance properties of peptides measured experimentally. In this study, we propose a model of quantum statistical mechanics which aims to investigate the transport properties of 1D-semiconductor at nanoscales. The model is a two-band Hamiltonian in which electrons are assumed to be quasi-free. It allows us to investigate the behaviour of current and quantum fluctuations under the influence of numerous parameters, showing the response with respect to varying voltage, temperature and length. We compute the current observable at each site and demonstrate the local behaviour generating the current.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of run-and-tumble-like dynamics in coupled self-propelled robots: experiment and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble (RT) motion is commonly observed in flagellated microswimmers, arising from synchronous and asynchronous flagellar beating. In addition to hydrodynamic interactions, mechanical coupling has recently been recognized to play a key role in flagellar synchronization. To explore this, we design a macroscopic model system that comprises dry, self-propelled robots linked by a rigid rod to model a biflagellated microorganism. To mimic a low Reynolds number environment, we program each robot to undergo overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion. We find that such a system exhibits RT-like behavior, characterized by sharp tumbles and exponentially distributed run times, consistent with real microswimmers. We quantify tumbling frequency and demonstrate its tunability across experimental parameters. Additionally, we provide a theoretical model that reproduces our results, elucidating physical mechanisms governing RT dynamics.</description>
