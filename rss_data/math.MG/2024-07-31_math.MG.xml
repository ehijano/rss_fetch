      <title>The Complement of a Closed Set Satisfying the Extended Exterior Sphere Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a novel analytical proof of an improved version of [10, Theorem 3.1], showing that the complement of a closed set satisfying the extended exterior sphere condition is nothing but the union of closed balls with lower semicontinuous radius function. The improvement lies in the radius function, which is now larger than the one used in [10, Theorem 3.1].</description>

      <title>Vertex generated polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define and investigate a class of polytopes which we call "vertex generated" consisting of polytopes which are the average of their $0$ and $n$ dimensional faces. We show many results regarding this class, among them: that the class contains all zonotopes, that it is dense in dimension $n=2$, that any polytope can be summed with a zonotope so that the sum is in this class, and that a strong form of the celebrated "Maurey Lemma" holds for polytopes in this class. We introduce for every polytope a parameter which measures how far it is from being vertex-generated, and show that when this parameter is small, strong covering properties hold.</description>

      <title>A Solution to the Periodic Square Peg Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve the periodic square peg problem using a simple Lagrangian Floer homology argument. Inscribed squares are interpreted as intersections between two non-displaceable Lagrangian sub-manifolds of a symplectic 4-torus.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity of harmonic functions on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the H\"older regularity condition for harmonic functions on metric measure spaces and prove that under mild volume regular condition and upper heat kernel estimate, the H\"older regularity condition, the weak Bakry-\'Emery non-negative curvature condition, the heat kernel H\"older continuity with or without exponential terms and the heat kernel near-diagonal lower bound are equivalent. As applications, firstly, we prove the validity of the so-called generalized reverse H\"older inequality on the Sierpi\'nski carpet cable system, which was left open by Devyver, Russ, Yang (Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN (2023), no. 18, 15537-15583). Secondly, we prove that two-sided heat kernel estimates alone imply gradient estimate for the heat kernel on strongly recurrent fractal-like cable systems, which improves the main results of the aforementioned paper. Thirdly, we obtain H\"older (Lipschitz) estimate for heat kernel on general metric measure spaces, which extends the classical Li-Yau gradient estimate for heat kernel on Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Colorful positive bases decomposition and Helly-type results for cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the following colorful Helly-type result: Fix $k \in [d-1]$. Assume $\mathcal{A}_1, \dots, \mathcal{A}_{d+(d-k)+1}$ are finite sets (colors) of nonzero vectors in $\R^d$. If for every rainbow sub-selection $R$ from these sets of size at most $\max \{d+1, 2(d-k+1)\}$, the system $\langle {a},{x} \rangle \leq 0,\; a \in R$ has at least $k$ linearly independent solutions, then at least one of the systems $\langle {a},{x} \rangle \leq 0,\; a \in \mathcal{A}_i,$ $i \in [d+(d-k)+1]$ has at least $k$ linearly independent solutions.
  A \emph{rainbow sub-selection} from several sets refers to choosing at most one element from each set (color).
  The Helly-number $\max \{d+1, 2(d-k+1)\}$ and the number of colors $d+(d-k)+1$ are optimal.
  Our key observation is a certain colorful Carath\'eodory-type result for positive bases.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of the Rips complexes of Integer lattices via local domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for each positive integer $n$, the Rips complexes of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice in the $d_1$ metric (i.e., the Manhattan metric, also called the natural word metric in the Cayley graph) are contractible at scales above $n^2(2n-1)$, with the bounds arising from the Jung's constants. We introduce a new concept of locally dominated vertices in a simplicial complex, upon which our proof strategy is based. This allows us to deduce the contractibility of the Rips complexes from a local geometric condition called local crushing. In the case of the integer lattices in dimension $n$ and a fixed scale $r$, this condition entails the comparison of finitely many distances to conclude that the corresponding Rips complex is contractible. In particular, we are able to verify that for $n=1,2,3$, the Rips complex of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice at scale greater or equal to $n$ is contractible. We conjecture that the same proof strategy can be used to extend this result to all dimensions $n$</description>

      <title>Convex co-compact groups with one dimensional boundary faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.05056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider convex co-compact subgroups of the projective linear group. We prove that such a group is relatively hyperbolic with respect to a collection of virtually Abelian subgroups of rank two if and only if each open face in the ideal boundary has dimension at most one. We also introduce the "coarse Hilbert dimension" of a subset of a convex set and use it to characterize when a naive convex co-compact subgroup is word hyperbolic or relatively hyperbolic with respect to a collection of virtually Abelian subgroups of rank two.</description>

      <title>Many partitions of mass assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, extending the recent work of authors with Calles Loperena and Dimitrijevi\'c Blagojevi\'c, we give a general and complete treatment of a problem of partition of mass assignments with prescribed arrangements of hyperplanes on Euclidean vector bundles. Using a new configuration test map scheme, as well as an alternative topological framework, we are able to reprove known results, extend them to arbitrary bundles as well as to put various types of constraints on the solutions. Moreover, the developed topological methods allow us to give new proofs and extend results of Guth and Katz, Schnider, and Sober\'on and Takahashi. In this way we place all these results under one ``roof''.</description>

      <title>Coarse embeddability, $L^1$-compression and Percolations on General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a locally finite, connected graph has a coarse embedding into a Hilbert space if and only if there exist bond percolations with arbitrarily large marginals and two-point function vanishing at infinity. We further show that the decay of the two-point function is stretched exponential with stretching exponent $\alpha\in[0,1]$ if and only if the $L^1$-compression exponent of the graph is at least $\alpha$, leading to a probabilistic characterization of this exponent. These results are new even in the particular setting of Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups. The proofs build on new probabilistic methods introduced recently by the authors to study group-invariant percolation on Cayley graphs [25,26], which are now extended to the general, non-symmetric situation of graphs to study their coarse embeddability and $L^1$-compression exponents.</description>
