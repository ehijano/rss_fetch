      <title>Folding Branched Covers of the $3$-Sphere Branched over Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A folding of a branched cover of the 3-sphere that is branched over a knot is a continuous map of the cover into the product of the sphere with a disk that has the property that the projection onto the sphere factor induces the covering. Moreover, away from the branch set, the map is a general position immersion. Cyclic branched covers can be folded so that the map is an embedding when the disk factor is 2-dimensional. Dihedral branched covers can also be folded. In as much as possible, the foldings that are presented are quite detailed. In particular, the paper focuses upon a folding of the dihedral cover of the 3-sphere that is branched along a torus knot of type (2,5). The cover also is homeomorphic to the $3$-sphere.</description>

      <title>Cluster algebras and skein algebras for surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two algebras of curves associated to an oriented surface of finite type - the cluster algebra from combinatorial algebra, and the skein algebra from quantum topology. We focus on generalizations of cluster algebras and generalizations of skein algebras that include arcs whose endpoints are marked points on the boundary or in the interior of the surface. We show that the generalizations are closely related by maps that can be explicitly defined, and we explore the structural implications, including (non-)finite generation. We also discuss open questions about the algebraic structure of the algebras.</description>

      <title>Cocompact Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ has a modular embedding if its adjoint trace field is a totally real number field and every unbounded Galois conjugate $\Gamma^\sigma$ comes equipped with a holomorphic (or conjugate holomorphic) map ${\phi^\sigma : \mathbb{B}^1 \to \mathbb{B}^1}$ intertwining the actions of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^\sigma$ on the Poincar\'e disk $\mathbb{B}^1$. This paper provides the first cocompact nonarithmetic Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding that are not commensurable with a triangle group. The main result, proved using period domains, is that any immersed totally geodesic complex curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold has a modular embedding. Another consequence is that there are infinitely many signatures for which no finite-volume quotient of $\mathbb{B}^1$ with that signature can be an immersed totally geodesic curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold.</description>

      <title>J-braid groups are torus necklace groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of links we call torus necklaces for which the link groups are precisely the braid groups of generalised $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, this correspondence exhibits the meridians of the aforementioned link groups as braid reflections. In particular, this construction generalises to all irreducible rank two complex reflection groups a well-known correspondence between some rank two complex braid groups and some torus knot groups. In addition, as abstract groups, we show that the family of link groups associated to Seifert links coincides with the family of circular groups. This shows that every time a link group has a non-trivial center, it is a Garside group.</description>

      <title>The mapping class group action on the odd character variety is faithful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The odd character variety of a Riemann surface is a moduli space of SO(3) representations of the fundamental group which can be interpreted as the moduli space of stable holomorphic rank 2 bundles of odd degree and fixed determinant. This is a symplectic manifold, and there is a homomorphism from a finite extension of the mapping class group of the surface to the symplectic mapping class group of this moduli space. When the genus is at least 2, it is shown that this homomomorphism is injective. This answers a question posed by Dostoglou and Salamon and generalizes a theorem of Smith from the genus 2 case to arbitrary genus. A corresponding result on the faithfulness of the action on the Fukaya category of the odd character variety is also proved. The proofs use instanton Floer homology, a version of the Atiyah-Floer Conjecture, and aspects of a strategy used by Clarkson in the Heegaard Floer setting.</description>

      <title>Fixed-point-free involutions on the boundaries of Right-angled Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: About 20 years ago, Bogdan Nica conjectured that the boundary of any word-hyperbolic group admits admits a fixed-point-free involution. In this very short article, we prove a variation of the conjecture, replacing word-hyperbolic groups with Right-angled coxeter groups. This is not a solution to Nica's conjecture, but hopefully the techniques will shed some light regarding possible approaches to the problem.</description>

      <title>Can Yang-Baxter imply Lie algebra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum knot invariants (like colored HOMFLY-PT or Kauffman polynomials) are a distinguished class of non-perturbative topological invariants. Any known way to construct them (via Chern-Simons theory or quantum R-matrix) starts with a finite simple Lie algebra. Another set of knot invariants - of finite type - is related to quantum invariants via a perturbative expansion. However can all finite type invariants be obtained in this way? Investigating this problem, P. Vogel discovered a way to polynomially parameterize the expansion coefficients with three parameters so that, at different specific values, this reproduces the answers for all simple Lie (super)algebras. Then it is easy to construct a polynomial $P_{alg}$ that vanishes for all simple Lie algebras, and the corresponding Vassiliev invariant would thus be absent from the perturbative expansion.
  We review these Vogel claims pointing out at least two interesting implications of his construction. First, we discuss whether infinite-dimensional Lie algebras might enlarge Chern-Simons theory. Second, Vogel's construction implies an alternative axiomatization of simple Lie algebras - when we start from knot invariants and arrive at Lie algebras and their classification, which is opposite to conventional logic that we mentioned at the beginning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cerf and Palais independently proved a remarkable result about extending diffeomorphisms defined on smooth balls in a manifold to global diffeomorphisms of the manifold onto itself. We explain Palais' argument and show how to extend it to the class of homeomorphisms and bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. While Palais' argument is surprising, it is elementary and short. However, its extension to bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms and homeomorphisms requires deep results: the stable homeomorphism and the annulus theorems.</description>

      <title>Learning 3-Manifold Triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real 3-manifold triangulations can be uniquely represented by isomorphism signatures. Databases of these isomorphism signatures are generated for a variety of 3-manifolds and knot complements, using SnapPy and Regina, then these language-like inputs are used to train various machine learning architectures to differentiate the manifolds, as well as their Dehn surgeries, via their triangulations. Gradient saliency analysis then extracts key parts of this language-like encoding scheme from the trained models. The isomorphism signature databases are taken from the 3-manifolds' Pachner graphs, which are also generated in bulk for some selected manifolds of focus and for the subset of the SnapPy orientable cusped census with $&lt;8$ initial tetrahedra. These Pachner graphs are further analysed through the lens of network science to identify new structure in the triangulation representation; in particular for the hyperbolic case, a relation between the length of the shortest geodesic (systole) and the size of the Pachner graph's ball is observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a streamlined procedure for constructing small symplectic 4-manifolds via contact gluing, based on a technique invented by David Gay around 2000. We also give a few applications, ranging from embeddings of singular Lagrangian RP^2s to realizing an infinite family of lens spaces as hypersurfaces of contact type in a symplectic Hirzebruch surface. Furthermore, our investigation on S^1-invariant contact structures also suggests there should be a universal upper bound for the self-intersection of a rational unicuspidal curve with one Puiseux pair in any algebraic surface (the bound depends only on the singularity).</description>

Abstract: We present problems and results that combine graph-minors and coarse geometry. For example, we ask whether every geodesic metric space (or graph) without a fat $H$ minor is quasi-isometric to a graph with no $H$ minor, for an arbitrary finite graph $H$. We answer this affirmatively for a few small $H$. We also present a metric analogue of Menger's theorem and Konig's ray theorem. We conjecture metric analogues of the Erdos--Posa Theorem and Halin's grid theorem.</description>

      <title>On acylindrical tree actions and outer automorphism group of Baumslag-Solitar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores acylindrical actions on trees, building on previous works related to the mapping class group and projection complexes. We demonstrate that the quotient action of a $1$-acylindrical action of a group on a tree by an equivariant family of subgroups remains $1$-acylindrical. We establish criteria for ensuring that this quotient action is non-elementary acylindrical, thus preserving acylindrical hyperbolicity of the group. Additionally, we show that the fundamental group of a graph of groups admits the largest acylindrical action on its Bass-Serre tree under certain conditions. As an application, we analyze the outer automorphism group of non-solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups, we prove its acylindrical hyperbolicity, highlighting the differences between various tree actions and identifying the largest acylindrical action.</description>
