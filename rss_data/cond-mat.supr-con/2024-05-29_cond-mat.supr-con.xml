      <title>Comment on "Trapped flux in a small crystal of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ at ambient pressure and in a diamond anvil pressure cell" by S. L. Bud'ko et al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17500v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their paper arXiv:2405.08189, Supercond. Sci. Technol. 37 (2024) 065010 [1], Bud'ko et al. present experimental results for trapped magnetic flux for a tiny sample of a type II superconductor. The paper aims to provide evidence in support of the interpretation that similar measurements performed in samples of hydrogen-rich materials under high pressure by Minkov, Bud'ko and coauthors [2] are conclusive evidence [3] for superconductivity in hydrides under pressure. Here we point out that the new evidence presented by Bud'ko et al. [1] further supports our interpretation [4],[5] that the reported measurements of trapped flux on hydrides under pressure [2] are evidence that the samples are $not$ superconducting.</description>

      <title>The Phase Diagram of High-Tc Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the detailed structure of the T vs. doping phase diagram of hole doped High-Tc superconducting cuprates, from the point of view of a recently proposed comprehensive theory for these materials. We obtain, in particular, analytic expressions for the transition lines delimiting the Neel phase, TN (x), the Spin-Glass phase, Tg(x) and the CDW Charge Ordered phase, Tco(x). These, results along with the previously derived expressions for the transition lines delimiting the Superconducting phase, Tc (x), the Pseudogap (and Strange Metal) phases, T*(x) and the Fermi Liquid phase, Tfl(x) are in excellent agreement with the experimental data and form an unprecedentedly accurate description of cuprates. Our study reveals, in particular, the complementary role, which is played by the mechanisms responsible for the onset of superconducting (SC) and Spin-Glass (SG) phases in these materials. The absence of SG phases in electron doped High-Tc superconducting cuprates, strongly suggests a different SC mechanism should operate in those materials.</description>

      <title>Low-power Rapid Planar Superconducting Logic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid-pace growing demand for high-performance computation and big-data manipulation entails substantial increase in global power consumption, and challenging thermal management. Thus, there is a need in allocating competitive alternatives for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Superconducting platforms, such as rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) lack electric resistance and excel in power efficiency and time performance. However, traditional RSFQs require 3D geometry for their Josephson junctions (JJs) imposing a large footprint, and hence preventing device miniaturization and increasing processing time. Here, we demonstrate that RSFQ logic circuits of planar geometry with weak-link bridges are scalable, relatively easy to process and are CMOS-compatible on a Si chip. Universal logic gates, as well as combinational arithmetic circuiting that are based on these devices are demonstrated. The power consumption and processing time of these logic circuits were as low as 0.8 nW and 13 ps, an order of magnitude improvement with respect to the equivalent traditional-RSFQ logic circuits and two orders of magnitude with respect to CMOS. The competitive performance of planar RSFQ logic circuits renders them for promising CMOS substitutes, especially in the supercomputational realm.</description>

      <title>Resistance Distribution of Decoherent Quantum Hall-Superconductor Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission, of a decoherent quantum Hall-superconductor edge, with the decoherence coming from metallic puddles along the edge. Such metallic puddles may originate from magnetic vortex cores or other superconductivity suppressing perturbations. In contrast to the distribution of a coherent edge which is peaked away from zero charge transmission, we show analytically and numerically that the distribution of a decoherent edge with metallic puddles is always peaked at zero charge transmission, which serves as a probe of coherence of superconducting chiral edge states. We further show that the distribution width decays exponentially in magnetic field and temperature. Our theoretical decoherent distribution agrees well with the recent experimental observation in graphene with superconducting proximity.</description>

      <title>Engineering flux-controlled flat bands and topological states in a Stagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Stagome lattice, a variant of the Kagome lattice, where one can make any of the bands completely flat by tuning an externally controllable magnetic flux. This systematically allows the energy of the flat band (FB) to coincide with the Fermi level. We have analytically calculated the compact localized states (CLS) associated to each of these flat bands appearing at different values of the magnetic flux. We also show that, this model features nontrivial topological properties with distinct integer values of the Chern numbers as a function of the magnetic flux. We argue that this mechanism for making any of the bands exactly flat could be of interest to address the FB superconductivity in such a system. Furthermore, we believe that the phenomenon of photonic flat band localization could be studied in the Stagome lattice structure, designed for instance using femtosecond laser induced single-mode waveguide arrays.</description>

      <title>Momentum-resolved electronic structures and strong electronic correlations in graphene-like nitride superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although transition-metal nitrides have been widely applied for several decades, experimental investigations of their high-resolution electronic band structures are rare due to the lack of high-quality single-crystalline samples. Here, we report on the first momentum-resolved electronic band structures of titanium nitride (TiN) films, a remarkable nitride superconductor. The measurements of crystal structures and electrical transport properties confirmed the high quality of these films. More importantly, with a combination of high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and the first-principles calculations, the extracted Coulomb interaction strength of TiN films can be as large as 8.5 eV, whereas resonant photoemission spectroscopy yields a value of 6.26 eV. These large values of Coulomb interaction strength indicate that superconducting TiN is a strongly correlated system. Our results uncover the unexpected electronic correlations in transition-metal nitrides, potentially providing a perspective not only to understand their emergent quantum states but also to develop their applications in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Pair-Kondo effect: a mechanism for time-reversal broken superconductivity in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important open puzzle in the superconductivity of UTe$_2$ is the emergence of time-reversal broken superconductivity from a non-magnetic normal state. Breaking time-reversal symmetry in a single second-order superconducting transition requires the existence of two degenerate superconducting order parameters, which is not natural for orthorhombic UTe$_2$. Moreover, experiments under pressure (Braithwaite et. al., Comm. Phys. \bf{2}, 147 (2019), arXiv:1909.06074 [cond-mat.str-el]) suggest that superconductivity sets in at a single transition temperature in a finite parameter window, in contrast to the splitting between the symmetry breaking temperatures expected for accidental degenerate orders. Motivated by these observations, we propose a mechanism for the emergence of time-reversal breaking superconductivity without accidental or symmetry-enforced order parameter degeneracies in systems close to a magnetic phase transition. We demonstrate using Landau theory that a cubic coupling between incipient magnetic order and magnetic moments of Cooper pairs (pair-Kondo coupling) can drive time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductivity that onsets in a single, weakly first order transition over an extended region of the phase diagram. We discuss the experimental signatures of such transition in thermodynamic and resonant ultrasound measurements. A microscopic origin of pair-Kondo coupling is identified as screening of magnetic moments by chiral Cooper pairs, built out of two non-degenerate order parameters - an extension of Kondo screening to unconventional pairs.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial Quantum Geometry and the Strength of Electron-Phonon Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of electrons to phonons (electron-phonon coupling) is crucial for the existence of various phases of matter, in particular superconductivity and density waves. Here, we devise a theory that incorporates the quantum geometry of the electron bands into the electron-phonon coupling, demonstrating the crucial contributions of the Fubini-Study metric or its orbital selective version to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling constant. We apply the theory to two materials, graphene and MgB$_2$ where the geometric contributions account for approximately 50\% and 90\% of the total electron-phonon coupling constant, respectively. The quantum geometric contributions in the two systems are further bounded from below by topological contributions. Our results suggest that the nontrivial electron band geometry/topology might favor superconductivity with relatively high critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Flat-band ratio and quantum metric in the superconductivity of modified Lieb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the band as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter, critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature are calculated within cluster dynamical mean-field theory. We find that while the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are good indicators of superconductivity near zero temperature, at finite temperatures the behavior is more complicated. Our results suggest that the properties of the other bands near the flat band(s) are crucial.</description>

      <title>Superconducting magnetoelectric effects in mesoscopic hybrid structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15553v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, a supercurrent flow can lead to nondissipative magnetoelectric effects. We offer a straightforward formalism to obtain a supercurrent-induced magnetization in superconductors with broken inversion symmetry, which may have orbital, layer, sublattice, or valley degrees of freedom, multiband noncentrosymmetric superconductors. The nondissipative magnetoelectric effect may find applications in fabricating quantum computation platforms or efficient superconducting spintronic devices. We explore how the current-induced magnetization can be employed to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes in a simple hybrid structure.</description>
