      <title>Batch Bayesian optimization of attosecond betatron pulses from laser wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser wakefield acceleration can generate a femtosecond-scale broadband X-ray betatron radiation pulse from electrons accelerated by an intense laser pulse in a plasma. The micrometer-scale of the source makes wakefield betatron radiation well-suited for advanced imaging techniques, including diffraction and phase-contrast imaging. Recent progress in laser technology can expand these capabilities into the attosecond regime, where the practical applications would significantly benefit from the increased energy contained within the pulse. Here we use numerical simulations combined with batch Bayesian optimization to enhance the radiation produced by an attosecond betatron source. The method enables an efficient exploration of a multi-parameter space and identifies a regime in which a plasma density spike triggers the generation of a high-charge electron beam. This results in an improvement of more than one order of magnitude in the on-axis time-averaged power within the central time containing half of the radiated energy, compared to the reference case without the density spike.</description>

      <title>A predictive formula for the H-mode electron separatrix density: Bridging regression and physics-based models across C-Mod, AUG and JET tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron density at the separatrix ($n_{e,\mathrm{sep}}$) plays a central role in balancing energy confinement, detachment achievement, and ELM suppression in tokamaks, thereby influencing core-edge integration. To study what determines this key parameter, a database of H-mode separatrix density measurements from Alcator C-Mod, ASDEX Upgrade, and JET tokamaks has been assembled using a consistent analysis method across all devices. This dataset is used to derive a regression scaling expression based solely on engineering parameters, and the results are compared to predictions from the two-point model. The agreement found is remarkable: both the regression and model provide similar parameter dependencies and tokamak-specific multiplicative constants. Building on this agreement, a fully predictive formula that combines the regression dependencies and the two-point model multiplicative constant is proposed. This formula is able to estimate $n_{e,\mathrm{sep}}$ across the three machines within a factor of 1.5, and provides projections to next-step devices (ITER, SPARC, DTT, JT-60SA and COMPASS-U) that are in agreement with available SOLPS simulations.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Interferometric Measurements of Plasma Density Evolution in Laser-Driven Capacitor-Coil Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-driven capacitor-coil targets provide a compact platform for generating strong magnetic fields and are widely used in magnetized high-energy-density plasma experiments. In addition to magnetic-field generation, these targets also produce plasma in the coil region, which can influence the subject physical processes, interact with secondary targets or external plasmas in their applications. However, direct, time-resolved measurements of the plasma density surrounding the coil remain limited. Here, we report interferometric measurements of the plasma density evolution in laser-driven capacitor-coil targets irradiated by the University of Osaka LFEX laser. Two-dimensional electron density maps reveal two distinct plasma sources loading the coil region: plasma generated in the coil itself and plasma produced by laser ablation of the target plates. These results provide quantitative information on plasma loading and evolution in capacitor-coil targets and are directly relevant to the design and modeling of magnetized high-energy-density plasma experiments.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Power of Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory to Explore the Electronic Structure Under Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in X-ray free-electron laser diagnostics have enabled direct probing of the electronic structure under extreme pressures and temperatures, such as those encountered in stellar interiors and inertial confinement fusion experiments, challenging theoretical models for interpreting experimental data. Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) has been successfully applied to analyze experimental X-ray scattering measurements, but its high computational cost renders routine application impractical. Orbital-free DFT (OFDFT) is a substantially more efficient alternative, with computational cost scaling linearly with system size and a weak temperature dependence, yet it often lacks the accuracy required for electronic structure description. Overcoming this limitation, we present a non-empirical Kohn-Sham-assisted orbital-free density functional framework for calculations at extreme conditions, which enables efficient OFDFT simulations with KSDFT-level accuracy for electron densities, electron-ion structure factors, and equations of state across a broad range of conditions. Benchmark comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo data for dense hydrogen and validation against Rayleigh weight measurements of hot dense beryllium demonstrate the reliability of the framework and speedups of up to several hundred times compared with KSDFT. We further show that even at temperatures on the order of 100 eV, quantum non-locality remains essential for correctly describing the electronic structure of dense hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimisation of Non-linear Breit-Wheeler Pair Production in Simulated Laser Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High laser intensities enable the production of electron-positron pairs from bright gamma rays passing through strong fields. Potentially the most promising approach for all-optical experiments in the near term uses dense but higher divergence electron beams from laser wakefield acceleration to produce gamma rays through inverse Compton scattering. Achieving many-photon collisions between these gamma rays and the high intensity laser pulse in practice is extremely difficult, however, due to significant shot-to-shot jitter in laser pointing and timing.
  We model these practical difficulties using simulated Monte-Carlo experiments. By using a more efficient algorithm for sampling infrequent pair production with particle splitting, we enable the exploration of a multi-dimensional parameter space. Using Gaussian Process Regression we then efficiently find optimal conditions for maximising pair production by changing the laser spot size, the energy in the colliding beam, and the stand-off distance between the laser wakefield accelerator and the focus of the colliding laser pulse. We find that the optimal stand-off distance increases with the degree of laser jitter and that the best conditions for producing electron-positron pairs are not the same as the best conditions for maximising the energy in the gamma rays. With \unit[100]{J} of laser energy, we estimate rates of pair production of around 1 pair per 100 electrons are achievable even with jitter of 10s of microns and 10s of femtoseconds.</description>

      <title>Investigating Solid-Fluid Phase Coexistence in DC Plasma Bilayer Crystals: The Role of Particle Pairing and Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a detailed investigation of solid-fluid phase coexistence in a bilayer dusty plasma crystal subjected to varying confinement ring bias voltages in a DC glow discharge argon plasma. Melamine formaldehyde particles were employed to form a stable, hexagonally ordered bilayer crystal within a confinement ring electrically isolated from the grounded cathode. By systematically adjusting the confinement ring bias, a distinct phase coexistence emerged characterized by a fluid-like melted core surrounded by a solid crystalline periphery. Crucially, analysis of the phonon spectra revealed frequency shifts that deviate significantly from the predictions of classical monolayer Mode-Coupling Instability (MCI) theory. Stability analysis further demonstrated that dynamic interlayer particle pairing and the associated increase in non-reciprocal interaction strength are strongly correlated with the onset of structural destabilization. These findings highlight previously underappreciated mechanisms driving the melting transition in bilayer dusty plasmas, offering a more comprehensive understanding of phase behavior in complex plasma systems. The results underscore the importance of interlayer coupling and confinement effects in tuning structural transitions.</description>

      <title>On Topology of Perturbed Vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. A corollary of this work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices in full three dimensional context.</description>

      <title>Comparing Simulated and Observed Particle Energy Distributions through Magnetic Reconnection in Earth's Magnetotail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive process that accelerates particles to high energies in Earth's magnetosphere, offering a unique natural laboratory to study this phenomenon. This study investigates how well data-driven fully kinetic simulations can reproduce the ion and electron energy distributions observed during a reconnection event by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations initialized with plasma parameters derived from the MMS event and compared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations. Key numerical and physical parameters were systematically varied to assess their influence on the resulting particle spectra. The simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of nonthermal energy distributions for both species, but generally underestimate the very high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical parameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial upstream temperatures instead play a more pronounced role in reproducing the observed distributions.We present a novel analysis of data-driven fully kinetic simulations of MR, showing that key aspects of particle acceleration can be captured, while also highlighting the limitations of 2D simulations and the need for more realistic (e.g., 3D) setups to reproduce the observed particle energization accurately.</description>
