      <title>The Y Dwarf Population with HST: unlocking the secrets of our coolest neighbours -- III. Near-Infrared Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Y dwarfs represent the coldest class of brown dwarfs, with effective temperatures below 500K, and provide unique analogues to cold giant exoplanets. We present a large compilation of uniform near-infrared photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope for 21 Y dwarfs across multiple WFC3/IR filters, including the F105W, F125W and F160W bands. We employed refined PSF-fitting and calibration procedures to reach photometric uncertainties at the 0.02-0.05 mag level for most targets. Combined with precise parallax measurements, our data reveal well-defined Y-dwarf sequences in near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams, observed with a markedly improved tightness. Known photometric trends emerge with minimal scatter, including the continuous redward progression in F125W-F160W with decreasing temperature, and the blueward trend in F105W-F125W with possible hints of a reversal around 350K. Comparisons to the ATMO, Sonora Elf Owl, and Lacy &amp; Burrows atmospheric models highlight systematic discrepancies, in particular F105W-F125W and F105W-F160W colours predicted to be too red. Low-metallicity grids provide the best fits to the global Y-dwarf population, although closer inspection across wavelengths shows that these preferences likely reflect compensating effects in missing or incomplete physics rather than true population-level abundances. While some atmospheric diversity is expected among Y dwarfs, their tight observational sequences and systematic offsets from model predictions reveal that key physical and chemical processes remain inadequately captured in current grids. Our results underscore the importance of high-precision, internally consistent datasets in robustly tracing the Y-dwarf cooling sequence and providing the empirical constraints needed to advance theoretical models at the lowest temperatures.</description>

      <title>Unipolarity of the solar magnetic field in equatorial coronal holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of the unbalanced magnetic polarity distribution of 70 coronal holes was performed. Data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) were used to examine the photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field ($B_{\mathrm{LOS}}$) beneath these coronal holes. The skewness ($S$) values of the $B_{\mathrm{LOS}}$ distributions revealed significant asymmetry, characterized by the dominance of one magnetic polarity, with $\sim88\%$ of the coronal holes exhibiting a skewness value ranging from $\pm(0.20~\text{to}~0.40)$. The corresponding magnetic flux imbalance ($\Phi_{\mathrm{imb}}$) ranges from $20\%$ to $45\%$. In contrast, quiet-Sun regions show symmetric magnetic field distributions with skewness values less than$~0.11$ and flux imbalance less than $11.0\%$. A study of a coronal hole as it traverses across the disk shows that the magnetic field distribution does not evolve significantly over this time, remaining stable across half a solar rotation. A moderate correlation ($r = 0.60$) between the magnetic flux imbalance and the speed of associated high speed solar wind streams ($v_{\mathrm{HSS}}$) suggests that flux imbalance may contribute to the generation of these faster solar wind streams. These results imply that regions with higher flux imbalance ($\Phi_{\mathrm{imb}}$), indicative of more open magnetic field structures, present more favorable conditions for plasma acceleration as compared to closed bi-polar field, but the moderate correlation indicates that other factors may also play important roles.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of starspot structure and differential rotation of Kepler-411</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starspots and their movements on stellar surfaces enable investigating the mechanisms of stellar magnetic activity. Information on the spot distribution and differential rotation provide important constraints for the behaviour of stellar magnetic dynamos. We analyse the Kepler photometry of Kepler-411, a known exoplanet host, to determine the distribution and properties of star spots on the stellar surface with two independent and complementary methods: modelling the photometric effect of rotation of spots on the stellar surface and mapping of spots by transiting planets. By constructing a spot model accounting for geometry, differential rotation and spot evolution, we model the spots of the stellar surface giving rise to the observed brightness variations. We also search for evidence for occultations of starspots in high-cadence photometry. Our spot models reproduce the observed photometric variations well and we are able to obtain information on the distribution and movement of spots on the stellar surface. We do not obtain evidence for differential rotation -- the rotational profile is consistent with rigid-body rotation with a period of 10.52$\pm$0.34 days. We detect three occultations of spots by planet c. The positions of these spots coincide well with the positions of larger spot structures identified by our modelling of the rotational modulation of the light curve.</description>

      <title>Orbital Period Changes of Recurrent Nova T Pyxidis Demonstrate that M_ejecta &gt;&gt; 11.3xM_accreted and Is Not a Type Ia Supernova Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent nova (RN) T Pyxidis (T Pyx) has a complex history of mass accreting-onto and ejection-from the white dwarf, with a classical nova eruption around 1866 kick-starting a RN-phase with six RN eruptions from 1890--2011. T Pyx is a primary progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). This is chiefly a question of whether the mass accreted by the white dwarf ($M_{\rm accreted}$) is more-or-less than the mass ejected by the nova eruptions ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) over the entire eruption cycle. Prior attempts to measure $M_{\rm ejecta}$ from the traditional methods have a scatter of $&gt;$130$\times$, so only a new technique can provide a measure of adequate accuracy and reliability. This new technique is the timing experiment of measuring the orbital period from 1986 to 2025, where the period increased by $+$50.3$\pm$7.9 parts-per-million across the 2011 eruption. With simple and sure physics, the best estimate for the mass ejected by one RN event is $&gt;$2400$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$, with an extreme inviolate limit of $\gg$354$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. Over all eruptions in a cycle, $M_{ejecta}$$&gt;$17120$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$, with an inviolate limit of $M_{ejecta}$$\gg$2144$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. Over the full eruption cycle, the white dwarf accreted 220$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. So M$_{\rm ejecta}$$\gg$11.3$\times$M$_{\rm accreted}$, and T Pyx can never become a SNIa. This paper is the seventh in a series proving that each of various popular candidate SNIa progenitors cannot possibly evolve to a supernova; including V445 Pup, U Sco, T CrB, all symbiotic stars, FQ Cir, V1405 Cas, and now T Pyx.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic He I 1083 nm prominence eruption observations in the middle corona with MLSO/UCoMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a major driver of space weather as they propagate through the heliosphere. Many CMEs have associated prominence material entangled in their magnetic structure which contains cooler plasma. This cooler CME component contains significant amounts of neutral elements, which emit brightly in permitted atomic lines. It has been hypothesized that permitted transitions of neutral elements in eruptions could be used for inferring the magnetic field in CMEs, which is crucial for space weather forecasting. We present observations made with the Upgraded Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (UCoMP) in He I 1083 nm that clearly show the presence of neutral helium in eruptive prominences associated with CMEs as they propagate through the lower and middle corona. We find that solar prominence eruptions can be detected in He I 1083 nm observations up to the edge of the instrument field of view at about 2 solar radii, providing valuable spectral information that complements existing extreme ultraviolet and white-light coronal imaging observatories. These results illustrate the capability of UCoMP to probe the dynamic behavior of prominence eruptions, allowing for their line-of-sight velocity estimation, and potentially improving space weather forecasting by enabling earlier and more accurate identification of Earth-directed eruptions.</description>

      <title>A Deep Precursor-Dip-Main Superoutburst Sequence in VW Hydri Observed with TESS: High-Cadence Constraints on the Thermal-Tidal Instability Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 120s cadence TESS observations of three superoutbursts of the SU UMa-type dwarf nova VW Hydri. Two events (SO2 in Sectors 87+88 and SO3 in Sector 93) exhibit a pronounced, temporally pronounced precursor-dip followed by a rapid rise into the main superoutburst plateau. This morphology, previously seen in Kepler light curves of V1504 Cyg and V344 Lyr, is a key prediction of the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model when a normal (precursor) outburst expands the disk only marginally beyond the 3:1 resonance radius, allowing the tidal instability to grow slowly and produce a deep dip approaching quiescence before rapid amplification drives the main superoutburst. A sliding-window time-frequency analysis reveals superhump power already during the decline and near minimum light, with a smooth period evolution across the dip and stabilization after the system returns to the hot state, consistent with the growth and saturation of disk eccentricity at the 3:1 resonance. From the stabilized Stage A superhump periods, we infer a representative mass ratio $q = 0.131 \pm 0.002$. Combined with either a typical SU UMa white-dwarf mass prior or the semi-empirical donor sequence at an orbital period of 107~min, the implied component masses are $M_1 \simeq 0.6$--$1.0\,M_\odot$ and $M_2 \simeq 0.08$--$0.14\,M_\odot$, ruling out a brown-dwarf donor and establishing VW~Hyi as a benchmark system for testing tidal-instability models in low-$q$ dwarf novae.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of an EXor outburst SPICY 97589</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar outbursts from variable or periodic accretion are thought to be ubiquitous across young stellar populations. However, relatively few outbursting objects have been discovered to date. Here, we present the characterisation of a new EXor-type episodic accretor. We aim to characterise the nature of the 2023 outburst of SPICY 97589/Gaia23bab and characterise the stellar source for the first time, while exploring how an accretion outburst contributes to disk evolution. We employ multi-waveband medium-resolution spectroscopy with UVB-VIS-NIR coverage during the peak of the 2023 outburst and the post-outburst quiescent object. The broad wavelength coverage of the dataset allows for robust measurements of the accretion rate using known line tracers. The addition of quiescent spectra provides a good estimation of stellar parameters of the central star while also informing us on the evolution of the disk during outburst phases. We find the stellar source to be a 3410\,K, M3.0 type star with a luminosity of 0.41 $L_\odot$ and an estimated stellar mass of 0.29 $M_\odot$. We measure the accretion rate of SPICY 97589 to be $\dot M = 2.38\pm0.58\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. This value is at two orders of magnitude greater than the quiescent accretion rate. Thus, we confirm that the 2023 outburst was driven by an influx of material from the surrounding environment to the central star, an accretion outburst. The spectral fingerprint of emission lines is also characteristic of an outbursting EXor-type source, including variable disk winds.</description>

      <title>Estimating Electron Densities in the Middle Solar Corona using White-light and Radio Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron density of the solar corona is a fundamental parameter in many areas of solar physics. Traditionally, routine estimates of coronal density have relied exclusively on white-light observations. However, these density estimates, obtained by inverting the white-light data, require simplifying assumptions, which may affect the robustness of the measurements. Hence, to improve the reliability of coronal density measurements, it is highly desirable to explore other complementary methods. In this study, we estimate the coronal electron densities in the middle corona, between approximately $1.7-3.5R_\odot$, using low-frequency radio observations from the recently commissioned Long Wavelength Array at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO-LWA). The results demonstrate consistency with those derived from white-light coronagraph data and predictions from theoretical models. We also derive a density model valid between 1.7--3.5 $r_\odot$ and is given by $\rho (r')=1.27r'^{-2}+29.02r'^{-4}+71.18r'^{-6}$, where $r'=r/R_\odot$, and $r$ is the heliocentric distance. OVRO-LWA is a solar-dedicated radio interferometer that provides science-ready images with low latency, making it well-suited for generating regular and independent estimates of coronal densities to complement existing white-light techniques.</description>

      <title>Searching for rotational X-ray modulation on TIC 277539431</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TIC 277539431, a fast rotating M7 dwarf, was detected to host the highest latitude flare to date at $81^\circ$. Magnetic activity like stellar flares occurring at high latitude indicate occurrence of coronal loops at these latitudes on fully-convective M dwarfs. In contrast, sunspots usually occur below $30^\circ$. In our study we look for modulation on the X-ray signal occurring due to occultation of coronal loops by the star due to stellar rotation. We report an updated rotation period for this star as $P_{\text{rot}}=273.593$ min based on TESS sectors 12, 37, 39, 64 and 65. We conducted $\chi^2_{\textrm{red}}$ fits by varying the amplitude and the phase of a sinusoidally modulated signal derived from the new rotation period. We find no evidence of rotational modulation in the X-ray signal. This could be due to multiple scenarios, such as lack of a stable coronal loop during observation or the modulated signal being too weak, however given the dataset, individual scenarios cannot be distinguished.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Nested Structure of the Outflow from the Low Luminosity Protostar IRAS 16253-2429 using JWST and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the earliest stage of star and planet formation requires detailed observations to address the connection and interplay between the accretion, outflow, and disk evolution. We present results from observations of the low luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{bol}} \sim 0.2,L_{\odot}$) and low mass ($M_{*} \sim 0.15,M_{\odot}$) Class 0 protostar IRAS~16253$-$2429, conducted as part of the eDisk ALMA Large Program and the JWST Cycle~1 GO program IPA. Observations reveal a wide hourglass-shaped continuum cavity traced in scattered light (at $\leq 5,\mu$m), with a brighter, extended northern side. We detect 15 pure rotational H$2$ transitions ($E{\mathrm{up}} = 1015$--21411~K), revealing a wide-angle molecular outflow. The outflow width traced by H$_2$~0-0~S(11) at the protostellar location measures $\leq 35$~au, slightly larger than the dust and Keplerian disk diameters ($\sim 30$~au) but wider than the 20--23~au jet width in [Fe~II]. The opening angle narrows from 40--35 degrees for the low-$J$ H$_2$ lines (up to S(5)) and the cold gas component traced by ALMA $^{12}$CO to $\sim 28$--19 degrees for the high-$J$ H$_2$ lines (S(7)--S(11)). Position--velocity diagrams of H$2$ reveal higher velocities for higher $E{\mathrm{up}}$, ranging from $\sim 12.5$~km~s$^{-1}$ for H$_2$~0-0~S(1) and S(2) to $\sim 28.5$~km~s$^{-1}$ for H$_2$~0-0~S(5) and S(7) with respect to the mean flow velocity. The nested excitation and velocity structure of the collimated jet and wide-angle wind suggests a magnetohydrodynamic wind as a likely launching mechanism, similar to findings in other protostars and Class~II sources. The lower-velocity millimeter CO emission may be gas from the infalling envelope accelerated outward by the wide-angle wind along the cavity walls.</description>

      <title>A comparison of G-band brightness as a proxy-magnetometer in various magnetic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the diagnostic potential of the G-band at 430.4 nm for probing small-scale magnetic fields in the solar photosphere. Combining three-dimensional MHD simulations from the MURaM code and spectral synthesis via the RH 1.5D code, we evaluate the intensity contrast in the G-band filtergrams by comparing the filter centered at 430.4 nm in comparison to the conventional 430.5 nm. Our results show that filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm provide higher contrast across varying magnetic environments, particularly at narrow filter widths. This enhancement arises from its slightly higher formation height and greater sensitivity to temperature variations in magnetized regions. These findings indicate that G-band filtergrams centered at 430.4 nm show enhanced diagnostic potential under the assumptions of the present modeling. The obtained results are also relevant and suggest potential applications in stellar contexts, where molecular bands are often used as proxies for magnetic activity.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Study of the Physical and Orbital Characteristics, and Eclipse Timing Variations of the Post Common Envelope Binary DD CrB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of the eclipsing binary DD CrB, composed of a B-type subdwarf primary and an M-type main-sequence secondary, with the main goal of investigating its eclipse timing variations (ETVs). Our new multi-color photometric observations, radial velocity measurements, and precise eclipse timings from TESS allow us to constrain the system parameters. The Romer delay between primary and secondary minima yields a mass ratio of $q = 0.299 \pm 0.009$, enabling robust simultaneous modeling of the light and radial velocity curves with {\sc phoebe} 2.17. By fixing the albedo of the secondary to its maximum physically plausible value (A$_2 = 1.0$), despite the degeneracy between albedo, surface temperature, and radius, we obtained a satisfactory fit, resulting in a significantly lower temperature ($T_2 \sim 2360$ K) and a radius ($R_2 \sim 0.16$ R$_\odot$) in agreement with literature values. Using the total mass of the components and the orbital size derived from this modeling, we interpret the ETVs and find them best explained by a Jupiter-mass tertiary companion on a $\sim13$-year orbit in all competing models, while the eccentric (e $\sim0.46$) models perform better in terms of fit statistics.</description>

      <title>Chromospheric Flashes in a Solar Pore: Insights from Multi-line Spectropolarimetric Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar pores are strongly magnetized regions lacking a photospheric penumbra and characterized by predominantly vertical magnetic fields. We present a multi-line study of flashes in a solar pore using high-resolution observations from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope in Fe~\textsc{i}~6302~\AA, Ca~\textsc{ii}~8542~\AA\ and K, and H-$\beta$, complemented by (E)UV data from \textit{IRIS} and \textit{SDO}/AIA. Bisector analysis and spectral inversions with \textsc{SIR} and \textsc{NICOLE} were used to infer stratifications of temperature, line-of-sight velocity, and magnetic field. Flashes, confined to one half of the pore, exhibit cooler photospheric temperatures ($\Delta T \approx 400$~K), stronger magnetic fields ($\Delta B \approx 250$~G), larger inclinations ($\sim25^{\circ}$ versus $\sim18^{\circ}$), and persistent upflows ($\sim0.5$~km~s$^{-1}$) compared to the quiescent pore. They are co-spatial with enhanced 3- and 5-minute power in the photosphere, while only 3-minute power persists in the chromosphere. Flashes are detected down to $\sim50\%$ line depth in Ca~\textsc{ii}~8542~\AA\ intensity and show central chromospheric upflows ($\sim1$~km~s$^{-1}$) flanked by strong downflows ($\sim8$~km~s$^{-1}$). Temperature enhancements reach $\sim500$~K at $\log\tau \approx -5$ and $\sim2500$~K at $\log\tau \approx -6$, with a bimodal velocity distribution. Flashes correspond one-to-one with radially outward running waves near the pore boundary (5--15~km~s$^{-1}$). Strong Ca~\textsc{ii} core emission, occasional Stokes~$V$ reversals, and H-$\beta$ enhancements indicate that pore flashes are confined to the lower and mid-chromosphere, with little influence on higher atmospheric layers.</description>

      <title>Gaia white dwarfs with infrared excess I. The 100 pc catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of infrared excess flux observed in white dwarfs (WDs) is related to the existence of debris disks or substellar companions. These systems provide important clues in the study of extrasolar planetary material and binary evolution. However, fully characterising their properties requires a statistically significant, complete sample. This work aims to identify a complete sample of WDs with infrared excess emission within 100 pc of the Sun. We built the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the WDs using synthetic photometry in 56 optical filters of the J-PAS system, generated from Gaia Data Release 3 low-resolution spectra and complemented with the latest infrared photometry available at the Virtual Observatory (VO). VOSA was used to fit the SEDs with different atmospheric WD models depending on the source spectral type. We visually checked optical and infrared images to identify contaminated photometry. We built a catalogue of 456 infrared excess WDs, of which 292 are robust identifications, and 164 are candidates. 351 ($\sim$75%) are new identifications. This implies a fraction of infrared excess WDs between 5.9$\pm$0.3% and 9.2$\pm$0.4%, higher than previous works, but in agreement with some more recent estimates. Furthermore, for the sample of infrared excess WDs, the fraction of sources with non-hydrogen atmosphere increases with the Gaia GBP-GRP colour, contrary to the general WD population. However, this result should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, a thorough comparison of our catalogue with those of previous studies was performed. The sample of WDs with infrared excess emission within 100 pc presented in this work is the largest, most complete and reliable to date. Due to their proximity, they are ideal targets for follow-up studies aimed at characterising circumstellar disks, substellar companions, and the composition of accreted planetary material.</description>

      <title>Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae. IV. Type Ia supernovae: Na I D line strength relating to external material and intrinsic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear runaways in certain white dwarfs in binary systems. They have been extensively studied, yet their progenitor and explosion mechanisms remain poorly understood. We study a large sample of SNe Ia comparing the narrow interstellar absorption features in their spectra with various photometric and spectroscopic supernova properties, as well as with environmental characteristics. We find that the sodium absorption is significantly stronger in younger, more star-forming and more centrally located SNe Ia, as expected. However, we also show that there is a strong dependence on intrinsic properties that is independent of the environment. In fact, we find strong evidence for two environmental SN Ia populations, an old and a young one, with the young population showing significantly different distributions of sodium strength when divided according to the Si II ejecta velocity, nebular velocity, extinction, E(B-V), and reddening curve, RV. Performing a clustering of the SNe Ia, we recover an old population of SNe with low extinction and normal ejecta velocity, while we confirm that the young population can be subdivided into a group of highly-extincted, high-velocity SNe Ia with much stronger blueshifted sodium absorption, and another of low-extincted, normal-velocity objects with little sodium absorption. We interpret this relation of intervening material with intrinsic properties as evidence for the young SN Ia population, occurring in young and star-forming environments, to have asymmetric radiation that interacts with nearby material, and whose observables depend thus on the viewing angle. Finally, we show that the cosmological mass-step is consistent with these populations.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A from 2013--2020 Deep [Fe II]+[Si I] Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of supernova remnant Cassiopeia A based on two deep, narrow-band images covering the [Fe II] 1.644um + [Si I] 1.645um lines obtained in 2013 and 2020 with the same instruments on the UKIRT 3.8m telescope. The identical setup and observing procedure allow for direct, accurate measurements of morphological and kinematic changes over a seven-year baseline. We identified 263 compact knots in the 2020 image and, through comparison with the 2013 catalog of Koo et al. 2018 (arXiv:1809.07935), classified them into quasi-stationary circumstellar knots and fast-moving knots (FMKs) of supernova ejecta. The FMKs show significant flux fluctuations, and many of those detected in 2013 are absent in the 2020 image. Proper-motion measurements derived from cross-correlation analysis indicate that most FMKs follow nearly ballistic expansion, whereas some, particularly those just beyond the eastern Fe-rich, X-ray emitting ejecta region, exhibit noticeable deceleration. The proper motions of the main ejecta shell were also measured and modeled as a uniformly expanding shell with a systemic motion, which reproduces the observed geometric and kinematic asymmetries of the remnant.</description>

      <title>The compositions of the HR 8799 planets reflect accretion of both solids and metal-enriched gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With four giant planets ($m\sim5-10~M_{\rm Jup}$, $T_\rm{eff}\sim900-1200$ K) orbiting between 15-70 au, HR 8799 provides an unparalleled testbed for studying giant planet formation and probing compositional trends across the protoplanetary disk. We present new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations ($2.85-5.3~\mu$m, $R\approx2700$) that now include the spectrum of HR 8799 b, and higher S/N spectra for HR 8799 c, d, and e compared to that in Ruffio &amp; Xuan et al. 2026. We detect CO, CH$_4$, H$_2$O, H$_2$S, CO$_2$, and for planet b, NH$_3$. We combine the NIRSpec spectra with $1-5 \mu$m photometry to perform atmospheric retrievals that account for disequilibrium chemistry and clouds, and allow C/H, O/H, N/H, and S/H to scale independently. While the four planets are similarly enriched in carbon and oxygen, with C/H and O/H between $3-5\times$ stellar, we observe a tentative trend of increasing S/H - a tracer of refractory solids - from $2-5 \times$ stellar with increasing orbital distance. From HR 8799 b's NH$_3$ abundance, we estimate $\rm N/H=21.2^{+16.2}_{-8.8}\times$ stellar, suggesting the outer planet accreted significant amounts of N-rich gas. Overall, the elemental abundance patterns we observe are consistent with a picture where planet b formed between the CO snowline and the more-distant N$_2$ snowline, while the inner planets accreted $3 \times$ stellar CO-enriched disk gas within the CO snowline. The excess volatile mass from pebble drift and evaporation implies an integrated pebble flux of $750 \pm 200~M_{\oplus}$. The increase in the planets' S/H with orbital distance implies more solid accretion further out, which is quantitatively compatible with expectations from both pebble and planetesimal accretion ($2 \times$ Minimum Mass Solar Nebula) paradigms.</description>

      <title>Three-Body Barrier Dynamics of Double-Alpha Decay in Heavy Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simultaneous emission of two $\alpha$ particles--double-$\alpha$ decay--represents a long-predicted but unobserved mode of nuclear radioactivity. Here we formulate this process as a genuine three-body problem within the hyperspherical coordinate framework and evaluate decay probabilities by numerically solving the corresponding hyperradial Schr\"{o}dinger equation, combined with large-scale random sampling of the potential parameters; the latter treatment ensures that the present results are more convincing. Inspired by this, we demonstrate that the penetrability ratio between simultaneous and sequential $\alpha$ emission exhibits a strikingly linear dependence on $ZQ_{\alpha\alpha}^{-1/2}$, extending the barrier penetration dynamics into the correlated few-body regime. The nuclei $^{108}$Xe, $^{218}$Ra, $^{224}$Pu, $^{222}$U, $^{216}$Rn, and $^{220}$Th are suggested as the most promising candidates for the observation of double-$\alpha$ decay, with predicted half-lives potentially accessible within present detection limits. Our results provide a unified framework for multi-$\alpha$ decay and open a pathway to probing nuclear clustering and few-body correlations in heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Herschel/HIFI Observations of Molecular Lines Toward G10.47+0.03</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spectral line analysis of the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 (hereafter, G10). Our aim is to determine molecular abundances and excitation conditions across a wide spectral range inaccessible to ground-based observatories. We utilize archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory, obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI). We report here the detection of high-excitation CO, 13CO, and C18O, H2O isotopologues, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CS, C34S, SO, SO2, H2CS, and CH3OH. CO, p-H2O, CS, and HCN show similar velocity profiles with a narrow, blueshifted component, which may be linked to the outer outflow layer. Redshifted wings may indicate inner outflow activity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework is employed to infer column densities and temperatures accurately. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the global physical parameters of G10, providing essential context for interpreting the molecular emission. The MCMC analysis revealed two excitation temperature components: a warm component (30-65 K) and a hot component (90-250 K). The higher temperatures indicate dense, hot gas typical of massive hot cores. The lower temperatures correspond to the warm, less dense envelope around the core. Transitions of H2O, high-excitation CO, and HCN indicate outflowing gas and high-density shocked regions. These findings highlight G10's complex dynamical environment.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependence of Subsurface Solar Convection Using the Time-Distance Deep-Focus Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-examine the deep-focus methodology of time-distance helioseismology previously used to estimate the power spectrum of the solar convection at a depth of about 30 Mm, which was found to be significantly weaker than predicted by theory and simulations. The Global Acoustic, Linearized Euler (GALE) and Eulerian Lagrangian (EULAG) codes are used to generate ground-truth simulations to evaluate the accuracy of the inferred convective power spectrum. This validation process shows that the power spectrum derived using the time-distance methodology diverges significantly from ground truth beyond spatial scales corresponding to the spherical harmonic degree $\ell=15$--$30$ because of the limited resolution of helioseismic measurements at that depth. However, the power estimated at larger spatial scales ($\ell&lt;15$) is sufficiently accurate. We then apply the methodology to solar data selected from throughout Solar Cycle 24 and find some evidence that the magnitude of the convective power changes throughout the Cycle. An average of the convective power across the Solar Cycle reveals a spectrum that is qualitatively similar to previous estimates, though about half an order of magnitude greater. The disagreement between observations of solar convection and the magnitudes predicted by simulations persists.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a Long-Lived Deep-Seated Main-Sequence Magnetic Field During White Dwarf Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of white dwarf (WD) magnetic fields that originate from core-convective dynamos during the main-sequence. Using stellar evolution and WD cooling models combined with magnetic field diffusion calculations, we demonstrate that a surviving field from the main-sequence can account for various features observed in magnetic WDs. In particular, the earlier emergence of stronger magnetic fields in more massive WDs, compared to older, less massive, and less magnetic ones, can be explained by this framework. This is because the magnetic boundary at the onset of WD cooling lies deeper in less massive WDs, resulting in a slower and weaker evolution of the surface magnetic field due to increasing electrical conductivity over time. We further show that many of the magnetic field strengths observed across different WD samples can be reproduced if the deep-seated field generated during the main sequence is comparable to predictions from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of core-convective dynamos, or if equipartition provides a valid scaling for the main-sequence dynamo. Additionally, our predictions for surface magnetic fields vary by a factor of 2 to 4 when higher-order modes of poloidal magnetic field expansion and turbulent diffusion driven by crystallization-induced convection are included. These effects should therefore be considered when investigating the origin of magnetic fields in individual WDs.</description>

      <title>FQ Circini: An Ordinary Nova with a High-mass B1 V(n)(e) Companion Whose Decretion Disk Transfers Mass to the White Dwarf via Roche-Lobe Overflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FQ Cir was an ordinary fast He/N classical nova, peaking at $V$=10.9. The pre-eruption and post-eruption counterpart was at $V$=14.0, making the smallest known classical nova amplitude of 3.1 mag. The nova light and the counterpart coincide to 0.034 arc-seconds, and the counterpart is a rare hot/blue emission-line star with flickering, so the identification of the quiescent nova is certain. The counterpart is a weak Be main sequence star, B1 V(n)(e). A coherent photometric period appears in all four {\it TESS} Sectors and in the AAVSO post-eruption light curve, as ellipsoidal modulation with orbital period 2.041738 days. The companion must have been spun-up to a fast rotation, and like all Be stars, a decretion disk is exuded. With the constraints of the blackbody radius and the main sequence, the companion mass is 13.0$^{+0.2}_{-0.5}$ $M_{\odot}$, with radius 6.2$\pm$0.2 $R_{\odot}$. This is the discovery of a cataclysmic variable with a high-mass companion, a new class that we call `High Mass Cataclysmic Variables'. The white dwarf mass is 1.25$\pm$0.10 $M_{\odot}$ and must have an accretion disk that supplies fuel for the nova eruption. FQ Cir represents a new mode of accretion in interacting binaries, with Roche lobe overflow from the decretion disk feeding mass into the usual accretion disk around the white dwarf, for disk-to-disk accretion. From the mass budget of the binary, the primary star must have its initial mass $&gt;$7.6 $M_{\odot}$, forming an ONe white dwarf, so FQ Cir can never become a Type Ia supernova.</description>

      <title>Hidden in Plain Sight II: Characterizing the luminous companion to Kappa Velorum with VLTI/GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kappa Velorum (Markeb, HD 81188) is one of the brightest stars in the Southern sky and has long been known to be a single-lined spectroscopic binary. The binary mass function is large, $f(M)=1.15\ M_\odot$, suggesting that the bright (V=2.5) B2IV star may host a dark, compact object companion. We use VLTI GRAVITY observations to definitively test this possibility by directly resolving the binary. We detect a main sequence B star companion and rule out the compact object scenario. By combining the relative astrometric orbit and archival radial velocities, we report an updated precise characterization of the orbit (period $P=116.795\pm0.002$ d, eccentricity $e=0.1764\pm0.0004$, inclination $i=74.04\pm0.01^{\circ}$) and estimate the masses of the B stars. Using the original Hipparcos parallax measurement $\varpi = 6.05\pm0.48$ mas, we find $M_1 = 10^{+4}_{-2}\ M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 6.9\pm1.0\ M_\odot$. The uncertainties on the masses are primarily driven by the uncertain parallax, which we find is likely biased by the orbital motion. We use an archival UVES spectrum and MIST evolutionary tracks to refine our mass estimates. Finally, we discuss how interferometry and high-contrast imaging may be used to characterize other candidate star+compact object binaries, including those that will be discovered with Gaia DR4, as part of a larger effort to uncover the hidden population of black holes in the Milky Way.</description>

Abstract: We utilize multi-epoch line-of-sight velocity measurements from the Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument to estimate the binary fraction for member stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor. Our dataset comprises 670 distinct member stars, with a total of more than 2,000 observations collected over approximately one year. We constrain the binary fraction for UMi to be $0.61^{+0.16}_{-0.20}$ and $0.69^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$, with the binary orbital parameter distributions based on solar neighborhood observation from Duquennoy &amp; Mayor (1991) and Moe &amp; Di Stefano (2017), respectively. Furthermore, by dividing our data into two subsamples at the median metallicity, we identify that the binary fraction for the metal-rich ([Fe/H]&gt;-2.14) population is slightly higher than that of the metal-poor ([Fe/H]&lt;-2.14) population. Based on the Moe &amp; Di Stefano model, the best-constrained binary fractions for metal-rich and metal-poor populations in UMi are $0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.24}$ and $0.48^{+0.26}_{-0.19}$, respectively. After a thorough examination, we find that this offset cannot be attributed to sample selection effects. We also divide our data into two subsamples according to their projected radius to the center of UMi, and find that the more centrally concentrated population in a denser environment has a lower binary fraction of $0.33^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$, compared with $1.00^{+0.00}_{-0.32}$ for the subsample in more outskirts.</description>

      <title>A multiwavelength ALMA view of gas and dust in binary protoplanetary system AS 205: Evidence of dust asymmetric distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations of multi-wavelength dust emissions at 3.1 and 1.3 mm; along with molecular line emissions of CO(2-1), CO(3-2), $^{13}$CO(3-2), and C$^{18}$O(3-2) at spatial resolutions of 7-45 AU towards the protoplanetary system AS 205. The dust emissions exhibit two distinct components of AS 205 N and AS 205 S, separated by 1.3 arcsec. While gas kinematics within the dust disk regions are dominated by Keplerian rotation, the more extended gas emission displays complex morphology and kinematics strongly affected by the binary gravitational interaction in the outer regions. The stellar masses of AS 205 N and AS 205 S are estimated at $0.78\pm0.19$ and $1.93\pm0.86$ M$_\odot$, respectively. Azimuthal variation is observed in the spectral index distribution of both disks. In AS 205 N, the spectral index minimum in the southwest is coincident with the peaks of CO($2-1$), CO($3-2$), and $^{13}$CO($3-2$) integrated intensity and the relative position of its southern counterpart. On the other hand, the spectral index distribution in AS 205 S exhibits two prominent maxima, with the one in the northeast aligning with the peak of $^{13}$CO($3-2$), and the peak in the south coinciding with local maxima in CO($2-1$) and CO($3-2$) azimuthal profiles. These results suggest a correlation between dust grain size and/or optical depth with the gas distributions. Dust trapping along the spiral arms possibly contributes to the spectral index minima in AS 205 N; however, the observed asymmetry across both disks suggests the involvement of additional mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The Tarantula massive binary monitoring VII. The nature of the eccentric O+BH binary candidate VFTS 812</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive O-type stars ($M\gtrsim15\,M_\odot$) with an X-ray quiet black hole (BH) companion represent a crucial stage in massive binary evolution leading to binary BH mergers. The population of such binaries remains elusive, with $\lesssim5$ candidate or confirmed systems. The Tarantula nebula harbors thousands of massive stars, 2-3 % of which are expected to have BH companions. It is therefore an ideal place to hunt for such systems. Here we analyse 30 epochs of VLT/FLAMES IFU high-resolution observations of the H$\delta$ region, as well as archival FLAMES spectroscopy, of VFTS 812, a 17-day single-lined spectroscopic binary with an O4V primary and a minimum secondary mass of $5.1\,M_\odot$. Following careful removal of the nebular contamination, spectral disentangling on the new data did not reveal any signature of the hidden companion. We derive $T_\mathrm{eff}=49^{+3}_{-4}$ kK, $\log L/L_\odot=5.7\pm0.1$ and $v_\mathrm{rot,max}{\rm \,sin\,}i=110^{+25}_{-35}$ km/s for the O4V component, yielding a (single star) evolutionary mass of $53^{+6}_{-5}$ $M_\odot$ and an age in the range of 0-1.6 Myr. Using injection tests of various luminous artificial companions in our data, we exhaustively rule out the presence of any luminous signature from a main sequence star more massive than $6\,M_\odot$. We discuss the possible nature of the companion, suggesting that the rejuvenated O star + BH companion is the most suitable scenario to consistently explain the location, (rejuvenated) young age, eccentricity and lack of companion signature. While this establishes VFTS 812 as a strong candidate O+BH system, follow-up observations are deemed necessary for robust confirmation and to search for accretion signatures on the O4V star.</description>

      <title>Long Period Transients (LPTs): a comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long Period Transients (LPTs) are a recently identified class of sources characterized by periodic radio bursts lasting seconds to minutes, with flux densities that might reach several tens of Jy. These radio bursts repeat with periodicity from minutes to hours, and they exhibit strong polarization and transient activity periods. To date, about 12 such sources have been identified, which might encompass the same or different physical scenarios. Proposed explanations include binary systems with a white dwarf and a low-mass star companion, slow-spinning magnetars, highly magnetized isolated white dwarfs, and other exotic objects. In a few cases the optical counterpart indeed points toward a white dwarf with a low-mass companion, while in other cases, transient X-ray emission was detected, very common in magnetars. However, despite being able to reproduce partially some of the characteristics of LPTs, all the proposed scenarios find difficulty in explaining the exact physical origin of their bright, highly polarized and periodic radio emission. We review here the state-of-the-art in the observations and interpretation of this puzzling class of radio transients.</description>
