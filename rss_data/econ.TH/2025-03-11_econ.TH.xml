      <title>Paying and Persuading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the joint design of information and transfers when an informed Sender can motivate Receiver by both paying and (Bayesian) persuading. We introduce an augmented concavification method to characterize Sender's value from jointly designing information and transfers. We use this characterization to show Sender strictly benefits from combining information and payments whenever the actions induced at adjacent kinks in the augmented concavification differ from those in the information-only concavification. When Receiver has an outside option, Sender always first increases the informativeness of their experiment before adjusting transfers - payments change if and only if full revelation does not meet Receiver's outside option constraint. Moreover, we show repeated interactions cannot restore ex-post efficiency, even with transfers and arbitrarily patient agents. However, Sender benefits from linking incentives so long as Receiver prefers the stage-game optimal information structure to no information. Our results have implications for platforms such as Uber, where both monetary rewards and strategic information disclosure influence driver behavior.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Marketplace Operator in Inducing Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady rise of e-commerce marketplaces underscores the need to study a market structure that captures the key features of this setting. To this end, we consider a price-quantity Stackelberg duopoly in which the leader is the marketplace operator and the follower is an independent seller. The objective of the marketplace operator is to maximize a weighted sum of profit and a term capturing positive customer experience, whereas the independent seller solely seeks to maximize their own profit. Furthermore, the independent seller is required to share a fraction of their revenue with the marketplace operator for the privilege of selling on the platform. We derive the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium of this game and find that the equilibrium strategies depend on the assumed rationing rule. We then consider practical implications for marketplace operators. Finally, we show that, under intensity rationing, consumer surplus and total welfare in the duopoly marketplace is always at least as high as under an independent seller monopoly, demonstrating that it is socially beneficial for the operator to join the market as a seller.</description>

      <title>Market-based Architectures in RL and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Market-based agents refer to reinforcement learning agents which determine their actions based on an internal market of sub-agents. We introduce a new type of market-based algorithm where the state itself is factored into several axes called ``goods'', which allows for greater specialization and parallelism than existing market-based RL algorithms. Furthermore, we argue that market-based algorithms have the potential to address many current challenges in AI, such as search, dynamic scaling and complete feedback, and demonstrate that they may be seen to generalize neural networks; finally, we list some novel ways that market algorithms may be applied in conjunction with Large Language Models for immediate practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Recovery from Manipulated Signals, with Applications to Decentralized Physical Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first formal model capturing the elicitation of unverifiable information from a party (the "source") with implicit signals derived by other players (the "observers"). Our model is motivated in part by applications in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (a.k.a. "DePIN"), an emerging application domain in which physical services (e.g., sensor information, bandwidth, or energy) are provided at least in part by untrusted and self-interested parties. A key challenge in these signal network applications is verifying the level of service that was actually provided by network participants.
  We first establish a condition called source identifiability, which we show is necessary for the existence of a mechanism for which truthful signal reporting is a strict equilibrium. For a converse, we build on techniques from peer prediction to show that in every signal network that satisfies the source identifiability condition, there is in fact a strictly truthful mechanism, where truthful signal reporting gives strictly higher total expected payoff than any less informative equilibrium. We furthermore show that this truthful equilibrium is in fact the unique equilibrium of the mechanism if there is positive probability that any one observer is unconditionally honest (e.g., if an observer were run by the network owner). Also, by extending our condition to coalitions, we show that there are generally no collusion-resistant mechanisms in the settings that we consider.
  We apply our framework and results to two DePIN applications: proving location, and proving bandwidth. In the location-proving setting observers learn (potentially enlarged) Euclidean distances to the source. Here, our condition has an appealing geometric interpretation, implying that the source's location can be truthfully elicited if and only if it is guaranteed to lie inside the convex hull of the observers.</description>

      <title>Screening with Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a nonlinear pricing model where the seller controls both product pricing (screening) and buyer information about their own values (persuasion). We prove that the optimal mechanism always consists of finitely many signals and items, even with a continuum of buyer values. The seller optimally pools buyer values and reduces product variety to minimize informational rents. We show that value pooling is optimal even for finite value distributions if their entropy exceeds a critical threshold. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the optimal menu restricts offering to a single item.</description>

      <title>Global Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives, State-Salient Decision Rules and the Strict Condorcet Choice Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple proof of a well-known axiomatic characterization of state-salient decision rules, using Weak Dominance Criterion and Global Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives. Subsequently we provide a simple axiomatic characterization of the Strict-Condorcet choice function on the domain of all preference profiles that have a strict-Condorcet winner, assuming that if the first two ranks are occupied by the same two alternatives in all states of nature, then the chosen alternative will be the one from these two that is preferred to the other with probability greater than half-provided such an alternative exists. We also show that this result is not valid if we extend the domain to the set of all preference profiles that have a unique weak-Condorcet winner.</description>

      <title>Exclusion Zones of Instant Runoff Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research on instant runoff voting (IRV) shows that it exhibits a striking combinatorial property in one-dimensional preference spaces: there is an "exclusion zone" around the median voter such that if a candidate from the exclusion zone is on the ballot, then the winner must come from the exclusion zone. Thus, in one dimension, IRV cannot elect an extreme candidate as long as a sufficiently moderate candidate is running. In this work, we examine the mathematical structure of exclusion zones as a broad phenomenon in more general preference spaces. We prove that with voters uniformly distributed over any $d$-dimensional hyperrectangle (for $d &gt; 1$), IRV has no nontrivial exclusion zone. However, we also show that IRV exclusion zones are not solely a one-dimensional phenomenon. For irregular higher-dimensional preference spaces with fewer symmetries than hyperrectangles, IRV can exhibit nontrivial exclusion zones. As a further exploration, we study IRV exclusion zones in graph voting, where nodes represent voters who prefer candidates closer to them in the graph. Here, we show that IRV exclusion zones present a surprising computational challenge: even checking whether a given set of positions is an IRV exclusion zone is NP-hard. We develop an efficient randomized approximation algorithm for checking and finding exclusion zones. We also report on computational experiments with exclusion zones in two directions: (i) applying our approximation algorithm to a collection of real-world school friendship networks, we find that about 60% of these networks have probable nontrivial IRV exclusion zones; and (ii) performing an exhaustive computer search of small graphs and trees, we also find nontrivial IRV exclusion zones in most graphs. While our focus is on IRV, the properties of exclusion zones we establish provide a novel method for analyzing voting systems in metric spaces more generally.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic and Linear Model of Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of infinite horizon linear dynamic optimization and obtain results concerning existence of solution and satisfaction of the Euler condition and transversality condition being unconditionally sufficient for optimality of a trajectory. We show that the optimal value function is concave and continuous and the optimal trajectory satisfies the functional equation of dynamic programming. Linearity bites when it comes to the definition of optimal decision rules which can no longer be guaranteed to be single-valued. We show that the optimal decision rule is an upper semi-continuous correspondence. For linear cake-eating problems, we obtain monotonicity results for the optimal value function and a conditional monotonicity result for optimal decision rules. We also introduce the concept of a two-phase linear cake eating problem and obtain a necessary condition that must be satisfied by all solutions of such problems.</description>
