      <title>Resolution Limiting Factors in Low-Energy Cascade Zenith Reconstruction with the IceCube Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory includes low energy extensions such as the existing DeepCore subarray and the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, which will consist of seven new strings of photosensors with denser instrumentation than the existing array. The setup will allow for the study of neutrino oscillations with greater sensitivity compared to the existing instrumentation, improve neutrino mass ordering studies, and test for the unitarity of the PMNS mixing matrix with high precision. A critical component in these low-energy physics analyses is the accurate reconstruction of event information, particularly the zenith angle of incoming neutrinos. In this study, we discuss the processes that limit the zenith resolution, which include the transverse spread of the hadronic shower, in-ice photon scattering, module resolutions, and module noise. By considering approximations to these processes, we aim to approach the intrinsic zenith resolution limits for purely hadronic events.</description>

      <title>Novel Silicon and GaAs Sensors for Compact Sampling Calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two samples of silicon pad sensors and two samples of GaAs sensors are studied in an electron beam with 5 GeV energy from the DESY-II test-beam facility. The sizes of the silicon and GaAs sensors are about 9$\times$9 cm$^2$ and 5$\times$8 cm$^2$, respectively. The thickness is 500 micrometer for both the silicon and GaAs sensors. The pad size is about 5$\times$5 mm$^2$. The sensors are foreseen to be used in a compact electromagnetic sampling calorimeter. The readout of the pads is done by metal traces connected to the pads and the front-end ASICs at the edges of the sensors. For the silicon sensors, copper traces on a Kapton foil are connected to the sensor pads with conducting glue. The pads of the GaAs sensors are connected to bond-pads via aluminium traces on the sensor substrate. The readout is based on a dedicated front-end ASIC, called FLAME. Pre-processing of the raw data and deconvolution is performed with FPGAs. The whole system is orchestrated by a Trigger Logic Unit. Results are shown for the signal-to-noise ratio, the homogeneity of the response, edge effects on pads, and for signals due to the readout traces.</description>

      <title>Soft Error Rate in Space: A Unified Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new physics-based model for analytical calculation of Soft Error Rate (SER) in digital memory circuits under the influence of heavy ions in space orbits is proposed. This method is based on parameters that are uniquely determined from the results of ground tests under nor-mal ion incidence. It is shown that preliminary averaging over the total solid angle within the standard inverse cosine model allows one to take into account the effect of isotropic flow, which increases the effective SER. The model includes the ability to estimate the contribution to SER of the low LET spectrum region, which is very important for modern ICs with low Single Event Upset tolerance.</description>

      <title>Towards An Updated Simulation of the Booster Neutrino Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise, accurate neutrino flux predictions for neutrino beam experiments are crucial for physics results. Flux predictions for the Booster Neutrino Beam at Fermilab were first published in 2009 by the MiniBooNE collaboration. It is no longer possible to run the simulation used to create these predictions due to outdated software versions. In this exciting period for the Short-Baseline Neutrino Program at Fermilab, with both the far detector (ICARUS) and the near detector (SBND) operating, an updated flux model for the BNB is necessary. For the purpose of using a dynamic, up-to-date beam model, the SBN program has created a new simulation named G4BNB. This framework contains new features, such as a full neutrino ancestry to handle hadron production systematics with more precision, and the inclusion of neutral mesons from the proton-beryllium scatter to allow the study of exotic BSM scenarios.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency, high-count-rate 2D superconducting nanowire single-photon detector array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are the current leading technology for the detection of single-photons in the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions, due to record performance in terms of detection efficiency, low dark count rate, minimal timing jitter, and high maximum count rates. The various geometry and design parameters of SNSPDs are often carefully tailored to specific applications, resulting in challenges in optimising each performance characteristic without adversely impacting others. In particular, when scaling to larger array formats, the key challenge is to manage the heat load generated by the many readout cables in the cryogenic cooling system. Here we demonstrate a practical, self-contained 64-pixel SNSPD array system which exhibits high performance of all operational parameters, for use in the strategically important SWIR spectral region. The detector is an 8x8 array of 27.5 x 27.8 {\mu}m pixels on a 30 {\mu}m pitch, which leads to an 80 -- 85% fill factor. At a wavelength of 1550nm, a uniform average per-pixel photon detection efficiency of 77.7% was measured and the observed system detection efficiency (SDE) across the entire array was 65%. A full performance characterisation is presented, including a dark count rate of 20 cps per pixel, full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) jitter of 100 ps per pixel, a 3-dB maximum count rate of 645 Mcps and no evidence of crosstalk at the 0.1% level. This camera system therefore facilitates a variety of picosecond time-resolved measurement-based applications that include biomedical imaging, quantum communications, and long-range single-photon light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and 3D imaging.</description>

      <title>Efficient cosmic ray generator for particle detector simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional cosmic ray simulations make use of the Montecarlo method in a very naive way to randomise energy and direction for each simulated particle. The flux of cosmic rays is modelled as a rain coming from a plane above the object of interest (detectors in particle physics applications, planes in dosimetry studies, etc.) with an experimental angular and energy distributions. This strategy is very inefficient because many of the particles never touch the detector. Here a refined way of implementing the Montecarlo method is proposed in order to generate a sample of events that hit the target volume whose angular distribution coincides with the one from the naive implementation. It is based on the projection of a sphere containing the target volume onto a plane tangent to it with a fixed angle, we call it the secant method. This configuration allows to compute the probability of a cosmic particle hitting the sphere with this incoming angle as proportional to the area of the corresponding section of a cylinder. The performance of this method is faster in terms of computing time and identical physical results are achieved. It has been implemented in REST-for-Physics framework and it is tested with the geometry of a real detector, the IAXO-D0 Micromegas X-ray detector for the future axion helioscope BabyIAXO. Our method is 37 times more efficient than the traditional Montecarlo schema for the same accuracy, being more useful when the target volume departs from spherical shape</description>

      <title>Estimation of the FR4 Microwave Dielectric Properties at Cryogenic Temperature for Quantum-Chip-Interface PCBs Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ad-hoc interface PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) are today the standard connection between cryogenic cabling and quantum chips. Besides low-loss and low-temperature-dependent-dielectric-permittivity materials, Flame Resistance n.4 (FR4) provides a low-cost solution for fabrication of cryogenic PCBs. Here, we report on an effective way to evaluate the dielectric performance of a FR4 laminate used as substrate for cryogenic microwave PCBs. We designed a coplanar waveguide {\lambda}/2 open-circuit series resonator, and we fabricated the PCB using a low-cost manufacturing process, obtaining in-plane geometric features with maximum variations of 50-100 um compared to the PCB design. Such a geometry allows to exploit the resonance peak of the resonator to measure the variation of the complex permittivity as a function of the temperature. The resonance peak frequency was used to estimate the real permittivity, achieving a sensitivity of -470 MHz and a resolution of 1.2x10^-2. Similarly, the resonance peak magnitude was involved in the extrapolation of the loss tangent, reaching a sensitivity of ~-337 dB and a resolution of 1.6x^10-4. For the FR4 laminate used, we estimated a 9 % reduction of the real permittivity and a 70 % reduction of the loss tangent in the temperature range from 300 to 4 K. The proposed approach can be immediately extended to the detection of cryogenic temperature-dependent dielectric performance of any kind of substrate.</description>

      <title>A method to detect the VUV photons from cooled $^{229}$Th:CaF$_2$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thorium-229, with its exceptionally low-energy nuclear excited state, is a key candidate for developing nuclear clocks. $^{229}$Th-doped CaF$_2$ crystals, benefiting from calcium fluoride's wide band gap, show great promise as solid-state nuclear clock materials. These crystals are excited by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lasers, which over time cause radiation damage. Cooling the crystals can mitigate this damage but introduces a challenge: photoabsorption. This occurs when residual gas molecules condense on the crystal surface, absorbing VUV photons and deteriorating detection efficiency. To solve this, we developed a cooling technique using a copper shield to surround the crystal, acting as a cold trap. This prevents ice-layer formation, even at temperatures below $-100\,^\circ$C, preserving high VUV photon detection efficiency. Our study detailed the experimental cooling setup and demonstrated the effectiveness of the copper shield in maintaining crystal performance, a critical improvement for future solid-state nuclear clocks operating at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Removal of Radioactive Noble Gas Radon from Air by Ag-Zeolite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the removal of radon from purified and ambient airs by Ag-zeolite. Ag-zeolite is known to have very high performance for airborne radon removal. The dependence of zeolite type and silver content on the performance of radon removal was evaluated. The performance of radon removal by single pass and radon emanation were also evaluated. In addition, the adsorption performance due to zeolite solidification and the change in adsorption performance due to moisture in the gas were evaluated in order to investigate properties that should be considered for future practical use. These properties will be adaptable to the development of air purification systems for the large volume ultra-low radioactivity experiments.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Monte Carlo Simulation Tool on Electron Transport in Noble Gases and Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the particle detectors based on noble gases or liquids, it is essential to understand the transport dynamic and the properties of the electrons. We report the development of a tool for electron transport in noble gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr, or Xe, and liquids Ar, Kr, or Xe. The simulation, implemented in C++ and MATLAB, is based on electron-atom collisions, including elastic scattering, excitation and ionization. We validate the program through assessing the electron's swarm parameters, specifically the drift velocity and the diffusion coefficient. For electron transport in liquids, two models are discussed and both are used for the construction of the Monte Carlo framework based on the Cohen Leker theory. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the simulation tool, which offers a valuable support for detector design and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Toward thermoelectric characterization of (nano)materials by in situ transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility to perform an in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) thermoelectric characterization of materials. A differential heating element on a custom in-situ TEM microchip allows to generate a temperature gradient across the studied materials, which are simultaneously measured electrically. A thermovoltage was induced in all studied devices, whose sign corresponds to the sign of the Seebeck coefficient of the tested materials. The results indicate that in-situ thermoelectric TEM studies can help to profoundly understand fundamental aspects of thermoelectricity, which is exemplary demonstrated by tracking the thermovoltage during in-situ crystallization of an amorphous Ge thin film. We propose an improved in-situ TEM microchip design, which should facilitate a full quantitative measurement of the induced temperature gradient, the electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as the Seebeck coefficient. The benefit of the in-situ approach is the possibility to directly correlate the thermoelectric properties with the structure and chemical composition of the entire studied device down to the atomic level, including grain boundaries, dopants or crystal defects, and to trace its dynamic evolution upon heating or during the application of electrical currents</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation of experiments for rare-event searches based on skipper Charge Coupled Devices (skipper-CCDs) presents new challenges for the sensor packaging and readout. Scaling the active mass and simultaneously reducing the experimental backgrounds in orders of magnitude requires a novel high-density silicon-based package that must be massively produced and tested. In this work, we present the design, fabrication, testing, and empirical signal model of a multi-channel silicon package. In addition, we outline the chosen specifications for the ongoing production of 1500 wafers that will add up to a 10 kg skipper-CCD array with 24000 readout channels.</description>
