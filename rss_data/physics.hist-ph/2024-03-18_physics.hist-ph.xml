      <title>The hole argument meets Noether's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hole argument of general relativity threatens a radical and pernicious form of indeterminism. One natural response to the argument is that points belonging to different but isometric models should always be identified, or 'dragged-along', by the diffeomorphism that relates them. In this paper, I first criticise this response and its construal of isometry: it stumbles on certain cases, like Noether's second theorem. Then I go on to describe how the essential features of Einstein\rq{}s `point-coincidence' response to the hole argument avoid the criticisms of the `drag-along response' and are compatible with Noether's second theorem.</description>

      <title>The Negative Energy Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac negative energy sea introduced the concept of antimatter, and explained it, not least in its relationship to negative-energy solutions to the wave equation. Post-war, it was largely displaced by what I shall call the 'standard formalism', dependent, among other things, on normal-ordering. A much better explanation is provided by the 'two complex structures' viewpoint, as first introduced by Irving Segal: the one ('natural') kind of complex numbers at the level of covariant, local fields; and the other ('particle') complex numbers at the level of the one-particle Hilbert space and Fock space. The former is local, the latter non-local: therein lies the fundamental difference between relativistic and non-relativistic quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Matter and cosmogenesis in Kant's Theory of the Heavens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1755, Kant published his General Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, in which he presented his hypothesis on the formation of the solar system, known as the primitive nebula hypothesis. This original theory of the heavens was written in dialogue with the conceptions of celestial matter of his time. On the one hand, Kant recognized Descartes' cosmological enterprise as a decisive mechanistic requirement for the intelligence of physics, but his vortices of matter fell into disrepute: Newton invalidated them mathematically. On the other hand, attraction at a distance provides an incomparable explanation of phenomena, but has left a gaping hole in our understanding of the law's material anchorage in bodies, and ultimately sends the question of how the system works back to God. He then set out to overcome the dichotomy established by these two authors, drawing on the Cartesian adage ''give me matter and I'll make a world'', but applying Newton's laws to cosmogenesis. In concrete terms, interplanetary space currently contains no matter capable of explaining the motion of the stars, we need to look further back into the system's past, to find an earlier state of material dispersion whose effects are still being felt. He must assume the existence of a cloud of dust, made up of the simplest elements and moved by the forces of attraction and repulsion alone. From this, Kant can form the hypothesis of the primitive nebula breaking down first into a phase of stellogenesis, and then into the creation of an accretion disk gradually forming the planets and their satellites.</description>

      <title>What can we know about that which we cannot even imagine?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03886v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this essay I will consider a sequence of questions. The first questions concern the biological function of intelligence in general, and cognitive prostheses of human intelligence in particular. These will lead into questions concerning human language, perhaps the most important cognitive prosthesis humanity has ever developed. While it is traditional to rhapsodize about the cognitive power encapsulated in human language, I will emphasize how horribly limited human language is - and therefore how limited our cognitive abilities are, despite their being augmented with language. This will lead to questions of whether human mathematics, being ultimately formulated in terms of human language, is also deeply limited. I will then combine these questions to pose a partial, sort-of, sideways answer to the guiding concern of this essay: what we can ever discern about that we cannot even conceive?</description>
