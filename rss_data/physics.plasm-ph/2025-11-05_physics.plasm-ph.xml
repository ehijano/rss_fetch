      <title>Unified Model of Heated Plasma Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to predict plasma density and temperature distributions created in the early stages of high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, we develop a fluid model of plasma expansion into vacuum that incorporates external heating. We propose a new three-parameter family of self-similar solutions for plasma expansion that models a wide range of spatiotemporal variations of the electron temperature. Depending on the relative scales of the heated plasma domain $L$, the Debye length $\lambda_D$ and an emergent ion-acoustic correlation length $\lambda_s$, characterized by the parameters $\lambda_s/\lambda_D$ and $L/\lambda_s$, a spectrum of dynamical behaviors for the expanding plasma are identified. The behavior is classified into five dynamical regimes, ranging from nearly quasineutral expansion to the formation of bare ion slabs susceptible to Coulomb explosion. The limiting self-similar solutions are analyzed, and the dynamics in the five asymptotic limits in the parameter space are detailed. Scaling relations for the length scales and energies of the expanding plasma are proposed. The self-similar framework is applied to laser-plasma interactions, specifically addressing the plasma dynamics at a target surface during prepulse-target interactions. The results offer insights into the expansion behavior based on the laser-plasma parameters, and scaling relations for optimizing laser-plasma schemes and guiding experimental designs in high-intensity laser experiments.</description>

      <title>Integrated Observation of Isotope-Dependent Turbulence, Zonal Flow, and Turbulence-Driven Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the long-standing unresolved issue of "isotope effect" in plasma transport, this study investigates the hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) isotope dependence of a nonlinear turbulence system. The analysis focuses on the zonal flow (ZF) activity, turbulence properties, their nonlinear interaction, and resulting turbulent transport in a torus plasma. ZF activity, observed in low-density electron cyclotron heating plasmas in Heliotron J, is enhanced with increasing D gas fraction from 10 to 80 percent. While the turbulence scale size in the edge region (rho approx 0.8) is larger in D plasmas, the reduction and decoupling of fluctuations, associated with an enhanced ZF, results in beneficial impacts on turbulent transport, driven by an enhanced nonlinear coupling between the ZF and turbulence in D plasmas. These differences in the turbulence nature lead to the significant reduction of turbulence-induced transport observed in the D plasma. These comprehensive observations suggest that the isotope dependence on the turbulence system is essential for explaining the isotope effect on confinement improvement and is vital in predicting the performance of future fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Detecting Shearless Phase-Space Transport Barriers in Global Gyrokinetic Turbulence Simulations with Test Particle Map Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetically confined fusion plasmas, the role played by zonal E$\times$B flow shear layers in the suppression of turbulent transport is relatively well-understood. However, less is understood about the role played by the weak shear regions that arise in the non-monotonic radial electric field profiles often associated with these shear layers. In electrostatic simulations from the global total-f gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code XGC, we demonstrate how shearless regions with non-zero flow curvature form zonal "jets" that, in conjunction with neighboring regions of shear, can act as robust barriers to particle transport and turbulence spreading. By isolating quasi-coherent fluctuations radially localized to the zonal jets, we construct a map model for the Lagrangian dynamics of gyrokinetic test particles in the presence of drift waves. We identify the presence of shearless invariant tori in this model and verify that these tori act as partial phase-space transport barriers in the simulations. We also demonstrate how avalanches impinging on these shearless tori cause reconnection events that form "cold/warm core ring" structures analogous to those found in oceanic jets, facilitating transport across the barriers without destroying them completely. We discuss how shearless tori may generically arise from tertiary instabilities or other types of discrete eigenmodes, suggesting their potential relevance to broader classes of turbulent fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Laser diagnostics for negative ion source optimization: insights from SPIDER at the ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ITER Heating Neutral Beams (HNBs) require large, high-energy H/D atom beams (285/330 A/m^2 extracted current density, and 1/0.87 MeV acceleration energy, respectively for H and D). To address the associated challenges, the SPIDER negative ion RF beam source at the Neutral Beam Test Facility (NBTF) in Padova (Italy) serves as a full-scale source prototype with a 100 kV triode accelerator, for design validation and performance verification. SPIDER is equipped with two advanced laser diagnostics to monitor key plasma parameters; Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) is used to measure H$^-$\slash D$^-$ ion densities, while Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (LAS) tracks caesium neutral density in the source. These measurements are essential for optimizing negative ion production and meeting ITER source targets. We present diagnostic upgrade details, recent experimental results, and correlations with other machine parameters. Since CRDS relies on a single 4.637-meter-long optical cavity, the longest used in such sources, it has demonstrated sensitivity to alignment. Based on recent experimental experience, structural improvements are being implemented to enhance both stability and measurement reliability. LAS has mainly been employed as a tool to monitor the caesium conditioning status of SPIDER. Additionally, due to a distributed measurement over four lines of sight, LAS has proven effective in monitoring the caesium distribution within the source. This work demonstrates the essential role of laser diagnostics in developing ITER-relevant plasma sources and informs ongoing efforts to improve measurement accuracy in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Simulation of multi-species kinetic instabilities with the Numerical Flow Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic instabilities are one of the most challenging aspects in computational plasma physics. Accurately capturing their onset and evolution requires fine resolution of the high-dimensional distribution functions of each relevant species, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitively expensive. Additionally, plasma dynamics is an inherently multi-scale phenomenon due to the vast separation of scales between heavy ions and light-weight electrons. In previous work the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) was suggested as a high-fidelity alternative with reduced memory complexity making it an interesting candidate to simulate complicated kinetic instabilities. In this work we extend NuFI to non-periodic boundary conditions and demonstrate how it is possible to reduce the computational complexity to allow for longer simulation periods.</description>

      <title>Modeling formation and transport of clusters at high temperature and pressure gradients by implying partial chemical equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical approach to describing transport of an entire ensemble of clusters with different sizes as a single species in gas has been developed. The major assumption is an existence of local partial chemical equilibrium between the clusters. It is shown that thermal diffusion emerges in the collective description as a significant factor even if it is negligible when transport of the original molecular species is considered. Analytical expressions for the effective diffusion and thermal diffusion coefficients at temperature, pressure, and chemical composition gradients have been derived. The theory has been applied to a technology of H2S conversion in a centrifugal plasma-chemical reactor and has made it possible to account for sulfur clusters in numerical process modeling.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Guided Online Ensemble for Non-stationary Data Streams in Fusion Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams. Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model. Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA) technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and 10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.</description>

      <title>Production of High-Specific-Activity Radioisotopes Using High-Energy Fusion Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that transmutation driven by high-energy neutrons from deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion can produce many medically important radioisotopes-including $^{99}$Mo/${}^{99\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Tc}$, $^{131}$I, $^{177}$Lu, $^{153}$Sm, $^{111}$In, $^{133}$Xe, $^{32}$P, $^{64}$Cu, $^{60}$Co, $^{103}$Pd, $^{89}$Sr, $^{188}$Re, $^{117}$In/$^{117\mathrm{m}1}$Sn, $^{90}$Y, and $^{166}$Ho - and emerging isotopes such as $^{161}$Tb, $^{195\mathrm{m}1}$Ir/$^{195\mathrm{m}}$Pt, $^{47}$Sc, ${}^{103}\mathrm{Ru}/{}^{103\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Rh}$, ${}^{103}\mathrm{Pd}/{}^{103\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Rh}$, and $^{119}$Sb with high specific activity and in large quantities. These reactions involve stable, abundant feedstocks and non-fission transmutation channels that change the proton number, enabling chemical rather than isotopic separation. Fusion-based transmutation could provide a flexible and proliferation-resistant platform for supply of high-purity isotopes. A D-T neutron source operating at a few megawatts of fusion power could meet or exceed global demand for most major radioisotopes. Further research is required to develop tailored approaches for feedstock processing and product extraction.</description>
