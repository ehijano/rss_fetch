      <title>Analysis of Conducted and Radiated Emission on a Self-oscillating Capacitive Touch Sensing Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of smartphones, there has been a recent increase in the use of capacitive touch sensing for various Human Machine Interfaces (HMI). Capacitive-based touch sensing provides higher flexibility and cost-effectiveness than, methodologies such as resistive-based touch sensing. However, Capacitive-based touch sensing is more prone to disturbances such as Electromagnetic interference (EMI) and noise due to temperature variation. This effect becomes more dominating as the sensing excitation frequency increases. Traditional capacitance to digital circuits, such as sigma-delta capacitive sensing, requires multiple clock cycles to measure sensing capacitance, thus necessitating higher frequency operation. In turn, this produces challenges in Electromagnetic Emission while also increasing its susceptibility to EMI, such as false or ghost touch due to exposure of the sensing electrodes to various frequency electric fields. This paper discusses the conducted electromagnetic emission behavior of an external excitation-frequency independent self-oscillating capacitance-to-time converter, where sensing is done with a single clock cycle, and discusses radiated Electromagnetic emission of the touch sensing electrode. The proposed approach is suitable for touch-sensing applications, mainly when used in a noisy EMI environment, such as inside a vehicle within the Automotive industry.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulating Rydberg Atom Quantum Computers for Hardware-Software Co-design with PachinQo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to accelerate various domains: scientific computation, machine learning, and optimization. Recently, Rydberg atom quantum computing has emerged as a promising quantum computing technology, especially with the demonstration of the zonal addressing architecture. However, this demonstration is only compatible with one type of quantum algorithm, and extending it to compile and execute general quantum algorithms is a challenge. To address it, we propose PachinQo, a framework to co-design the architecture and compilation for zonal addressing systems for any given quantum algorithm. PachinQo's evaluation demonstrates its ability to improve a quantum algorithm's estimated probability of success by 45% on average in error-prone quantum environments.</description>

      <title>Investigation of in vitro neuronal activity processing using a CMOS-integrated ZrO2-based memristive crossbar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of the epileptiform neuronal activity on the response of a CMOS-integrated ZrO2-based memristive crossbar and its conductivity was studied. Epileptiform neuronal activity was obtained in vitro in the hippocampus slices of laboratory mice using 4-aminopyridine experimental model. Synaptic plasticity of the memristive crossbar induced by epileptiform neuronal activity pulses was detected. Qualitatively, the results obtained in the case of normal (without pathologies) and epileptiform neuronal activity with and without noise coincide. For quantitative analysis, the value of the relative change in synaptic weight has been calculated for such important biological mechanisms of synapses as paired-pulse facilitation/depression, post-tetanic potentiation/depression, and long-term potentiation/depression. It has been shown that average value of the relative change in synaptic weight and its are smaller mainly in the case of epileptiform neuronal activity pulses. An effect of the influence of noise included in the neuronal activity was found, which consists in the fact that the current response of the memristive crossbar is smaller in the presence of noise. The results of this study can be used in the development of new generation hardware-implemented computing devices with high performance and energy efficiency for the tasks of restorative medicine and robotics. In particular, using these results, neurohybrid devices can be developed for processing epileptiform activity in real time and for its suppression.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Indoor RIS-Assisted Channels at 304 GHz: Experimental Measurements, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are expected to play a pivotal role in future indoor ultra high data rate wireless communications as well as highly accurate three-dimensional localization and sensing, mainly due to their capability to provide flexible, cost- and power-efficient coverage extension, even under blockage conditions. However, when considering beyond millimeter wave frequencies where there exists GHz-level available bandwidth, realistic models of indoor RIS-parameterized channels verified by field-trial measurements are unavailable. In this article, we first present and characterize three RIS prototypes with $100\times100$ unit cells of half-wavelength inter-cell spacing, which were optimized to offer a specific non-specular reflection with $1$-, $2$-, and $3$-bit phase quantization at $304$ GHz. The designed static RISs were considered in an indoor channel measurement campaign carried out with a $304$ GHz channel sounder. Channel measurements for two setups, one focusing on the transmitter-RIS-receiver path gain and the other on the angular spread of multipath components, are presented and compared with both state-of-the-art theoretical models as well as full-wave simulation results. The article is concluded with a list of challenges and research directions for RIS design and modeling of RIS-parameterized channels at THz frequencies.</description>

      <title>A Review of Challenges in Speech-based Conversational AI for Elderly Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificially intelligent systems optimized for speech conversation are appearing at a fast pace. Such models are interesting from a healthcare perspective, as these voice-controlled assistants may support the elderly and enable remote health monitoring. The bottleneck for efficacy, however, is how well these devices work in practice and how the elderly experience them, but research on this topic is scant. We review elderly use of voice-controlled AI and highlight various user- and technology-centered issues, that need to be considered before effective speech-controlled AI for elderly care can be realized.</description>

      <title>A clustering aggregation algorithm on neutral-atoms and annealing quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to perform clustering aggregation, designed for neutral-atoms quantum computers and quantum annealers. Clustering aggregation is a technique that mitigates the weaknesses of clustering algorithms, an important class of data science methods for partitioning datasets, and is widely employed in many real-world applications. By expressing the clustering aggregation problem instances as a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem and as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, it was possible to solve them by leveraging the potential of Pasqal's Fresnel (neutral-atoms processor) and D-Wave's Advantage QPU (quantum annealer). Additionally, the designed clustering aggregation algorithm was first validated on a Fresnel emulator based on QuTiP and later on an emulator of the same machine based on tensor networks, provided by Pasqal. The results revealed technical limitations, such as the difficulty of adding additional constraints on the employed neutral-atoms platform and the need for better metrics to measure the quality of the produced clusterings. However, this work represents a step towards a benchmark to compare two different machines: a quantum annealer and a neutral-atom quantum computer. Moreover, findings suggest promising potential for future advancements in hybrid quantum-classical pipelines, although further improvements are needed in both quantum and classical components.</description>

      <title>BATIS: Bootstrapping, Autonomous Testing, and Initialization System for Quantum Dot Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. As the complexity of QD devices grows, manual tuning becomes increasingly infeasible, necessitating robust and scalable autotuning solutions. Tuning large arrays of QD qubits depends on efficient choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS), an automated framework designed to streamline QD device testing and initialization. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing and gate characterization. The current channel formation protocol follows a novel and scalable approach that requires a single measurement regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at 1.3 K on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.</description>

      <title>Available Degrees of Spatial Multiplexing of a Uniform Linear Array with Multiple Polarizations: A Holographic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capabilities of multi-antenna technology have recently been significantly enhanced by the proliferation of extra large array architectures. The high dimensionality of these systems implies that communications take place in the nearfield regime, which poses some questions as to their effective perfomrance even under simple line of sight configurations. In order to study these limitations, a uniform linear array (ULA) is considered here, the elements of which are three infinitesimal dipoles transmitting different signals in the three spatial dimensions. The receiver consists of a single element with three orthogonal infinitesimal dipoles and full channel state information is assumed to be available at both ends. A capacity analysis is presented when the number of elements of the ULA increases without bound while the interelement distance converges to zero, so that the total aperture length is kept asymptotically fixed. In particular, the total number of available spatial eigenmodes is shown to depend crucially on the receiver position in space, and closed form expressions are provided for the different achievability regions. From the analysis it can be concluded that the use of three orthogonal polarizations at the transmitter guarantees the almost universal availability of two spatial streams, whereas the use of only two polarizations results in a more extensive region where maximum multiplexing gain is available.</description>
