      <title>On the Mean Value of $D_k(n)$ in Arithmetic Progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k \ge 2$ be a fixed integer. We define the multiplicative function $D_k(n) = d_k(n)/d_k^*(n)$, such that $d_k(n)$ is the Piltz divisor function and $d_k^*(n) = k^{\omega(n)}$ is its unitary analogue, where $\omega(n)$ is the number of distinct prime divisors of $n$. We establish an asymptotic formula for the sum
  \[
  \sum_{\substack{n \le x \\ n \equiv a \pmod q}} D_k(n),
  \]
  where $\gcd(a,q)=1$. This result is a generalization of the study presented in \cite{Derbal 2023}.

      <title>Note on Fractional Sums with Fixed GCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fractional sums of arithmetic functions over products of two or three integers, with emphasis on fixed greatest common divisors and multiplicative weights. Let $f$ be an arithmetic function satisfying $f(n) \ll n^\alpha$ for some $0 \le \alpha &lt; 1$. For $r \ge 2$, let $\tau_r(n)$ denote the number of representations of $n$ as a product of $r$ positive integers, and more generally, $\tau_r^{(d)}(n)$ the number of representations with $\gcd$ factors equal to $d$. We establish asymptotic formulas for the fractional sums \[ S_{f,r}^{(d)}(x) = \sum_{n \le x} \tau_r^{(d)}(n) f\!\left(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{n}\right\rfloor \right), \] in the cases $r=2$ and $r=3$.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of shapes of octic Kummer extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of a number field $K$ of degree $n$ is defined as the equivalence class of the lattice of integers under linear operations generated by rotations, reflections, and positive scalar dilations. It may be viewed as a point in the space of shapes $\mathscr{S}_{n-1} =
\mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{GO}_{n-1}(\mathbb{R})$. In this paper, we study the distribution of shapes of octic Kummer extensions $L=\mathbb{Q}(i,\sqrt[4]{m})$, where $m\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is fourth-power-free. We parametrize these shapes by explicit invariants known as shape parameters and establish an asymptotic formula for their joint distribution ordered by absolute discriminant. The limiting distribution is given by an explicit measure that factors as the product of a continuous measure and a discrete measure arising from local arithmetic conditions.</description>

      <title>Balanced rectangles over Sturmian words and minimal discrepancy intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $m\times n$ rectangular matrices formed from Sturmian words with slope $\alpha$ and we fully characterise their balance properties in terms of the Ostrowski representations of $m$ an $n$ with respect to $\alpha$. This generalises recent results by Anselmo et al., as well as by Shallit and Vukusic, where only quadratic irrationals $\alpha$ were considered. In contrast to the two mentioned papers, our approach is based on the distribution of $n\alpha \bmod 1$.</description>

      <title>Explicit Euclidean division algorithms for some degree 8 number rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on some rings of integers of number fields which are known to be norm-Euclidean domains, but for which no explicit algorithm computing the Euclidean division has yet been studied or implemented. The rings of integers we are interested in were proven to be Euclidean by H.W. Lenstra, Jr in 1978; they include the $n$-th cyclotomic rings for $n=15,20,24$. We present an algorithm performing Euclidean division in these rings based on Lenstra's proof and a closest vector computation by Conway and Sloane, and study its complexity. We give a complete implementation of the algorithm in SageMath. We also estimate the size of the remainders obtained when computing Euclidean divisions with this algorithm.</description>

      <title>A supercongruence related to Whipple's ${}_5F_4$ formula and Dwork's dash operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a parametric supercongruence related to Whipple's ${}_5F_4$ formula and Dwork's dash operation. As a typical consequence, we obtain the following result: for any prime $p\equiv3\pmod4$ and odd integer $r\geq1$, $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p^r-1}(8k+1)\frac{(\frac14)_k^3(\frac12)_k}{(1)_k^3(\frac34)_k}\equiv 3p^r+\frac{27p^{3r}}{4}H_{(p^r-3)/4}^{(2)}\pmod{p^{r+3}}, $$ where $(x)_n=x(x+1)\cdots(x+n-1)$ is the Pochhammer symbol and $H_n^{(2)}=\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k^2}$ is the $n$-th harmonic number of order $2$. This confirms a conjecture of Guo and Zhao [Forum Math. 38 (2026), 1099-1109]. Our proof rely on a new parametric WZ pair which allows us to transform the original sum to a computable form in the sense of congruence. Another essential ingredient of our proof involves the properties of Dwork's dash operation.</description>

Abstract: We study the pair correlations of the logarithms of the integral values of quadratic norm forms at various scalings, proving the existence of pair correlation measures. We describe a surprising set of asymptotic behaviours when the scaling increases, passing from a punctual measure to a Poissonian behaviour through an exotic behaviour at the transition phase.</description>

      <title>Parametrization and reduction to depth zero of $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}[\frac{1}{p}]$-blocks of tame $p$-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a reductive group over a non-archimedean local field $F$ of residue characteristic $p$. We consider pairs $(\phi,I)$ consisting of a "wild inertia" Langlands parameter $\phi: P_F \longrightarrow \hat{G}$ whose centralizer $C_{\hat{G}}(\phi)$ is a Levi subgroup of $\hat{G}$, and a cohomological invariant $I$ whose definition is inspired by the theory of endoscopy. Assuming that $p$ is odd and not a torsion prime of $G$ nor of $\hat{G}$, we associate to each such pair $(\phi,I)$ a Serre subcategory $\mathrm{Rep}^{\phi,I}(G(F))$ of the category of smooth $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}[\frac{1}{p}]$-representations of $G(F)$. Then we construct an equivalence between this Serre subcategory and the category of depth-zero $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}[\frac{1}{p}]$-representations of a twisted Levi subgroup $G_{\phi,I}$ of $G$, which is dual to $C_{\hat{G}}(\phi)$. This pattern for reduction to depth zero fits well with the conjectural (categorical) local Langlands correspondence.
  When $G$ is tamely ramified and $p$ does not divide the order of its Weyl group, then the above Serre subcategories provide the block decomposition of the category of all smooth $\overline{\mathbb{Z}}[\frac{1}{p}]$-representations of $G(F)$. In this case, we thus obtain a reduction-to-depth-zero process for smooth representations of $G(F)$ valued in any algebraically closed field of characteristic different from $p$. When that field has characteristic 0, this recovers some of the recent results of Adler--Fintzen--Mishra--Ohara. When that field is $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_{\ell}$, we use our results together with Zhu's unipotent categorical correspondence to produce a fully faithful embedding of $D\mathrm{Rep}_{\overline{\mathbb{F}}_{\ell}}(\mathrm{GL}_{n}(F))$ into a suitable category of coherent sheaves on the moduli space of $n$-dimensional $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_{\ell}$-representations of the Weil group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any type of fundamental groupoid scheme, we construct an algebraic cohomology theory for varieties with coefficients in the base field. This is a minor variant of \'etale cohomology, involving neither de Rham complexes nor hypercohomology. The main idea is to delegate the role of \'etale morphisms to fundamental groupoids, thereby bypassing the Grothendieck topology. To validate this theory, we prove a comparison theorem between the algebraically defined cohomology using the pro-algebraic fundamental groupoid over $\mathbb{C}$ and singular cohomology. Furthermore, our construction naturally extends to other types of fundamental groupoids, providing a uniform foundation for various cohomology theories.</description>

      <title>On the quasi-uniformity properties of quasi-Monte Carlo point sets and sequences -- Part II: digital nets and sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quasi-uniformity properties of digital nets, a class of quasi-Monte Carlo point sets. Quasi-uniformity is a space-filling property used for instance in experimental designs and radial basis function approximation. However, it has not been investigated so far whether common low-discrepancy digital nets are quasi-uniform, with the exception of the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence, which has recently been shown not to be quasi-uniform. In this paper, with the goal of constructing quasi-uniform low-discrepancy digital nets, we introduce the notion of well-separated point sets and provide an algebraic criterion to determine whether a given sequence of digital nets is well-separated. Using this criterion, we present an example of a two-dimensional digital net which has low-discrepancy and is quasi-uniform. Additionally, we provide several counterexamples of low-discrepancy digital nets that are not quasi-uniform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrepancy of a point set quantifies how well the points are distributed, with low-discrepancy point sets demonstrating exceptional uniform distribution properties. Such sets are integral to quasi-Monte Carlo methods, which approximate integrals over the unit cube for integrands of bounded variation. In contrast, quasi-uniform point sets are characterized by optimal separation and covering radii, making them well-suited for applications such as radial basis function approximation. This paper explores the quasi-uniformity properties of quasi-Monte Carlo point sets constructed from lattices and also Kronecker sequences. Specifically, we analyze rank-1 lattice point sets, Fibonacci lattice point sets, Frolov point sets, and Kronecker sequences (also referred to as $(n \boldsymbol{\alpha})$-sequences), providing insights into their potential for use in applications that require both low-discrepancy and quasi-uniform distribution. As an example, we show that the $(n \boldsymbol{\alpha})$-sequence with $\alpha_j = 2^{j/(d+1)}$ for $j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, d\}$ is quasi-uniform and has low-discrepancy. The quasi-uniformity properties of quasi-Monte Carlo digital nets and sequences will be studied in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Inscription, twistors, and $p$-adic periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the theory of inscribed $v$-sheaves, a differentiable extension of the theory of diamonds and $v$-sheaves with internal tangent bundles that are often relative inscribed Banach-Colmez spaces, then apply this theory to the study of $p$-adic periods. In particular, we construct natural inscribed versions of the Hodge and Hodge-Tate period maps and their lattice refinements for de Rham torsors, then compute the derivatives of these period maps in terms of classical structures in $p$-adic Hodge theory. These torsors include infinite level global Shimura varieties and infinite level local Shimura varieties, and for these spaces we also give another moduli-theoretic construction of the inscribed structure; the construction in the local Shimura case applies more generally to the non-minuscule moduli of mixed characterisic local shtukas with one leg. The key new ingredients in our study of inscribed structures on $p$-adic Lie group torsors over smooth rigid varieties over a $p$-adic field are the Liu-Zhu period map, a refinement of the Hodge period map whose derivative is the geometric Sen morphism/canonical Higgs field, and a closely related exact tensor functor from $\mathbb{Q}_p$-local systems to a category of twistor bundles on the relative thickened Fargues-Fontaine curve. These new structures are only visible after passing to the inscribed setting. We also discuss some possible implications of our computations in the vein of ``differential topology for diamonds."</description>

Abstract: We consider a Dirichlet series $D(F,G;s)$ attached to two automorphic forms $F$ and $G$ of an orthogonal group of real signature $(2,4)$, involving their Fourier--Jacobi coefficients. When $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ a lift of a Jacobi-Poincar\'e series, our main result gives that $D(F,G;s)$ is equal to the standard $L$-function attached to $F$, up to an explicit constant. To establish this, we use a correspondence between binary Hermitian forms and ideals of quaternion algebras, as established by Latimer, together with the fact that the even Clifford algebra of a three-dimensional definite quadratic space can be identified with a quaternion division algebra. Our work should be seen as a generalisation of a work of Kohnen and Skoruppa, whose result corresponds to the case of the orthogonal group of real signature $(2,3)$.</description>

      <title>Fast Computing Formulas for some Dirichlet L-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\chi_k$ a self$-$dual primitive Dirichlet character mod $k$ several reduced identities of Dirichlet $L-$functions $L_k(s):=L(s,\chi_k)$, expressed as linear combinations of Hurwitz $\zeta$ functions, are found for $s=2,3$ and some selected values of $k$. By using a merged approach between the Wilf$-$Zeilberger method and a Dougall$'$s $_5H_5$ technique, new proven accelerated series of hypergeometric$-$type are derived for specific Hurwitz $\zeta$ function values. These fast series that are computed by means of the binary splitting algorithm, enter into the reduced identities found producing very efficient formulas to compute selected $L-$function values. The new algorithms include $L_k(2)$ for $k = -4$ Catalan's constant, $-7, -8, -15, -20, -24$ together with $L_k(3)$ for $k = 1$ Apery's constant, $5, 8$ and $12$. Formulas were tested and verified up to 100 million decimal places for each $L-$value.</description>

      <title>On the Real Zeroes of Half-integral Weight Hecke Cusp Forms, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for $\gg K^2$ of the half-integral weight Hecke cusp forms in the Kohnen plus subspaces with weight bounded by a large parameter $K$, the number of "real" zeroes grows at the expected rate. A key technical step in the proof is to obtain sharp bounds for the mollified first and second moments of quadratic twists of modular $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>Counting geodesics on expander surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study properties of typical closed geodesics on expander surfaces of high genus, i.e. closed hyperbolic surfaces with a uniform spectral gap of the Laplacian. Under an additional systole lower bound assumption, we show almost every geodesic of length much greater than $\sqrt{g}\log g$ is non-simple. And we prove almost every closed geodesic of length much greater than $g (\log g)^2$ is filling, i.e. each component of the complement of the geodesic is a topological disc. Our results apply to Weil-Petersson random surfaces, random covers of a fixed surface, and Brooks-Makover random surfaces, since these models are known to have uniform spectral gap asymptotically almost surely.
  Our proof technique involves adapting Margulis' counting strategy to work at low length scales.</description>

      <title>Computing the cohomology of constructible \'etale sheaves on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit expression of the cohomology complex of a constructible sheaf of abelian groups on the small \'etale site of an irreducible curve over an algebraically closed field, when the torsion of the sheaf is invertible in the field. This expression only involves finite groups, and is functorial in both the curve and the sheaf. In particular, we explain how to compute the Galois action on this complex. We also present an algorithm which computes it and study its complexity.</description>

      <title>Motivic Steenrod operations at the characteristic via infinite ramification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct motivic power operations on the mod-$p$ motivic cohomology of $\Fb_p$-schemes using a motivic refinement of Nizio{\l}'s theorem. The key input is a purity theorem for motivic cohomology established by Levine. Our operations satisfy the expected properties (naturality, Adem relations, and the Cartan formula) for all bidegrees, generalizing previous results of Primozic which were only know along the ``Chow diagonal.'' We offer geometric applications of our construction: 1) an example of non-(quasi-)smoothable algebraic cycle at the characteristic, 2) an answer to the motivic Steenrod problem at the characteristic, 3) a counterexample to the integral version of a crystalline Tate conjecture.</description>

      <title>p-adic Ghobber-Jaming Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ and $\{\omega_k\}_{k=1}^n$ be two orthonormal bases for a finite dimensional p-adic Hilbert space $\mathcal{X}$. Let $M,N\subseteq \{1, \dots, n\}$ be such that \begin{align*} \displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|&lt;1, \end{align*} where $o(M)$ is the cardinality of $M$. Then for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we show that \begin{align} (1) \quad \quad \quad \quad \|x\|\leq \left(\frac{1}{1-\displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|}\right)\max\left\{\displaystyle \max_{j \in M^c}|\langle x, \tau_j\rangle |, \displaystyle \max_{k \in N^c}|\langle x, \omega_k\rangle |\right\}. \end{align}
  We call Inequality (1) as \textbf{p-adic Ghobber-Jaming Uncertainty Principle}. Inequality (1) is the p-adic version of uncertainty principle obtained by Ghobber and Jaming \textit{[Linear Algebra Appl., 2011]}. We also derive analogues of Inequality (1) for non-Archimedean Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Wedderburn decomposition of the total ring of quotients of certain Iwasawa algebras II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G\simeq H\rtimes\Gamma$ be the semidirect product of a finite group $H$ and $\Gamma\simeq\mathbb Z_p$. Let $ F/\mathbb Q_p$ be a finite extension with ring of integers $\mathcal O_F$. Then the total ring of quotients $\mathcal Q^F(\mathcal G)$ of the completed group ring $\mathcal O_F[[\mathcal G]]$ is semisimple artinian. We determine its Wedderburn decomposition in full generality in terms of the Wedderburn decomposition of the group ring $ F[H]$. Such a description was previously available only for those simple components for which a certain associated field extension is totally ramified.</description>

Abstract: We investigate and generalise Levine sequences like A011784, A061892 and A061894 and develop an algebraic theory for them. We thereby also cover other fast growing sequences like A014644, which we call golombic due to their strong ties with Golomb's sequence A001462.</description>
