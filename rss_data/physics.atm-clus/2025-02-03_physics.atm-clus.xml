      <title>High- and low-energy many-body effects of graphene in a unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the many-body features of graphene band structure and electronic response can be accurately evaluated by applying many-body perturbation theory to a tight-binding (TB) model. In particular, we compare TB results for the optical conductivity with previous ab-initio calculations, showing a nearly perfect agreement both in the low energy region near the Dirac cone ($\sim 100$ meV), and at the higher energies of the {\pi} plasmon ($\sim 5$ eV). A reasonable agreement is reached also for the density-density response at the Brillouin zone corner. With the help of the reduced computational cost of the TB model, we study the effect of self-consistency on the screened interaction (W) and on the quasi-particle corrections, a task that is not yet achievable in ab-initio frameworks. We find that self-consistency is important to reproduce the experimental results on the divergence of the Fermi velocity, while it marginally affects the optical conductivity. Finally, we study the robustness of our results against doping or the introduction of a uniform dielectric environment.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Dipole-Dipole Interactions Enabled with Guided Plasmons of Matched Nanoparticle-on-Mirror Antenna Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ruling a wide range of phenomena, dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) are typically constrained to the short range due to their rapid decay with the increasing dipole separations, limiting the performance in long-range applications. By judiciously designing the photonic structures that control the two-point Green's functions of the electromagnetic environment, the spontaneous emission of quantum emitters (luminescence) and their interactions (e.g., F\"orster energy transfer) can be conveniently tuned. In this paper, we designed a matched nanoparticle-on-mirror antenna pair with enhanced DDI guided by surface plasmon polaritons confined to the metal substrate, which ensures concentrated and enhanced interaction over long ranges of tens of wavelengths. The long-range ($\sim 10 \lambda$) DDI between donor-acceptor emitters is enhanced by $6\times 10^{3}$ times respective to bare gold film, and $4.4\times 10^{4}$ times respective to vacuum. Our result provides a promising testbed for investigating long-range DDI phenomena on the nanoscale.</description>
