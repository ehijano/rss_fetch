      <title>ArgoLOOM: agentic AI for fundamental physics from quarks to cosmos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in modern physics has been supported by a steadily expanding corpus of numerical analyses and computational frameworks, which in turn form the basis for precision calculations and baseline predictions in experimental programs. These tools play a central role in navigating a complex landscape of theoretical models and current and potential observables to identify and understand fundamental interactions in physics. In addition, efforts to search for new fundamental interactions increasingly have a cross-disciplinary nature, such that understanding and leveraging interoperabilities among computational tools may be a significant enhancement. This work presents a new agentic AI framework, which we call ArgoLOOM, designed to bridge methodologies and computational analyses across cosmology, collider physics, and nuclear science. We describe the system contours, key internal aspects, and outline its potential for unifying scientific discovery pipelines. In the process, we demonstrate the use of ArgoLOOM on two small-scale problems to illustrate its conceptual foundations and potential for extensibility into a steadily growing agentic framework for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Perturbative unitarity for models with singlet and doublet scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete description of unitarity bounds on the gauge-scalar sectors of models with extra $SU(2)$ doublet, neutral singlet, and charged singlet scalars. Such additions are very frequent in models beyond the Standard Model, and, in particular, they are almost universal in models explaining the dark matter problem. We propose a specific classification and minimal set of scattering matrices containing all the relevant information. We also developed a Mathematica implementation of our results, BounDS, and we use it to fully study a number of simple cases, comparing with the literature, when available. The Mathematica notebook BounDS is provided via a public GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>A Limit on the Total Lepton Number in the Universe from BBN and the CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At temperatures below the QCD phase transition, any substantial lepton number in the Universe can only be present within the neutrino sector. In this work, we systematically explore the impact of a non-vanishing lepton number on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Relying on our recently developed framework based on momentum averaged quantum kinetic equations for the neutrino density matrix, we solve the full BBN reaction network to obtain the abundances of primordial elements. We find that the maximal primordial total lepton number $L$ allowed by BBN and the CMB is $-0.12 \,(-0.10) \leq L \leq 0.13\,(0.12) $ for NH (IH), while specific flavor directions can be even more constrained. This bound is complementary to the limits obtained from avoiding baryon overproduction through sphaleron processes at the electroweak phase transition since, although numerically weaker, it applies at lower temperatures and is obtained completely independently. We publicly release the C++ code COFLASY-C on GitHub which solves for the evolution of the neutrino quantum kinetic equations numerically.</description>

      <title>Surveying the complex three Higgs doublet model with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs are being measured with higher precision as the Run 3 stage of LHC continues. Models with multiple Higgs doublets allow potential deviations from the SM predictions. For more than two doublets, there are five possible types of models that avoid flavor changing neutral couplings at tree level by the addition of a symmetry. We consider a softly broken Z2xZ2 three-Higgs doublet model with explicit CP violation in the scalar sector, exploring all five possible types of coupling choices and all five mass orderings of the neutral scalar bosons. The phenomenological study is performed using a Machine Learning black box optimization algorithm that efficiently searches for the possibility of large pseudoscalar Yukawa couplings. We identify the model choices that allow a purely pseudoscalar coupling in light of all recent experimental limits, including direct searches for CP-violation, thus motivating increased effort into improving the experimental precision.</description>

      <title>Neutrino transition dipole moments in light of the KM3NeT event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, KM3NeT observed the highest energy neutrino seen to date. The most probable estimate places the energy of the neutrino at an extreme value of 220 PeV, and energies up to 2.6 EeV are contained in the $90\%$ probability interval. Even though the source of the signal cannot be ascertained with the available data, this observation already opens unique possibilities to test new physics. Here, we study the implications for the transition magnetic dipole portal connecting active and sterile neutrinos. We remain agnostic regarding the origin of the neutrino and focus on local effects. Concretely, we study the contribution of an efficient active to sterile transitions to the opacity seen on the path to the detector at Earth. We find that the ultra-high-energy neutrino event does not add relevant information for sterile neutrinos with masses less than a TeV. However, the observation becomes important at higher masses and can provide the leading constraint in that regime.</description>

      <title>Flavour Invariants of Multi Higgs Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a systematic way of analyzing the N Higgs Doublet Models flavor sector will be developed. We introduce a complete set of mixing matrices describing the rotation between certain suitably defined bases, akin to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, which describes the relation between the up-quark and down-quark mass bases. We point out the crucial importance played by the charged Higgs basis. It is also introduced for the first time a complete set of weak basis transformation invariant traces of flavor matrices for the general N doublets case. This will be important for studies of the renormalization group evolution in terms of relevant physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the $l^{-}l^{+}\nu \overline{\nu}$ final state at multi-TeV muon colliders through the exclusive decay of ZZ/WW gauge bosons in the Randall-Sundrum model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An attempt is made to present the effect of the exclusive decay of ZZ/WW gauge bosons at high energy colliders in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. In this paper, we investigate the $l^{-}l^{+}\nu \overline{\nu}$ final state at muon-TeV colliders through the exclusive decay of ZZ/WW gauge bosons in detail. The result shows that with fixed collision energies, cross-sections for $l^{-}l^{+}\nu \overline{\nu}$ production in final state depend strongly on the parameters of the unparticle physics, muon polarization coefficients, parameters on anomalous couplings and also KK-graviton propagators. With the benchmark background $(\Lambda_{U}, d_{U})$ $= (1 $TeV$, 1.9)$, the total cross-sections achieve the maximum value when both of muon beams polarize left or right. In case of the different polarization, the cross section increases as the collision energy increases. The numerical evaluation shows that the cross-section for $l^{-}l^{+}\nu \overline{\nu}$ final state through the exclusive decay of WW charged bosons is much larger than that of ZZ neutral bosons under the same conditions, which can be detected in the future muon collisions.</description>

      <title>Missing Beats: Dark Matter Silences Short-Period Cepheids in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming near-infrared facilities (e.g., JWST/NIRCam, ELT/MICADO) will dramatically increase the detectability of galactic center Cepheids despite extreme extinction at optical wavelengths. In this work, we study the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on Cepheid stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way. We show that at densities $\rho \sim 10^5 \, \text{GeV} \, \text{cm}^{-3}$, blue-loop evolution can be suppressed, preventing the formation of low-mass ($3$-$6 \, M_\odot$) short-period ($1$-$6$ days) Cepheids. A dearth of such variables could provide indirect evidence for DM heating. Notably, this effect occurs at lower DM densities than required to impact main-sequence stars. Future surveys will thus offer a novel, complementary probe of DM properties in galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Relations and Pole-Skipping in a Holographic Charmonium Model with Rotating Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a bottom-up holographic QCD model to investigate the dissociation of charmonium states moving in a rotating medium by calculating their quasinormal modes. We begin by reviewing the holographic quarkonium spectrum at zero temperature. Then, we derive the equations of motion for heavy vector mesons propagating in a rotating plasma, separating the analysis into longitudinal and transverse directions relative to the wave vector. Additionally, we compute the charge diffusion constant in the rotating background and analyze the pole-skipping phenomenon, which emerges in the retarded Green's function. Finally, we investigate the impact of rotation on the spin alignment of the J/psi state in the helicity frame, utilizing the spectral function obtained from the holographic framework.</description>

      <title>Beyond scalar QED radiative corrections: the $\rho^{\pm}-\rho^0$ width difference, FSR corrections and their impact on $\Delta a_{\mu}^{\rm HVP, LO}[\tau]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper arXiv:0708.3256 [hep-ph] we have calculated the radiative corrections to $\rho \to \pi\pi$ decays, aiming to estimate the width difference between charged and neutral rho mesons. There, we have used the scalar QED approximation and taken the convection terms to keep the loop contributions finite in the case of charged rho meson decays. Here we compute the radiative corrections by considering the electromagnetic structure of charged mesons and we also include the full Lorentz structure of the electromagnetic vertices. We re-evaluate the width difference of $\rho^{\pm}-\rho^0$ vector mesons and calculate the structure-dependent contributions to Final State Radiation terms in the $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ cross section. Both effects are important inputs for evaluating the isospin breaking corrections in the dominant hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon $g-2$ when using $\tau$ lepton data.</description>

      <title>Inverse magnetic catalysis in the linear sigma model: a beyond mean field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the restoration of chiral symmetry in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks under the influence of strong magnetic fields and finite temperature, incorporating screening effects through ring diagrams. While previous studies using tree-level thermal masses lead to magnetic catalysis across all temperature ranges, in tension with lattice QCD results, we go beyond this limitation by computing the bosonic masses self-consistently within the lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation. The self-consistent approach modifies the effective potential and allows us to accurately track the thermal evolution of the order parameter. Our results reveal the emergence of a critical end point (CEP) in the $T-|eB|$ phase diagram and, notably, exhibit inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) behavior: the (pseudo)critical temperature decreases with increasing magnetic field strength. This is in contrast to the magnetic catalysis behavior found when non-self-consistent masses are used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that self-consistent boson masses have been implemented in this context, offering a new framework for exploring the QCD phase diagram using effective models.</description>

      <title>Suppression of scalar perturbations due to a heavy axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast-rolling axion can transfer its kinetic energy to gauge fields via the Chern-Simons coupling, leading to copious production of gauge quanta during inflation. The amplified gauge fields act as a source for both scalar and tensor perturbations. In this work, we propose a mechanism for suppressing scalar perturbations while sourcing strong tensor perturbations. We present an implementation of such a mechanism, demonstrating that sourced tensor perturbations are expected to be detected by upcoming next-generation CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Flavor Imprints on Novel Low Mass Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Majorana scotogenic-like loop framework in which neutrino mass generation and dark matter stability are intrinsically connected to the breaking of the discrete flavor symmetry $A_4$. This breaking leads to the emergence of the scoto-seesaw mechanism and a $Z_2$ symmetry. This naturally explains the solar and atmospheric mass-squared differences, $\Delta m_{sol}^{2}$ and $\Delta m_{atm}^{2}$, while simultaneously ensuring dark matter stability. Our model accommodates normal ordering of neutrino masses, with a generalized $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry shaping the structure of leptonic mixing and a lower limit on the lightest neutrino mass. Moreover, the model provides predictions for the octant of $\theta_{23}$ and a strong correlation between $\Delta m_{sol}^{2}$ and $\Delta m_{atm}^{2}$. This correlation puts a lower bound on the fermionic DM mass. In contrast, scalar dark matter remains viable over a broad mass spectrum. A notable feature is that the low mass regime ($\sim 15$ GeV onwards) survives owing to the presence of efficient co-annihilation channels, which are typically absent in the Majorana scotogenic scenario. Additionally, the model aligns with current and future limits from lepton flavor violation experiments.</description>

Abstract: We report on the perturbative study, at next-to-leading order (NLO), of correlation functions at finite temperature of two chromoelectric fields connected by an adjoint Wilson line in Euclidean space. We find a source of asymmetry in two of the correlators studied. Finally, we compare the results with recent Lattice QCD calculations at high temperatures and show a good agreement between the two.</description>

Abstract: We compute the next-to-leading-power corrections in the $N$-jettiness variable to the production of a prompt photon and a jet at next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD in the $q \bar q$ annihilation channel. We employ the $k_\perp$ jet algorithm and assume that the $N$-jettiness value divided by the jet transverse momentum is the smallest parameter in the problem; in particular it should be small compared to the jet radius $R$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its discovery at the Tevatron in 1995, the top quark has been extensively studied due to its unique properties. We discuss how the remarkable progress in top-quark physics has opened the possibility of using the top quark as a tool to test quantum mechanics at the energy frontier. After reviewing the motivations for exploring beyond quantum mechanics, we present an example: probing post-quantum correlations at the energy frontier with boosted top quarks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the refined dark-photon exclusion bound from Dark SRF's pathfinder run. Our new result is driven by improved theoretical modeling of frequency instability in high-quality resonant experiments. Our analysis leads to a constraint that is an order of magnitude stronger than previously reported (corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio that is four orders of magnitude larger). This result represents the world-leading constraint on non-dark-matter dark photons over a wide range of masses below $6\,\rm \mu eV$ and translates to the best laboratory-based limit on the photon mass $m_\gamma&lt;2.9\times 10^{-48}\,\rm g$.</description>

      <title>Reheating with Thermal Dissipation and Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order for an inflationary universe to evolve into a hot universe, a process known as reheating is required. However, the precise mechanism of reheating remains unknown. We show that if the reheating is triggered by thermal dissipation effects, distinctive features appear in the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves. This suggests a possible way to observationally probe the physics of reheating.</description>

      <title>Neural Post-Einsteinian Test of General Relativity with the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries are excellent probes of gravity in the strong- and dynamical-field regime. We report a test of general relativity (GR) with the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) using the recently developed neural post-Einsteinian framework, both on individual events and at the population level through hierarchical modeling. We find no significant violation of GR and place a constraint that, for the first time, efficiently covers non-GR theories characterized by not only post-Newtonian deviations but also those beyond under the same theory-agnostic framework.</description>

      <title>Role of universal function of the nuclear proximity potential: A systematic study on the alpha-decay of heavy/super-heavy nuclei and {\alpha}-induced reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of the universal function is fundamental advantage of proximity potential model. We present a systematic study of the role of universal function of the proximity potential model on alpha decay process for 250 ground state to ground state transitions using WKB approximation. In order to realize this goal, five universal functions proposed in the proximity models gp 77, Guo 2013, Ngo 80, Zhang 2013 and Prox. 2010 have been incorporated into the formalism of Prox. 77. The obtained results show that the radial behavior of universal function affects the penetration probability of the {\alpha} particle. The theoretical {\alpha} decay half lives are calculated and compared with the corresponding experimental data. It is shown that the Prox. 77 with Guo 2013 universal function provides the best fit to the available data. The role of the different universal functions in the {\alpha} decay half lives of super heavy nuclei (SHN) with Z from 104 to 118 are also studied. It is shown that the experimental half lives in the super heavy mass region are described well using the Prox. 77 with Zhang 2013 universal function. In this paper, the validity of the original and modified forms of the proximity 77 potential is also examined for complete fusion reactions between {\alpha} particle and 10 different target nuclei. Our results show that the measured {\alpha} induced fusion reaction cross sections can be well reproduced using the Prox. 77 with Zhang 2013 universal function for the reactions involving light and medium nuclei. Whereas, the Prox. 77 with Guo 2013 universal function model demonstrates a reliable agreement with the experimental data at sub-barrier energies for heavier systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a newly developed hybrid hadronic transport + hydrodynamics framework geared towards heavy ion collisions at low to intermediate beam energies, and report on the resulting excitation function of dileptons. In this range of energies, it is unclear how to properly initialize the hydrodynamic evolution. Due to the cumulative electromagnetic radiation throughout the collision, dilepton observables are sensitive to the initial condition. In this work, we study how the dilepton ``thermometer'' is affected by employing dynamical initial conditions, in contrast to the traditional fixed-time approach.</description>

      <title>QED vacuum polarization in the Coulomb field of a nucleus: a method of high-order calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A calculation of the QED vacuum polarization potential in the Coulomb field of a pointlike nucleus was presented in an earlier publication by the author and his collaborators. Corrections up to order $\alpha^2 (Z\alpha)^7$ were evaluated, where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number and $Z\alpha$ is treated as an independent variable. These corrections correspond to two-loop Feynman graphs with proper propagators of fermions in the external field. The calculation employed a reduction to free QED, leading to free QED Feynman graphs with up to eight independent loops. The method of calculation is described here in detail.</description>

      <title>Search for dark matter around intermediate mass black holes with the H.E.S.S. experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses ranging from a hundred and a million solar masses, are hypothesised to be surrounded by dense regions of dark matter known as dark matter spikes, where the annihilation of dark matter particles could produce detectable gamma rays. The detection of dark matter annihilation around IMBHs therefore offers a promising approach for probing the nature of dark matter. In this work, we search for dark matter annihilation around IMBHs using data from the Galactic Plane Survey, the Extragalactic Survey and a selection of satellite galaxies observed by the H.E.S.S. gamma-ray experiment in Namibia. Since no evidence for a gamma-ray signal from dark matter annihilation around IMBHs has been found, we set upper limits on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross section for dark matter masses between 800 GeV and 100 TeV. Our analysis obtains limits on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross section below the thermal relic cross section for dark matter masses between 10 and 100 TeV.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter we introduce the $\theta$-dependence and the topological properties of QCD, features of the strongly interacting sector which give rise to the strong CP problem in the more general context of the Standard Model of particle physics. We discuss the analytical approaches that can be used to obtain qualitative, or in some cases quantitative, information on the $\theta$-dependence of QCD and QCD-like models, discussing their range of validity and comparing their predictions with the numerical results obtained by means of lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Predictions in modified Glauber model of total charged-particle yields centrality dependence in O+O and Ne+Ne collisions at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we present the results of application of the Monte Carlo modified Glauber model for the predictions of collision centrality dependence of the total charged-particle yields for 16O +16O and 20Ne+20Ne colliding systems at the LHC.
  Our model differs from the Standard Glauber model by the effective account of the energy losses in successive inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions. For this purpose, a single model parameter k is defined as a mean fraction of the momentum loss that happens in any binary nucleon collision due to the production of multiple particles. Therefore, the decrease of the nucleon momentum after each inelastic collision leads to a corresponding reduction of the inelastic cross section and the mean multiplicity yield in the subsequent interaction. All these effects are taken into account in the MC model in each of the subsequent inelastic binary interactions.
  We discuss the purely geometrical effects for these light colliding systems that could be considered useful in future studies of QGP properties in energy density scanning. Predictions in this single parameter model are based on the previous successful analysis of non-linear centrality dependence of charged particle yields observed in Pb+Pb collisions by ALICE at the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the recently released B-mode polarisation data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) favour a non-vanishing contribution of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin which is in tension with the previous BICEP-Keck (BK) measurements. Our analysis uses the third-order slow-roll primordial power spectra, with theoretically motivated priors, on the multifrequency SPT likelihoods complemented by the latest Planck satellite data products. The SPT measurements provide 1.0 bit of information gain on the first slow-roll parameter, which is higher than the 0.9 bit provided by BK even though the SPT sensitivity is five times lower. Moreover, the Bayesian dimensionality on the same parameter exceeds 1.5 for SPT versus 0.3 for BK showing that it is overconstrained by the SPT data. Even if this BB-tension could be the result of a yet to be understood foreground, our findings should motivate for a closer analysis of this unexpected B-modes excess.</description>

      <title>Application of the holographic equations of state for modeling experiments on heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for numerical modeling of the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions using a holographic equation of state. Machine learning methods were applied to address the regression and optimization issues during the calibration of the relevant parameters using the LQCD results for quark masses that approximate the physical values. Numerical simulations are performed using the iEBE-MUSIC and vHLLE-SMASH frameworks, which incorporate certain relativistic hydrodynamics solvers. We modify the code by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model and SMASH. Finally, the spectra of produced hadrons are computed using a hybrid iSS+UrQMD and Hadron Sampler+SMASH approaches at the freeze-out stage.12 p</description>

      <title>Resolving the W-Boson Mass in the Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10888v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2022, the CDF Collaboration reported the $W$-boson mass, $M_W=80.4335\pm0.0094~\mathrm{GeV}$, which deviates from the Standard Model (SM) prediction, $M_W^{\rm SM}=80.357\pm0.006~\mathrm{GeV}$, by about $7\sigma$. By contrast, the CMS Collaboration obtained $M_W=80.3602\pm0.0099~\mathrm{GeV}$, very close to the SM global electroweak fit value of $\sim80.357~\mathrm{GeV}$. Motivated by this situation, we reassess the $W$-boson mass within the Lepton-Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model (LS-2HDM). We perform random scans (generated with SARAH 4.13.0 and evaluated with SPheno 4.0.3) and confront the results with up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints. In the LS-2HDM, if $h_1$ is the SM-like Higgs at $m_{h_1}\simeq125$ GeV with $|\cos(\beta-\alpha)|\lesssim0.06$, $17\lesssim\tan\beta\lesssim39$, $144\lesssim m_{h_2}\lesssim414$ GeV, and $435\lesssim m_{A,H^{\pm}}\lesssim685$ GeV, the model reproduces the 2024 CMS $W$-boson mass within $3\sigma$. Solutions near the 2022 CDF value, $M_W=80.4335\pm0.0094~\mathrm{GeV}$, survive; however, after applying all constraints, including HiggsTools, they approach it at best within $\lesssim2\sigma$. Our findings emphasize that the LS-2HDM favors the CMS results consistently with the current experimental results. On the other hand, while one can accommodate also the CDF results in this model theoretically, up-to-date electroweak precision bounds on the oblique parameters $(S,T,U)$ together with the SM-like Higgs and LFU constraints exclude these solutions and our results for $W-$boson mass can be only as close as about $2\sigma$ to the CDF results.</description>

      <title>CGAN-Based Framework for Meson Mass and Width Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesons play a crucial role in understanding the strong interactionin the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, the mass and decay width of several ordinary and exotic mesons remain experimentally undetermined. In this work, we propose a novel application of advanced machine learning techniques to deal with this challenge. Due to the limited available meson datasets, traditional data-driven methods are norm To overcome this, we employ a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate synthetic meson data based on known physical parameters. This not only augments the dataset but also retain the underlying physics of the original mesons data. With the extended dataset, we train multiple copies of CGAN and apply a bagging technique to predict uncertainties, improving the robustness and reliability of the predictions. As our findings indicate, the CGAN models are capable of well describing meson properties and their structure relations, offering a potent novel instrument for hadron spectroscopy. This calculation opens a promising future for data-driven hadron physics studies.</description>

Abstract: We present a fit of the transverse momentum spectrum for Drell-Yan and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering data, based on transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization at N$^4$LL accuracy. Our analysis shows good agreement with the data and confirms the findings of previous studies. Based on this, we extract the unpolarized TMD parton distribution functions, the TMD fragmentation functions, and the Collins-Soper kernel. Compared to earlier works, our study incorporates several improvements, including large-$x$ resummation, flavor and fragmentation function dependence, among others. Additionally, we supplement our extraction with an analysis of the transverse momentum moments of the extracted distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate constraints from flavor changing rare meson decays to a light vector boson $X$, followed by the decay of the on-shell $X$ into the SM fermions. The flavor changing meson decay emitting the light $X$ is induced by loop processes where the up-type quarks, the $W$ boson, or charged scalar bosons are running inside loops. We calculate all one-loop diagrams with neglecting all masses of light quarks except for the top quark in a general anomaly free extra $U(1)$ model. Our theoretical evaluation of the branching ratio of charged $B$ meson decay and charged kaon decay is compared to experimental results, and we derive new constraints for dark photon, $U(1)_{B-L}$ and $U(1)_R$ models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the holographic s-wave superfluid model with 4th and 6th power self-interaction terms $\lambda |\psi|^4$ and $\tau |\psi|^6$ with considering the full back-reaction of the matter fields on the metric in the 3+1 dimensional bulk. The self-interaction terms are good at controlling the condensate to realize various phase transitions, such as the zeroth-order, first-order, and second-order phase transitions within the single condensate s-wave superfluid model. Therefore, in this work, we are able to investigate the influence of the back-reaction strength on the various phase transitions, including the zeroth and first order phase transitions. In addition, we confirm that the influence of the 4th and 6th power terms on the superfluid phase transition in the case of finite back-reaction are qualitative the same as in the probe limit, thus present universality. We also plot the special value $\lambda_s$ of the parameter $\lambda$ at different back-reaction strength, below which the condensate grows to an opposite direction and is important in controlling the order of the superfluid phase transitions. Comparing the influence of the back-reaction parameter and that of the higher-order nonlinear coefficients, we see that the back-reaction strength brings in both the effective couplings similar to the 4th power and 6th power terms.</description>

      <title>A short review of the vector charmonium-like state $\psi(4230)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a concise review of the vector charmonium state $\psi(4230)$, which was originally labelled as $Y(4260)$ in the literature. As one of the earliest candidates for a QCD exotic states, its interpretation has initiated various ideas about possible manifestations of non-perturbative mechanisms in the charmonium mass regime. In this short article we briefly review the experimental status of $\psi(4230)$ and discuss possible theoretical interpretations. We will focus on four broadly investigated scenarios, i.e. tetraquark, hybrid, hadro-quarkonium, and hadronic molecule, and highlight the key issues based on these approaches. Crucial experimental observables, e.g. mass position, lineshapes, di-lepton decay width $\Gamma_{ee}$, production rates in $B$ meson decays, dominant hadronic decay patterns, and the potential $1^{-+}$ and $0^{--}$ exotic partners, are assessed, which can provide crucial structure information for understanding this mysterious state.</description>

      <title>Inclusion of the Longitudinal Momentum-Transfer Component and Kinematic Factors in a diffraction approach for H(d,p)X Reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, within the framework of the Glauber-Sitenko approximation, an analysis of the differential cross section for deuteron breakup into a proton in the reaction H(d,p)X is presented. The study is carried out using various parameterizations of the deuteron wave function, including the single-Gaussian parametrization, the multi-Gaussian K2 parametrization, and models based on the Av18 and NijmI nucleon-nucleon potentials. Special attention is given to the effects of small longitudinal components of the transferred momentum (Qz &lt; 0.5 GeV/c) and the transverse momentum of the proton-neutron pair (p_perp &lt; 0.5 GeV/c) in the anti-laboratory reference frame. The results are compared with experimental data, particularly in the region of longitudinal momenta p\_3 = 0.25-0.5 GeV/c, where quark effects are expected to manifest. Preliminary estimates show a decrease in the cross section with increasing transverse momentum, as well as a relatively small shift (and growth) of the cross-section maximum due to the inclusion of the longitudinal component Qz.</description>

      <title>Confronting the production mechanisms of nuclei with deuteron and proton-triggered balance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ultra high-energy collisions, nuclei with very low binding energies are not expected to survive the dense and hot final state environment. The traditional view has therefore been that nuclei form via coalescence after the hot environment has dissipated. However, statistical thermal models, where hadrons are produced from a fireball at thermal equilibrium, can describe the relative abundances of light nuclei in pp and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC equally well. In this paper we investigate if balance functions triggered by protons and deuterons can be used to distinguish between the two production mechanisms. The coalescence model is investigated using PYTHIA, while the statistical thermal model is examined using the Thermal FIST package. We find that for both models the same simple relation between proton and deuteron triggered balance functions is applicable. However, there is a striking difference between the two models when the transverse momentum of trigger particles is varied. This dependence offers a promising observable to discriminate between the two production scenarios that goes beyond nuclei production. Furthermore, we find that deuteron-meson balance functions vanish identically for both models due to baryon number conservation and isospin symmetry.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cosmic-Ray Cooling in AGN from Dark Matter Deep Inelastic Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs) through the dark matter (DM) spikes of active galactic nuclei entails significant energy loss via interactions with DM. While previous studies of sub-GeV DM have focused on elastic scattering, this process becomes insufficient at higher proton energies and DM masses. In this work, we investigate the CR-DM deep inelastic scattering (DIS) as mediated by a vector portal. We calculate the DIS contribution to the CR energy loss rate and derive stringent exclusion limits on the CR-DM scattering cross-section for DM masses between $10^{-6}$ GeV and $1$ GeV. For higher CR energies and mediator masses, the resulting CR cooling timescales are reduced by orders of magnitude after involving the DIS contribution, producing stringent constraints that surpass most of current experimental limits.</description>

Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous in extensions of the Standard Model and offer a unifying framework on open problems in cosmology. Depending on their mass and interactions, axions can act as dark matter, drive cosmic acceleration as dark energy, or contribute to the relativistic background as dark radiation. Motivated by the plenary talk at TAUP 2025, this proceeding reviews the phenomenology of light bosons in the early and late Universe, with a focus on the theoretical foundations, observational signatures, and experimental prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent note [1], J. M. Cline criticised our idea that, besides the known Higgs boson with mass $m_h=$ 125 GeV, the Higgs field $\cal H$ could exhibit a relatively narrow, second resonance with theoretical mass $(M_H)^{\rm Theor} = 690\,(30)$ GeV. His criticism addresses both the basic theory part as well as our phenomenological analysis, in which we show that the characteristic, experimental signature of the proposed new resonance may already be visible in various LHC data. As for the comparison with experiment, Cline altogether ignores our most recent article [2], except for its title, and limits himself to just show an old plot from a preprint from five years ago. For this reason, as far as the phenomenology is concerned, there is nothing to reply to. Instead, we will briefly reply to his criticism on the theoretical part. Our conclusion is that Cline has completely ignored basic aspects of our work.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensation as a Unifying Mechanism for Special Spectra of Cosmic Gamma Rays and Low-Momentum Pion Enhancement at the Large Hadron Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding the internal structure of the proton is a fundamental challenge in physics. Historically, any new discovery about the proton has fuelled advances in several scientific fields. We have reported that gluons inside the proton accumulate near the critical momentum due to chaotic phenomena, forming gluon condensation. Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Inference of the Structure and Orbit of Milky Way Satellites with Semi-Analytic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-analytic modeling furnishes an efficient avenue for characterizing the properties of dark matter halos associated with satellites of Milky Way-like systems, as it easily accounts for uncertainties arising from halo-to-halo variance, the orbital disruption of satellites, baryonic feedback, and the stellar-to-halo mass (SMHM) relation. We use the SatGen semi-analytic satellite generator -- which incorporates both empirical models of the galaxy-halo connection in the field as well as analytic prescriptions for the orbital evolution of these satellites after they enter a host galaxy -- to create large samples of Milky Way-like systems and their satellites. By selecting satellites in the sample that match the observed properties of a particular dwarf galaxy, we can then infer arbitrary properties of the satellite galaxy within the Cold Dark Matter paradigm. For the Milky Way's classical dwarfs, we provide inferred values (with associated uncertainties) for the maximum circular velocity $v_{max}$ and the radius $r_{max}$ at which it occurs, varying over two choices of feedback model and two prescriptions for the SMHM relation that populate dark matter halos with physically distinct galaxies. While simple empirical scaling relations can recover the median inferred value for $v_{max}$ and $r_{max}$, this approach provides realistic correlated uncertainties and aids interpretability through variation of the model. For these different models, we also demonstrate how the internal properties of a satellite's dark matter profile correlate with its orbit, and we show that it is difficult to reproduce observations of the Fornax dwarf without strong baryonic feedback. The technique developed in this work is flexible in its application of observational data and can leverage arbitrary information about the satellite galaxies to make inferences about their dark matter halos and population statistics.</description>

Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions have recently emerged as a promising ``imaging-by-smashing'' approach that may reveal the intrinsic shapes of atomic nuclei. Here, I outline a conceptual framework for this technique, explaining how nuclear shapes are encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution, and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Modeling of acceleration in heavy-ion collisions: occurrence of temperature below the Unruh temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that extremely strong electric fields can be created in central collisions of heavy ions, due to which the Schwinger effect can be significant. A direct analogue of the electric field in hydrodynamics is the acceleration of the medium. Using the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) framework we model the Au-Au collisions at intermediate collision energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=4.5-11.5\,$GeV and obtain the spatial distribution of acceleration at different time moments. The present study demonstrates that extremely high acceleration of the order of 1 GeV may be generated in both central and non-central collisions, and that the distribution exhibits a core-corona structure. Consequently, in contrast to the case with an electric field, the Unruh effect is expected to be significant. It is demonstrated that for the confined phase the temperature is less than the Unruh temperature. Conversely, in the deconfined phase, the relationship is inverse. The obtained results thus support the prediction about the existence of states with $T&lt;T_U$ at the early stages of the collision and the associated complementary description of thermalization in terms of the novel phase transition at the Unruh temperature.</description>

      <title>DESI results: Hint towards coupled dark matter and dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scenario where a dark energy quintessence field $\phi$ with positive kinetic energy is coupled with dark matter. With two different self-interaction potentials for the field and a particular choice of the coupling function, we show explicitly how the observable effective equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ for the dark energy field crosses the phantom barrier ($w_{\rm eff} = -1$) while keeping the equation of state of the quintessence field $w_\phi &gt; -1$. With appropriate choices of parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$ crosses the phantom divide around redshift $z\sim 0.5$, transitioning from $w_{\rm eff} &lt;-1$ in the past to $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ today. This explains DESI observations well. Our analysis reveals that the model remains consistent within the $2\sigma$ confidence intervals provided by DESI for several combinations of the scalar field parameters, highlighting its potential in explaining the dynamics of dark energy arising from a simple Yukawa-type long-range interaction in the dark sector. While the current findings offer a promising framework for interpreting DESI observations, future work, including a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, is necessary to constrain the parameter space further and strengthen the statistical significance of the results.</description>

      <title>How much has DESI dark energy evolved since DR1?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DESI has reported a dynamical dark energy (DE) signal based on the $w_0 w_a$CDM model that is in conflict with Hubble tension. Recalling that the combination of DESI DR1 BAO and DR1 full-shape (FS) modeling are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, in this letter we comment on the status of fluctuations in DR1 BAO documented in \cite{DESI:2024mwx, Colgain:2024xqj} in the DR2 update. In particular, we note that neither DR1 BAO nor DR2 BAO nor DR2 BAO+CMB confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model with relaxed model parameter priors confirm late-time accelerated expansion today. Translating DESI BAO constraints into flat $\Lambda$CDM constraints, we observe that the LRG1 constraint remains the most prominent outlier, a distinction now held jointly with ELG1, LRG2 switches from smaller to larger $\Omega_m$ values relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM, and ELG data drive the relatively low $\Omega_m$ in the full DR2 BAO. We observe that one cannot restore $w_0 = -1$ within one $1 \sigma$ by removing either LRG1 or ELG1 or LRG2, but LRG2 in DR2, in contrast to LRG1 in DR1, now has the greatest bearing on $w_0 &gt; -1$. We conclude that BAO has yet to stabilise, but the general trend is towards greater consistency with DESI DR1 FS modeling results, where there may be no dynamical DE signal in DESI data alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gauge Theory Bootstrap [arXiv:2309.12402, arXiv:2403.10772] computes the strongly coupled pion dynamics by considering the most general scattering matrix, form factors and spectral densities and matching them with perturbative QCD at high energy and with weakly coupled pions at low energy. In this work, we show that further constraints on the spectral densities significantly reduce the possible solutions to a small set of qualitatively similar ones. Quantitatively, the precise solution is controlled by the asymptotic value of the form factors and SVZ sum rules. We also introduce an iterative procedure that, starting from a generic feasible point, converges to a unique solution parameterized by the UV input. For the converged solution we compute masses and widths of resonances that appear, scattering lengths and effective ranges of partial waves, low energy coefficients in the effective action. Additionally, we use these results to discuss the thermodynamics of a pion gas including pair correlations of pions with same and opposite charge.</description>

      <title>Generic EFT-motivated beyond General Relativity gravitational wave tests and their curvature dependence: from observation to interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a "dictionary" to expedite the identification of potential deviations in gravitational waveforms from those predicted by General Relativity (GR) during the inspiral phase of black hole binaries. Assuming deviations from GR can be described by a local Effective Field Theory (EFT) formulated in terms of curvature operators (and possibly additional scalar fields), this dictionary characterizes how deviations scale with the masses of the binary components and identifies the leading order Post-Newtonian corrections in generic theories constructed within the EFT framework. By establishing a direct connection between observations and candidate theories beyond GR, this dictionary also aids in distinguishing genuine physical effects from systematic errors. These results can be readily incorporated into essentially all existing tests for the inspiral regime and, in particular, facilitate a more efficient combination of data from multiple events.</description>

      <title>Detecting milli-Hz gravitational waves with optical resonators</title>

Abstract: We propose a gravitational wave detector based on ultrastable optical cavities enabling the detection of gravitational wave signals in the mostly unexplored $10^{-5}-1$ Hz frequency band. We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave detection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with current technology.</description>
