      <title>A deep learning approach to inverse medium scattering: Learning regularizers from a direct imaging method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to solve numerically the two-dimensional inverse medium scattering problem with far-field data. This is a challenging task due to the severe ill-posedness and strong nonlinearity of the inverse problem. As already known, it is necessary but also difficult numerically to employ an appropriate regularization strategy which effectively incorporates certain a priori information of the unknown scatterer to overcome the severe ill-posedness of the inverse problem. In this paper, we propose to use a deep learning approach to learn the a priori information of the support of the unknown scatterer from a direct imaging method. Based on the learned a priori information, we propose two inversion algorithms for solving the inverse problem. In the first one, the learned a priori information is incorporated into the projected Landweber method. In the second one, the learned a priori information is used to design the regularization functional for the regularized variational formulation of the inverse problem which is then solved with a traditional iteration algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments show that our inversion algorithms provide good reconstruction results even for the high contrast case and have a satisfactory generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Numerical study on hyper parameter settings for neural network approximation to partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) obtained by neural networks are highly affected by hyper parameter settings. For instance, the model training strongly depends on loss function design, including the choice of weight factors for different terms in the loss function, and the sampling set related to numerical integration; other hyper parameters, like the network architecture and the optimizer settings, also impact the model performance. On the other hand, suitable hyper parameter settings are known to be different for different model problems and currently no universal rule for the choice of hyper parameters is known.
  In this paper, for second order elliptic model problems, various hyper parameter settings are tested numerically to provide a practical guide for efficient and accurate neural network approximation. While a full study of all possible hyper parameter settings is not possible, we focus on studying the formulation of the PDE loss as well as the incorporation of the boundary conditions, the choice of collocation points associated with numerical integration schemes, and various approaches for dealing with loss imbalances will be extensively studied on various model problems; in addition to various Poisson model problems, also a nonlinear and an eigenvalue problem are considered.</description>

      <title>Using Co-Located Range and Doppler Radars for Initial Orbit Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With debris larger than 1 cm in size estimated to be over one million, precise cataloging efforts are essential to ensure space operations' safety. Compounding this challenge is the oversubscribed problem, where the sheer volume of space objects surpasses ground-based observatories' observational capacity. This results in sparse, brief observations and extended intervals before image acquisition. LeoLabs' network of phased-array radars addresses this need by reliably tracking 10 cm objects and larger in low Earth orbit with 10 independent radars across six sites. While LeoLabs tracklets are extremely short, they hold much more information than typical radar observations. Furthermore, two tracklets are generally available, separated by a couple of minutes. Thus, this paper develops a tailored approach to initialize state and uncertainty from a single or pair of tracklets. Through differential algebra, the initial orbit determination provides the state space compatible with the available measurements, namely an orbit set. This practice, widely used in previous research, allows for efficient data association of different tracklets, thus enabling the addition of accurate tracks to the catalog following their independent initialization. The algorithm's efficacy is tested using real measurements, evaluating the IOD solution's accuracy and ability to predict the next passage from a single or a pair of tracklets.</description>

      <title>On the impact of observation error correlations in data assimilation, with application to along-track altimeter data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation involves estimating the state of a system by combining observations from various sources with a background estimate of the state. The weights given to the observations and background state depend on their specified error covariance matrices. Observation errors are often assumed to be uncorrelated even though this assumption is inaccurate for many modern data-sets such as those from satellite observing systems. As methods allowing for a more realistic representation of observation-error correlations are emerging, our aim in this article is to provide insight on their expected impact in data assimilation. First, we use a simple idealised system to analyse the effect of observation-error correlations on the spectral characteristics of the solution. Next, we assess the relevance of these results in a more realistic setting in which simulated alongtrack (nadir) altimeter observations with correlated errors are assimilated in a global ocean model using a three-dimensional variational assimilation (3D-Var) method. Correlated observation errors are modelled in the 3D-Var system using a diffusion operator. When the correlation length scale of observation error is small compared to that of background error, inflating the observation-error variances can mitigate most of the negative effects from neglecting the observation-error correlations. Accounting for observation-error correlations in this situation still outperforms variance inflation since it allows small-scale information in the observations to be more effectively extracted and does not affect the convergence of the minimization. Conversely, when the correlation length scale of observation error is large compared to that of background error, the effect of observation-error correlations cannot be properly approximated with variance inflation. However, the correlation model needs to be constructed carefully to ensure the minimization problem is adequately conditioned so that a robust solution can be obtained. Practical ways to achieve this are discussed.</description>

      <title>Spectral Method for 1-D Neutron Transport Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient fully spectral approximation scheme for exploring the one-dimensional steady-state neutron transport equation. Our methodology integrates the spectral-(Petrov-)Galerkin scheme in the spatial dimension with the Legendre-Gauss collocation scheme in the directional dimension. The directional integral in the original problem is discretized with Legendre-Gauss quadrature. We furnish a rigorous proof of the solvability of this scheme and, to our best knowledge, conduct a comprehensive error analysis for the first time. Notably, the order of convergence is optimal in the directional dimension, while in the spatial dimension, it is suboptimal and, importantly, non-improvable. Finally, we verify the computational efficiency and error characteristics of the scheme through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Optimal $L^\infty$-error estimate for isoparametric finite element method in a smooth domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the isoparametric finite element method (FEM) for the Poisson equation in a smooth domain with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. Because the boundary is curved, standard triangulated meshes do not exactly fit it. Thereby we need to introduce curved elements if better accuracy than linear FEM is desired, which necessitates the use of isoparametric FEMs. We establish optimal rate of convergence $O(h^{k+1})$ in the $L^\infty$-norm for $k \ge 2$, by extending the approach of our previous work [Kashiwabara and Kemmochi, Numer.\ Math.\ \textbf{144}, 553--584 (2020)] developed for Neumann boundary conditions and $k = 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a space-time finite element method to discretize the parabolic initial-boundary value problem and extend its error analysis with refined estimates on unstructured space-time meshes. We establish higher-order estimates in three different norms, thereby supplementing existing research. Moreover, we obtain an optimal estimate in a norm stronger than that of the trial space. Finally, we present numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A BDF B-spline Method for a Nonlocal Tumor Growth Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a model for tumor growth using nonlocal velocity. We establish some results on the existence and uniqueness of the solution for a nonlocal tumor growth model. Many experiences show that tumor spheroid can be invariant by rotation and can guard the shape of the spheroid during the growth process in some particular cases. Here, we assume that the multiple components of the system are invariant by rotation. Then, we use the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) spline to solve the nonlocal system. To illustrate the effecienty of the proposed method, we performed numerical tests that simulate a tumor growth scenario. Such techniques may be used to provide informations on practical applications of the model.</description>

      <title>Online multidimensional dictionary learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dictionary learning is a widely used technique in signal processing and machine learning that aims to represent data as a linear combination of a few elements from an overcomplete dictionary. In this work, we propose a generalization of the dictionary learning technique using the t-product framework, enabling efficient handling of multidimensional tensor data. We address the dictionary learning problem through online methods suitable for tensor structures. To effectively address the sparsity problem, we utilize an accelerated Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) enhanced with an extrapolation technique known as Anderson acceleration. This approach significantly improves signal reconstruction results. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed method outperforms existing acceleration techniques, particularly in applications such as data completion. These results suggest that our approach can be highly beneficial for large-scale tensor data analysis in various domains.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Thermo-Mechanical Simulation of Laser Beam Welding Using High-Performance Computing: A Qualitative Reproduction of Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser beam welding is a non-contact joining technique that has gained significant importance in the course of the increasing degree of automation in industrial manufacturing. This process has established itself as a suitable joining tool for metallic materials due to its non-contact processing, short cycle times, and small heat-affected zones. One potential problem, however, is the formation of solidification cracks, which particularly affects alloys with a pronounced melting range. Since solidification cracking is influenced by both temperature and strain rate, precise measurement technologies are of crucial importance. For this purpose, as an experimental setup, a Controlled Tensile Weldability (CTW) test combined with a local deformation measurement technique is used.
  The aim of the present work is the development of computational methods and software tools to numerically simulate the CTW. The numerical results are compared with those obtained from the experimental CTW. In this study, an austenitic stainless steel sheet is selected. A thermo-elastoplastic material behavior with temperature-dependent material parameters is assumed. The time-dependent problem is first discretized in time and then the resulting nonlinear problem is linearized with Newton's method. For the discretization in space, finite elements are used. In order to obtain a sufficiently accurate solution, a large number of finite elements has to be used. In each Newton step, this yields a large linear system of equations that has to be solved. Therefore, a highly parallel scalable solver framework, based on the software library PETSc, was used to solve this computationally challenging problem on a high-performance computing architecture. Finally, the experimental results and the numerical simulations are compared, showing to be qualitatively in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Solving Bayesian inverse problems via Fisher adaptive Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preconditioned Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) is a widely used method in statistical applications, where the choice of the preconditioning matrix plays a critical role. Recently, Titsias \cite{Titsias2024} demonstrated that the inverse Fisher information matrix is the optimal preconditioner by minimizing the expected squared jump distance and proposed an adaptive scheme to estimate the Fisher matrix using the sampling history. In this paper, we apply the Fisher adaptive Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) to Bayesian inverse problems. Moreover, we provide a rigorous convergence rate analysis for the adaptive scheme used to estimate the Fisher matrix. To evaluate its performance, we use this algorithm to sample from posterior distributions in several Bayesian inverse problems. And compare its constructions with the standard adaptive Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (which employs the empirical covariance matrix of the posterior distribution as the preconditioner) and the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) algorithm. Our numerical results demonstrate show that the Fisher adaptive MALA is highly effective for Bayesian inversion, and significantly outperforms other sampling methods, particularly in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Conditional Stability of the Euler Method on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive nonlinear stability results for numerical integrators on Riemannian manifolds, by imposing conditions on the ODE vector field and the step size that makes the numerical solution non-expansive whenever the exact solution is non-expansive over the same time step. Our model case is a geodesic version of the explicit Euler method. Precise bounds are obtained in the case of Riemannian manifolds of constant sectional curvature. The approach is based on a cocoercivity property of the vector field adapted to manifolds from Euclidean space. It allows us to compare the new results to the corresponding well-known results in flat spaces, and in general we find that a non-zero curvature will deteriorate the stability region of the geodesic Euler method. The step size bounds depend on the distance traveled over a step from the initial point. Numerical examples for spheres and hyperbolic 2-space confirm that the bounds are tight.</description>

Abstract: We improve upon the current bound on convergence rates of the Gauss-Seidel, Kaczmarz, and more generally projection methods where projections are visited in randomized order. The tighter bound reveals a practical approach to speed up convergence by over-relaxation -- a longstanding challenge that has been difficult to overcome for general problems with deterministic Succession of Over-Relaxations.</description>

      <title>P-Order: A Unified Quantitative Framework for Analyzing Multivariate Iterative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose P-order (Power-order), a unified, norm-independent framework for quantifying the convergence rates of iterative methods. Standard analyses based on Q-order are norm dependent and require some uniformity of error reductions asymptotically. Although the Ortega--Rheinboldt R-order supports non-uniform (including non-monotonic sequences) and is norm-independent, it does not differentiate among various sublinear rates and has ambiguities for some superlinear rates. In contrast, our proposed framework parameterizes the convergence rate in direct analogy with asymptotic notations in combinatorial algorithm analysis (including little-$o$, big-$\Theta$, and little-$\omega$), thereby precisely distinguishing linear, sublinear (e.g., fractional-power and logarithmic), and superlinear regimes. We demonstrate the utility of P-order by analyzing fixed-point iterations, and we show that P-order can provide tighter bounds on the convergence rate than R-order for both sublinearly and superlinearly convergent fixed-point iterations and avoids some ambiguities in R-order. Furthermore, we present a refined analysis of Newton's method for nonlinear equations with a spectrum of sublinear and superlinear convergence rates.</description>

      <title>A fast Fourier spectral method for the linearized Boltzmann collision operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fast Fourier spectral method to compute linearized collision operators of the Boltzmann equation for variable hard-sphere gases. While the state-of-the-art method provides a computational cost O(MN^4 log N), with N being the number of modes in each direction and M being the number of quadrature points on a hemisphere, our method reduces the cost to O(N^4 log N), removing the factor M, which could be large in our numerical tests. The method is applied in a numerical solver for the steady-state Boltzmann equation with quadratic collision operators. Numerical experiments for both spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous Boltzmann equations have been carried out to test the accuracy and efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Ensemble optimal control for managing drug resistance in cancer therapies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of ensemble optimal control to derive enhanced strategies for pharmacological cancer treatment. In particular, we focus on moving beyond the classical clinical approach of giving the patient the maximal tolerated drug dose (MTD), which does not properly exploit the fight among sensitive and resistant cells for the available resources. Here, we employ a Lotka-Volterra model to describe the two competing subpopulations, and we enclose this system within the ensemble control framework. In the first part, we establish general results suitable for application to various solid cancers. Then, we carry out numerical simulations in the setting of prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy, yielding a computed policy that is reminiscent of the medical 'active surveillance' paradigm. Finally, inspired by the numerical evidence, we propose a variant of the celebrated adaptive therapy (AT), which we call 'Off-On' AT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop approximations for the Riemann zeta function that enable high-precision computation within the critical strip and other vertical strips. These approximations combine the main sum of the Riemann-Siegel formula with a simple approximation of the remainder term, which involves only elementary functions and certain precomputed coefficients obtained via Gaussian quadrature. Additionally, we provide approximations for the derivative of the Riemann zeta function and present extensive numerical evidence demonstrating the accuracy of these approximations.</description>

      <title>The turnpike control in stochastic multi-agent dynamics: a discrete-time approach with exponential integrators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the turnpike property in stochastic discrete-time optimal control problems for interacting agents. Extending previous deterministic results, we show that the turnpike effect persists in the presence of noise under suitable dissipativity and controllability conditions. To handle the possible stiffness in the system dynamics, we employ for the time discretization, integrators of exponential type. Numerical experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the advantages of exponential integrators over standard explicit schemes and confirming the effectiveness of the turnpike control even in the stochastic setting.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for semilinear partial integro-differential equations and its complexity analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09639v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for semilinear parabolic partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). We prove that the numerical approximation scheme converges to the unique viscosity solution of the PIDE under consideration. To that end, we derive a Feynman-Kac representation for the unique viscosity solution of the semilinear PIDE, extending the classical Feynman-Kac representation for linear PIDEs. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e. the computational complexity of the algorithm is bounded polynomially in the dimension $d$ and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. We also provide a numerical example in up to 10'000 dimensions to demonstrate its applicability.</description>

Abstract: We consider finite element approximations of unique continuation problems subject to elliptic equations in the case where the normal derivative of the exact solution is known to reside in some finite dimensional space. To give quantitative error estimates we prove Lipschitz stability of the unique continuation problem in the global H1-norm. This stability is then leveraged to derive optimal a posteriori and a priori error estimates for a primal-dual stabilised finite method.</description>

      <title>An accelerated Levin-Clenshaw-Curtis method for the evaluation of highly oscillatory integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient approximation of highly oscillatory integrals plays an important role in a wide range of applications. Whilst traditional quadrature becomes prohibitively expensive in the high-frequency regime, Levin methods provide a way to approximate these integrals in many settings at uniform cost. In this work, we present an accelerated version of Levin methods that can be applied to a wide range of physically important oscillatory integrals, by exploiting the banded action of certain differential operators on a Chebyshev polynomial basis. Our proposed version of the Levin method can be computed essentially in just $\mathcal{O}(\nu\log\nu)$ operations, where $\nu$ is the number of quadrature points and the dependence of the cost on a number of additional parameters is made explicit in the manuscript. This presents a significant speed-up over the direct computation of the Levin method in current state-of-the-art. We outline the construction of this accelerated method for a fairly broad class of integrals and support our theoretical description with a number of illustrative numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a continuous approach to computing the pseudospectra of linear operators with compact resolvent, following a 'solve-then-discretize' strategy. Instead of taking a finite section approach or using a finite-dimensional matrix to approximate the operator of interest, the new method employs an operator analogue of the Lanczos process to work with operators and functions directly. The method is shown to be free of spectral pollution and spectral invisibility, fully adaptive, nearly optimal in accuracy. The advantages of the method are demonstrated by extensive numerical examples and comparison with the traditional method.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for stochastic Galerkin approximations of elliptic random PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers stochastic Galerkin approximations of linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with stochastic forcing terms and stochastic diffusion coefficients, that cannot be bounded uniformly away from zero and infinity. A traditional numerical method for solving the resulting high-dimensional coupled system of PDEs is replaced by deep learning techniques. In order to achieve this, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which typically operate on the strong residual of the PDE and can therefore be applied in a wide range of settings, are considered. As a second approach, the Deep Ritz method, which is a neural network that minimizes the Ritz energy functional to find the weak solution, is employed. While the second approach only works in special cases, it overcomes the necessity of testing in variational problems while maintaining mathematical rigor and ensuring the existence of a unique solution. Furthermore, the residual is of a lower differentiation order, reducing the training cost considerably. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on several model problems.</description>

      <title>Local MALA-within-Gibbs for Bayesian image deblurring with total variation prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Bayesian inference for image deblurring with total variation (TV) prior. Since the posterior is analytically intractable, we resort to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. However, since most MCMC methods significantly deteriorate in high dimensions, they are not suitable to handle high resolution imaging problems. In this paper, we show how low-dimensional sampling can still be facilitated by exploiting the sparse conditional structure of the posterior. To this end, we make use of the local structures of the blurring operator and the TV prior by partitioning the image into rectangular blocks and employing a blocked Gibbs sampler with proposals stemming from the Metropolis-Hastings adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA). We prove that this MALA-within-Gibbs (MLwG) sampling algorithm has dimension-independent block acceptance rates and dimension-independent convergence rate. In order to apply the MALA proposals, we approximate the TV by a smoothed version, and show that the introduced approximation error is evenly distributed and dimension-independent. Since the posterior is a Gibbs density, we can use the Hammersley-Clifford Theorem to identify the posterior conditionals which only depend locally on the neighboring blocks. We outline computational strategies to evaluate the conditionals, which are the target densities in the Gibbs updates, locally and in parallel. In two numerical experiments, we validate the dimension-independent properties of the MLwG algorithm and demonstrate its superior performance over MALA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a numerical solution of Allen-Cahn equation with constant and degenerate mobility, with polynomial and logarithmic energy functionals, with deterministic and random initial functions, and with advective term in one, two, and three spatial dimensions, based on the physics-informed neural network (PINN). To improve the learning capacity of the PINN, we incorporate the energy dissipation property of the Allen-Cahn equation as a penalty term into the loss function of the network. To facilitate the learning process of random initials, we employ a continuous analogue of the initial random condition by utilizing the Fourier series expansion. Adaptive methods from traditional numerical analysis are also integrated to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed PINN. Numerical results indicate a consistent decrease in the discrete energy, while also revealing phenomena such as phase separation and metastability.</description>

      <title>Tensor train based sampling algorithms for approximating regularized Wasserstein proximal operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a tensor train (TT) based algorithm designed for sampling from a target distribution and employ TT approximation to capture the high-dimensional probability density evolution of overdamped Langevin dynamics. This involves utilizing the regularized Wasserstein proximal operator, which exhibits a simple kernel integration formulation, i.e., the softmax formula of the traditional proximal operator. The integration, performed in $\mathbb{R}^d$, poses a challenge in practical scenarios, making the algorithm practically implementable only with the aid of TT approximation. In the specific context of Gaussian distributions, we rigorously establish the unbiasedness and linear convergence of our sampling algorithm towards the target distribution. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we apply them to various scenarios, including Gaussian families, Gaussian mixtures, bimodal distributions, and Bayesian inverse problems in numerical examples. The sampling algorithm exhibits superior accuracy and faster convergence when compared to classical Langevin dynamics-type sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Predicting the statistical error of analog particle tracing Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large particle systems are often described by high-dimensional (linear) kinetic equations that are simulated using Monte Carlo methods for which the asymptotic convergence rate is independent of the dimensionality. Even though the asymptotic convergence rate is known, predicting the actual value of the statistical error remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we show how the statistical error of an analog particle tracing Monte Carlo method can be calculated (expensive) and predicted a priori (cheap) when estimating quantities of interest (QoI) on a histogram. We consider two types of QoI estimators: point estimators for which each particle provides one independent contribution to the QoI estimates, and analog estimators for which each particle provides multiple correlated contributions to the QoI estimates. The developed statistical error predictors can be applied to other QoI estimators and nonanalog simulation routines as well. The error analysis is based on interpreting the number of particle visits to a histogram bin as the result of a (correlated) binomial experiment. The resulting expressions can be used to optimize (non)analog particle tracing Monte Carlo methods and hybrid simulation methods involving a Monte Carlo component, as well as to select an optimal particle tracing Monte Carlo method from several available options. Additionally, the cheap statistical error predictors can be used to determine a priori the number of particles N that is needed to reach a desired accuracy. We illustrate the theory using a linear kinetic equation describing neutral particles in the plasma edge of a fusion device and show numerical results. The code used to perform the numerical experiments is openly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kalman filtering and smoothing are the foundational mechanisms for efficient inference in Gauss-Markov models. However, their time and memory complexities scale prohibitively with the size of the state space. This is particularly problematic in spatiotemporal regression problems, where the state dimension scales with the number of spatial observations. Existing approximate frameworks leverage low-rank approximations of the covariance matrix. But since they do not model the error introduced by the computational approximation, their predictive uncertainty estimates can be overly optimistic. In this work, we propose a probabilistic numerical method for inference in high-dimensional Gauss-Markov models which mitigates these scaling issues. Our matrix-free iterative algorithm leverages GPU acceleration and crucially enables a tunable trade-off between computational cost and predictive uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method on a large-scale climate dataset.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the problem of enforcing a desired centrality measure in complex networks, while still keeping the original pattern of the network. Specifically, by representing the network as a graph with suitable nodes and weighted edges, we focus on computing the smallest perturbation on the weights required to obtain a prescribed PageRank or Katz centrality index for the nodes. Our approach relies on optimization procedures that scale with the number of modified edges, enabling the exploration of different scenarios and altering network structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>OpenGERT: Open Source Automated Geometry Extraction with Geometric and Electromagnetic Sensitivity Analyses for Ray-Tracing Propagation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate RF propagation modeling in urban environments is critical for developing digital spectrum twins and optimizing wireless communication systems. We introduce OpenGERT, an open-source automated Geometry Extraction tool for Ray Tracing, which collects and processes terrain and building data from OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Global ML Building Footprints, and USGS elevation data. Using the Blender Python API, it creates detailed urban models for high-fidelity simulations with NVIDIA Sionna RT. We perform sensitivity analyses to examine how variations in building height, position, and electromagnetic material properties affect ray-tracing accuracy. Specifically, we present pairwise dispersion plots of channel statistics (path gain, mean excess delay, delay spread, link outage, and Rician K-factor) and investigate how their sensitivities change with distance from transmitters. We also visualize the variance of these statistics for selected transmitter locations to gain deeper insights. Our study covers Munich and Etoile scenes, each with 10 transmitter locations. For each location, we apply five types of perturbations: material, position, height, height-position, and all combined, with 50 perturbations each. Results show that small changes in permittivity and conductivity minimally affect channel statistics, whereas variations in building height and position significantly alter all statistics, even with noise standard deviations of 1 meter in height and 0.4 meters in position. These findings highlight the importance of precise environmental modeling for accurate propagation predictions, essential for digital spectrum twins and advanced communication networks. The code for geometry extraction and sensitivity analyses is available at github.com/serhatadik/OpenGERT/.</description>
