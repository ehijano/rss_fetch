      <title>Analysis of Solitons within the framework of the fractional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation utilizing Hirota bilinear method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of fractional order parameter $(\alpha)$ in nonlinear waves is examined in the fractional Zakharov-Kuznetsov (FZK) equation with the Hirota bilinear approach. Symbolic computation is used for all mathematical calculations. A significant impact of the fractional order parameter is found on the single and multi-soliton solutions. The fact that the structural change is noticeable when $\alpha$ is raised, is crucial to our investigation.</description>

      <title>Wave evolution within the Cubic Vortical Whitham equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the evolution of disturbances within the framework of the Cubic Vortical Whitham (CV-Whitham) equation, considering both positive and negative cubic nonlinearities. This equation plays important role for description of the wave processes in the presence of shear flows. We find well-formed breather-type structures arising from the evolution of depression disturbances with positive cubic nonlinearity. For elevation disturbances, the results are two-fold. When the cubic nonlinearity is negative, we show that the CV-Whitham equation and the Gardner equation are qualitatively similar, differing only by a small phase lag due to differences in the dispersion term. However, with positive cubic nonlinearity, the differences between the solutions become more pronounced, with the CV-Whitham equation producing sharper waves that suggest the onset of wave breaking.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed that a soliton resulting from nonlinearity can be pumped across an integer or fractional number of unit cells as a system parameter is slowly varied over a pump period. Nonlinear Thouless pumping is now understood as the flow of instantaneous Wannier functions, ruling out the possibility of pumping a soliton across a nonzero number of unit cells over one cycle when a corresponding Wannier function does not exhibit any flow, i.e., when the corresponding Bloch band that the soliton bifurcates from is topologically trivial. Here we surprisingly find an anomalous nonlinear Thouless pump where the displacement of a soliton over one cycle is twice the Chern number of the Bloch band from which the soliton bifurcates. We show that the breakdown of the correspondence between the displacement of a soliton and the Chern number arises from the emergence of a new branch of stable soliton solutions mainly consisting of two neighboring instantaneous Wannier functions. Furthermore, we find a nonlinearity-induced integer quantized Thouless pump, allowing a soliton to travel across one unit cell during a pump period, even when the corresponding band is topologically trivial. Our results open the door to studying nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons.</description>

      <title>Radial kinks in a Schwartzschild-like geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of a domain wall (kink) of the $\phi^4$ model in a radially symmetric environment defined by a gravity source. This source deforms the standard Euclidian metric into a Schwartzschild-like one. We introduce an effective model that accurately describes the dynamics of the kink center. This description works well even outside the perturbation region, i.e., even for large masses of the gravitating object. We observed that such a spherical domain wall surrounding a star-type object inevitably "collapses", i.e., shrinks in radius towards the origin and offer an understanding of the latter phenomenology. The relevant analysis is presented for a circular domain wall and a spherical one.</description>

      <title>Collisional Dynamics of Solitons and Pattern Formation in an Integrable Cross Coupled Nonlinear Schrodinger equation with constant background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics arising out of the propagation of light pulses with different polarizations through a condensate (referred to as a constant background field) with cross coupling described by a coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equation(NLSE) type equation. We then employ Gauge and Darboux transformation approach to bring out the rich dynamics arising out of the background field and cross coupling. The collisional dynamics of bright solitons is found to be inelastic. The constant background field is found to facilitate the periodic localization of light pulses during propagation. We have also unearthed breathers, bright-bright, bright-dark and dark-bright solitons of the coupled NLSE. While the amplitude of breathers oscillate with time as predicted, their maximum(or minimum) amplitude is found to remain a constant and the addition of cross coupling only contributes to the rapid fluctuations in its amplitude over a period of time. In addition, the reinforcement of cross coupling in the presence of constant wave field facilitates the interference of light pulses leading to interesting pattern formation among bright-bright, bright-dark and dark-bright solitons. The highlight of the results is that one obtains various localized excitations like breathers, bright and dark solitons by simply manipulating the amplitude of the constant wave field.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Behaviour of SIR Models with Cross-Diffusion and Vital Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary epidemiological models often involve spatial variation, providing an avenue to investigate the averaged dynamics of individual movements. In this work, we extend a recent model by Vaziry, Kolokolnikov, and Kevrekidis [Royal Society Open Science 9 (10), 2022] that included, in both infected and susceptible population dynamics equations, a cross-diffusion term with the second spatial derivative of the infected population density. Diffusion terms of this type occur, for example, in the Keller-Siegel chemotaxis model. The presented model corresponds to local orderly commute of susceptible and infected individuals, and is shown to arise in two dimensions as a limit of a discrete process. The present contribution identifies and studies specific features of the new model's dynamics, including various types of infection waves and buffer zones protected from the infection. The model with vital dynamics additionally exhibits complex spatiotemporal behaviour that involves the generation of quasiperiodic infection waves and emergence of transient strongly heterogeneous patterns.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Interface Laws of Turing Mixtures and Foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For cellular functions like division and polarization, protein pattern formation driven by NTPase cycles is a central spatial control strategy. Operating far from equilibrium, no general theory links microscopic reaction networks and parameters to the pattern type and dynamics. We discover a generic mechanism giving rise to an effective interfacial tension organizing the macroscopic structure of non-equilibrium steady-state patterns. Namely, maintaining protein-density interfaces by cyclic protein attachment and detachment produces curvature-dependent protein redistribution which straightens the interface. We develop a non-equilibrium Neumann angle law and Plateau vertex conditions for interface junctions and mesh patterns, thus introducing the concepts of ``Turing mixtures'' and ``Turing foams''. In contrast to liquid foams and mixtures, these non-equilibrium patterns can select an intrinsic wavelength by interrupting an equilibrium-like coarsening process. Data from in vitro experiments with the E. coli Min protein system verifies the vertex conditions and supports the wavelength dynamics. Our study uncovers interface laws with correspondence to thermodynamic relations that arise from distinct physical processes in active systems. It allows the design of specific pattern morphologies with potential applications as spatial control strategies in synthetic cells.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-induced phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemotaxis allows single cells to self-organize at the population level, as classically described by Keller-Segel models. We show that chemotactic aggregation can be understood using a generalized Maxwell construction based on the balance of density fluxes and reactive turnover. This formulation implies that aggregates generically undergo coarsening, which is interrupted and reversed by cell growth and death. Together, both stable and spatiotemporally dynamic aggregates emerge. Our theory mechanistically links chemotactic self-organization to phase separation and reaction-diffusion patterns.</description>

      <title>Coarsening dynamics of chemotactic aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auto-chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells along gradients in chemicals they secrete, is central to the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns in biological systems. Since the introduction of the Keller-Segel model, numerous variants have been analyzed, revealing phenomena such as coarsening of aggregates, stable aggregate sizes, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics. Here, we consider general mass-conserving Keller-Segel models, that is, models without cell growth and death, and analyze the generic long-time dynamics of the chemotactic aggregates. Building on and extending our previous work, which demonstrated that chemotactic aggregation can be understood through a generalized Maxwell construction balancing density fluxes and reactive turnover, we use singular perturbation theory to derive the full rates of mass competition between well-separated aggregates. We analyze how this mass-competition process drives coarsening in both diffusion- and reaction-limited regimes, with the diffusion-limited rate aligning with our previous quasi-steady-state analyses. Our results generalize earlier mathematical findings, demonstrating that coarsening is driven by self-amplifying mass transport and aggregate coalescence. Additionally, we provide a linear stability analysis of the lateral instability, predicting it through a nullcline-slope criterion similar to the curvature criterion in spinodal decomposition. Overall, our findings suggest that chemotactic aggregates behave similarly to phase-separating droplets, providing a robust framework for understanding the coarse-grained dynamics of auto-chemotactic cell populations and providing a basis for the analysis of more complex multi-species chemotactic systems.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Rotating Wall-Mode Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20541v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly rotating limit, we derive a balanced set of reduced equations governing the strongly nonlinear development of the convective wall-mode instability in the interior of a general container. The model illustrates that wall-mode convection is a multiscale phenomenon where the dynamics of the bulk interior diagnostically determine the small-scale dynamics within Stewartson boundary layers at the sidewalls. The sidewall boundary layers feedback on the interior via a nonlinear lateral heat-flux boundary condition, providing a closed system. Outside the asymptotically thin boundary layer, the convective modes connect to a dynamical interior that maintains scales set by the domain geometry. In many ways, the final system of equations resembles boundary-forced planetary geostrophic baroclinic dynamics coupled with barotropic quasi-geostrophic vorticity. The reduced system contains the results from previous linear instability theory but captured in an elementary fashion, providing a new avenue for investigating wall-mode convection in the strongly nonlinear regime. We also derive the dominant Ekman-flux correction to the onset Rayleigh number for large Taylor number, Ra ~ 31.8 Ta^(1/2) - 4.43 Ta^(5/12) for no-slip boundaries. We demonstrate some of the reduced model's nonlinear dynamics with numerical simulations in a cylindrical container.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a field-theoretical model that describes the interaction between kinks and antikinks and between kinks and other heterogeneous fields and impurities. We show that the long-range kink can tunnel through a barrier created by heterogeneous fields and impurities even when the energy of the center of mass of the kink is less than the height of the energy barrier. We also study the conditions under which the kink can pass freely through a disordered medium. We introduce the concept of "effective translational symmetry". We compare our results with those from recent papers published in this journal, where the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield property is discussed.</description>

      <title>Deep noise squeezing in parametrically driven resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we investigate white noise squeezing in the frequency domain of classical parametrically-driven resonators with added noise. We use Green's functions to analyse the response of the resonator to added noise. In one approach, we obtain the Green's function approximately using the first-order averaging method, while in the second approach, exactly, using Floquet theory. We characterize the noise squeezing by calculating the statistical properties of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of the resonator response to added noise. In the noise spectral density, we observe that the squeezing effects occur only at half the parametric pump frequency. Due to correlation, the squeezing limit of $-6$~dB can be reached even with detuning at the instability threshold in a single parametrically-driven resonator. We also applied our techniques to investigate squeezing in a system consisting a parametric resonator linearly coupled to a harmonic resonator. In this system, we obtained deep squeezing at around $-40$~dB in one of the quadratures of the harmonic oscillator response. Finally, we also showed that our analysis of squeezing based on Floquet theory can be applied to multiple coupled resonators with parametric modulation and multiple noise inputs.</description>

      <title>Phase-induced vortex pinning in rotating supersolid dipolar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the pinning of vortices for a stationary rotating dipolar supersolid along the low-density paths between droplets as a function of the rotation frequency. We restrict ourselves to the stationary configurations of vortices with the same symmetry as that of the array of droplets. In particular, such an analysis clearly reveals that vortices are not only pinned at local density minima, but instead their coordinates are smooth functions of the rotation frequency. Our approach to explaining such a behavior exploits the fact that the wave function of each rotating droplet acquires a linear phase on the coordinates. Hence, the relative phases between the nearest neighboring droplets allow us to predict the position of the vortices in the intermediate low-density region. Here, we show that for a droplet distribution forming a triangular lattice, the phases of three neighboring droplets are needed for the correct description of the vortex location. In particular, for our confined system, we demonstrate that the estimate accurately reproduces the extended Gross-Pitaevskii results in the spatial regions where the neighboring droplets are well-defined.</description>

      <title>The role of spatial dimension in the emergence of localised radial patterns from a Turing instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of localised radial patterns from a Turing instability has been well studied in two and three dimensional settings and predicted for higher spatial dimensions. We prove the existence of localised $(n+1)$-dimensional radial patterns in general two-component reaction-diffusion systems near a Turing instability, where $n&gt;0$ is taken to be a continuous parameter. We determine explicit dependence of each pattern's radial profile on the dimension $n$ through the introduction of $(n+1)$-dimensional Bessel functions, revealing a deep connection between the formation of localised radial patterns in different spatial dimensions.</description>
