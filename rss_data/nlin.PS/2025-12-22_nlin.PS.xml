      <title>Nonlinear skin breathing modes in one-dimensional nonreciprocal mechanical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in a one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon chain of classical oscillators coupled by asymmetric springs, akin to a mechanical analogue of the Hatano-Nelson model with onsite nonlinearity. Using multiple-scale analysis, we show that families of nonlinear skin breathing modes -- time-periodic, boundary-localized oscillations -- emerge from their linear counterparts at any nonreciprocal strength. We derive an explicit nonlinear frequency shift for these families of nonlinear breathing modes, showing its dependence on amplitude, nonlinearity type, lattice size, and nonreciprocity, and we predict the emergence of genuine skin end breathers at the boundary once their oscillation frequency and higher harmonics enter the spectral gaps of the linear spectrum. Numerical pseudo-arclength continuation confirms full families of solutions for both hardening and softening nonlinearities. Furthermore, the Floquet analysis shows that these modes can be either linearly stable or unstable, with Floquet eigenvectors exhibiting skin localization inherited from the asymmetric couplings. Our results extend the nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect from stationary modes to intrinsically time-periodic excitations, providing a pathway to engineer and control breathing modes in nonreciprocal mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Convection Patterns in Nonequilibrium Kawasaki Dynamics at Low Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a conservative stochastic lattice dynamics (Kawasaki dynamics) in contact everywhere in the bulk with a heat bath. Particles interact via an Ising Hamiltonian and phase separation occurs at low temperature. We drive the system out of equilibrium by imposing a temperature field that varies spatially on macroscopic scales while preserving local equilibrium. Under these conditions, the usual low-temperature long-range order is replaced by robust convection patterns, featuring regularly spaced stripe structures for suitable geometries. These nonequilibrium states differ markedly from those obtained in an equilibrium dynamics with the same local temperature profile. We develop a macroscopic description that captures these behaviors and provides a unified framework for understanding the observed patterns.</description>

      <title>Stability of parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Dirac solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear stability of two exact stationary solutions of the parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Dirac equation is investigated. Stability is ascertained through the resolution of the eigenvalue problem, which stems from the linearization of this equation around the exact solutions. On the one hand, it is proven that one of these solutions is always unstable, which confirms previous analysis based on a variational method. On the other hand, it is shown that sufficiently large dissipation guarantees the stability of the second solution. Specifically, we determine the stability curve that separates stable and unstable regions in the parameter space. The dependence of the stability diagram on the driven frequency is also studied, and it is shown that low-frequency solitons are stable across the entire parameter space. These results have been corroborated with extensive simulations of the parametrically driven and damped nonlinear Dirac equation by employing a novel and recently proposed numerical algorithm that minimizes discretization errors.</description>

      <title>Empirical Discovery of Multi-Scale Transfer of Information in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the time scales and information flow associated with multiscale energy transfer in a weakly turbulent system. This is done through a greedy optimization algorithm which finds the maximum conditional-mutual information across lagged embeddings of time series localized by wavenumber. For our chosen weakly turbulent system, the algorithm finds asymmetries in the information flow across wavenumbers, reflecting what are typically described as forward and inverse cascades. However, our approach goes beyond typical heuristic arguments and provides quantitative insight into the intricate multi-wave mixing dynamics necessary to maintain the steady statistical state characterizing weak turbulence. Our work then provides a novel, detailed, and fully nonlinear statistical analysis of a weakly turbulent system. The flexibility of our approach points to broader applicability in real-world data coming from chaotic or turbulent dynamical systems.</description>
