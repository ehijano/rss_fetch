      <title>St\"ackel problem for non-diagonal Killing tensors: Yano-Patterson lifts, algebra of strong symmetries and quadratic in momenta integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct integrable Hamiltonian systems such that functionally independent Poisson commuting integrals are quadratic in the momenta. Unlike the classical St\"ackel setting, we allow the associated self-adjoint $(1,1)$-tensors $K_\alpha$ to be non-diagonalisable and have Jordan blocks and points where the Segre characteristic changes. Our construction is covariant and is based on Nijenhuis geometry: starting from a gl-regular Nijenhuis operator $L$ and its symmetry algebra, we obtain a large class of such integrable systems in a coordinate-free and signature-independent way; it is explicit once we have chosen a gl-regular Nijnhuis operator. In the diagonalisable case, our construction reproduces the St\"ackel construction, and in dimension $n=2$ it recovers all known systems of this type; for $n\ge 3$ most of our systems are new. Finally, we establish applications to infinite-dimensional integrable systems of hydrodynamic type: namely, we show that for Killing $(1,1)$-tensors $ K_\alpha$ corresponding to our example the evolutionarly PDE system of hydrodynamic type $u_t = K_\alpha(u)u_x$ is integrable. We describe its symmetries, and use generalised reciprocal transformations to reduce it to a system with constant coefficient matrices.</description>

      <title>Integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded super-Liouville Equation and Induced $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded super-Virasoro Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for enlarging the construction of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded classical Toda theory from the class of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Lie algebras to the class of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Lie superalgebras. This scheme is applied to derive a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extension of the super-Liouville equation based on a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extension of $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2).$ The mathematical tools employed in this work are a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded version of the zero-curvature formalism and of the Polyakov's soldering procedure. It is demonstrated that both methods yield the same $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded super-Liouville equation. An algebraic construction of solutions to the resulting equations is also presented, together with their B\"acklund transformations. Furthermore, three distinct new $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extensions of the super-Virasoro algebra are obtained via Hamiltonian reduction of the WZNW currents defined for $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-$\mathfrak{osp}(1|2).$</description>

      <title>Les Houches Lectures on Exact WKB Analysis and Painlev\'e Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first part of these lecture notes is devoted to an introduction to the theory of exact WKB analysis for second-order Schr\"odinger-type ordinary differential equations. It reviews the construction of the WKB solution, Borel summability, connection formulas, and their application to direct monodromy problems.
  In the second part, we discuss recent developments in applying exact WKB analysis to the study of Painlev\'e equations. By combining exact WKB analysis with topological recursion, it becomes possible to explicitly compute the monodromy of linear differential equations associated with Painlev\'e equations, assuming Borel summability and other conditions. Furthermore, by using isomonodromy deformations (integrability of the Painlev\'e equations), the resurgent structure of the $\tau$-function and partition function is analyzed.
  These lecture notes accompanied a series of lectures at the Les Houches school, ``Quantum Geometry (Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics)'' in Summer 2024.</description>

      <title>Frequency Extraction from Invariant Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In non-degenerate integrable Hamiltonian systems, invariant tori can be parameterized equivalently by action variables or by their fundamental frequencies. We introduce an invariant-flow formulation for extracting fundamental frequencies of integrable Hamiltonian systems. By treating invariants as generators of commuting Hamiltonian flows, the frequencies are obtained from time-of-flight parameters along these flows, providing a direct alternative to action-angle constructions and spectral methods based on long time series. The approach yields an explicit numerical procedure that extends naturally to systems with multiple degrees of freedom. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using the McMillan map, where machine-precision accuracy is achieved.</description>
