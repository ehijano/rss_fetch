      <title>Design, Fabrication, Characterization, and Testing of a Bias Supply Circuit for Silicon Photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04510v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To assess the viability of a shallow-depth neutrino detector, a Cosmic Muon Veto Detector (CMVD) is being constructed on top of the stack of Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detectors at TIFR, Mumbai. The CMVD employs extruded plastic scintillators for muon detection, with wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for signal readout. A highly stable, low-noise power source is essential for biasing the SiPMs, as the precision, accuracy, and stability of the supply directly impact the consistency of their gain. To address this, we designed a biasing power supply capable of delivering 50-58 V in 50 mV steps, with a maximum short-circuit current output of 1 mA. The system incorporates digital voltage control, stabilization, and current monitoring, making it compatible with external controllers (such as microcontrollers). This added flexibility and modularity allow for additional functionalities, including temperature compensation. Designed to supply multiple SiPMs with close to breakdown voltages in parallel, the circuit seamlessly integrates with the front-end electronics of the detector system.</description>

      <title>Ponderomotive-expulsion: toward creating an electron-free volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a demonstration of a prototype approach to clear the laser focal volume of free electrons and disable their atomic and molecular sources. Employing two temporally separated, copropagating pulses, we exploited a pump-probe setup in our experiment. The pump ionized a low-density gas and expelled free and nascent electrons from its focal volume. The probe, traversing the same focal volume, expelled any remaining free and probe-induced nascent electrons. We gauged the effectiveness of the approach by capturing the spatial distribution of ejected electrons with image plates while we varied the relative intensity and time delay between the pump and probe. When we injected the pump 300 fs before the probe, we found the electron spatial distribution significantly altered and the yield suppressed, proving ponderomotive expulsion works. However, the yield was enhanced when we set the temporal spacing between the pump and probe to 150 fs. Simulations show the enhancement is due to Airy rings of the focused pump expelling electrons inward toward the propagation axis. Our results show that the complete removal of focal-volume electrons was inhibited by spatial overlap fluctuations and the stronger probe generating ionization outside the cleared-volume of the pump. We discuss ways to mitigate these impediments and propose alternate two-beam arrangements to achieve more efficient focal-volume clearing.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional vision sensors based on catadioptric systems with discrete infrared photoreceptors for swarm robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we fabricated and studied two designs for omnidirectional vision sensors for swarm robotics, based on catadioptric systems consisting of a mirror with rotational symmetry, eight discrete infrared photodiodes and a single LED, in order to provide localization and navigation abilities for mobile robotic agents. We considered two arrangements for the photodiodes: one in which they point upward into the mirror, and one in which they point outward, perpendicular to the mirror. To determine which design offers a better field of view on the plane, as well as detection of distance and orientation between two agents, we developed a test rail with three degrees of freedom to experimentally and systematically measure the signal registered by the photodiodes of a given sensor (in a single readout) from the light emitted by another as functions of the distance and orientation. Afterwards, we processed and analyzed the experimental data to develop mathematical models for the mean response of a photodiode in each design. Finally, by numerically inverting the models, we compared the two designs in terms of their accuracy. Our results show that the design with the photodiodes pointing upward resolves better the distance, while the other resolves better the orientation of the emitting agent, both providing an omnidirectional field of view.</description>

      <title>In-situ high voltage generation with Cockcroft-Walton multiplier for xenon gas time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have newly developed a Cockcroft-Walton (CW) multiplier that can be used in a gas time projection chamber (TPC). A TPC requires a high voltage to form an electric field that drifts ionization electrons. Supplying the high voltage from outside the pressure vessel requires a dedicated high-voltage feedthrough. An alternative approach is to generate the high voltage inside the pressure vessel with a relatively low voltage introduced from outside. A CW multiplier can convert a low AC voltage input to a high DC voltage output, making it suitable for this purpose.
  We have integrated a CW multiplier into the AXEL (A Xenon ElectroLuminescence detector), a high pressure xenon gas TPC to search for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe. It uses silicon photomultipliers to detect the ionization electrons through elecrtoluminescence, making it strong against electronic noise. Operation of the CW multiplier was successfully demonstrated; the TPC was operated for 40 days at 6.8 bar, and an energy resolution as high as (0.67 $\pm$ 0.08) % (FWHM) at 2615 keV was obtained.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic modeling and science reach of DMRadio-m$^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DMRadio-m$^3$ is an experiment that is designed to be sensitive to KSVZ and DFSZ QCD axion models in the 10--200\,MHz (41 neV$/c^2$ -- 0.83 $\mu$eV/$c^2$) range. The experiment uses a solenoidal dc magnetic field to convert an axion dark-matter signal to an ac electromagnetic response in a coaxial copper pickup. The current induced by this axion signal is measured by dc SQUIDs. In this work, we present the electromagnetic modeling of the response of the experiment to an axion signal over the full frequency range of DMRadio-m$^3$, which extends from the low-frequency, lumped-element limit to a regime where the axion Compton wavelength is only a factor of two larger than the detector size. With these results, we determine the live time and sensitivity of the experiment. The primary science goal of sensitivity to DFSZ axions across 30--200 MHz can be achieved with a $3\sigma$ live scan time of 2.9 years.</description>

      <title>A novel layered reconstruction framework for longitudinal segmented electromagnetic calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In future high-energy physics experiments, the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) will operate in exceptionally high-luminosity. An ECAL featuring layered readout in the longitudinal direction and precise time-stamped information offers a multi-dimensional view, enriching our comprehension of the showering process of electromagnetic particles in high-luminosity environments. And it is taken as the baseline design for several new experiments, including the planned upgrades of the current running experiments. Reconstructing and matching the multi-dimensional information across different layers poses new challenges in utilizing layered data effectively. This work introduces a novel layered reconstruction framework for the ECAL with a layered readout information structure and develops the layered clustering algorithm. It expands the concept of clusters from planes to multiple layers. Additionally, this work presents the corresponding layered cluster correction methods, investigates the transverse shower profile, which is utilized for overlapping clusters splitting, and develops the layered merged $\pi^0$ reconstruction algorithm based on this framework. By incorporating energy and time information in 3-dimension, this framework provides a suitable software platform for the preliminary research of longitudinal segmented ECAL and new perspectives in physics analysis.</description>
