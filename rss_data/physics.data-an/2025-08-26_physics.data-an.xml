      <title>Assessing Convergence Patterns Across Modern Nucleon-Nucleon Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BUQEYE model for correlated effective field theory (EFT) truncation errors assumes a regular pattern of dimensionless coefficients extracted from order-by-order observable calculations. This enables results from lower orders to inform statistical predictions for error estimates of omitted higher orders. We test the model for multiple chiral EFT ($\chi$EFT) nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials using a suite of six common NN scattering observables represented as functions of relative momentum and scattering angle. First, we flag irregularity in the convergence patterns of potentials with so-called "soft" regulator scales, namely that the sizes of the coefficients in the observables' expansions are mismatched between the even and odd orders. Second, we test the BUQEYE model's assumption of Gaussian process (GP) stationarity against the data and find that the GP's correlation structure as encoded in its length scale is nonstationary: The GP length scale in the angular dimension $\ell_{\theta}$ is approximately inversely proportional to the relative momentum of the scattering process. After we remediate this issue by allowing $\ell_{\theta}$ to vary with momentum, diagnostics show significant improvement, validating the application of the BUQEYE model after this modification. Third, we find that good performance of the BUQEYE model relies on properly choosing the $\chi$EFT breakdown scale $\Lambda_{b}$. With $m_{\text{eff}}$ held fixed at the physical pion mass we find $\Lambda_{b}=600$--$750$ MeV for various N$^{3}$LO interactions. Statistically consistent distributions for $\Lambda_{b}$ across orders are only found for the SMS potential at a regulator scale of 450 or 500 MeV. All our results can be reproduced using a publicly available Jupyter notebook, which can be straightforwardly modified to analyze other $\chi$EFT NN potentials.</description>

      <title>Lost Data in Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. More than 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation remain unused. Of the more than 150000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. Thus, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as &gt;90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article.</description>

      <title>Deep learning of phase transitions with minimal examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past several years, there have been many studies demonstrating the ability of deep neural networks to identify phase transitions in many physical systems, notably in classical statistical physics systems. One often finds that the prediction of deep learning methods trained on many ensembles below and above the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ behaves similarly to an order parameter, and this analogy has been successfully used to locate $T_{\rm c}$ and estimate universal critical exponents. In this work, we pay particular attention to the ability of a convolutional neural network to capture these critical parameters for the 2-$d$ Ising model when the network is trained on configurations at $T=0$ and $T=\infty$ only. We directly compare its output to the same network trained at multiple temperatures below and above $T_{\rm c}$ to gain understanding of how this extreme restriction of training data can impact a neural network's ability to classify phases. We find that the network trained on two temperatures is still able to identify $T_{\rm c}$ and $\nu$, while the extraction of $\gamma$ becomes more challenging.</description>

      <title>Unbinned inclusive cross-section measurements with machine-learned systematic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel methodology for addressing systematic uncertainties in unbinned inclusive cross-section measurements and related collider-based inference problems. Our approach incorporates known analytic dependencies on parameters of interest, including signal strengths and nuisance parameters. When these dependencies are unknown, as is frequently the case for systematic uncertainties, dedicated neural network parametrizations provide an approximation that is trained on simulated data. The resulting machine-learned surrogate captures the complete parameter dependence of the likelihood ratio, providing a near-optimal test statistic. As a case study, we perform a first-principles inclusive cross-section measurement of $\textrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau$ in the single-lepton channel, utilizing simulated data from the FAIR Universe Higgs Uncertainty Challenge. Results in Asimov data, from large-scale toy studies, and using the Fisher information demonstrate significant improvements over traditional binned methods. Our computer code ``Guaranteed Optimal Log-Likelihood-based Unbinned Method'' (GOLLUM) for machine-learning and inference is publicly available.</description>
