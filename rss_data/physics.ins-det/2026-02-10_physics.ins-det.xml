      <title>Split-Post Microwave Displacement Transducer with Quadratic Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a microwave cavity-based displacement readout employing a split-post geometry for measuring the motion of a dielectric membrane. The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer.</description>

      <title>Mutual Inductance Sensing SQUID: Cryogenic microcalorimeter based on mutual inductance readout of superconducting temperature sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting microcalorimeters, such as superconducting transition-edge sensors and magnetic microcalorimeters, have emerged as state-of-the-art detectors for x-ray emission spectroscopy by combining near-unity quantum efficiency with excellent energy resolution. Despite these achievements, their resolving power has not yet reached the level required to rival modern wavelength-dispersive grating or crystal spectrometers. Here, we introduce a next-generation SQUID-based microcalorimeter concept that exploits the strong temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of a superconductor operated close to its critical temperature. The resulting mutual-inductance-based readout enables in situ tunable signal amplification, while inherently avoiding hysteretic effects that commonly limit superconducting sensors. Experiments with prototype devices demonstrate robust and reproducible operation over a wide temperature range. Based on our measurements and modeling, we project that an energy resolution below 100meV should be achievable with an optimized absorber-sensor combination. This approach therefore represents a promising pathway towards next-generation cryogenic detectors for high-precision X-ray spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Geometry-driven impact of photosensor placement on S2-based XY reconstruction in a dual-phase argon TPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of the horizontal vertex $(x,y)$ from the S2 electroluminescence pattern is essential for fiducialization and background rejection in dual-phase argon time projection chambers. In this work, we perform a Geant4-based simulation study using the G4DS framework to investigate how detector geometry, in particular the distance between the top photodetector plane and the gas pocket, impacts S2-based XY reconstruction. A compact dual-phase argon TPC instrumented with seven Hamamatsu R8520-506 PMTs is simulated with electron recoils at 41.5 keV (corresponding to the ${}^{83m}\mathrm{Kr}$ calibration energy), as well as 1.0 keV to probe the low-S2 regime. The PMT array height is scanned from 0 mm to 50 mm, and XY positions are reconstructed using a geometrical solid-angle (GSA) method with the S2 emission modeled by 1 mm-thick slices across the 7 mm gas pocket. The results show a clear non-monotonic dependence of reconstruction bias and resolution on PMT height, driven by the trade-off between S2 light sharing and photon statistics. These findings provide guidance for geometry optimization in future low-threshold dual-phase argon detectors and will be validated with upcoming prototype measurements.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of the CERN ATLAS ITk MOPS Readout: A Feasibility Study on Production and Development Setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) necessitates a complete replacement of the ATLAS Inner Detector with the new Inner Tracker (ITk). This upgrade imposes stringent requirements on the associated Detector Control System (DCS), which is responsible for the monitoring, control, and safety of the detector. A critical component of the ITk DCS is the Monitoring of Pixel System (MOPS), which supervises the local voltages and temperatures of the new pixel detector modules. This paper introduces a dedicated testbed and verification methodology for the MOPS readout, defining a structured set of test cases for two DCS-readout architectures: a preliminary Raspberry Pi-based controller, the "MOPS-Hub Mock-up"(MH Mock-up), and the final production FPGA-based "MOPS-Hub" (MH). The methodology specifies the measurement chain for end-to-end latency, jitter, and data integrity across CAN and UART interfaces, including a unified time-stamping scheme, non-intrusive signal taps, and a consistent data-logging and analysis pipeline. This work details the load profiles and scalability scenarios (baseline operation, full-crate stress, and CAN Interface Card channel isolation), together with acceptance criteria and considerations for measurement uncertainty to ensure reproducibility. The objective is to provide a clear, repeatable procedure to qualify the MH architecture for production and deployment in the ATLAS ITk DCS. A companion paper will present the experimental results and the comparative analysis obtained using this testbed.</description>

      <title>U-Net Based Image Enhancement for Short-time Muon Scattering Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon Scattering Tomography (MST) is a promising non-invasive inspection technique, yet the practical application of short-time MST is hindered by poor image quality due to limited muon flux. To address this limitation, we propose a U-Net-based framework trained on Point of Closest Approach (PoCA) images reconstructed with simulation MST data to enhance image quality. When applied to experimental MST data, the framework significantly improves image quality, increasing the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) from 0.7232 to 0.9699 and decreasing the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) from 0.3604 to 0.0270. These results demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance low-statistics MST images, thereby paving the way for the practical deployment of short-time MST.</description>

      <title>Information Theory: An X-ray Microscopy Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray microscopy (XRM) is commonly used to obtain three-dimensional information on internal microstructure, but the imaging pipeline introduces noise, redundancy and information loss at multiple stages. This paper treats the XRM workflow as an information-processing system acting on a finite information budget. Using entropy, mutual information and Kullback-Leibler divergence, we quantify how acquisition, denoising, alignment, sparse-angle sampling, dose variation and reconstruction reshape the statistical structure of projection data and reconstructed volumes. Case studies based on the Walnut 1 dataset illustrate how these processes redistribute information and impose bottlenecks. We summarise the workflow using a unified information budget and show that mutual information provides a reconstruction-agnostic indicator of fidelity, supporting quantitative comparison and optimisation of XRM protocols, particularly under low-dose or time-constrained conditions</description>

      <title>Preprint: Sheath thickness measurements with the biased plasma impedance probe, Agreement with Child Langmuir scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma sheaths play a central role in plasma-surface interactions, yet their thickness remains challenging to measure experimentally. Although classical analytical models such as the Child-Langmuir (CL) sheath model provide clear predictions for sheath thickness, experimental validation has been limited because most diagnostics either rely on indirect, multi-step inference (e.g., Langmuir probes) or require invasive and technically demanding techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that the plasma impedance probe (PIP), when operated with a controlled DC bias, enables relatively direct, model-informed measurements of sheath thickness that are reasonably straightforward to implement experimentally. Across a range of discharge conditions, biased-PIP sheath thickness measurements are found to follow CL scaling closely, requiring a single, consistent empirical correction factor of $\alpha \approx 0.74$ to reconcile the measured thickness with CL predictions. Concurrent measurements of plasma density and electron damping show that probe biasing does not significantly perturb the bulk plasma density, supporting the validity of the biased-PIP approach. Building on this validation, we leverage the empirically determined $\alpha$ factor to extend the floating (unbiased) PIP analysis to obtain model-dependent estimates of electron temperature and plasma potential without electrical biasing. A side-by-side comparison demonstrates close agreement between floating-PIP results and those obtained from a biased Langmuir probe. Taken together, these results establish the PIP as a complementary diagnostic to the Langmuir probe, expanding the range of accessible plasma measurements while providing experimental support for classical sheath models.</description>

      <title>Dipole Localization Using An Integrated Radio Frequency Atomic Magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically-pumped atomic magnetometers have previously been used in arrays to reject interference from far away sources and enable the sensitive detection of local sources of radio frequency (RF) signals, useful, for instance, in the detection of low field NMR signals in an unshielded environment. We now demonstrate a complementary scheme in which four magnetometer measurements are used to locate in three dimensions a nearby radio frequency source. The methodology relies on the measurement of a radio frequency vector at two different positions and modeling the source as a magnetic dipole of known orientation. In contrast to coil detection, magnetometers have the advantage of measuring signals in a 2D plane, and do not inductively couple to their environment or each other, making them a strong candidate for localization of hidden RF sources. For this demonstration, we use only a single RF magnetometer to make four measurements of a synchronous and oriented dipole source, but it is to be expected that this could be replaced by four magnetometers working simultaneously. In addition, this work is greatly aided by the introduction of a fully integrated magnetometer, in which all optics, including lasers, are safely enclosed into a compact head with flexible wired connections. The portable, as well as safe, nature of the sensor make it quite valuable for in the field work.</description>

      <title>Search for Invisible Decay Modes in Nuclear Gamma Cascades of a ${}^{46}$Sc Source Using a CsI (Tl) Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in modern physics, motivating extensive searches for new light, weakly coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. Numerous experiments have probed a variety of dark matter candidates using diverse detector technologies, yet large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. In this work, we present a novel high-statistics search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $\gamma$ cascades, employing approximately 100~kg of CsI(Tl) scintillators at Texas A\&amp;M University. The key feature of this experiment is the use of a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source combined with a "missing gamma" technique, in which the absence of a photon in a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance--disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, thereby enabling sensitivity to weaker couplings. With approximately 1000~hours of data collected using the current setup, no statistically significant excess was observed, consistent with existing constraints on dark-sector candidates such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), dark scalars, and dark photons in the sub-MeV mass range. This result highlights the sensitivity of the missing-gamma technique and motivates the development of a larger-scale detector with improved systematic control to extend dark-sector searches into previously unexplored regions of parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a new end-to-end experimental data streaming framework designed from the ground up to support new types of applications -- AI training, extremely high-rate X-ray time-of-flight analysis, crystal structure determination with distributed processing, and custom data science applications and visualizers yet to be created. Throughout, we use design choices merging cloud microservices with traditional HPC batch execution models for security and flexibility. This project makes a unique contribution to the DOE Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI) landscape. By creating a flexible, API-driven data request service, we address a significant need for high-speed data streaming sources for the X-ray science data analysis community. With the combination of data request API, mutual authentication web security framework, job queue system, high-rate data buffer, and complementary nature to facility infrastructure, the LCLStreamer framework has prototyped and implemented several new paradigms critical for future generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Low-noise Fourier Transform Spectroscopy Enabled by Superconducting On-Chip Filterbank Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historically employed spectroscopic architectures used for large field of view mapping spectroscopy in millimetere and sub-millimetre astronomy suffer from significant drawbacks. On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R~1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10--100 with surveys of $10^5$--$10^6$ spectrometer hours.</description>
