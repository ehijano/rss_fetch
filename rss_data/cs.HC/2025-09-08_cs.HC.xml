      <title>Computational Cognitive Modeling to understand the effects of Racializing AI on Human-AI cooperation with PigChase Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the continued anthropomorphization of AI systems, the potential impact of racialization during human-AI interaction is understudied. This study explores how human-AI cooperation may be impacted by the belief that data used to train an AI system is racialized, that is, it was trained on data from a specific group of people. During this study, participants completed a human-AI cooperation task using the Pig Chase game. Participants of different self-identified demographics interacted with AI agents whose perceived racial identities were manipulated, allowing us to assess how sociocultural perspectives influence the decision-making of participants in the game. After the game, participants completed a survey questionnaire to explain the strategies they used while playing the game and to understand the perceived intelligence of their AI teammates. Statistical analysis of task behavior data revealed a statistically significant effect of the participant's demographic, as well as the interaction between this self-identified demographic and the treatment condition (i.e., the perceived demographic of the agent). The results indicated that Non-White participants viewed AI agents racialized as White in a positive way compared to AI agents racialized as Black. Both Black and White participants viewed the AI agent in the control treatment in a negative way. A baseline cognitive model of the task using ACT-R cognitive architecture was used to understand a cognitive-level, process-based explanation of the participants' perspectives based on results found from the study. This model helps us better understand the factors affecting the decision-making strategies of the game participants. Results from analysis of these data, as well as cognitive modeling, indicate a need to expand understanding of the ways racialization (whether implicit or explicit) impacts interaction with AI systems.</description>

      <title>Transforming Fashion with AI: A Comparative Study of Large Language Models in Apparel Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fashion has evolved from handcrafted designs to automated production over the years, where AI has added another dimension to it. Nowadays, practically every industry uses artificial models to automate their operations. To explore their role, we examined three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) in multiple stages of textile manufacturing (e.g., sustainable choice, cost effectiveness, production planning, etc.). We assessed the models' ability to replicate garment design using certain parameters (fabric construction, shade, weave, silhouette, etc.). We compared the models in terms of different body types and functional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could evaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary modifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper analysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation and classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric construction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed other models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) score of approximately $0.2$. In fabric classification from images, we found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors (e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving approximately $80\%$ accuracy for base construction and $55\%$ for detailed construction. However, our results indicate that Deepseek faced significant challenges in generating and recognizing fabric images. Overall, all the models struggled to recognize complex fabric constructions and intricate designs from images, and relying too much on AI might hinder human creativity. We also observed that all three models performed effectively in providing recommendations and insights for fabric design in textual form.</description>

      <title>SePA: A Search-enhanced Predictive Agent for Personalized Health Coaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces SePA (Search-enhanced Predictive AI Agent), a novel LLM health coaching system that integrates personalized machine learning and retrieval-augmented generation to deliver adaptive, evidence-based guidance. SePA combines: (1) Individualized models predicting daily stress, soreness, and injury risk from wearable sensor data (28 users, 1260 data points); and (2) A retrieval module that grounds LLM-generated feedback in expert-vetted web content to ensure contextual relevance and reliability. Our predictive models, evaluated with rolling-origin cross-validation and group k-fold cross-validation show that personalized models outperform generalized baselines. In a pilot expert study (n=4), SePA's retrieval-based advice was preferred over a non-retrieval baseline, yielding meaningful practical effect (Cliff's $\delta$=0.3, p=0.05). We also quantify latency performance trade-offs between response quality and speed, offering a transparent blueprint for next-generation, trustworthy personal health informatics systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Idle Animation Believability: a User Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animating realistic avatars requires using high quality animations for every possible state the avatar can be in. This includes actions like walking or running, but also subtle movements that convey emotions and personality. Idle animations, such as standing, breathing or looking around, are crucial for realism and believability. In games and virtual applications, these are often handcrafted or recorded with actors, but this is costly. Furthermore, recording realistic idle animations can be very complex, because the actor must not know they are being recorded in order to make genuine movements. For this reasons idle animation datasets are not widely available. Nevertheless, this paper concludes that both acted and genuine idle animations are perceived as real, and that users are not able to distinguish between them. It also states that handmade and recorded idle animations are perceived differently. These two conclusions mean that recording idle animations should be easier than it is thought to be, meaning that actors can be specifically told to act the movements, significantly simplifying the recording process. These conclusions should help future efforts to record idle animation datasets. Finally, we also publish ReActIdle, a 3 dimensional idle animation dataset containing both real and acted idle motions.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Experiences From Working with Extended Reality in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) is increasingly used as a productivity tool and recent commercial XR devices have even been specifically designed as productivity tools, or, at least, are heavily advertised for such purposes, such as the Apple Vision Pro (AVP), which has now been available for more than one year. In spite of what marketing suggests, research still lacks an understanding of the long-term usage of such devices in ecologically valid everyday settings, as most studies are conducted in very controlled environments. Therefore, we conducted interviews with ten AVP users to better understand how experienced users engage with the device, and which limitations persist. Our participants report that XR can increase productivity and that they got used to the device after some time. Yet, a range of limitations persist that might hinder the widespread use of XR as a productivity tool, such as a lack of native applications, difficulties when integrating XR into current workflows, and limited possibilities to adapt and customize the XR experience.</description>

      <title>Exploring Situated Stabilities of a Rhythm Generation System through Variational Cross-Examination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates GrooveTransformer, a real-time rhythm generation system, through the postphenomenological framework of Variational Cross-Examination (VCE). By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct artistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum accompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack format, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The versatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the project. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we identify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system invariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its development. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive and analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing its value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped by users and contexts.</description>

      <title>Transition of car-based human-mobility in the pandemic era: Data insight from a cross-border region in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many transport authorities are collecting and publishing almost real-time road traffic data to meet the growing trend of massive open data, a vital resource for foresight decision support systems considering deep data insights. Using such a traffic count dataset, we explored the spatio-temporal transitions in the cross-country road traffic volumes in the context of modelling behavioural transitions in car-based human mobility. We developed a reproducible workflow for computing multi-dimensional variables of traffic flow. This study reports on individual car-based daily travel behaviour detected, before (2016-2018) and during the COVID pandemic (2019-2021), between Germany and neighbouring countries (Luxembourg, France and Belgium). In relevance to the net-zero carbon transition, further study should shed light on the interpolation and downscaling approaches at the comprehensive road-network level for identifying pollution hot spots, causal link to functional landuse patterns and calculation of spatial influence area. In the case of Luxembourg, the Bridges and Roads Authority has installed a large digital traffic observatory infrastructure through the adoption of sensor-based IoT technologies, like other European member states. Since 2016, they have provided high-performance data processing and published open data on the country's road traffic. The dataset contains an hourly traffic count for different vehicle types, daily for representative observation points, followed by a major road network. The original dataset contains significant missing entries, so comprehensive data harmonization was performed.</description>

      <title>Conversational AI increases political knowledge as effectively as self-directed internet search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational AI systems are increasingly being used in place of traditional search engines to help users complete information-seeking tasks. This has raised concerns in the political domain, where biased or hallucinated outputs could misinform voters or distort public opinion. However, in spite of these concerns, the extent to which conversational AI is used for political information-seeking, as well the potential impact of this use on users' political knowledge, remains uncertain. Here, we address these questions: First, in a representative national survey of the UK public (N = 2,499), we find that in the week before the 2024 election as many as 32% of chatbot users - and 13% of eligible UK voters - have used conversational AI to seek political information relevant to their electoral choice. Second, in a series of randomised controlled trials (N = 2,858 total) we find that across issues, models, and prompting strategies, conversations with AI increase political knowledge (increase belief in true information and decrease belief in misinformation) to the same extent as self-directed internet search. Taken together, our results suggest that although people in the UK are increasingly turning to conversational AI for information about politics, this shift may not lead to increased public belief in political misinformation.</description>

      <title>Combine Virtual Reality and Machine-Learning to Identify the Presence of Dyslexia: A Cross-Linguistic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish university students. In particular, the research investigates whether VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test, but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia, particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Approach to Grounding AI Model Evaluations in Human-derived Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria, aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors. Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills, such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.</description>

      <title>TalkToAgent: A Human-centric Explanation of Reinforcement Learning Agents with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However, there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models (LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator, Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.</description>

      <title>SpiderNets: Estimating Fear Ratings of Spider-Related Images with Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance, though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.</description>

      <title>SparkUI-Parser: Enhancing GUI Perception with Robust Grounding and Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives. Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SparkUI-Parser.</description>

Abstract: Automated web testing plays a critical role in ensuring high-quality user experiences and delivering business value. Traditional approaches primarily focus on code coverage and load testing, but often fall short of capturing complex user behaviors, leaving many usability issues undetected. The emergence of large language models (LLM) and AI agents opens new possibilities for web testing by enabling human-like interaction with websites and a general awareness of common usability problems. In this work, we present WebProber, a prototype AI agent-based web testing framework. Given a URL, WebProber autonomously explores the website, simulating real user interactions, identifying bugs and usability issues, and producing a human-readable report. We evaluate WebProber through a case study of 120 academic personal websites, where it uncovered 29 usability issues--many of which were missed by traditional tools. Our findings highlight agent-based testing as a promising direction while outlining directions for developing next-generation, user-centered testing frameworks.</description>

      <title>SciDaSynth: Interactive Structured Data Extraction from Scientific Literature with Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explosion of scientific literature has made the efficient and accurate extraction of structured data a critical component for advancing scientific knowledge and supporting evidence-based decision-making. However, existing tools often struggle to extract and structure multimodal, varied, and inconsistent information across documents into standardized formats. We introduce SciDaSynth, a novel interactive system powered by large language models (LLMs) that automatically generates structured data tables according to users' queries by integrating information from diverse sources, including text, tables, and figures. Furthermore, SciDaSynth supports efficient table data validation and refinement, featuring multi-faceted visual summaries and semantic grouping capabilities to resolve cross-document data inconsistencies. A within-subjects study with nutrition and NLP researchers demonstrates SciDaSynth's effectiveness in producing high-quality structured data more efficiently than baseline methods. We discuss design implications for human-AI collaborative systems supporting data extraction tasks. The system code is available at https://github.com/xingbow/SciDaEx</description>

      <title>Automatically Detecting Online Deceptive Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deceptive patterns (DPs) in digital interfaces manipulate users into making unintended decisions, exploiting cognitive biases and psychological vulnerabilities. These patterns have become ubiquitous across various digital platforms. While efforts to mitigate DPs have emerged from legal and technical perspectives, a significant gap in usable solutions that empower users to identify and make informed decisions about DPs in real-time remains. In this work, we introduce AutoBot, an automated, deceptive pattern detector that analyzes websites' visual appearances using machine learning techniques to identify and notify users of DPs in real-time. AutoBot employs a two-staged pipeline that processes website screenshots, identifying interactable elements and extracting textual features without relying on HTML structure. By leveraging a custom language model, AutoBot understands the context surrounding these elements to determine the presence of deceptive patterns. We implement AutoBot as a lightweight Chrome browser extension that performs all analyses locally, minimizing latency and preserving user privacy. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate AutoBot's effectiveness in enhancing users' ability to navigate digital environments safely while providing a valuable tool for regulators to assess and enforce compliance with DP regulations.</description>

      <title>DRIVE-T: A Methodology for Discriminative and Representative Data Viz Item Selection for Literacy Construct and Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The underspecification of progressive levels of difficulty in measurement constructs design and assessment tests for data visualization literacy may hinder the expressivity of measurements in both test design and test reuse. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes DRIVE-T (Discriminating and Representative Items for Validating Expressive Tests), a methodology designed to drive the construction and evaluation of assessment items. Given a data vizualization, DRIVE-T supports the identification of task-based items discriminability and representativeness for measuring levels of data visualization literacy. DRIVE-T consists of three steps: (1) tagging task-based items associated with a set of data vizualizations; (2) rating them by independent raters for their difficulty; (3) analysing raters' raw scores through a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement model. In this way, we can observe the emergence of difficulty levels of the measurement construct, derived from the discriminability and representativeness of task-based items for each data vizualization, ordered into Many-Facets construct levels. In this study, we show and apply each step of the methodology to an item bank, which models the difficulty levels of a measurement construct approximating a latent construct for data visualization literacy. This measurement construct is drawn from semiotics, i.e., based on the syntax, semantics and pragmatics knowledge that each data visualization may require to be mastered by people. The DRIVE-T methodology operationalises an inductive approach, observable in a post-design phase of the items preparation, for formative-style and practice-based measurement construct emergence. A pilot study with items selected through the application of DRIVE-T is also presented to test our approach.</description>

      <title>OPRA-Vis: Visual Analytics System to Assist Organization-Public Relationship Assessment with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of public opinions collected from digital media helps organizations maintain positive relationships with the public. Such public relations (PR) analysis often involves assessing opinions, for example, measuring how strongly people trust an organization. Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) hold great promise for supporting Organization-Public Relationship Assessment (OPRA) because they can map unstructured public text to OPRA dimensions and articulate rationales through prompting. However, adapting LLMs for PR analysis typically requires fine-tuning on large labeled datasets, which is both labor-intensive and knowledge-intensive, making it difficult for PR researchers to apply these models. In this paper, we present OPRA-Vis, a visual analytics system that leverages LLMs for OPRA without requiring extensive labeled data. Our framework employs Chain-of-Thought prompting to guide LLMs in analyzing public opinion data by incorporating PR expertise directly into the reasoning process. Furthermore, OPRA-Vis provides visualizations that reveal the clues and reasoning paths used by LLMs, enabling users to explore, critique, and refine model decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPRA-Vis through two real-world use cases and evaluate it quantitatively, through comparisons with alternative LLMs and prompting strategies, and qualitatively, through assessments of usability, effectiveness, and expert feedback.</description>

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents, powered by Large Foundation Models, have emerged as a transformative approach to automating human-computer interaction. These agents autonomously interact with digital systems or software applications via GUIs, emulating human actions such as clicking, typing, and navigating visual elements across diverse platforms. Motivated by the growing interest and fundamental importance of GUI agents, we provide a comprehensive survey that categorizes their benchmarks, evaluation metrics, architectures, and training methods. We propose a unified framework that delineates their perception, reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities. Furthermore, we identify important open challenges and discuss key future directions. Finally, this work serves as a basis for practitioners and researchers to gain an intuitive understanding of current progress, techniques, benchmarks, and critical open problems that remain to be addressed.</description>

      <title>StereoDetect: Detecting Stereotypes and Anti-stereotypes the Correct Way Using Social Psychological Underpinnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stereotypes are known to have very harmful effects, making their detection critically important. However, current research predominantly focuses on detecting and evaluating stereotypical biases, thereby leaving the study of stereotypes in its early stages. Our study revealed that many works have failed to clearly distinguish between stereotypes and stereotypical biases, which has significantly slowed progress in advancing research in this area. Stereotype and Anti-stereotype detection is a problem that requires social knowledge; hence, it is one of the most difficult areas in Responsible AI. This work investigates this task, where we propose a five-tuple definition and provide precise terminologies disentangling stereotypes, anti-stereotypes, stereotypical bias, and general bias. We provide a conceptual framework grounded in social psychology for reliable detection. We identify key shortcomings in existing benchmarks for this task of stereotype and anti-stereotype detection. To address these gaps, we developed StereoDetect, a well curated, definition-aligned benchmark dataset designed for this task. We show that sub-10B language models and GPT-4o frequently misclassify anti-stereotypes and fail to recognize neutral overgeneralizations. We demonstrate StereoDetect's effectiveness through multiple qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing benchmarks and models fine-tuned on them. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/KaustubhShejole/StereoDetect.</description>

      <title>First Steps Towards Overhearing LLM Agents: A Case Study With Dungeons &amp; Dragons Gameplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons &amp; Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.</description>

      <title>DiMo-GUI: Advancing Test-time Scaling in GUI Grounding via Modality-Aware Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies: dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.</description>

      <title>UI-TARS-2 Technical Report: Advancing GUI Agent with Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning, action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5. On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization to real-world interactive scenarios.</description>

      <title>PersonaTeaming: Exploring How Introducing Personas Can Improve Automated AI Red-Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming, that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods, shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between automated and human red-teaming approaches.</description>
