      <title>The ESPRESSO Redshift Drift Experiment I -- High-resolution spectra of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of QSO J052915.80-435152.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the temporal evolution in the redshift of distant objects, the redshift drift, is a probe of universal expansion and cosmology. We perform the first steps towards a measurement of such effect using the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of bright quasars as a tracer of cosmological expansion. Our goal is to determine to which precision a velocity shift measurement can be carried out with the signal-to-noise (S/N) level currently available and whether this precision aligns with previous theoretical expectations. A precise assessment of the achievable measurement precision is fundamental for estimating the time required to carry out the whole project. We acquire 12 hours of ESPRESSO observations distributed over 0.875 years of the brightest quasar known, J052915.80-435152.0 (z=3.962), to obtain high-resolution spectra of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, with median S/N of ~86 per 1 km/s pixel at the continuum. We divide the observations into two epochs and analyse them using both a pixel-by-pixel method and a model-based approach. This comparison allows us to estimate the velocity shift between the epochs, as well as the velocity precision that can be achieved at this S/N. The model-based method is calibrated using high-resolution simulations of the intergalactic medium, and it provides greater accuracy compared to the pixel-by-pixel approach. We measure a velocity drift of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest consistent with zero: $\Delta v = -1.25\pm 4.45 {\rm ms^{-1}}$, equivalent to a cosmological drift of $\dot{v}=-1.43\pm 5.09 {\rm ms^{-1}yr^{-1}}$ or $\dot{z}= (-2.19\pm7.77) \times 10^{-8}{\rm yr^{-1}}$. The measurement uncertainties are on par with the expected precision. We estimate that reaching a 99% detection of the cosmic drift requires a monitoring campaign of 5400 hours of integration time over 54 years with an ELT and an ANDES-like high-resolution spectrograph.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred Project: Modeling Baryon and Hot-Gas Fraction Evolution in Simulated Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryon fraction of galaxy clusters is a powerful tool to inform on the cosmological parameters while the hot-gas fraction provides indications on the physics of the intracluster plasma and its interplay with the processes driving galaxy formation. Using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from The Three Hundred collaboration of about 300 simulated massive galaxy clusters with median mass $M_{500}\approx7 \times 10^{14}$M$_{\odot}$ at $z=0$, we model the relations between total mass and either baryon fraction or the hot gas fractions at overdensities $\Delta = 2500$, $500$, and $200$ with respect to the cosmic critical density, and their evolution from $z\sim 0$ to $z\sim 1.3$. We fit the simulation results for such scaling relations against three analytic forms (linear, quadratic, and logarithmic in a logarithmic plane) and three forms for the redshift dependence, considering as a variable both the inverse of cosmic scale factor, $(1+z)$, and the Hubble expansion rate, $E(z)$. We show that power-law dependencies on cluster mass poorly describe the investigated relations. A power-law fails to simultaneously capture the flattening of the total baryon and gas fractions at high masses, their drop at the low masses, and the transition between these two regimes. The other two functional forms provide a more accurate description of the curvature in mass scaling. The fractions measured within smaller radii exhibit a stronger evolution than those measured within larger radii. From the analysis of these simulations, we conclude that as long as we include systems in the mass range herein investigated, the baryon or gas fraction can be accurately related to the total mass through either a parabola or a logarithm in the logarithmic plane. The trends are common to all modern hydro simulations, although the amplitude of the drop at low masses might differ [Abridged].</description>

      <title>Modified Newtonian Dynamics: Observational Successes and Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is an alternative to the dark matter hypothesis that attempts to explain the "missing gravity" problem in astrophysics and cosmology through a modification to objects' dynamics. Since its conception in 1983, MOND has had a chequered history. Some phenomena difficult to understand in standard cosmology MOND explains remarkably well, most notably galaxies' radial dynamics encapsulated in the Radial Acceleration Relation. But for others it falls flat -- mass discrepancies in clusters are not fully accounted for, the Solar System imposes a constraint on the shape of the MOND modification seemingly incompatible with that from galaxies, and non-radial motions are poorly predicted. An experiment that promised to be decisive -- the wide binary test -- has produced mainly confusion. This article summarises the good, the bad and the ugly of MOND's observational existence. I argue that despite its imperfections it does possess ongoing relevance: there may yet be crucial insight to be gleaned from it.</description>

      <title>Unified weak lensing constraints on the evolution of the mass -- X-ray luminosity relation for galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling relations between galaxy cluster properties are crucial for understanding cosmology and baryonic physics. Rigorous calibration of the $M-L_X$ relation, employing weak lensing mass and consistent statistical methodology, is challenging due to heterogeneous cluster samples. The release of LEGACY imaging data introduced the possibility of unifying the cluster selection. We present the all-sky extension of the CODEX catalog based on LEGACY data and introduce a Bayesian framework for calibrating the X-ray luminosity-mass relation, derived for 100 clusters with weak lensing mass measurements. Using the X-ray luminosity estimates for those clusters from ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) data, we perform a power-law fit to the $M-L_X$ relation. Furthermore, taking advantage of the recently released eROSITA data (eRASS1), we assess the impact of point source contamination on cluster fluxes for 42 clusters in the eRASS1 footprint. The RASS fit yields a slope of $\beta = 0.75 \pm 0.09$, 1.7$\sigma$ lower than the best self-similar prediction, with marginal evidence for the redshift evolution of the normalization ($\gamma = 0.65 \pm 0.43$). As for the eRASS1 analysis, the slope is substantially steeper, $\beta = 1.11 \pm 0.15$, and in further agreement with the prediction of self-similarity. No additional evolution is also seen ($\gamma = 0.004 \pm 0.790 $). While our results provide the practical means for cosmological studies of both RASS and eRASS data, the link to cluster physics is much cleaner after the cluster flux contamination is reduced. We also analyzed the impact of the selection function on calibration, finding that its full modeling is essential.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings as Dynamical Dark Energy: Novel Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings, topological defects predicted by high-energy theories, may contribute to the late-time expansion of the Universe, effectively mimicking dynamical dark energy. We investigate four phenomenological extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model involving a residual string network: (i) a non-relativistic component with positive energy density (Model~1), (ii) a velocity-dependent extension (Model~2), (iii) a non-relativistic string network with energy density allowed to take both positive and negative values (Model~3), and (iv) a general scenario with free energy and velocity parameters (Model~4). These models are constrained using \textit{Planck} CMB data, SDSS or DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae observations. Models~1 and~2 yield strong upper bounds on the string density, for example, $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}} &lt; 0.00901$ at 95\% CL from the CMB+DESI+DESY5 combination for Model~2, and mildly shift the inferred value of $H_0$ upward, though they are not favored by Bayesian evidence. For the same combination, the bulk velocity is bound as $v_{\mathrm{s}} &lt; 0.569$. Models~3 and~4 exhibit a consistent preference for slightly negative values of $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}}$, with CMB-only data yielding $\Omega_{\mathrm{s}} = -0.038^{+0.029}_{-0.022}$ and $v_{\mathrm{s}}&lt; 0.574$ in Model~4, and a best-fit improvement of $\Delta \chi^2 = -6.07$. However, these improvements are not sufficient to overcome the Occam penalty, and the Bayesian evidence continues to favor $\Lambda$CDM. These findings demonstrate the power of current data to constrain exotic energy components and encourage further exploration of string-inspired extensions to $\Lambda$CDM, particularly those involving negative-tension networks.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Superclusters and Their Complexes in the Cosmic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The richest and largest structures in the cosmic web are galaxy superclusters, their complexes (associations of several almost connected very rich superclusters), and planes. Superclusters represent a special environment where the evolution of galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters differs from the evolution of these systems in a low-density environment. The richest galaxy clusters reside in superclusters. The richest superclusters in the nearby Universe form a quasiregular pattern with the characteristic distance between superclusters 120 - 140 $h^{-1}$Mpc. Moreover, superclusters in the nearby Universe lie in two huge perpendicular planes with the extent of several hundreds of megaparsecs, the Local Supercluster plane and the Dominant supercluster plane. The origin of these patterns in the supercluster distribution is not yet clear, and it is an open question whether the presence of such structures can be explained within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This review presents a brief story of superclusters, their discovery, definitions, main properties, and large-scale distribution.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble parameter with the 21 cm brightness temperature signal in a universe with inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 21\,cm brightness temperature as a probe of the Hubble tension in the framework of an inhomogeneous cosmological model. Employing Buchert's averaging formalism to study the effect of inhomogeneities on the background evolution, we consider scaling laws for the backreaction and curvature consistent with structure formation simulations. We calibrate the effective matter density using MCMC analysis using Union 2.1 Supernova Ia data. Our results show that a higher Hubble constant ($\sim73$\,km/s/Mpc) leads to a shallower absorption feature in the brightness temperature versus redshift curve. On the other hand, a lower value ($\sim67$\,km/s/Mpc) produces a remarkable dip in the brightness temperature $T_{21}$. Such a substantial difference is absent in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings indicate that inhomogeneities could significantly affect the 21\,cm signal, and may shed further light on the different measurements of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Ito calculus meets the Hubble tension: Effects of small-scale electron density fluctuations on the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel formalism to include the effect of electron density fluctuations at ultra small scales (well below the sound horizon at last scattering) on the observed anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We treat the electron field as an independent stochastic variable and obtain the required ensemble-averaged photon Boltzmann equations using Ito calculus. Beyond changes to the average recombination history (which can be incorporated in the standard approach) our work identifies two new effects caused by the clumpiness of the medium. The first is a correction to the Thomson visibility function caused by correlations of the electron fluctuations along the line of sight, leading to an additional broadening of the visibility towards higher redshifts which causes extra damping and smearing of the CMB anisotropies. The second effect is a reduction of the effective scattering rate in the (pre-)recombination era that affects the photon transfer functions in a non-trivial manner. These new effects are subdominant in LCDM but can be significant in cosmologies with an early onset of structure formation (e.g., due to generation of enhanced small-scale power) as suggested by a number of indicators (e.g., the abundance of high redshift galaxies observed by JWST). We discuss the relevance of these new effects to the Hubble tension, finding that corrections which cannot be captured by simple modifications to the average recombination history arise. This highlights how important an understanding of the recombination process is in cosmological inference, and that a coordinated simulation and analysis campaign is required as part of the search for the origin of the various tensions in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with improved inverse distance ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.</description>

      <title>Bayesian reconstruction of primordial perturbations from induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of primordial black holes or other dark matter relics from amplified density fluctuations in the early universe may also generate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GW), carrying vital information about the primordial power spectrum and the early expansion history of our universe. We present a Bayesian approach aimed at reconstructing both the shape of the scalar power spectrum and the universe's equation of state from GW observations, using interpolating splines to flexibly capture features in the GW data. The optimal number of spline nodes is chosen via Bayesian evidence, aiming at balancing complexity of the model and the fidelity of the reconstruction. We test our method using both representative mock data and recent Pulsar Timing Array measurements, demonstrating that it can accurately reconstruct the curvature power spectrum as well as the underlying equation of state, if different from radiation.</description>

      <title>Attention-based Neural Network Emulators for Multi-Probe Data Vectors Part III: Modeling The Next Generation Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning can accelerate cosmological inferences that involve many sequential evaluations of computationally expensive data vectors. Previous works in this series have examined how machine learning architectures impact emulator accuracy and training time for optical shear and galaxy clustering 2-point function. In this final manuscript, we explore neural network performance when emulating Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization power spectra. We maximize the volume of applicability in the parameter space of our emulators within the standard $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter model while ensuring that errors are below cosmic variance. Relative to standard multi-layer perceptron architectures, we find the dot-product-attention mechanism reduces the number of outliers among testing cosmologies, defined as the fraction of testing points with $\Delta \chi^2 &gt; 0.2$ relative to \textsc{CAMB} outputs, for a wide range of training set sizes. Such precision enables attention-based emulators to be directly applied to real data without requiring any additional correction via importance sampling. Combined with pre-processing techniques and optimized activation and loss functions, attention-based models can meet the precision criteria set by current and future CMB and lensing experiments. For each of Planck, Simons Observatory, CMB S4, and CMB HD, we find the fraction of outlier points to be less than $10\%$ with around $2\times10^5$ to $4\times10^5$ training data vectors. We further explore the applications of these methods to supernova distance, weak lensing, and galaxy clustering, as well as alternative architectures and pre-processing techniques.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on small-scale primordial non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to the large-scale primordial power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$, which are strictly constrained, the small-scale $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ remain less restricted. Considering local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the PBH and SIGW caused by large-amplitude small-scale primordial power spectrum. By analyzing current observational data from PTA, CMB, BAO, and abundance of PBH, and combining them with the SNR analysis of LISA, we rigorously constrain the parameter space of $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Furthermore, we examine the effects of different shapes of the primordial power spectrum on these constraints and comprehensively calculate the Bayes factors for various models. Our results indicate that SIGW generated by a monochromatic primordial power spectrum are more likely to dominate current PTA observations, with the corresponding constraint on the primordial non-Gaussian parameter being $-10.0&lt;f_{\mathrm{NL}}&lt;1.2$.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Nature of Cosmological Effective Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of our intuition about Effective Field Theories (EFTs) stems from their formulation in flat spacetime, yet EFTs have become indispensable tools in cosmology, where time-dependent backgrounds are the norm. In this work, we demonstrate that in spacetimes undergoing significant expansion-such as accelerated FLRW and de Sitter backgrounds-the contributions of operators with mass dimension $\Delta$ to physical observables grow factorially with $\Delta$ at fixed couplings. This behavior stands in stark contrast to expectations from flat spacetime. As a result, the cosmological EFT expansion is generally asymptotic rather than convergent, even at tree level.
  To illustrate this phenomenon, we analyze simple toy models involving a massless or conformally coupled scalar field interacting with a heavy scalar with zero or infinite sound speed. We demonstrate that meaningful EFT predictions can still be extracted via appropriate resummation techniques, performed in both Fourier and Mellin-momentum space. In the infinite sound speed limit, where the heavy field is effectively non-dynamical, the resummed EFT reproduces the exact result of the full theory. In other cases, the EFT captures only the local part of the dynamics, omitting nonlocal terms, which are exponentially suppressed in the large-mass limit for the Bunch-Davies state.</description>

      <title>Bursty or heavy? The surprise of bright Population III systems in the Reionization era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the first, so-called Population III (Pop III), stars has for long remained largely unconstrained. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) finally opened new concrete prospects for their detection during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), notably providing promising observational constraints on the Pop III ultra-violet luminosity function (UVLF) at $z \sim 6.5$. These preliminary data hint towards an unexpected population of UV-bright Pop III sources, which challenges the prevailing view that Pop III star formation is confined to molecular-cooling mini-halos. Here we show that there are two families of models that can explain these surprising observations, either by allowing for late-time Pop III formation within massive, atomic-cooling halos (with halo masses up to $M_\mathrm{up}^\mathrm{III} \gtrsim 10^{10.5} ~\mathrm{M_\odot}$) or by invoking a highly bursty Pop III star-formation activity (with a stochasticity parameter $\sigma_\mathrm{UV}^\mathrm{III} \gtrsim 1.5$). In these scenarios Pop III systems would have to be either heavier or burstier than usually assumed, underscoring the need to reconsider common assumptions about Pop III star-formation sites, and the potential implications of JWST candidates for current and future observations.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested transmutation of a compact star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mechanism -- Magnetically Arrested Transmutation (MAT) -- to account for the observed absence of ordinary pulsars near the Galactic centre, a longstanding puzzle known as the missing pulsar problem and the over-representation of magnetic white dwarfs in the same region. In this scenario, compact stars capture and accumulate dark matter, eventually forming an endoparasitic black hole (EBH) of initial mass $M_0$ at their core. Although such EBHs generally grow by accreting host matter, we show that sufficiently strong core magnetic fields can establish pressure equilibrium, thereby stalling further accretion and halting the star's transmutation into a black hole. We derive the conditions for MAT to occur, identifying a critical parameter $\beta$, which encapsulates the interplay between the magnetic field strength, host matter density, and EBH mass. For $0 &lt; \beta \leq 4/27$, the growth of the EBH is arrested, limiting its final mass ($M_{\rm f}$) to $M_0 &lt; M_{\rm f} \leq 3/2 M_0$, whereas for $\beta &gt; 4/27$, full transmutation may ensue. This framework offers a plausible unified explanation for the absence of ordinary pulsars and the survival of the magnetar PSR J1745-2900, and the elevated population of magnetic white dwarfs, in the Galactic centre, and hence could be tested and should have implications for understanding dark matter and compact objects.</description>

      <title>GalSBI-SPS: a stellar population synthesis-based galaxy population model for cosmology and galaxy evolution applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys will enable unprecedented tests of the concordance cosmological model and of galaxy formation and evolution. Fully exploiting their potential requires a precise understanding of the selection effects on galaxies and biases on measurements of their properties, required, above all, for accurate estimates of redshift distributions n(z). Forward-modelling offers a powerful framework to simultaneously recover galaxy n(z)s and characterise the observed galaxy population. We present GalSBI-SPS, a new SPS-based galaxy population model that generates realistic galaxy catalogues, which we use to forward-model HSC data in the COSMOS field. GalSBI-SPS samples galaxy physical properties, computes magnitudes with ProSpect, and simulates HSC images in the COSMOS field with UFig. We measure photometric properties consistently in real data and simulations. We compare redshift distributions, photometric and physical properties to observations and to GalSBI. GalSBI-SPS reproduces the observed grizy magnitude, colour, and size distributions down to i&lt;23. Median differences in magnitudes and colours remain below 0.14 mag, with the model covering the full colour space spanned by HSC. Galaxy sizes are offset by 0.2 arcsec on average and some tension exists in the g-r colour, but the latter is comparable to that seen in GalSBI. Redshift distributions show a mild positive offset (0.01-0.08) in the mean. GalSBI-SPS qualitatively reproduces the stellar mass-SFR and size-stellar mass relations seen in COSMOS2020. GalSBI-SPS provides a realistic, survey-independent galaxy population description at a Stage-III depth using only parameters from the literature. Its predictive power will improve significantly when constrained against observed data using SBI, providing accurate redshift distributions satisfying the stringent requirements set by Stage IV surveys.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of primordial black hole accretion during early matter domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scenario in which primordial black holes (PBHs) form in a post-inflationary radiation-dominated (RD) phase and then experience significant accretion during a phase of early matter dominated (EMD). We show that PBH masses could grow by up to two orders of magnitude. Restricting to the linear perturbation regime, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum that features two peaks. The high-frequency peak is associated with the PBH formation in the RD phase, while the low-frequency peak is due to the sudden transition from EMD to the later, standard RD phase. We identify a PBH mass range where one or both peaks can be observed by a combination of different GW detectors. Finally, we show the signal-to-noise ratio of the total GW spectrum for PBHs in the asteroid mass window, where they could comprise the totality of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Spectral indices in active galactic nuclei as seen by Apertif and LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two new radio continuum images obtained with Apertif at 1.4 GHz. The images, produced with a direction-dependent calibration pipeline, cover 136 square degrees of the Lockman Hole and 24 square degrees of the ELAIS-N fields, with an average resolution of 17x12" and residual noise of 33 uJy/beam. With the improved depth of the images we found in total 63692 radio sources, many of which are detected for the first time at this frequency. With the addition of the previously published Apertif catalog for the Bootes field, we cross-match with the LOFAR deep-fields value-added catalogs at 150 MHz, resulting in a homogeneous sample of 10196 common sources with spectral index estimates, one of the largest to date. We analyze and discuss the correlations between spectral index, redshift, linear sources size, and radio luminosity, taking into account biases of flux-density-limited surveys. Our results suggest that the observed correlation between spectral index and redshift of active galactic nuclei can be attributed to the Malmquist bias reflecting an intrinsic relation between radio luminosity and the spectral index. We also find a correlation between spectral index and linear source size with more compact sources having steeper spectra.</description>

      <title>Diverse reddening distributions in sight lines to type Ia supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from host-galaxy interstellar reddening.The latter is commonly modelled in a probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\tau) as a universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies. We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies, primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution may peak at E(B-V)&gt;0 when considering a population of young type Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust expected in these galaxies.</description>

      <title>Opening up New Parameter Space for Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are compelling dark matter (DM) candidates, yet the minimal production mechanism solely based on active ($\nu_a$)-sterile ($\nu_s$) oscillations is excluded by astrophysical observations. Non-standard self-interactions in either active ($\nu_a-\nu_a$) or sterile ($\nu_s-\nu_s$) sector are known to alter the sterile neutrino DM production in the early Universe, which could alleviate the tension with astrophysical constraints to some extent. Here we propose a novel solution where scalar-mediated non-standard interactions between active and sterile neutrinos ($\nu_a-\nu_s$) generate new production channels for $\nu_s$, independent of the active-sterile mixing and without the need for any fine-tuned resonance or primordial lepton asymmetry. This framework enables efficient sterile neutrino DM production even at vanishingly small mixing angles and opens up new viable regions of parameter space that can be tested with future $X$-ray and gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate an approach to quantum gravity, called the ring paradigm. Gravity is mediated superluminally, and the graviton is described as a phonon on the grid of matter in the Universe. This theory has very interesting applications to cosmology and would ultimately solve the old problem of the cosmological constant. It further gives new impulses to the scalar field theories because the gravitational ring decays to some phantom field. As is obvious, we radically break the Lorentz invariance, which means that some generalization of the Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius theorem in quantum field theory is possible.</description>

      <title>A black hole in a near-pristine galaxy 700 million years after the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04, hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow Hbeta emission indicates an extremely low chemical enrichment, less than 0.01 solar. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in rare cases. Models invoking "primordial black holes" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole.</description>

      <title>Dust Budget Crisis in Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently identified by JWST, are characterized by their compact morphology and red optical continuum emission, which is often interpreted as evidence for significant dust extinction of $A_V \gtrsim 3$ mag. However, the dust-reddened AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared emission and a potential "dust budget crisis" in cases when the host galaxy is either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI, Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly constrained to $A_V \lesssim 1.0$ mag for A2744-45924 and $A_V \lesssim 1.5$ mag for RUBIES-BLAGN-1 under the SMC extinction laws, with slightly weaker constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised $A_V$ values yield a radiative efficiencies of $10\%$ for the LRD population, easing the tension with the Soltan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories, provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Exploring Faraday rotation signatures and population bounds for primordial magnetic black holes</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes bearing magnetic charges may bypass the constraints imposed by Hawking radiation, thereby enabling reasonable present-day populations, even for masses below $10^{15}\, \mathrm{g} $--a range previously considered improbable. They could, therefore, conceivably contribute to a component of dark matter. We investigate novel Faraday rotation signatures exhibited by primordial magnetic black holes while also establishing new Parker-type bounds on their populations. For the latter, we bound the dark matter fraction from intergalactic magnetic fields in cosmic voids $\left(f_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-8}\right)$ and cosmic web filaments $\left(f_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-4}\right)$, notably eclipsing previous bounds. Exploring Faraday rotation effects, we discern a pronounced rotation of the polarization angle and the rotation measure values for extremal primordial magnetic black holes with masses $M^{\text{ex.}}_{\text{ BH}} \gtrsim 10^{-6}~ \text{M}_\odot$. This makes them potentially detectable in current observations. A comparative investigation finds that the effects are notably greater than for a neutron star, like a Magnetar, with a similar magnetic field at the surface. Moreover, the polarization angle maps for primordial magnetic black holes exhibit unique features, notably absent in other astrophysical magnetic configurations. In this context, we also introduce a simple integral measure, offering a quantitative measure for their discrimination in many scenarios. These traits potentially suggest a robust avenue for their observational detection and differentiation.</description>

Abstract: Halo core tracking is a novel concept designed to efficiently follow halo substructure in large simulations. We have recently developed this concept in gravity-only simulations to investigate the galaxy-halo connection in the context of empirical and semi-analytic models. Here, we incorporate information from hydrodynamics simulations, with an emphasis on establishing a connection between cores and galaxies. We compare cores across gravity-only, adiabatic hydrodynamics, and subgrid hydrodynamics simulations with the same initial phases. We demonstrate that cores are stable entities whose halo-centric radial profiles match across the simulations. We further develop a methodology that uses merging and infall mass cuts to group cores in the hydrodynamics simulation, creating on average, a one-to-one match to corresponding galaxies. We apply this methodology to cores from the gravity-only simulation, thus creating a proxy for galaxies which approximate the populations from the hydrodynamics simulation. Our results pave the way to incorporate inputs from smaller-scale hydrodynamics simulations directly into large-scale gravity-only runs in a principled manner.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel analytic density profile for halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, which accurately captures the isothermal-core configuration, i.e. where both the density and velocity dispersion profiles exhibit central plateaus in the halo innermost region. Importantly, the profile retains a simple and tractable functional form. We demonstrate analytically how our density profile satisfies the aforementioned conditions, with comparisons to other contemporary functional choices. We further validate the profile using idealized N-body simulations, showing that it provides excellent representations of both the density and velocity dispersion profiles across a broad range of evolutionary stages, from the early thermalization phase to the late core-collapse regime. As a result of its accuracy and simplicity, the proposed profile offers a robust framework for analyzing halo evolution in a variety of SIDM scenarios. It also holds practical utility in reducing simulation needs and in generating initial conditions for simulations targeting the deep core-collapse regime.</description>

      <title>Origin of cosmological neutrino mass bounds: background $\textit{versus}$ perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmological upper bound on the total neutrino mass is the dominant limit on this fundamental parameter. Recent observations-soon to be improved-have strongly tightened it, approaching the lower limit set by oscillation data. Understanding its physical origin, robustness, and model-independence becomes pressing. Here, we explicitly separate for the first time the two distinct cosmological neutrino-mass effects: the impact on background evolution, related to the energy in neutrino masses; and the "kinematic" impact on perturbations, related to neutrino free-streaming. We scrutinize how they affect CMB anisotropies, introducing two effective masses enclosing $\textit{background}$ ($\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Backg.}$) and $\textit{perturbations}$ ($\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.}$) effects. We analyze CMB data, finding that the neutrino-mass bound is mostly a background measurement, i.e., how the neutrino energy density evolves with time. The bound on the "kinematic" variable $\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.}$ is largely relaxed, $\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.} &lt; 0.8\,\mathrm{eV}$. This work thus adds clarity to the physical origin of the cosmological neutrino-mass bound, which is mostly a measurement of the neutrino equation of state, providing also hints to evade such a bound.</description>

      <title>Testing inhomogeneous cosmography in our cosmic neighborhood using CosmicFlows-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence of the third order general cosmographic expansion of the luminosity distance is examined using several versions of a semi-realistic model of our local cosmic neighborhood, based on publicly available density and velocity fields from CosmicFlows-4. The study supports earlier findings that the general cosmographic expansion diverges at surprisingly low redshifts, often well before z = 0.1. By being based on a realistically placed observer within a data-informed cosmic environment, the results underscore that convergence must be a central concern when applying the general cosmographic expansion. By showing all-sky maps of kinematic parameters, the study also highlights the substantial information we lose when relying solely on standard FLRW-based cosmography.
  Poor convergence does not necessarily render the information extracted by fitting data to the general cosmographic expansion meaningless. Rather, it calls for caution in interpreting this information, particularly regarding the physical meaning of the fitting coefficients, the physical scales they probe and the implicit smoothing introduced by the fit.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Synthetic-source Injection Across the Full Survey Using Balrog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic source injection (SSI), the insertion of sources into pixel-level on-sky images, is a powerful method for characterizing object detection and measurement in wide-field, astronomical imaging surveys. Within the Dark Energy Survey (DES), SSI plays a critical role in characterizing all necessary algorithms used in converting images to catalogs, and in deriving quantities needed for the cosmology analysis, such as object detection rates, galaxy redshift estimation, galaxy magnification, star-galaxy classification, and photometric performance. We present here a source injection catalog of $146$ million injections spanning the entire 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint, generated using the Balrog SSI pipeline. Through this sample, we demonstrate that the DES Year 6 (Y6) image processing pipeline provides accurate estimates of the object properties, for both galaxies and stars, at the percent-level, and we highlight specific regimes where the accuracy is reduced. We then show the consistency between SSI and data catalogs, for all galaxy samples developed within the weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses of DES Y6. The consistency between the two catalogs also extends to their correlations with survey observing properties (seeing, airmass, depth, extinction, etc.). Finally, we highlight a number of applications of this catalog to the DES Y6 cosmology analysis. This dataset is the largest SSI catalog produced at this fidelity and will serve as a key testing ground for exploring the utility of SSI catalogs in upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Feedback in Massive Halos: Implications for the Distribution of Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use order of magnitude estimates and observational constraints to argue that feedback from relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) produced by massive black holes is likely to have a particularly large effect at radii of order the virial radius and larger in group-mass halos. We show that for a range of plausible (but uncertain) CR transport parameters and energetics, the pressure produced by CRs generated by the central massive black hole over its lifetime can be of order the thermal gas pressure in the outskirts of $\sim 10^{13-14} M_\odot$ halos (but not in more massive clusters). The properties of this CR feedback at low redshift are not well predicted by the radiative cooling rate of hot gas at smaller radii, which is often used as a proxy for `current' black hole feedback. This is because most black hole growth happens early in massive halos, and CR transport timescales in halo outskirts are Gyr or more; the accumulated CR energy thus depends on the full history of black hole activity in the halo. The large CR pressure in group-mass systems likely leads to CR-driven outflows that move gas from large halo radii to outside the virial radius. Such feedback would not be captured by current cosmological simulations that focus on mechanical black hole feedback; in particular, CR feedback remains active even long after the mechanical feedback sourcing the CRs has turned off. We speculate that this CR feedback may be important for explaining the weak lensing $S_8$ tension and the evidence for strong feedback at large halo radii from kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich measurements. Prospects for testing this mechanism observationally and implementing the necessary physics in cosmological simulations are discussed.</description>

      <title>How probable is the Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wing in the spectrum of the redshift z = 5.9896 quasar ULAS J0148+0600?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shape of the Ly-$\alpha$ transmission in the near zone of the redshift $z=5.9896$ quasar ULAS J0148$+$0600 (hereafter J0148) is consistent with a damping wing arising from an extended neutral hydrogen island in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM). Here we use simulations of late-ending reionisation from Sherwood-Relics to assess the expected incidence of quasars with Ly-$\alpha$ and Ly-$\beta$ absorption similar to the observed J0148 spectrum. We find a late end to reionisation at $z=5.3$ is a necessary requirement for reproducing a Ly-$\alpha$ damping wing consistent with J0148. This occurs in $\sim3$ per cent of our simulated spectra for an IGM neutral fraction $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle=0.14$ at $z=6$. However, using standard assumptions for the ionising photon output of J0148, the a priori probability of drawing a simulated quasar spectrum with a Ly-$\alpha$ damping wing profile and Ly-$\alpha$ near zone size that simultaneously match J0148 is very low, $p&lt;10^{-3}$. We speculate this is because the ionising emission from J0148 is variable on timescales $t&lt;10^{5}\rm\,yr$, or alternatively that the Ly-$\alpha$ transmission in the J0148 near zone is impacted by the transverse proximity effect from nearby star-forming galaxies or undetected quasars. We also predict the IGM temperature should be $T\sim 4\times 10^{4}\rm\,K$ within a few proper Mpc of the Ly-$\alpha$ near zone edge due to recent HI and HeII photo-heating. Evidence for enhanced thermal broadening in the Ly-$\alpha$ absorption near the damping wing edge would provide further evidence that the final stages of reionisation are occurring at $z&lt;6$.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the universe may be more harmonic than we thought</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy in the Crosshairs: A Joint Analysis with DESI, Pantheon plus, and TDCOSMO Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive joint analysis of three representative dark energy models - ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, and the Generalised Emergent Dark Energy (GEDE) model - using the latest observational datasets: baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Releases 1 and 2 (DR1/DR2), the Pantheon Plus sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and time-delay cosmography from TDCOSMO lensing. The CPL model yields a statistically significant improvement over ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$, with $\Delta \chi^2 = -3.6$ for DESI DR2+Pantheon Plus+TDCOSMO, favoring a quintessence-like behavior ($w_0=-0.87^{+0.05 }_{-0.05} $, $w_a=-0.41^{+ 0.28}_{-0.28}$ at 1$\sigma$ confidence level). The GEDE model also exhibits slightly favoring than ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$ with observations, yielding $\Delta \chi^2 =-2.83$ (DR1) and $\Delta \chi^2 = -3.82$ (DR2). The captured potential dark energy evolution transition parameter $\Delta$ in GEDE model is constrained to $-0.52^{+0.22}_{-0.20}$ (DR1) and $-0.50^{+0.18}_{-0.17}$ (DR2), showing a $2.4\sigma$ and $2.9\sigma$ deviation from zero respectively. This statistically significant ($&gt;2\sigma$) non-zero value of $\Delta$ provides evidence against a pure cosmological constant scenario. The negative sign indicates quintessence-like behavior ($w &gt; -1$) in the late universe. Notably, the GEDE constraints show a $&gt;3\sigma$ tension with the $\Delta=1$ (Phenomenological Emergent Dark Energy model) predictions. This significant discrepancy implies that while both models belong to the emergent dark energy family, their fundamentally different transition mechanisms lead to distinct cosmological implications. Our results collectively suggest that GEDE provides a phenomenologically viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>A G_2G2-Holonomy Model for Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration in M-theory: Alleviating the Hubble Tension through Geometric Vacuum Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An M-theory framework with $G_{\mathrm{2}}$-holonomy compactification yields dynamical geometric moduli generating an evolving $\Lambda(z)$, termed ``geometric vacuum energy'' from fluxes and instanton corrections. Evolving the model from early cosmic times reveals strong attractor behaviors. For specific potential parameters ($\phi_c \approx 5.0$, fine-tuned $V_0$), a natural attractor solution emerges, alleviating the Hubble tension. It yields $H_0 \approx 69.4\ \mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ (compared to $H_0 \approx 67\ \mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ from early-Universe probes) and $\Lambda(0) \approx 1.105 \times 10^{-52}\ \mathrm{m}^{-2}$, with $\Phi(0) \approx 2.2$. This maintains overall concordance, accommodating $\Omega_{k0}\approx 0.097$, $\Omega_{m0}\approx 0.25$, age $\approx 13.8\mathrm {Gyr}$, and is consistent with BBN/CMB constraints where geometric vacuum energy is subdominant. Excellent fit ($\chi^2/N \approx 0.44$) is found against 34 $H(z)$ cosmic chronometer data. The model yields $S_8 \approx 0.74$. This highlights how $G_{\mathrm{2}}$-M-theory can reconcile late-time observations via attractor dynamics, suggesting a UV-complete origin for dynamical vacuum energy. Further investigations are envisaged.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise and accurate estimation of cosmological parameters is crucial for understanding the Universe's dynamics and addressing cosmological tensions. In this methods paper, we explore bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, including the Improved Multi-Operator Differential Evolution scheme and the Philippine Eagle Optimization Algorithm (PEOA), alongside the relatively known genetic algorithm, for cosmological parameter estimation. Using mock data that underlay a true fiducial cosmology, we test the viability of each optimization method to recover the input cosmological parameters with confidence regions generated by bootstrapping on top of optimization. We compare the results with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in terms of accuracy and precision, and show that PEOA performs comparably well under the specific circumstances provided. Understandably, Bayesian inference and optimization serve distinct purposes, but comparing them highlights the potential of nature-inspired algorithms in cosmological analysis, offering alternative pathways to explore parameter spaces and validate standard results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of dark energy through a detailed analysis of its equation of state parameter $w(z)$ as a function of redshift. We derive a general expression for $w(z)$ from the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, establishing a direct relationship between the dark energy equation of state and the observable Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its derivative. Using the relation $w(z) = -1 + \frac{2(1+z)}{3H(z)} \frac{dH}{dz}$, we develop an approximation method valid for $z \lesssim 1$ that accounts for the changing balance between matter and dark energy contributions to cosmic expansion. We compare our theoretical framework with recent observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2, analysing how well the commonly used Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(z) = -1 + w_a \frac{z}{1+z}$ captures the evolution of dark energy. Our results indicate that the dark energy equation of state exhibits a monotonic evolution with redshift, transitioning from deceleration to acceleration around $z \approx 0.7$. Notably, our predicted $w_{\mathrm{DE}}$ remains greater than $-1$ across all redshifts, avoiding phantom energy scenarios that would violate the null energy condition. This work demonstrates how precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history can constrain the nature of dark energy and provides a framework for testing dynamical dark energy models against current and future cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. V. Modeling Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies with Updated UniverseMachine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environment plays a critical role in shaping the assembly of low-mass galaxies. Here, we use the UniverseMachine (UM) galaxy-halo connection framework and the Data Release 3 of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey to place dwarf galaxy star formation and quenching into a cosmological context. UM is a data-driven forward model that flexibly parameterizes galaxy star formation rates (SFR) using only halo mass and assembly history. We add a new quenching model to UM, tailored for galaxies with stellar masses $\lesssim 10^9$ solar masses, and constrain the model down to a stellar mass $\gtrsim 10^7$ solar masses using new SAGA observations of 101 satellite systems around Milky Way (MW)-mass hosts and a sample of isolated field galaxies in a similar mass range from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The new best-fit model, 'UM-SAGA,' reproduces the satellite stellar mass functions, average SFRs, and quenched fractions in SAGA satellites while keeping isolated dwarfs mostly star forming. The enhanced quenching in satellites relative to isolated field galaxies leads the model to maximally rely on halo assembly to explain the observed environmental quenching. Extrapolating the model down to a stellar mass $\sim 10^{6.5}$ solar masses yields a quenched fraction of $\gtrsim$ 30% for isolated field galaxies and $\gtrsim$ 80% for satellites of MW-mass hosts at this stellar mass. This specific prediction can soon be tested by spectroscopic surveys to reveal the relative importance of internal feedback, cessation of mass and gas accretion, satellite-specific gas processes, and reionization for the evolution of faint low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>EDEN: Exploring Disks Embedded in N-body simulations of Milky-Way-mass halos from Symphony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of galactic disks on the tidal stripping of cold dark matter subhalos within Milky Way (MW)-mass halos ($M_{\rm vir}\sim 10^{12}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) using a new simulation suite, EDEN. By re-simulating 45 MW-mass zoom-in halos from the N-body Symphony compilation with embedded disk potentials, which evolve according to star formation histories predicted by the UniverseMachine model, we self-consistently tie disk growth to halo accretion rate and significantly expand the range of disk masses and formation histories studied. We use the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to enhance the robustness of subhalo tracking. We find that disks near the median disk-to-halo mass ratio of our sample ($M_{\ast, \rm Disk}/M_{\rm vir, host} = 2\%$) reduce subhalo peak mass functions within 100 kpc by about $10\%$ for peak masses above $ 10^8\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Heavier, MW/M31-like disks ($M_{\ast, \rm Disk}/M_{\rm vir, host} \gtrsim 5\%$) lead to a reduction of more than $40\%$. Subhalo abundance suppression is more pronounced near halo centers, with particularly enhanced stripping for subhalos accreted over 8 Gyr ago on orbits with pericenters &lt; 100 kpc. Suppression is further amplified when disk mass is increased within fixed halo and disk assembly histories. In all cases, the suppression we measure should be interpreted as stripping below the mass resolution limit rather than complete subhalo disruption. This study reshapes our understanding of the MW's impact on its satellites, suggesting it strips subhalos more efficiently than typical MW-mass galaxies due to its larger disk-to-halo mass ratio and earlier disk formation.</description>

      <title>Project Dinos II: Redshift evolution of dark and luminous matter density profiles in strong-lensing elliptical galaxies across $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new measurement of the dark and luminous matter distribution of massive elliptical galaxies, and their evolution with redshift, by combining strong lensing and dynamical observables. Our sample of 56 lens galaxies covers a redshift range of $0.090 \leq z_{\rm l} \leq 0.884$. By combining new Hubble Space Telescope imaging with previously observed velocity dispersion and line-of-sight measurements, we decompose the luminous matter profile from the dark matter profile and perform a Bayesian hierarchical analysis to constrain the population-level properties of both profiles. We find that the inner slope of the dark matter density profile ("cusp"; $\rho_{\rm DM} \propto r^{-\gamma_{\rm in}}$) is consistent ($\mu_{\gamma_{\rm in}}=0.97^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ with $\leq0.07$ intrinsic scatter) with a standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW; $\gamma_{\rm in}=1$) at $z=0.35$. Additionally, we find an appreciable evolution with redshift ($d\log(\gamma_{\rm in})/dz=-0.44^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$) resulting in a shallower slope (of $&gt; 2 \sigma$ tension from NFW) at redshifts $z \ge 0.49$. This is in excellent agreement with previous population-level observational studies, as well as with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations such as IllustrisTNG. We also find the stellar mass-to-light ratio at the population level is consistent with that of a Salpeter initial mass function, a small stellar mass-to-light gradient ($\kappa_{*}(r)\propto r^{-\eta}$, with $\overline{\eta} \leq 5 \times 10^{-5}$), and isotropic stellar orbits. Our averaged total mass density profile is consistent with a power-law profile within 0.25 to 4 Einstein radii ($\overline{\gamma} = 2.24 \pm 0.14$), with an internal mass-sheet transformation parameter $\overline{\lambda} = 0.96 \pm 0.03$ consistent with no mass sheet. Our findings confirm the validity of the standard mass models used for time-delay cosmography.</description>

      <title>Impact of cosmic web on galaxy properties and their correlations: Insights from Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze a volume-limited sample from the SDSS and explore how cosmic web environments affect the interrelations between various galaxy properties, such as $(u-r)$ colour, stellar mass, specific star formation rate, metallicity, morphology, and $D4000$. Our analysis reveals that the first three principal components (PC1, PC2 and PC3) account for approximately $85\%$ of the data variance. We classify galaxies into different cosmic web environments based on the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor and compare PC1, PC2, PC3 across these environments. PC1 is dominated by colour, sSFR, D4000, and morphology. It displays clear bimodality across all cosmic web environments, with sheets and clusters showing distinct preferences for negative and positive PC1 values, respectively. This variation reflects the strong role of environmental processes in regulating star formation. PC2 and PC3, respectively show positively and negatively skewed unimodal distributions in all environments. PC2 is primarily influenced by metallicity whereas PC3 is dominated by stellar mass. It indicates that metallicity evolves gradually and is less sensitive to environmental extremes. PC3 likely captures residual variation in stellar mass. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test confirms that the distributions of PC1, PC2 and PC3 differ significantly across environments, with a confidence level exceeding $99.99\%$. Furthermore, we calculate the normalized mutual information (NMI) between the principal components and individual galaxy properties within different cosmic web environments. A two-tailed t-test reveals that for each relationship and each pair of environments, the null hypothesis is rejected with a confidence level $&gt;99.99\%$. Our analysis confirms that cosmic web environments play a significant role in shaping the correlations between galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>A Bright Future? Prospects for Cosmological Tests of GR with Multimessenger Gravitational Wave Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Further bright sirens - gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts - are keenly awaited, but proving elusive. The exceptional event GW170817 had a profound impact on the landscape of viable cosmological extensions of General Relativity (GR); can we expect this kind of shift to be repeated in the next decade? In this work we will assess the potential constraints from bright sirens in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5 era and third generation detector era. We set up the statistical formalism for our constraints, and generate and analyse simulated data in the context of general scalar-tensor theories. We highlight the important role that gamma-ray burst detection has in breaking key parameter degeneracies. We find that the next ten bright sirens alone will not competitively constrain cosmological gravity, but that one year of third generation observations could confidently detect mild departures from GR, e.g. the Horndeski parameter $\alpha_{\rm M}\neq 0$ is detected at greater than $3\sigma$. This justifies investment in a broad range of methods for gravitational wave cosmology (dark sirens, bright sirens and cross-correlation with large-scale structure) to ensure tests of cosmological gravity advance in both the short-term and the long-term.</description>

      <title>The holographic space-time model of inflation and its predictions for the CMB primordial spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1998 Carlip and Solodukhin independently conjectured the equality between fluctuations in the modular Hamiltonian of black holes and its expectation value. Banks and Zurek's 2021 work generalized this observation to any causal diamonds. We use this observation to calculate the precise normalization of primordial scalar and tensor power spectra in the Holographic Space-time (HST) model of inflation. In previous work Banks and Fischler outlined the general calculation of inflationary power spectra in this model, which we review here. Its conceptual basis is radically different from field theoretic inflation and it has no Transplanckian problems, but its predictions for power spectra will be shown to fit extant data equally well, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio agrees with experimental observations.</description>
