      <title>Reflexive Composition of Elementary State Machines, with an Application to the Reversal of Cellular Automata Rule 90</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of a one-dimensional lattice of state machines on two states and two symbols sequentially updated via a process of "reflexive composition." The space of 256 machines exhibits a variety of behavior, including substitution, reversible "billiard ball" dynamics, and fractal nesting. We show that one machine generates the Sierpinski Triangle and, for a subset of boundary conditions, is isomorphic to cellular automata Rule 90 in Wolfram's naming scheme. More surprisingly, two other machines follow trajectories that map to Rule 90 in reverse. Whereas previous techniques have been developed to uncover preimages of Rule 90, this is the first study to produce such inverse dynamics naturally from the formalism itself. We argue that the system's symmetric treatment of state and message underlies its expressive power.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Pure Strategy Relevant Equilibria in Concurrent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rational synthesis problems for concurrent games with $\omega$-regular objectives. Our model of rationality considers only pure strategy Nash equilibria that satisfy either a social welfare or Pareto optimality condition with respect to an $\omega$-regular objective for each agent. This extends earlier work on equilibria in concurrent games, without consideration about their quality. Our results show that the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying social welfare conditions can be computed as efficiently as the constrained Nash equilibrium existence problem. On the other hand, the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying the Pareto optimality condition possibly involves a higher upper bound, except in the case of B\"uchi and Muller games, for which all three problems are in the classes P and PSPACE-complete, respectively.</description>

      <title>Omega-Regular Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Roughly speaking, a system is said to be robust if it can resist disturbances and still function correctly. For instance, if the requirement is that the temperature remains in an allowed range $[l,h]$, then a system that remains in a range $[l',h']\subset[l,h]$ is more robust than one that reaches $l$ and $h$ from time to time. In this example the initial specification is quantitative in nature, this is not the case in $\omega$-regular properties. Still, it seems there is a natural robustness preference relation induced by an $\omega$-regular property. E.g. for a property requiring that every request is eventually granted, one would say that a system where requests are granted two ticks after they are issued is more robust than one in which requests are answered ninety ticks after they are issued. In this work we manage to distill a robustness preference relation that is induced by a given $\omega$-regular language. The robustness preference relation is a semantic notion (agnostic to the given representation of the language) that relies on Wagner's hierarchy and on Ehlers and Schewe's definition of natural rank of infinite words. It aligns with our intuitions on common examples, satisfies some natural mathematical criteria, and refines Tabuada and Neider's five-valued semantics into an infinite domain.</description>

      <title>Positive Hennessy-Milner Logic for Branching Bisimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Labelled transitions systems can be studied in terms of modal logic and in terms of bisimulation. These two notions are connected by Hennessy-Milner theorems, that show that two states are bisimilar precisely when they satisfy the same modal logic formulas. Recently, apartness has been studied as a dual to bisimulation, which also gives rise to a dual version of the Hennessy-Milner theorem: two states are apart precisely when there is a modal formula that distinguishes them.
  In this paper, we introduce "directed" versions of Hennessy-Milner theorems that characterize when the theory of one state is included in the other. For this we introduce "positive modal logics" that only allow a limited use of negation. Furthermore, we introduce directed notions of bisimulation and apartness, and then show that, for this positive modal logic, the theory of $s$ is included in the theory of $t$ precisely when $s$ is directed bisimilar to $t$. Or, in terms of apartness, we show that $s$ is directed apart from $t$ precisely when the theory of $s$ is not included in the theory of $t$. From the directed version of the Hennessy-Milner theorem, the original result follows.
  In particular, we study the case of branching bisimulation and Hennessy-Milner Logic with Until (HMLU) as a modal logic. We introduce "directed branching bisimulation" (and directed branching apartness) and "Positive Hennessy-Milner Logic with Until" (PHMLU) and we show the directed version of the Hennessy-Milner theorems. In the process, we show that every HMLU formula is equivalent to a Boolean combination of Positive HMLU formulas, which is a very non-trivial result. This gives rise to a sublogic of HMLU that is equally expressive but easier to reason about.</description>
