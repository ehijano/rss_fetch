      <title>Differentials on Forested and Hairy Graph Complexes with Dishonest Hairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of forested graph complexes with ordered and unordered hairs whose cohomology computes the cohomology of a family of groups $\Gamma_{g,r}$ that generalize the (outer) automorphism group of free groups. We give examples and a recipe for constructing additional differentials on these complexes. These differentials can be used to construct spectral sequences that start with the cohomology of the standard complexes. We focus on one such sequence that relates cohomology classes of graphs with different numbers of hairs and compute its limit.</description>

      <title>On the finite generation of the cohomology of abelian extensions of Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite-dimensional Hopf algebra is called quasi-split if it is Morita equivalent to a split abelian extension of Hopf algebras. Combining results of Schauenburg and Negron, it is shown that every quasi-split finite-dimensional Hopf algebra satisfies the finite generation cohomology conjecture of Etingof and Ostrik. This is applied to a family of pointed Hopf algebras in odd characteristic introduced by Angiono, Heckenberger and the first author, proving that they satisfy the aforementioned conjecture.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric polynomials and algebro-combinatorial duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we develop a systematic combinatorial definition for constructed earlier supersymmetric polynomial families. These polynomial families generalize canonical Schur, Jack and Macdonald families so that the new polynomials depend on odd Grassmann variables as well. Members of these families are labeled by respective modifications of Young diagrams. We show that the super-Macdonald polynomials form a representation of a super-algebra analog $\mathsf{T}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$ of Ding-Ioahara-Miki (quantum toroidal) algebra, emerging as a BPS algebra of D-branes on a conifold. A supersymmetric modification for Young tableaux and Kostka numbers are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Braiding on complex oriented Soergel bimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study U(n) Soergel bimodules in the context of stable homotopy theory. We define the $(\infty, 1)$-category $\mathrm{SBim}_E(n)$ of $E$-valued U(n) Soergel bimodules, where $E$ is a connective $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-ring spectrum, and assemble them into a monoidal locally additive $(\infty, 2)$-category $\mathrm{SBim}_E$. When $E$ has a complex orientation, we then construct a braiding, i.e. an $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structure, on the universal locally stable $(\infty, 2)$-category $\mathrm{K}^b_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathrm{SBim}_E)$ associated to $\mathrm{SBim}_E$. Along the way, we also prove spectral analogs of standard splittings of Soergel bimodules. This is a topological generalization of the type $A$ Soergel bimodule theory developed in a previous paper.</description>

      <title>$RLL$-realization of two-parameter quantum affine algebra in type $D_n^{(1)}$</title>

Abstract: We obtain the basic $R$-matrix of the two-parameter Quantum group $U=U_{r,s}\mathcal(\mathfrak{so}_{2n})$ via its weight representation theory and determine its $R$-matrix with spectral parameters for the two-parameter quantum affine algebra $U=U_{r,s}\mathcal(\widehat{\mathfrak{so}_{2n}})$. Using the Gauss decomposition of the $R$-matrix realization of $U=U_{r,s}\mathcal(\mathfrak{so}_{2n})$, we study the commutation relations of the Gaussian generators and finally arrive at its $RLL$-formalism of the Drinfeld realization of two-parameter quantum affine algebra $U=U_{r,s}\mathcal(\widehat{\mathfrak{so}_{2n}})$.</description>

      <title>Boson-Fermion correspondence, QQ-relations and Wronskian solutions of the T-system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.08931v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that there is a correspondence between representations of superalgebras and ordinary (non-graded) algebras. Keeping in mind this type of correspondence between the twisted quantum affine superalgebra $U_{q}(gl(2r|1)^{(2)})$ and the non-twisted quantum affine algebra $U_{q}(so(2r+1)^{(1)})$, we proposed, in the previous paper [arXiv:1109.5524], a Wronskian solution of the T-system for $U_{q}(so(2r+1)^{(1)})$ as a reduction (folding) of the Wronskian solution for the non-twisted quantum affine superalgebra $U_{q}(gl(2r|1)^{(1)})$. In this paper, we elaborate on this solution, and give a proof missing in [arXiv:1109.5524]. In particular, we explain its connection to the Cherednik-Bazhanov-Reshetikhin (quantum Jacobi-Trudi) type determinant solution known in [arXiv:hep-th/9506167]. We also propose Wronskian-type expressions of T-functions (eigenvalues of transfer matrices) labeled by non-rectangular Young diagrams, which are quantum affine algebra analogues of the Weyl character formula for $so(2r+1)$. We show that T-functions for spinorial representations of $U_{q}(so(2r+1)^{(1)})$ are related to reductions of T-functions for asymptotic typical representations of $U_{q}(gl(2r|1)^{(1)})$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Multiplier Based on Exponent Adder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum multiplication is a fundamental operation in quantum computing. It is important to have a quantum multiplier with low complexity. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Multiplier Based on Exponent Adder (QMbead), a new approach that requires just $\log_2(n)$ qubits to multiply two $n$-bit integer numbers, in addition to $O(n)$ ancillary qubits used for quantum state preparation. The QMbead uses a so-called exponent encoding to respectively represent two multiplicands as two superposition states which are prepared by a quantum state preparation method, then employs a quantum adder to obtain the sum of these two superposition states, and subsequently measures the outputs of the quantum adder to calculate the product of the multiplicands. Different quantum adders can be used in the QMbead. The circuit depth and time complexity of the QMbead, using a logarithmic-depth quantum carry lookahead adder (QCLA) as adder, are $O(\log n)$ and $O(n \log n)$, respectively. The gate complexity of the QMbead is $O(n)$. The circuit depth and gate complexity of the QMbead is better than existing quantum multipliers such as the quantum Karatsuba multiplier and the QFT based multiplier. The time complexity of the QMbead is identical to that of the fastest classical multiplication algorithm, Harvey-Hoeven algorithm. Interestingly, the QMbead maintains an advantage over the Harvey-Hoeven algorithm, given that the latter is only suitable for excessively large numbers, whereas the QMbead is valid for both small and large numbers. The multiplicand can be either an integer or a decimal number. The QMbead has been implemented on quantum simulators to compute products with a bit length of up to 273 bits using only 17 qubits, excluding the ancillary qubits used for quantum state preparation. This establishes QMbead as an efficient solution for multiplying large integer or decimal numbers with many bits.</description>

      <title>Integral invariants for framed 3-manifolds associated to trivalent graphs possibly with self-loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bott--Cattaneo's theory defines the integral invariants for a framed rational homology 3-sphere equipped with an acyclic orthogonal local system, in terms of graph cocycles without self-loops. The 2-loop term of their invariants is associated with the theta graph. Their definition requires a cohomological condition. Cattaneo--Shimizu removed this cohomological condition and gave a 2-loop invariant associated with a linear combination of the theta graph and the dumbbell graph, the 2-loop trivalent graph with self-loops. In this paper, we are concerned with an acyclic local system given by the adjoint representation of a semi-simple Lie group composed with a representation of the fundamental group of a closed 3-manifold, and we show that through a cohomological construction eventually the integral associated with the dumbbell graph vanishes. Based on this idea, we construct a theory of graph complexes and cocycles, so that higher-loop invariants can be defined by two different but equivalent methods: the graph cocycles without self-loops as in Bott--Cattaneo's theory, and the ones with self-loops that extend Cattaneo--Shimizu's 2-loop invariants. As a consequence, we prove that the generating series of Chern--Simons perturbation theory gives rise to topological invariants for framed 3-manifolds in our setting, which admits a formula in terms of only trivalent graphs without self-loops.</description>
