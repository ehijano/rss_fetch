      <title>PDMX: A Large-Scale Public Domain MusicXML Dataset for Symbolic Music Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent explosion of generative AI-Music systems has raised numerous concerns over data copyright, licensing music from musicians, and the conflict between open-source AI and large prestige companies. Such issues highlight the need for publicly available, copyright-free musical data, in which there is a large shortage, particularly for symbolic music data. To alleviate this issue, we present PDMX: a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores collected from the score-sharing forum MuseScore, making it the largest available copyright-free symbolic music dataset to our knowledge. PDMX additionally includes a wealth of both tag and user interaction metadata, allowing us to efficiently analyze the dataset and filter for high quality user-generated scores. Given the additional metadata afforded by our data collection process, we conduct multitrack music generation experiments evaluating how different representative subsets of PDMX lead to different behaviors in downstream models, and how user-rating statistics can be used as an effective measure of data quality. Examples can be found at https://pnlong.github.io/PDMX.demo/.</description>

      <title>Speech Recognition for Analysis of Police Radio Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Police departments around the world use two-way radio for coordination. These broadcast police communications (BPC) are a unique source of information about everyday police activity and emergency response. Yet BPC are not transcribed, and their naturalistic audio properties make automatic transcription challenging. We collect a corpus of roughly 62,000 manually transcribed radio transmissions (~46 hours of audio) to evaluate the feasibility of automatic speech recognition (ASR) using modern recognition models. We evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf speech recognizers, models fine-tuned on BPC data, and customized end-to-end models. We find that both human and machine transcription is challenging in this domain. Large off-the-shelf ASR models perform poorly, but fine-tuned models can reach the approximate range of human performance. Our work suggests directions for future work, including analysis of short utterances and potential miscommunication in police radio interactions. We make our corpus and data annotation pipeline available to other researchers, to enable further research on recognition and analysis of police communication.</description>

      <title>Single-stage TTS with Masked Audio Token Modeling and Semantic Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio token modeling has become a powerful framework for speech synthesis, with two-stage approaches employing semantic tokens remaining prevalent. In this paper, we aim to simplify this process by introducing a semantic knowledge distillation method that enables high-quality speech generation in a single stage. Our proposed model improves speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity compared to a single-stage baseline. Although two-stage systems still lead in intelligibility, our model significantly narrows the gap while delivering comparable speech quality. These findings showcase the potential of single-stage models to achieve efficient, high-quality TTS with a more compact and streamlined architecture.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Speech Restoration with Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional speech enhancement methods often oversimplify the task of restoration by focusing on a single type of distortion. Generative models that handle multiple distortions frequently struggle with phone reconstruction and high-frequency harmonics, leading to breathing and gasping artifacts that reduce the intelligibility of reconstructed speech. These models are also computationally demanding, and many solutions are restricted to producing outputs in the wide-band frequency range, which limits their suitability for professional applications. To address these challenges, we propose Hi-ResLDM, a novel generative model based on latent diffusion designed to remove multiple distortions and restore speech recordings to studio quality, sampled at 48kHz. We benchmark Hi-ResLDM against state-of-the-art methods that leverage GAN and Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) components, demonstrating superior performance in regenerating high-frequency-band details. Hi-ResLDM not only excels in non-instrusive metrics but is also consistently preferred in human evaluation and performs competitively on intrusive evaluations, making it ideal for high-resolution speech restoration.</description>

      <title>Learning Source Disentanglement in Neural Audio Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have significantly advanced audio compression by efficiently converting continuous audio signals into discrete tokens. These codecs preserve high-quality sound and enable sophisticated sound generation through generative models trained on these tokens. However, existing neural codec models are typically trained on large, undifferentiated audio datasets, neglecting the essential discrepancies between sound domains like speech, music, and environmental sound effects. This oversight complicates data modeling and poses additional challenges to the controllability of sound generation. To tackle these issues, we introduce the Source-Disentangled Neural Audio Codec (SD-Codec), a novel approach that combines audio coding and source separation. By jointly learning audio resynthesis and separation, SD-Codec explicitly assigns audio signals from different domains to distinct codebooks, sets of discrete representations. Experimental results indicate that SD-Codec not only maintains competitive resynthesis quality but also, supported by the separation results, demonstrates successful disentanglement of different sources in the latent space, thereby enhancing interpretability in audio codec and providing potential finer control over the audio generation process.</description>

      <title>The Sounds of Home: A Speech-Removed Residential Audio Dataset for Sound Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a residential audio dataset to support sound event detection research for smart home applications aimed at promoting wellbeing for older adults. The dataset is constructed by deploying audio recording systems in the homes of 8 participants aged 55-80 years for a 7-day period. Acoustic characteristics are documented through detailed floor plans and construction material information to enable replication of the recording environments for AI model deployment. A novel automated speech removal pipeline is developed, using pre-trained audio neural networks to detect and remove segments containing spoken voice, while preserving segments containing other sound events. The resulting dataset consists of privacy-compliant audio recordings that accurately capture the soundscapes and activities of daily living within residential spaces. The paper details the dataset creation methodology, the speech removal pipeline utilizing cascaded model architectures, and an analysis of the vocal label distribution to validate the speech removal process. This dataset enables the development and benchmarking of sound event detection models tailored specifically for in-home applications.</description>

      <title>LC-Protonets: Multi-label Few-shot learning for world music audio tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Label-Combination Prototypical Networks (LC-Protonets) to address the problem of multi-label few-shot classification, where a model must generalize to new classes based on only a few available examples. Extending Prototypical Networks, LC-Protonets generate one prototype per label combination, derived from the power set of labels present in the limited training items, rather than one prototype per label. Our method is applied to automatic audio tagging across diverse music datasets, covering various cultures and including both modern and traditional music, and is evaluated against existing approaches in the literature. The results demonstrate a significant performance improvement in almost all domains and training setups when using LC-Protonets for multi-label classification. In addition to training a few-shot learning model from scratch, we explore the use of a pre-trained model, obtained via supervised learning, to embed items in the feature space. Fine-tuning improves the generalization ability of all methods, yet LC-Protonets achieve high-level performance even without fine-tuning, in contrast to the comparative approaches. We finally analyze the scalability of the proposed method, providing detailed quantitative metrics from our experiments. The implementation and experimental setup are made publicly available, offering a benchmark for future research.</description>

      <title>Learning Spatially-Aware Language and Audio Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can picture a sound scene given an imprecise natural language description. For example, it is easy to imagine an acoustic environment given a phrase like "the lion roar came from right behind me!". For a machine to have the same degree of comprehension, the machine must know what a lion is (semantic attribute), what the concept of "behind" is (spatial attribute) and how these pieces of linguistic information align with the semantic and spatial attributes of the sound (what a roar sounds like when its coming from behind). State-of-the-art audio foundation models which learn to map between audio scenes and natural textual descriptions, are trained on non-spatial audio and text pairs, and hence lack spatial awareness. In contrast, sound event localization and detection models are limited to recognizing sounds from a fixed number of classes, and they localize the source to absolute position (e.g., 0.2m) rather than a position described using natural language (e.g., "next to me"). To address these gaps, we present ELSA a spatially aware-audio and text embedding model trained using multimodal contrastive learning. ELSA supports non-spatial audio, spatial audio, and open vocabulary text captions describing both the spatial and semantic components of sound. To train ELSA: (a) we spatially augment the audio and captions of three open-source audio datasets totaling 4,738 hours of audio, and (b) we design an encoder to capture the semantics of non-spatial audio, and the semantics and spatial attributes of spatial audio using contrastive learning. ELSA is competitive with state-of-the-art for both semantic retrieval and 3D source localization. In particular, ELSA achieves +2.8% mean audio-to-text and text-to-audio R@1 above the baseline, and outperforms by -11.6{\deg} mean-absolute-error in 3D source localization over the baseline.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Platform for Portable and Scalable Active Noise Mitigation for Construction Machinery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel portable and scalable Active Noise Mitigation (PSANM) system designed to reduce low-frequency noise from construction machinery. The PSANM system consists of portable units with autonomous capabilities, optimized for stable performance within a specific power range. An adaptive control algorithm with a variable penalty factor prevents the adaptive filter from over-driving the anti-noise actuators, avoiding non-linear operation and instability. This feature ensures the PSANM system can autonomously control noise at its source, allowing for continuous operation without human intervention. Additionally, the system includes a web server for remote management and is equipped with weather-resistant sensors and actuators, enhancing its usability in outdoor conditions. Laboratory and in-situ experiments demonstrate the PSANM system's effectiveness in reducing construction-related low-frequency noise on a global scale. To further expand the noise reduction zone, additional PSANM units can be strategically positioned in front of noise sources, enhancing the system's scalability.The PSANM system also provides a valuable prototyping platform for developing adaptive algorithms prior to deployment. Unlike many studies that rely solely on simulation results under ideal conditions, this paper offers a holistic evaluation of the effectiveness of applying active noise control techniques directly at the noise source, demonstrating realistic and perceptible noise reduction. This work supports sustainable urban development by offering innovative noise management solutions for the construction industry, contributing to a quieter and more livable urban environment.</description>

      <title>Learning Co-Speech Gesture Representations in Dialogue through Contrastive Learning: An Intrinsic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In face-to-face dialogues, the form-meaning relationship of co-speech gestures varies depending on contextual factors such as what the gestures refer to and the individual characteristics of speakers. These factors make co-speech gesture representation learning challenging. How can we learn meaningful gestures representations considering gestures' variability and relationship with speech? This paper tackles this challenge by employing self-supervised contrastive learning techniques to learn gesture representations from skeletal and speech information. We propose an approach that includes both unimodal and multimodal pre-training to ground gesture representations in co-occurring speech. For training, we utilize a face-to-face dialogue dataset rich with representational iconic gestures. We conduct thorough intrinsic evaluations of the learned representations through comparison with human-annotated pairwise gesture similarity. Moreover, we perform a diagnostic probing analysis to assess the possibility of recovering interpretable gesture features from the learned representations. Our results show a significant positive correlation with human-annotated gesture similarity and reveal that the similarity between the learned representations is consistent with well-motivated patterns related to the dynamics of dialogue interaction. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that several features concerning the form of gestures can be recovered from the latent representations. Overall, this study shows that multimodal contrastive learning is a promising approach for learning gesture representations, which opens the door to using such representations in larger-scale gesture analysis studies.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Sex Bias in Audio Data-driven COPD and COVID-19 Breathing Pattern Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the healthcare industry, researchers have been developing machine learning models to automate diagnosing patients with respiratory illnesses based on their breathing patterns. However, these models do not consider the demographic biases, particularly sex bias, that often occur when models are trained with a skewed patient dataset. Hence, it is essential in such an important industry to reduce this bias so that models can make fair diagnoses. In this work, we examine the bias in models used to detect breathing patterns of two major respiratory diseases, i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19. Using decision tree models trained with audio recordings of breathing patterns obtained from two open-source datasets consisting of 29 COPD and 680 COVID-19-positive patients, we analyze the effect of sex bias on the models. With a threshold optimizer and two constraints (demographic parity and equalized odds) to mitigate the bias, we witness 81.43% (demographic parity difference) and 71.81% (equalized odds difference) improvements. These findings are statistically significant.</description>

      <title>FakeMusicCaps: a Dataset for Detection and Attribution of Synthetic Music Generated via Text-to-Music Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-To-Music (TTM) models have recently revolutionized the automatic music generation research field. Specifically, by reaching superior performances to all previous state-of-the-art models and by lowering the technical proficiency needed to use them. Due to these reasons, they have readily started to be adopted for commercial uses and music production practices. This widespread diffusion of TTMs poses several concerns regarding copyright violation and rightful attribution, posing the need of serious consideration of them by the audio forensics community. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detection and attribution of TTM-generated data. We propose a dataset, FakeMusicCaps that contains several versions of the music-caption pairs dataset MusicCaps re-generated via several state-of-the-art TTM techniques. We evaluate the proposed dataset by performing initial experiments regarding the detection and attribution of TTM-generated audio.</description>

      <title>Personalized Speech Emotion Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction using Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotions are an essential element in verbal communication, so understanding individuals' affect during a human-robot interaction (HRI) becomes imperative. This paper investigates the application of vision transformer models, namely ViT (Vision Transformers) and BEiT (BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers) pipelines, for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) in HRI. The focus is to generalize the SER models for individual speech characteristics by fine-tuning these models on benchmark datasets and exploiting ensemble methods. For this purpose, we collected audio data from different human subjects having pseudo-naturalistic conversations with the NAO robot. We then fine-tuned our ViT and BEiT-based models and tested these models on unseen speech samples from the participants. In the results, we show that fine-tuning vision transformers on benchmark datasets and and then using either these already fine-tuned models or ensembling ViT/BEiT models gets us the highest classification accuracies per individual when it comes to identifying four primary emotions from their speech: neutral, happy, sad, and angry, as compared to fine-tuning vanilla-ViTs or BEiTs.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Speech Models for Word-Level Stuttered Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical diagnosis of stuttering requires an assessment by a licensed speech-language pathologist. However, this process is time-consuming and requires clinicians with training and experience in stuttering and fluency disorders. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of speech-language pathologists report being comfortable working with individuals who stutter, which is inadequate to accommodate for the 80 million individuals who stutter worldwide. Developing machine learning models for detecting stuttered speech would enable universal and automated screening for stuttering, enabling speech pathologists to identify and follow up with patients who are most likely to be diagnosed with a stuttering speech disorder. Previous research in this area has predominantly focused on utterance-level detection, which is not sufficient for clinical settings where word-level annotation of stuttering is the norm. In this study, we curated a stuttered speech dataset with word-level annotations and introduced a word-level stuttering speech detection model leveraging self-supervised speech models. Our evaluation demonstrates that our model surpasses previous approaches in word-level stuttering speech detection. Additionally, we conducted an extensive ablation analysis of our method, providing insight into the most important aspects of adapting self-supervised speech models for stuttered speech detection.</description>

      <title>Investigating Training Objectives for Generative Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative speech enhancement has recently shown promising advancements in improving speech quality in noisy environments. Multiple diffusion-based frameworks exist, each employing distinct training objectives and learning techniques. This paper aims at explaining the differences between these frameworks by focusing our investigation on score-based generative models and Schr\"odinger bridge. We conduct a series of comprehensive experiments to compare their performance and highlight differing training behaviors. Furthermore, we propose a novel perceptual loss function tailored for the Schr\"odinger bridge framework, demonstrating enhanced performance and improved perceptual quality of the enhanced speech signals. All experimental code and pre-trained models are publicly available to facilitate further research and development in this.</description>

      <title>Stimulus Modality Matters: Impact of Perceptual Evaluations from Different Modalities on Speech Emotion Recognition System Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems rely on speech input and emotional labels annotated by humans. However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities. We show that using labels elicited by voice-only stimuli for training yields better performance on the test set, whereas labels elicited by voice-only stimuli.</description>

      <title>Towards Automatic Assessment of Self-Supervised Speech Models using Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores using embedding rank as an unsupervised evaluation metric for general-purpose speech encoders trained via self-supervised learning (SSL). Traditionally, assessing the performance of these encoders is resource-intensive and requires labeled data from the downstream tasks. Inspired by the vision domain, where embedding rank has shown promise for evaluating image encoders without tuning on labeled downstream data, this work examines its applicability in the speech domain, considering the temporal nature of the signals. The findings indicate rank correlates with downstream performance within encoder layers across various downstream tasks and for in- and out-of-domain scenarios. However, rank does not reliably predict the best-performing layer for specific downstream tasks, as lower-ranked layers can outperform higher-ranked ones. Despite this limitation, the results suggest that embedding rank can be a valuable tool for monitoring training progress in SSL speech models, offering a less resource-demanding alternative to traditional evaluation methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Prediction Targets in Masked Pre-Training for Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech foundation models, such as HuBERT and its variants, are pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled speech for various downstream tasks. These models use a masked prediction objective, where the model learns to predict information about masked input segments from the unmasked context. The choice of prediction targets in this framework can influence performance on downstream tasks. For example, targets that encode prosody are beneficial for speaker-related tasks, while targets that encode phonetics are more suited for content-related tasks. Additionally, prediction targets can vary in the level of detail they encode; targets that encode fine-grained acoustic details are beneficial for denoising tasks, while targets that encode higher-level abstractions are more suited for content-related tasks. Despite the importance of prediction targets, the design choices that affect them have not been thoroughly studied. This work explores the design choices and their impact on downstream task performance. Our results indicate that the commonly used design choices for HuBERT can be suboptimal. We propose novel approaches to create more informative prediction targets and demonstrate their effectiveness through improvements across various downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Speaker-IPL: Unsupervised Learning of Speaker Characteristics with i-Vector based Pseudo-Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterative self-training, or iterative pseudo-labeling (IPL)--using an improved model from the current iteration to provide pseudo-labels for the next iteration--has proven to be a powerful approach to enhance the quality of speaker representations. Recent applications of IPL in unsupervised speaker recognition start with representations extracted from very elaborate self-supervised methods (e.g., DINO). However, training such strong self-supervised models is not straightforward (they require hyper-parameters tuning and may not generalize to out-of-domain data) and, moreover, may not be needed at all. To this end, we show the simple, well-studied, and established i-vector generative model is enough to bootstrap the IPL process for unsupervised learning of speaker representations. We also systematically study the impact of other components on the IPL process, which includes the initial model, the encoder, augmentations, the number of clusters, and the clustering algorithm. Remarkably, we find that even with a simple and significantly weaker initial model like i-vector, IPL can still achieve speaker verification performance that rivals state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>EzAudio: Enhancing Text-to-Audio Generation with Efficient Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent diffusion models have shown promising results in text-to-audio (T2A) generation tasks, yet previous models have encountered difficulties in generation quality, computational cost, diffusion sampling, and data preparation. In this paper, we introduce EzAudio, a transformer-based T2A diffusion model, to handle these challenges. Our approach includes several key innovations: (1) We build the T2A model on the latent space of a 1D waveform Variational Autoencoder (VAE), avoiding the complexities of handling 2D spectrogram representations and using an additional neural vocoder. (2) We design an optimized diffusion transformer architecture specifically tailored for audio latent representations and diffusion modeling, which enhances convergence speed, training stability, and memory usage, making the training process easier and more efficient. (3) To tackle data scarcity, we adopt a data-efficient training strategy that leverages unlabeled data for learning acoustic dependencies, audio caption data annotated by audio-language models for text-to-audio alignment learning, and human-labeled data for fine-tuning. (4) We introduce a classifier-free guidance (CFG) rescaling method that simplifies EzAudio by achieving strong prompt alignment while preserving great audio quality when using larger CFG scores, eliminating the need to struggle with finding the optimal CFG score to balance this trade-off. EzAudio surpasses existing open-source models in both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, delivering realistic listening experiences while maintaining a streamlined model structure, low training costs, and an easy-to-follow training pipeline. Code, data, and pre-trained models are released at: https://haidog-yaqub.github.io/EzAudio-Page/.</description>

      <title>3DFacePolicy: Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation with Diffusion Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation has made immersive progress both in research and application developments. The newest approaches focus on Transformer-based methods and diffusion-based methods, however, there is still gap in the vividness and emotional expression between the generated animation and real human face. To tackle this limitation, we propose 3DFacePolicy, a diffusion policy model for 3D facial animation prediction. This method generates variable and realistic human facial movements by predicting the 3D vertex trajectory on the 3D facial template with diffusion policy instead of facial generation for every frame. It takes audio and vertex states as observations to predict the vertex trajectory and imitate real human facial expressions, which keeps the continuous and natural flow of human emotions. The experiments show that our approach is effective in variable and dynamic facial motion synthesizing.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Large Language Models By Layerwise Attention Shortcuts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer architectures are the backbone of the modern AI revolution. However, they are based on simply stacking the same blocks in dozens of layers and processing information sequentially from one block to another. In this paper, we propose to challenge this and introduce adaptive computations for LLM-like setups, which allow the final layer to attend to all of the intermediate layers as it deems fit through the attention mechanism, thereby introducing computational \textbf{attention shortcuts}. These shortcuts can thus make the architecture depth and context adaptive. We showcase four different datasets, namely acoustic tokens, natural language, and symbolic music, and we achieve superior performance for GPT-like architecture. We give evidence via attention maps that the models learn complex dependencies across layers that are adaptive in context and depth depending on the input tokens.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multilingual Speech Generation and Recognition Abilities in LLMs with Constructed Code-switched Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have been explored in the speech domain for both generation and recognition tasks, their applications are predominantly confined to the monolingual scenario, with limited exploration in multilingual and code-switched (CS) contexts. Additionally, speech generation and recognition tasks are often handled separately, such as VALL-E and Qwen-Audio. In this paper, we propose a MutltiLingual MultiTask (MLMT) model, integrating multilingual speech generation and recognition tasks within the single LLM. Furthermore, we develop an effective data construction approach that splits and concatenates words from different languages to equip LLMs with CS synthesis ability without relying on CS data. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms other baselines with a comparable data scale. Furthermore, our data construction approach not only equips LLMs with CS speech synthesis capability with comparable speaker consistency and similarity to any given speaker, but also improves the performance of LLMs in multilingual speech generation and recognition tasks.</description>

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a crucial component in developing general-purpose AI agents capable of natural human-computer interaction. However, building robust multilingual SER systems remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data in languages other than English and Chinese. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance SER performance in low SER resource languages by leveraging data from high-resource languages. Specifically, we employ expressive Speech-to-Speech translation (S2ST) combined with a novel bootstrapping data selection pipeline to generate labeled data in the target language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and generalizable across different upstream models and languages. Our results suggest that this approach can facilitate the development of more scalable and robust multilingual SER systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in music source separation have significantly progressed, particularly in isolating vocals, drums, and bass elements from mixed tracks. These developments owe much to the creation and use of large-scale, multitrack datasets dedicated to these specific components. However, the challenge of extracting similarly sounding sources from orchestra recordings has not been extensively explored, largely due to a scarcity of comprehensive and clean (i.e bleed-free) multitrack datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel multitrack dataset called SynthSOD, developed using a set of simulation techniques to create a realistic (i.e. using high-quality soundfonts), musically motivated, and heterogeneous training set comprising different dynamics, natural tempo changes, styles, and conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate the application of a widely used baseline music separation model trained on our synthesized dataset w.r.t to the well-known EnsembleSet, and evaluate its performance under both synthetic and real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Low-Resource Language and Instruction Following Capabilities of Audio Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio language models can understand audio inputs and perform a range of audio-related tasks based on instructions, such as speech recognition and audio captioning, where the instructions are usually textual prompts. Audio language models are mostly initialized from pre-trained audio encoders and large language models (LLMs). Although these pre-trained components were developed to support multiple languages, audio-language models are trained predominantly on English data, which may limit their usability to only English instructions or English speech inputs. First, this paper examines the performance of existing audio language models in an underserved language using Thai as an example. This paper demonstrates that, despite being built on multilingual backbones, audio language models do not exhibit cross-lingual emergent abilities to low-resource languages. Second, this paper studies data mixture for developing audio language models that are optimized for a target language as well as English. In addition. this paper integrates audio comprehension and speech instruction-following capabilities into a single unified model. Our experiments provide insights into data mixture for enhancing instruction-following capabilities in both a low-resource language and English. Our model, Typhoon-Audio, outperforms existing open-source audio language models by a considerable margin, and it is comparable to state-of-the-art Gemini-1.5-Pro in both English and Thai languages.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Probabilistic Attribute Embedding Approach for Spoofed Speech Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for spoofed speech characterization through explainable probabilistic attribute embeddings. In contrast to high-dimensional raw embeddings extracted from a spoofing countermeasure (CM) whose dimensions are not easy to interpret, the probabilistic attributes are designed to gauge the presence or absence of sub-components that make up a specific spoofing attack. These attributes are then applied to two downstream tasks: spoofing detection and attack attribution. To enforce interpretability also to the back-end, we adopt a decision tree classifier. Our experiments on the ASVspoof2019 dataset with spoof CM embeddings extracted from three models (AASIST, Rawboost-AASIST, SSL-AASIST) suggest that the performance of the attribute embeddings are on par with the original raw spoof CM embeddings for both tasks. The best performance achieved with the proposed approach for spoofing detection and attack attribution, in terms of accuracy, is 99.7% and 99.2%, respectively, compared to 99.7% and 94.7% using the raw CM embeddings. To analyze the relative contribution of each attribute, we estimate their Shapley values. Attributes related to acoustic feature prediction, waveform generation (vocoder), and speaker modeling are found important for spoofing detection; while duration modeling, vocoder, and input type play a role in spoofing attack attribution.</description>

      <title>Zero Shot Text to Speech Augmentation for Automatic Speech Recognition on Low-Resource Accented Speech Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models greatly improved transcription performance both in clean, low noise, acoustic conditions and in reverberant environments. However, all these systems rely on the availability of hundreds of hours of labelled training data in specific acoustic conditions. When such a training dataset is not available, the performance of the system is heavily impacted. For example, this happens when a specific acoustic environment or a particular population of speakers is under-represented in the training dataset. Specifically, in this paper we investigate the effect of accented speech data on an off-the-shelf ASR system. Furthermore, we suggest a strategy based on zero-shot text-to-speech to augment the accented speech corpora. We show that this augmentation method is able to mitigate the loss in performance of the ASR system on accented data up to 5% word error rate reduction (WERR). In conclusion, we demonstrate that by incorporating a modest fraction of real with synthetically generated data, the ASR system exhibits superior performance compared to a model trained exclusively on authentic accented speech with up to 14% WERR.</description>

      <title>Ideal-LLM: Integrating Dual Encoders and Language-Adapted LLM for Multilingual Speech-to-Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating audio encoders with LLMs through connectors has enabled these models to process and comprehend audio modalities, significantly enhancing speech-to-text tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speech translation (AST). However, these methods often overlook the critical aspect of language adaptation in multilingual settings, relying instead on multilingual data without adequately addressing language differences. To address this gap, we propose the Ideal-LLM model, which employs dual multilingual encoders to enrich language feature information and utilizes a language-adapted connector to target the adaptation of each language specifically. By leveraging the complementary strengths of Whisper and MMS encoders, our approach ensures richer multilingual representations. Additionally, the language-adapted connector enhances modal transformation via a language weight selector tailored for each language. Experimental results demonstrate that Ideal-LLM significantly improves ASR performance, achieving a 32.6% relative reduction in average word error rates compared to the standard speech encoder integrated with LLMs and yields an average BLEU score of 36.78 for AST task.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Informal Speech Dataset for Punctuation Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presently, punctuation restoration models are evaluated almost solely on well-structured, scripted corpora. On the other hand, real-world ASR systems and post-processing pipelines typically apply towards spontaneous speech with significant irregularities, stutters, and deviations from perfect grammar. To address this discrepancy, we introduce SponSpeech, a punctuation restoration dataset derived from informal speech sources, which includes punctuation and casing information. In addition to publicly releasing the dataset, we contribute a filtering pipeline that can be used to generate more data. Our filtering pipeline examines the quality of both speech audio and transcription text. We also carefully construct a ``challenging" test set, aimed at evaluating models' ability to leverage audio information to predict otherwise grammatically ambiguous punctuation. SponSpeech is available at https://github.com/GitHubAccountAnonymous/PR, along with all code for dataset building and model runs.</description>

      <title>WER We Stand: Benchmarking Urdu ASR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of Urdu Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. We analyze the performance of three ASR model families: Whisper, MMS, and Seamless-M4T using Word Error Rate (WER), along with a detailed examination of the most frequent wrong words and error types including insertions, deletions, and substitutions. Our analysis is conducted using two types of datasets, read speech and conversational speech. Notably, we present the first conversational speech dataset designed for benchmarking Urdu ASR models. We find that seamless-large outperforms other ASR models on the read speech dataset, while whisper-large performs best on the conversational speech dataset. Furthermore, this evaluation highlights the complexities of assessing ASR models for low-resource languages like Urdu using quantitative metrics alone and emphasizes the need for a robust Urdu text normalization system. Our findings contribute valuable insights for developing robust ASR systems for low-resource languages like Urdu.</description>

      <title>TSELM: Target Speaker Extraction using Discrete Tokens and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose TSELM, a novel target speaker extraction network that leverages discrete tokens and language models. TSELM utilizes multiple discretized layers from WavLM as input tokens and incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to integrate target speaker information. Language models are employed to capture the sequence dependencies, while a scalable HiFi-GAN is used to reconstruct the audio from the tokens. By applying a cross-entropy loss, TSELM models the probability distribution of output tokens, thus converting the complex regression problem of audio generation into a classification task. Experimental results show that TSELM achieves excellent results in speech quality and comparable results in speech intelligibility.</description>

      <title>Label-Looping: Highly Efficient Decoding for Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient greedy decoding algorithm for Transducer-based speech recognition models. We redesign the standard nested-loop design for RNN-T decoding, swapping loops over frames and labels: the outer loop iterates over labels, while the inner loop iterates over frames searching for the next non-blank symbol. Additionally, we represent partial hypotheses in a special structure using CUDA tensors, supporting parallelized hypotheses manipulations. Experiments show that the label-looping algorithm is up to 2.0X faster than conventional batched decoding when using batch size 32. It can be further combined with other compiler or GPU call-related techniques to achieve even more speedup. Our algorithm is general-purpose and can work with both conventional Transducers and Token-and-Duration Transducers. We open-source our implementation to benefit the research community.</description>

      <title>Music auto-tagging in the long tail: A few-shot approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of digital music, using tags to efficiently organize and retrieve music from extensive databases is crucial for music catalog owners. Human tagging by experts is labor-intensive but mostly accurate, whereas automatic tagging through supervised learning has approached satisfying accuracy but is restricted to a predefined set of training tags. Few-shot learning offers a viable solution to expand beyond this small set of predefined tags by enabling models to learn from only a few human-provided examples to understand tag meanings and subsequently apply these tags autonomously. We propose to integrate few-shot learning methodology into multi-label music auto-tagging by using features from pre-trained models as inputs to a lightweight linear classifier, also known as a linear probe. We investigate different popular pre-trained features, as well as different few-shot parametrizations with varying numbers of classes and samples per class. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple model with pre-trained features can achieve performance close to state-of-the-art models while using significantly less training data, such as 20 samples per tag. Additionally, our linear probe performs competitively with leading models when trained on the entire training dataset. The results show that this transfer learning-based few-shot approach could effectively address the issue of automatically assigning long-tail tags with only limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Wave-U-Mamba: An End-To-End Framework For High-Quality And Efficient Speech Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Super-Resolution (SSR) is a task of enhancing low-resolution speech signals by restoring missing high-frequency components. Conventional approaches typically reconstruct log-mel features, followed by a vocoder that generates high-resolution speech in the waveform domain. However, as log-mel features lack phase information, this can result in performance degradation during the reconstruction phase. Motivated by recent advances with Selective State Spaces Models (SSMs), we propose a method, referred to as Wave-U-Mamba that directly performs SSR in time domain. In our comparative study, including models such as WSRGlow, NU-Wave 2, and AudioSR, Wave-U-Mamba demonstrates superior performance, achieving the lowest Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) across various low-resolution sampling rates, ranging from 8 kHz to 24 kHz. Additionally, subjective human evaluations, scored using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) reveal that our method produces SSR with natural and human-like quality. Furthermore, Wave-U-Mamba achieves these results while generating high-resolution speech over nine times faster than baseline models on a single A100 GPU, with parameter sizes less than 2% of those in the baseline models.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Based Generative Error Correction: A Challenge and Baselines for Speech Recognition, Speaker Tagging, and Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given recent advances in generative AI technology, a key question is how large language models (LLMs) can enhance acoustic modeling tasks using text decoding results from a frozen, pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. To explore new capabilities in language modeling for speech processing, we introduce the generative speech transcription error correction (GenSEC) challenge. This challenge comprises three post-ASR language modeling tasks: (i) post-ASR transcription correction, (ii) speaker tagging, and (iii) emotion recognition. These tasks aim to emulate future LLM-based agents handling voice-based interfaces while remaining accessible to a broad audience by utilizing open pretrained language models or agent-based APIs. We also discuss insights from baseline evaluations, as well as lessons learned for designing future evaluations.</description>
