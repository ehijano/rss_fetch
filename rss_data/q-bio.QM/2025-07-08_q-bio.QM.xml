      <title>Mono and Polyauxic Growth Kinetic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of microbial growth curves is essential for understanding and optimizing bioprocesses in biotechnology and environmental engineering. While classical monoauxic models such as Monod, Boltzmann, and Gompertz are widely used, they often lack biological interpretability or fail to capture the complex, multiphasic growth patterns observed in systems with mixed substrates or microbial communities. This paper presents a methodological framework for reparametrizing the Boltzmann and Gompertz equations, assigning direct biological significance to each parameter and enabling their application to both monoauxic and polyauxic (multi-phase) growth scenarios. Polyauxic growth is modeled as a weighted sum of sigmoidal functions, with constraints for model identifiability and biological plausibility. Robust parameter estimation is achieved using a Lorentzian loss function, combined with a global-local optimization strategy (Particle Swarm Optimization and Nelder-Mead), and systematic outlier exclusion using the ROUT method. Model parsimony is enforced via established information criteria. This workflow enables reliable, reproducible, and interpretable extraction of kinetic parameters from complex growth data and is broadly applicable to other fields where sigmoidal patterns are observed.</description>

      <title>Foreground-aware Virtual Staining for Accurate 3D Cell Morphological Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopy enables direct observation of cellular morphology in 3D, with transmitted-light methods offering low-cost, minimally invasive imaging and fluorescence microscopy providing specificity and contrast. Virtual staining combines these strengths by using machine learning to predict fluorescence images from label-free inputs. However, training of existing methods typically relies on loss functions that treat all pixels equally, thus reproducing background noise and artifacts instead of focusing on biologically meaningful signals. We introduce Spotlight, a simple yet powerful virtual staining approach that guides the model to focus on relevant cellular structures. Spotlight uses histogram-based foreground estimation to mask pixel-wise loss and to calculate a Dice loss on soft-thresholded predictions for shape-aware learning. Applied to a 3D benchmark dataset, Spotlight improves morphological representation while preserving pixel-level accuracy, resulting in virtual stains better suited for downstream tasks such as segmentation and profiling.</description>

      <title>Topological Sequence Analysis of Genomes: Delta Complex approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algebraic topology has been widely applied to point cloud data to capture geometric shapes and topological structures. However, its application to genome sequence analysis remains rare. In this work, we propose topological sequence analysis (TSA) techniques by constructing $\Delta$-complexes and classifying spaces, leading to persistent homology, and persistent path homology on genome sequences. We also develop $\Delta$-complex-based persistent Laplacians to facilitate the topological spectral analysis of genome sequences. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed TSA approaches in phylogenetic analysis using Ebola virus sequences and whole bacterial genomes. The present TSA methods are more efficient than earlier TSA model, k-mer topology, and thus have a potential to be applied to other time-consuming sequential data analyses, such as those in linguistics, literature, music, media, and social contexts.</description>

      <title>ADPv2: A Hierarchical Histological Tissue Type-Annotated Dataset for Potential Biomarker Discovery of Colorectal Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However, publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32 distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation learning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset. We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that our dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues affected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that confirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development. Our dataset is publicly available here: Part 1 at https://zenodo.org/records/15307021, Part 2 at https://zenodo.org/records/15312384 and Part 3 at https://zenodo.org/records/15312792</description>

      <title>A Statistical Framework for Co-Mediators of Zero-Inflated Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed molecular profiling at the individual cell level. However, integrating high-dimensional single-cell data into causal mediation analysis remains challenging due to zero inflation and complex mediator structures. We propose a novel mediation framework leveraging zero-inflated negative binomial models to characterize cell-level mediator distributions and beta regression for zero-inflation proportions. Subject-level mediators are aggregated from cell-level data to perform mediation analysis assessing causal pathways linking gene expression to clinical outcomes. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate improved power and controlled false discovery rates. We further illustrate the utility of this approach through application to ROSMAP single-cell transcriptomic data, uncovering biologically meaningful mediation effects that enhance understanding of disease mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Linear Generative Framework for Structure-Function Coupling in the Human Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain function emerges from coordinated activity across anatomically connected regions, where structural connectivity (SC) -- the network of white matter pathways - provides the physical substrate for functional connectivity (FC) -- the correlated neural activity between brain areas. While these structural and functional networks exhibit substantial overlap, their relationship involves complex, indirect mechanisms, including the dynamic interplay of direct and indirect pathways, recurrent network interactions, and neuromodulatory influences. To systematically untangle how structural architecture shapes functional patterns, this work aims to establish a set of rules that decode how direct and indirect structural connections and motifs give rise to FC between brain regions. Specifically, using a generative linear model, we derive explicit rules that predict an individual's resting-state fMRI FC from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived SC, validated against topological null models. Examining the rules reveals distinct classes of brain regions, with integrator hubs acting as structural linchpins promoting synchronization and mediator hubs serving as structural fulcrums orchestrating competing dynamics. Through virtual lesion experiments, we demonstrate how different cortical and subcortical systems distinctively contribute to global functional organization. Together, this framework disentangles the mechanisms by which structural architecture drives functional dynamics, enabling the prediction of how pathological or surgical disruptions to brain connectivity cascade through functional networks, potentially leading to cognitive and behavioral impairments.</description>

      <title>Exact phylodynamic likelihood via structured Markov genealogy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that each member of a broad class of Markovian population models induces a unique stochastic process on the space of genealogies. We construct this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of a filter equation, the structure of which is completely determined by the population model. We show that existing phylodynamic methods based on either the coalescent or the linear birth-death processes are special cases. We derive some properties of filter equations and describe a class of algorithms that can be used to numerically solve them. Our results open the door to statistically efficient likelihood-based phylodynamic inference for a much wider class of models than is currently possible.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the CoW with the TopCoW Challenge: Topology-Aware Anatomical Segmentation of the Circle of Willis for CTA and MRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is an important network of arteries connecting major circulations of the brain. Its vascular architecture is believed to affect the risk, severity, and clinical outcome of serious neurovascular diseases. However, characterizing the highly variable CoW anatomy is still a manual and time-consuming expert task. The CoW is usually imaged by two non-invasive angiographic imaging modalities, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA), but there exist limited datasets with annotations on CoW anatomy, especially for CTA. Therefore, we organized the TopCoW challenge with the release of an annotated CoW dataset. The TopCoW dataset is the first public dataset with voxel-level annotations for 13 CoW vessel components, enabled by virtual reality technology. It is also the first large dataset using 200 pairs of MRA and CTA from the same patients. As part of the benchmark, we invited submissions worldwide and attracted over 250 registered participants from six continents. The submissions were evaluated on both internal and external test datasets of 226 scans from over five centers. The top performing teams achieved over 90% Dice scores at segmenting the CoW components, over 80% F1 scores at detecting key CoW components, and over 70% balanced accuracy at classifying CoW variants for nearly all test sets. The best algorithms also showed clinical potential in classifying fetal-type posterior cerebral artery and locating aneurysms with CoW anatomy. TopCoW demonstrated the utility and versatility of CoW segmentation algorithms for a wide range of downstream clinical applications with explainability. The annotated datasets and best performing algorithms have been released as public Zenodo records to foster further methodological development and clinical tool building.</description>
