      <title>An efficient algorithm for \textsc{$\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free Edge Deletion} on graphs having a product structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs, a graph is \emph{$\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free} if it has no subgraph isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{F}$. We present a fixed-parameter linear-time algorithm that decides whether a planar graph can be made $\mathcal{F}$-subgraph-free by deleting at most $k$ vertices or $k$ edges, where the parameters are $k$, $\lvert \mathcal{F} \rvert$, and the maximum number of vertices in a member of $\mathcal{F}$. The running time of our algorithm is double-exponential in the parameters, which is faster than the algorithm obtained by applying the first-order model checking result for graphs of bounded twin-width.
  To obtain this result, we develop a unified framework for designing algorithms for this problem on graphs with a ``product structure.'' Using this framework, we also design algorithms for other graph classes that generalize planar graphs. Specifically, the problem admits a fixed-parameter linear time algorithm on disk graphs of bounded local radius, and a fixed-parameter almost-linear time algorithm on graphs of bounded genus.
  Finally, we show that our result gives a tight fixed-parameter algorithm in the following sense: Even when $\mathcal{F}$ consists of a single graph $F$ and the input is restricted to planar graphs, it is unlikely to drop any parameters $k$ and $\lvert V(F) \rvert$ while preserving fixed-parameter tractability, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails.</description>

      <title>Decidability and Characterization of Expansivity for Group Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group cellular automata are continuous, shift-commuting endomorphisms of $G^\mathbb{Z}$, where $G$ is a finite group. We provide an easy-to-check characterization of expansivity for group cellular automata on abelian groups and we prove that expansivity is a decidable property for general (non-abelian) groups. Moreover, we show that the class of expansive group cellular automata is strictly contained in that of topologically transitive injective group cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Excluding $K_{2,t}$ as a fat minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, the graph $K_{2,t}$ satisfies the fat minor conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu: for every $K\in \mathbb{N}$ there exist $M,A\in \mathbb{N}$ such that every graph with no $K$-fat $K_{2,t}$ minor is $(M,A)$-quasi-isometric to a graph with no $K_{2,t}$ minor. We use this to obtain an efficient algorithm for approximating the minimal multiplicative distortion of any embedding of a finite graph into a $K_{2,t}$-minor-free graph, answering a question of Chepoi, Dragan, Newman, Rabinovich, and Vax\`es from 2012.</description>

      <title>Directed Acyclic Outerplanar Graphs Have Constant Stack Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stack number of a directed acyclic graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ for which there is a topological ordering of $G$ and a $k$-coloring of the edges such that no two edges of the same color cross, i.e., have alternating endpoints along the topological ordering. We prove that the stack number of directed acyclic outerplanar graphs is bounded by a constant, which gives a positive answer to a conjecture by Heath, Pemmaraju and Trenk [SIAM J. Computing, 1999]. As an immediate consequence, this shows that all upward outerplanar graphs have constant stack number, answering a question by Bhore et al. [Eur. J. Comb., 2023] and thereby making significant progress towards the problem for general upward planar graphs originating from Nowakowski and Parker [Order, 1989]. As our main tool we develop the novel technique of directed $H$-partitions, which might be of independent interest. We complement the bounded stack number for directed acyclic outerplanar graphs by constructing a family of directed acyclic 2-trees that have unbounded stack number, thereby refuting a conjecture by N\"ollenburg and Pupyrev [GD 2023].</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for the Network Scale-Up Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemiologists and social scientists have used the Network Scale-Up Method (NSUM) for over thirty years to estimate the size of a hidden sub-population within a social network. This method involves querying a subset of network nodes about the number of their neighbours belonging to the hidden sub-population. In general, NSUM assumes that the social network topology and the hidden sub-population distribution are well-behaved; hence, the NSUM estimate is close to the actual value. However, bounds on NSUM estimation errors have not been analytically proven. This paper provides analytical bounds on the error incurred by the two most popular NSUM estimators. These bounds assume that the queried nodes accurately provide their degree and the number of neighbors belonging to the hidden population. Our key findings are twofold. First, we show that when an adversary designs the network and places the hidden sub-population, then the estimate can be a factor of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ off from the real value (in a network with $n$ nodes). Second, we also prove error bounds when the underlying network is randomly generated, showing that a small constant factor can be achieved with high probability using samples of logarithmic size $O(\log{n})$. We present improved analytical bounds for Erdos-Renyi and Scale-Free networks. Our theoretical analysis is supported by an extensive set of numerical experiments designed to determine the effect of the sample size on the accuracy of the estimates in both synthetic and real networks.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Fair Orientations of Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finding fair orientations of graphs of chores, in which each vertex corresponds to an agent, each edge corresponds to a chore, and a chore has zero marginal utility to an agent if its corresponding edge is not incident to the vertex corresponding to the agent. Recently, Zhou et al. (IJCAI, 2024) analyzed the complexity of deciding whether graphs containing a mixture of goods and chores have EFX orientations, and conjectured that deciding whether graphs containing only chores have EFX orientations is NP-complete. We resolve this conjecture by giving polynomial-time algorithms that find EF1 and EFX orientations of graphs containing only chores if they exist, even if there are self-loops. Remarkably, our result demonstrates a surprising separation between the case of goods and the case of chores, because deciding whether graphs containing only goods have EFX orientations was shown to be NP-complete by Christodoulou et al. (EC, 2023). In addition, we show the EF1 and EFX orientation problems for multigraphs to be NP-complete.</description>

      <title>H-Planarity and Parametric Extensions: when Modulators Act Globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a series of graph decompositions based on the modulator/target scheme of modification problems that enable several algorithmic applications that parametrically extend the algorithmic potential of planarity. In the core of our approach is a polynomial time algorithm for computing planar H-modulators. Given a graph class H, a planar H-modulator of a graph G is a set X \subseteq V(G) such that the ``torso'' of X is planar and all connected components of G - X belong to H. Here, the torso of X is obtained from G[X] if, for every connected component of G-X, we form a clique out of its neighborhood on G[X]. We introduce H-Planarity as the problem of deciding whether a graph G has a planar H-modulator. We prove that, if H is hereditary, CMSO-definable, and decidable in polynomial time, then H-Planarity is solvable in polynomial time. Further, we introduce two parametric extensions of H-Planarity by defining the notions of H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth, which generalize the concepts of elimination distance and tree decompositions to the class H. Combining this result with existing FPT algorithms for various H-modulator problems, we thereby obtain FPT algorithms parameterized by H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth for numerous graph classes H. By combining the well-known algorithmic properties of planar graphs and graphs of bounded treewidth, our methods for computing H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth lead to a variety of algorithmic applications. For instance, once we know that a given graph has bounded H-planar treedepth or bounded H-planar treewidth, we can derive additive approximation algorithms for graph coloring and polynomial-time algorithms for counting (weighted) perfect matchings. Furthermore, we design Efficient Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes (EPTAS-es) for several problems, including Maximum Independent Set.</description>

      <title>The lonely runner conjecture holds for eight runners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the lonely runner conjecture holds for eight runners. Our proof relies on a computer verification and on recent results that allow bounding the size of a minimal counterexample. We note that our approach also applies to the known cases with 4, 5, 6, and 7 runners. We expect that minor improvements to our approach could be enough to solve the cases of 9 or 10 runners.</description>

      <title>VC-Dimension vs Degree: An Uncertainty Principle for Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we uncover a new uncertainty principle that governs the complexity of Boolean functions. This principle manifests as a fundamental trade-off between two central measures of complexity: a combinatorial complexity of its supported set, captured by its Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension ($\mathrm{VC}(f)$), and its algebraic structure, captured by its polynomial degree over various fields. We establish two primary inequalities that formalize this trade-off: $\mathrm{VC}(f)+\mathrm{deg}(f)\ge n,$ and $\mathrm{VC}(f)+\mathrm{deg}_{\mathbb{F}_2}(f)\ge n$. In particular, these results recover the classical uncertainty principle on the discrete hypercube, as well as the Sziklai--Weiner's bound in the case of $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>
