      <title>Bisplit graphs -- A Structural and algorithmic study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dominating set $S$ of a graph $G(V,E)$ is called a \textit{secure dominating set} if each vertex $u \in V(G) \setminus S$ is adjacent to a vertex $v \in S$ such that $(S \setminus \{v\}) \cup \{u\}$ is a dominating set of $G$. The \textit{secure domination number} $\gamma_s(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a secure dominating set of $G$. The \textit{Minimum Secure Domination problem} is to find a secure dominating set of a graph $G$ of cardinality $\gamma_s(G)$. In this paper, the computational complexity of the secure domination problem on several graph classes is investigated. The decision version of secure domination problem was shown to be NP-complete on star(comb) convex split graphs and bisplit graphs. So we further focus on complexity analysis of secure domination problem under additional structural restrictions on bisplit graphs. In particular, by imposing chordality as a parameter, we analyse its impact on the computational status of the problem on bisplit graphs. We establish the P versus NP-C dichotomy status of secure domination problem under restrictions on cycle length within bisplit graphs. In addition, we establish that the problem is polynomial-time solvable in chain graphs. We also prove that the secure domination problem cannot be approximated for a bisplit graph within a factor of $(1-\epsilon)~ln~|V|$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, unless $NP \subseteq DTIME(|V|^{O(log~log~|V|)})$.</description>

      <title>On an Erd\H{o}s--Lov'asz problem: 3-critical 3-graphs of minimum degree 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Lov'asz asked whether there exists a "3-critical" 3-uniform hypergraph in which every vertex has degree at least 7. The original formulation does not specify what 3-critical means, and two non-equivalent notions have appeared in the literature and in later discussions of the problem. In this paper we resolve the question under both interpretations. For the transversal interpretation (criticality with respect to the transversal number), we prove that a 3-uniform hypergraph $H$ with $\tau(H)=3$ and $\tau(H-e)=2$ for every edge $e$ has at most 10 edges; in particular, $\delta(H)\le 6$, and this bound is sharp, witnessed by the complete 3-graph $K^{(3)}_5$. For the chromatic interpretation (criticality with respect to weak vertex-colourings), we give an explicit 3-uniform hypergraph on 9 vertices with $\chi(H)=3$ and minimum degree $\delta(H)=7$ such that deleting any single edge or any single vertex makes it 2-colourable. The criticality of the example is certified by explicit witness 2-colourings listed in the appendices, together with a short verification script.</description>

      <title>Dominion of some graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph G equals (V,E), a subset S subset of V is a dominating set if every vertex in V minus S is adjacent to some vertex in S. The dominating set with the least cardinality, gamma, is called a gamma-set which is commonly known as a minimum dominating set. The dominion of a graph G, denoted by zeta(G), is the number of its gamma-sets. Some relations between these two seemingly distinct parameters are established. In particular, we present the dominions of paths, some cycles and the join of any two graphs.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystalline Gibbs states in 4-dimensional lattice-gas models with finite-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional lattice-gas model with finite-range interactions that has non-periodic, ``quasicrystalline'' Gibbs states at low temperatures. Such Gibbs states are probability measures which are small perturbations of non-periodic ground-state configurations corresponding to tilings of the plane with Ammann's aperiodic tiles. Our construction is based on the correspondence between probabilistic cellular automata and Gibbs measures on their space-time trajectories, and a classical result on noise-resilient computing with cellular automata. The cellular automaton is constructed on the basis of Ammann's tiles, which are deterministic in one direction, and has non-periodic space-time trajectories corresponding to each valid tiling. Repetitions along two extra dimensions, together with an error-correction mechanism, ensure stability of the trajectories subjected to noise.</description>

      <title>On Prime Matrix Product Factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ factors into graphs $H$ and $K$ via a matrix product if $A = BC$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the adjacency matrices of $G$, $H$, and $K$, respectively. The graph $G$ is prime if, in every such factorization, one of the factors is a perfect matching that is, it corresponds to a permutation matrix. We characterize all prime graphs, then using this result we classify all factorable forests, answering a question of Akbari et al. [\emph{Linear Algebra and its Applications} (2025)]. We prove that every torus is factorable, and we characterize all possible factorizations of grids, addressing two questions posed by Maghsoudi et al. [\emph{Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics} (2025)].</description>

      <title>Geometric characterisation of structural and regular equivalences in undirected (hyper)graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similarity notions between vertices in a graph, such as structural and regular equivalence, are one of the main ingredients in clustering tools in complex network science. We generalise structural and regular equivalences for undirected hypergraphs and provide a characterisation of structural and regular equivalences of undirected graphs and hypergraphs through neighbourhood graphs and Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Our characterisation sheds new light on these similarity notions opening a new avenue for their exploration. These characterisations also enable the construction of a possibly wide family of regular partitions, thereby offering a new route to a task that has so far been computationally challenging.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Framework for Online Stochastic Matching with Correlated Arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02229v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of online algorithms for matching markets and revenue management settings is usually bound by the assumption that the demand process is formed by a fixed-length sequence of queries with unknown types, each drawn independently. This notion of serial independence implies that the demand of each type, i.e., the number of queries of a given type, has low variance and is approximately Poisson-distributed.
  This paper proposes a nonparametric framework for modeling arrival sequences in online stochastic matching that departs from the serial independent assumption. We propose two models, INDEP and CORREL, that capture different forms of serial correlations by combining a nonparametric distribution for the demand with standard assumptions on the arrival patterns -- adversarial or random order. The INDEP model can capture arbitrary serial correlations within each customer type but assumes cross-sectional independence across types, whereas the CORREL model captures common shocks across customer types. We demonstrate that fluid relaxations, which rely solely on demand expectations, have arbitrarily bad performance guarantees. In contrast, we develop new algorithms that achieve optimal (constant-factor) performance guarantees in each model. Our mathematical analysis includes tighter linear programming (LP) relaxations that leverage distribution knowledge, and a new lossless randomized LP rounding scheme for INDEP. We test our new LP relaxations and rounding scheme in simulations on real and synthetic data, and find that they consistently outperform well-established matching algorithms, especially on real data sequences that exhibit greater demand variance.</description>

      <title>Maximum Independent Set when excluding an induced minor: $K_1 + tK_2$ and $tC_3 \uplus C_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dallard, Milani\v{c}, and \v{S}torgel [arXiv '22] ask if for every class excluding a fixed planar graph $H$ as an induced minor, Maximum Independent Set can be solved in polynomial time, and show that this is indeed the case when $H$ is any planar complete bipartite graph, or the 5-vertex clique minus one edge, or minus two disjoint edges. A positive answer would constitute a far-reaching generalization of the state-of-the-art, when we currently do not know if a polynomial-time algorithm exists when $H$ is the 7-vertex path. Relaxing tractability to the existence of a quasipolynomial-time algorithm, we know substantially more. Indeed, quasipolynomial-time algorithms were recently obtained for the $t$-vertex cycle, $C_t$ [Gartland et al., STOC '21] and the disjoint union of $t$ triangles, $tC_3$ [Bonamy et al., SODA '23].
  We give, for every integer $t$, a polynomial-time algorithm running in $n^{O(t^5)}$ when $H$ is the friendship graph $K_1 + tK_2$ ($t$ disjoint edges plus a vertex fully adjacent to them), and a quasipolynomial-time algorithm running in $n^{O(t^2 \log n)+f(t)}$, with $f$ a single-exponential function, when $H$ is $tC_3 \uplus C_4$ (the disjoint union of $t$ triangles and a 4-vertex cycle). The former extends a classical result on graphs excluding $tK_2$ as an induced subgraph [Alekseev, DAM '07], while the latter extends Bonamy et al.'s result.</description>

      <title>Almost perfect nonlinear power functions with exponents expressed as fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a finite field, let $f$ be a function from $F$ to $F$, and let $a$ be a nonzero element of $F$. The discrete derivative of $f$ in direction $a$ is $\Delta_a f \colon F \to F$ with $(\Delta_a f)(x)=f(x+a)-f(x)$. The differential spectrum of $f$ is the multiset of cardinalities of all the fibers of all the derivatives $\Delta_a f$ as $a$ runs through $F^*$. An almost perfect nonlinear (APN) function is one for which the largest cardinality in its differential spectrum is $2$. Almost perfect nonlinear functions are of interest as cryptographic primitives. If $d$ is a positive integer, then the power function over $F$ with exponent $d$ is the function $f \colon F \to F$ with $f(x)=x^d$ for every $x \in F$. There is a small number of known infinite families of APN power functions. In this paper, we re-express the exponents for one such family in a more convenient form. This enables us not only to obtain the differential spectrum of each power function $f$ with an exponent in our family, but also to determine the elements that lie in an arbitrary fiber of the discrete derivative of $f$. This differential analysis, which is far more detailed than previous results, is achieved by composing the discrete derivative of $f$ with some permutations and a double covering of its domain to obtain a function whose fibers can more readily be analyzed.</description>

      <title>Finding Diverse Solutions Parameterized by Cliquewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding a few solutions for a given problem that are diverse, as opposed to finding a single best solution to solve the problem, has recently become a notable topic in theoretical computer science. Recently, Baste, Fellows, Jaffke, Masa\v{r}\'ik, Oliveira, Philip, and Rosamond showed that under a standard structural parameterization by treewidth, one can find a set of diverse solutions for many problems with only a very small additional cost [Artificial Intelligence 2022]. In this paper, we investigate a much stronger graph parameter, the cliquewidth, which can additionally describe some dense graph classes. Broadly speaking, it describes graphs that can be recursively constructed by a few operations defined on graphs whose vertices are divided into a bounded number of groups while each such group behaves uniformly with respect to any operation.
  We show that for any vertex problem, if we are given a dynamic program solving that problem on cliquewidth decomposition, we can modify it to produce a few solutions that are as diverse as possible with as little overhead as in the above-mentioned treewidth paper. As a consequence, we prove that a diverse version of any MSO$_1$ expressible problem can be solved in linear FPT time parameterized by the cliquewidth, the number of sought solutions, and the number of quantifiers in the formula, which was a natural missing piece in the complexity landscape of structural graph parameters and logic for the diverse problems. We prove our results allowing for a more general natural collection of diversity functions compared to only two mostly studied diversity functions previously. That might be of independent interest as a larger pool of different diversity functions can highlight various aspects of different solutions to a problem.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing graphs and their connectivity using graphlets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphlets are subgraphs rooted at a fixed vertex. The number of occurrences of graphlets aligned to a particular vertex, called graphlet degree sequence (gds), gives a topological description of the surrounding of the analyzed vertex. Graphlet degree distribution (gdd) of a graph is a matrix containing graphlet degree sequence for all vertices in the given graph. A long standing open problem called reconstruction conjecture (RC) asks whether the structure of a graph is uniquely determined by the multiset of its vertex-deleted subgraphs. Graphlet degree distribution up to size (n - 1), (&lt;= n - 1)-gdd, gives more information to reconstruct the graph and we use it to reconstruct any graph having a unique almost-asymmetric vertex-deleted subgraph, where almost-asymmetric means that at most one automorphism orbit has size larger than one. Moreover, we prove that any graph containing a vertex-cut of size 1 or any graph of order n having a vertex with degree at most 2 or at least n-2 is reconstructible from its (&lt;= n - 1)-gdd, which expands results shown in the standard RC. We also discuss the relation between gdd and graph connectivity and the conditions on (&lt;= 3)-gdd, whose breaking means that no graph with such gdd exists.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Submodular Maximization Under Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function with access to a noisy value oracle for the function instead of an exact value oracle. Similar to prior work, we assume that the noisy oracle is persistent in that multiple calls to the oracle for a specific set always return the same value. In this model, Hassidim and Singer (2017) design a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint, and Huang et al (2022) design a $(1-1/e)/2$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to any arbitrary matroid constraint. In this paper, we design a meta-algorithm that allows us to take any "robust" algorithm for exact submodular maximization as a black box and transform it into an algorithm for the noisy setting while retaining the approximation guarantee. By using the meta-algorithm with the measured continuous greedy algorithm, we obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation (resp. $1/e$-approximation) for monotone (resp. non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint under noise. Furthermore, by using the meta-algorithm with the double greedy algorithm, we obtain a $1/2$-approximation for unconstrained (non-monotone) submodular maximization under noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To date, the best circle graph recognition algorithm runs in almost linear time as it relies on a split decomposition algorithm that uses the union-find data-structure. We show that in the case of circle graphs, the PC-tree data-structure allows one to avoid the union-find data-structure to compute the split decomposition in linear time. As a consequence, we obtain the first linear-time recognition algorithm for circle graphs.</description>
