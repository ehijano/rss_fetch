      <title>Sublinear Data Structures for Nearest Neighbor in Ultra High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric data structures have been extensively studied in the regime where the dimension is much smaller than the number of input points. But in many scenarios in Machine Learning, the dimension can be much higher than the number of points and can be so high that the data structure might be unable to read and store all coordinates of the input and query points.
  Inspired by these scenarios and related studies in feature selection and explainable clustering, we initiate the study of geometric data structures in this ultra-high dimensional regime. Our focus is the {\em approximate nearest neighbor} problem.
  In this problem, we are given a set of $n$ points $C\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ and have to produce a {\em small} data structure that can {\em quickly} answer the following query: given $q\in \mathbb{R}^d$, return a point $c\in C$ that is approximately nearest to $q$.
  The main question in this paper is: {\em Is there a data structure with sublinear ($o(nd)$) space and sublinear ($o(d)$) query time when $d\gg n$?} In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. We present $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation data structures with the following guarantees. For $\ell_1$- and $\ell_2$-norm distances: $\tilde O(n \log(d)/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ space and $\tilde O(n/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ query time. We show that these space and time bounds are tight up to $\mathrm{poly}{(\log n/\epsilon)}$ factors. For $\ell_p$-norm distances: $\tilde O(n^2 \log(d) (\log\log (n)/\epsilon)^p)$ space and $\tilde O\left(n(\log\log (n)/\epsilon)^p\right)$ query time.
  Via simple reductions, our data structures imply sublinear-in-$d$ data structures for some other geometric problems; e.g. approximate orthogonal range search, furthest neighbor, and give rise to a sublinear $O(1)$-approximate representation of $k$-median and $k$-means clustering.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic-Time Internal Pattern Matching Queries in Compressed and Dynamic Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal Pattern Matching (IPM) queries on a text $T$, given two fragments $X$ and $Y$ of $T$ such that $|Y|&lt;2|X|$, ask to compute all exact occurrences of $X$ within $Y$. IPM queries have been introduced by Kociumaka, Radoszewski, Rytter, and Wale\'n [SODA'15 &amp; SICOMP'24], who showed that they can be answered in $O(1)$ time using a data structure of size $O(n)$ and used this result to answer various queries about fragments of $T$.
  In this work, we study IPM queries on compressed and dynamic strings. Our result is an $O(\log n)$-time query algorithm applicable to any balanced recompression-based run-length straight-line program (RLSLP). In particular, one can use it on top of the RLSLP of Kociumaka, Navarro, and Prezza [IEEE TIT'23], whose size $O\big(\delta \log \frac{n\log \sigma}{\delta \log n}\big)$ is optimal (among all text representations) as a function of the text length $n$, the alphabet size $\sigma$, and the substring complexity $\delta$. Our procedure does not rely on any preprocessing of the underlying RLSLP, which makes it readily applicable on top of the dynamic strings data structure of Gawrychowski, Karczmarz, Kociumaka, {\L}\k{a}cki and Sankowski [SODA'18], which supports fully persistent updates in logarithmic time with high probability.</description>

      <title>Novel Complexity Results for Temporal Separators with Deadlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two variants, (s,z,l)-Temporal Separator and (s,z,l)-Temporal Cut, respectively, of the vertex separator and the edge cut problem in temporal graphs. The goal is to remove the minimum number of vertices (temporal edges, respectively) in order to delete all the temporal paths that have time travel at most l between a source vertex s and target vertex z. First, we solve an open problem in the literature showing that (s,z,l)-Temporal Separator is NP-complete even when the underlying graph has pathwidth bounded by four. We complement this result showing that (s,z,l)-Temporal Separator can be solved in polynomial time for graphs of pathwidth bounded by three. Then we consider the approximability of (s,z,l)-Temporal Separator and we show that it cannot be approximated within factor$2^{\Omega(\log^{1-\varepsilon}|V|)}$ for any constant $\varepsilon&gt; 0$, unless $NP \subseteq ZPP$ (V is the vertex set of the input temporal graph) and that the strict version is approximable within factor l - 1 (we show also that it is unliklely that this factor can be improved). Then we consider the (s,z,l)-Temporal Cut problem, we show that it is APX-hard and we present a $2 \log_2(2\ell)$ approximation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Improved FPT Approximation Algorithms for TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TSP is a classic and extensively studied problem with numerous real-world applications in artificial intelligence and operations research. It is well-known that TSP admits a constant approximation ratio on metric graphs but becomes NP-hard to approximate within any computable function $f(n)$ on general graphs. This disparity highlights a significant gap between the results on metric graphs and general graphs. Recent research has introduced some parameters to measure the ``distance'' of general graphs from being metric and explored FPT approximation algorithms parameterized by these parameters. Two commonly studied parameters are $p$, the number of vertices in triangles violating the triangle inequality, and $q$, the minimum number of vertices whose removal results in a metric graph. In this paper, we present improved FPT approximation algorithms with respect to these two parameters. For $p$, we propose an FPT algorithm with a 1.5-approximation ratio, improving upon the previous ratio of 2.5. For $q$, we significantly enhance the approximation ratio from 11 to 3, advancing the state of the art in both cases.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Model for Grit in Pursuing Ambitious Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambition and risk-taking have been heralded as important ways for marginalized communities to get out of cycles of poverty. As a result, educational messaging often encourages individuals to strengthen their personal resolve and develop characteristics such as discipline and grit to succeed in ambitious ends. However, recent work in philosophy and sociology highlights that this messaging often does more harm than good for students in these situations. We study similar questions using a different epistemic approach and in simple theoretical models -- we provide a quantitative model of decision-making between stable and risky choices in the improving multi-armed bandits framework. We use this model to first study how individuals' "strategies" are affected by their level of grittiness and how this affects their accrued rewards. Then, we study the impact of various interventions, such as increasing grit or providing a financial safety net. Our investigation of rational decision making involves two different formal models of rationality, the competitive ratio between the accrued reward and the optimal reward and Bayesian quantification of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Enabling Fast, Accurate, and Efficient Real-Time Genome Analysis via New Algorithms and Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized genome analysis by enabling the rapid and cost-effective sequencing of large genomes. Despite these advancements, the increasing complexity and volume of genomic data present significant challenges related to accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency. These challenges are mainly due to various forms of unwanted and unhandled variations in sequencing data, collectively referred to as noise. In this dissertation, we address these challenges by providing a deep understanding of different types of noise in genomic data and developing techniques to mitigate the impact of noise on genome analysis.
  First, we introduce BLEND, a noise-tolerant hashing mechanism that quickly identifies both exactly matching and highly similar sequences with arbitrary differences using a single lookup of their hash values. Second, to enable scalable and accurate analysis of noisy raw nanopore signals, we propose RawHash, a novel mechanism that effectively reduces noise in raw nanopore signals and enables accurate, real-time analysis by proposing the first hash-based similarity search technique for raw nanopore signals. Third, we extend the capabilities of RawHash with RawHash2, an improved mechanism that 1) provides a better understanding of noise in raw nanopore signals to reduce it more effectively and 2) improves the robustness of mapping decisions. Fourth, we explore the broader implications and new applications of raw nanopore signal analysis by introducing Rawsamble, the first mechanism for all-vs-all overlapping of raw signals using hash-based search. Rawsamble enables the construction of de novo assemblies directly from raw signals without basecalling, which opens up new directions and uses for raw nanopore signal analysis.</description>

      <title>A Graph Width Perspective on Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path with precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set. This problem is known as Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Path Problem (POHPP). Here, we study the complexity for graph width parameters for which the ordinary Hamiltonian Path problem is in $\mathsf{FPT}$. We show that POHPP is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete for graphs of pathwidth 4. We complement this result by giving polynomial-time algorithms for graphs of pathwidth 3 and treewidth 2. Furthermore, we show that POHPP is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for graphs of clique cover number 2 and $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard for some distance-to-$\mathcal{G}$ parameters, including distance to path and distance to clique. In addition, we present $\mathsf{XP}$ and $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithms for parameters such as distance to block and feedback edge set number.</description>

      <title>Approximating Maximum Edge 2-Coloring by Normalizing Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a simple, undirected graph G, an edge 2-coloring is a coloring of the edges such that no vertex is incident to edges with more than 2 distinct colors. The problem maximum edge 2-coloring (ME2C) is to find an edge 2-coloring in a graph G with the goal to maximize the number of colors. For a relevant graph class, ME2C models anti-Ramsey numbers and it was considered in network applications. For the problem a 2-approximation algorithm is known, and if the input graph has a perfect matching, the same algorithm has been shown to have a performance guarantee of 5/3. It is known that ME2C is APX-hard and that it is UG-hard to obtain an approximation ratio better than 1.5. We show that if the input graph has a perfect matching, there is a polynomial time 1.625-approximation and if the graph is claw-free or if the maximum degree of the input graph is at most three (i.e., the graph is subcubic), there is a polynomial time 1.5-approximation algorithm for ME2C</description>

      <title>Grams: Gradient Descent with Adaptive Momentum Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathbf{G}$radient Descent with $\mathbf{A}$daptive $\mathbf{M}$omentum $\mathbf{S}$caling ($\mathbf{Grams}$), a novel optimization algorithm that decouples the direction and magnitude of parameter updates in deep learning. Unlike traditional optimizers that directly integrate momentum into updates, Grams separates the update direction, derived from current gradients, from momentum, which is used solely for adaptive magnitude scaling. This approach enables Grams to achieve improved loss descent compared to state-of-the-art cautious and momentum-based optimizers. We theoretically demonstrate that Grams descents faster than other state-of-the-art optimizers and establish a global convergence guarantee for Grams. We also validate its effectiveness through extensive empirical evaluations. The results demonstrate Grams' superior performance, including faster convergence and better generalization, compared to widely-used optimizers such as Adam, Lion, and their cautious variants. Our results highlight Grams' potential as a transformative approach for efficiently training and fine-tuning large language models. Code is available at https://github.com/Gunale0926/Grams.</description>

      <title>Mixing Time Matters: Accelerating Effective Resistance Estimation via Bidirectional Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently approximating the \textit{effective resistance} (ER) on undirected graphs, where ER is a widely used node proximity measure with applications in graph spectral sparsification, multi-class graph clustering, network robustness analysis, graph machine learning, and more. Specifically, given any nodes $s$ and $t$ in an undirected graph $G$, we aim to efficiently estimate the ER value $R(s,t)$ between nodes $s$ and $t$, ensuring a small absolute error $\epsilon$. The previous best algorithm for this problem has a worst-case computational complexity of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{L_{\max}^3}{\epsilon^2 d^2}\right)$, where the value of $L_{\max}$ depends on the mixing time of random walks on $G$, $d = \min\{d(s), d(t)\}$, and $d(s)$, $d(t)$ denote the degrees of nodes $s$ and $t$, respectively. We improve this complexity to $\tilde{O}\left(\min\left\{\frac{L_{\max}^{7/3}}{\epsilon^{2/3}}, \frac{L_{\max}^3}{\epsilon^2d^2}, mL_{\max}\right\}\right)$, achieving a theoretical improvement of $\tilde{O}\left(\max\left\{\frac{L_{\max}^{2/3}}{\epsilon^{4/3} d^2}, 1, \frac{L_{\max}^2}{\epsilon^2 d^2 m}\right\}\right)$ over previous results. Here, $m$ denotes the number of edges. Given that $L_{\max}$ is often very large in real-world networks (e.g., $L_{\max} &gt; 10^4$), our improvement on $L_{\max}$ is significant, especially for real-world networks. We also conduct extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic graph datasets to empirically demonstrate the superiority of our method. The experimental results show that our method achieves a $10\times$ to $1000\times$ speedup in running time while maintaining the same absolute error compared to baseline methods.</description>
