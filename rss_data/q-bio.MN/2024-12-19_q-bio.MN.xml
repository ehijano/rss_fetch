      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra Systems and Complex Balanced Polyexponential Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the global stability of generalized Lotka-Volterra systems with generalized polynomial right-hand side, without restrictions on the number of variables or the polynomial degree, including negative and non-integer degree. We introduce polyexponential dynamical systems, which are equivalent to the generalized Lotka-Volterra systems, and we use an analogy to the theory of mass-action kinetics to define and analyze complex balanced polyexponential systems, and implicitly analyze complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. We prove that complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems have globally attracting states, up to standard conservation relations, which become linear for the associated polyexponential systems. In particular, complex balanced generalized Lotka-Volterra systems cannot give rise to periodic solutions, chaotic dynamics, or other complex dynamical behaviors. We describe a simple sufficient condition for complex balance in terms of an associated graph structure, and we use it to analyze specific examples.</description>

      <title>Automated Inference of Graph Transformation Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explosion of data available in life sciences is fueling an increasing demand for expressive models and computational methods. Graph transformation is a model for dynamic systems with a large variety of applications. We introduce a novel method of the graph transformation model construction, combining generative and dynamical viewpoints to give a fully automated data-driven model inference method.
  The method takes the input dynamical properties, given as a "snapshot" of the dynamics encoded by explicit transitions, and constructs a compatible model. The obtained model is guaranteed to be minimal, thus framing the approach as model compression (from a set of transitions into a set of rules). The compression is permissive to a lossy case, where the constructed model is allowed to exhibit behavior outside of the input transitions, thus suggesting a completion of the input dynamics.
  The task of graph transformation model inference is naturally highly challenging due to the combinatorics involved. We tackle the exponential explosion by proposing a heuristically minimal translation of the task into a well-established problem, set cover, for which highly optimized solutions exist. We further showcase how our results relate to Kolmogorov complexity expressed in terms of graph transformation.</description>
