      <title>Outflow Interaction in Cep-E: Numerical Simulation and Observational Manifestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is clear observational evidence that the main Class 0/I stages of the star formation process are associated with powerful collimated outflows (jets), which sometimes propagate up to distances as large as $10^{4-5}$ au scales in molecular clouds. Additionally, intermediate high-mass and low-mass protostars have often been observed to form in crowded clusters, where the typical separation distance between any two cluster members is of the same order or smaller than the scale of the outflow length. Therefore, there must be an interaction between the molecular outflows of different protostars within the protostellar association. A good example of this is the case of Cepheus E-mm, which is a protostellar outflow extending over a few dozen au. At its core is a binary system consisting of two protostars, Cep E-A and Cep E-B, separated by about 1000 au. Both protostars eject molecular jets at velocities of ~100 km/s. The interaction between these molecular outflows provides an opportunity to study the effects of jet collisions in a clustered star-forming environment, as they may leave detectable imprints on the morphology of the main envelope of the system. Our work aims to study the effects of the collision of molecular jets associated with the components of the binary system Cep-A and Cep-E, analyzing the disruption or reduction of molecular emission in the main envelope of the system, which the molecular outflow { launched} by Cep-A presumably pushes. If we characterize the collision in this system, we can provide insights into the expected morphology and molecular emissions in collisions of molecular outflows { associated to star forming process.</description>

      <title>TIC 322208686: An Eclipsing System with $\gamma$ Doradus Pulsations and a Third Component on a Wider Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TIC 322208686 is known to be a detached binary that exhibits two types of variability: pulsation and eclipse. We present the physical properties of the target star using the short-cadence TESS data from sectors 24, 57, and 58, and our echelle spectra that show the presence of a tertiary companion. The spectral analysis led to the triple-lined radial velocities and the atmospheric parameters of the eclipsing components. Joint modeling of these observations reveals that the eclipsing pair contains two F-type stars with masses $1.564\pm0.012$ $M_\odot$ and $1.483\pm0.012$ $M_\odot$, radii $1.588\pm0.011$ $R_\odot$ and $1.500\pm0.012$ $R_\odot$, effective temperatures $7028\pm100$ K and $7020\pm110$ K, and luminosities $5.51\pm0.32$ $L_\odot$ and $4.90\pm0.32$ $L_\odot$. The light contributions of the three stars obtained from this modeling match well with those calculated from the observed spectra. The binary star parameters are in satisfactory agreement with evolutionary model predictions for age $t$ = 0.4 Gyr and metallicity $Z$ = 0.03. We extracted 11 significant frequencies from the TESS light residuals with the binary effects removed. Of these, five signals between 0.65 day$^{-1}$ and 1.89 day$^{-1}$ can be considered as $\gamma$ Dor pulsations originating mainly from the primary component, while the other frequencies are likely instrumental artifacts or combination terms. These results suggest that TIC 322208686 is a hierarchical triple, containing a pulsating eclipsing pair and a tertiary companion.</description>

      <title>A New FU Orionis Accretion Outburst in the W5 HII Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We announce a recently detected outburst that is currently only a few months old, and probably of FU Orionis type. The progenitor to the outburst was an emission-line, flat-spectrum SED young stellar object located in the W5 region, though somewhat outside the main star formation action. We present optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared lightcurves that illustrate the quiescent state of [KAG2008] 13656 and its subsequent$\Delta r \approx -4$ mag and $\Delta J\approx -3$ mag outburst over $\sim$75 days in late-2025. Follow-up optical and near-infrared spectroscopy confirms the expected features from an FU Ori disk and outflow.</description>

      <title>Outbursts in ultra-compact AM CVn binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AM CVn binaries are the most compact of accreting binaries having orbital periods in the range ~5-70 min. They consist of a white dwarf accreting hydrogen deficient material from a degenerate or semi-degenerate star and are predicted to be amongst the verification sources for future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. Using the recent catalogue of Green et al (2025) I focus attention on the orbital period range in which outbursts are seen from AM CVn's. I examine in more detail the outburst properties of KL Dra which has an outburst every few months and has many sectors of TESS data as an open resource. Using observational data on the outbursting systems in general, I compare the outburst recurrence time, duration and amplitude as a function of orbital period with the predictions of the disc instability model. The recurrence time is well described, although there is some evidence that the amount of material in the disc at the end of the quiescence phase is less than earlier model assumptions. The distribution of the outburst duration appears to be dependent on the cadence of the observations and how it is defined. Similarly the amplitude distribution is dependent on cadence and the filter, which causes an apparent spread in distribution. Both of these features need to be systematically studied using consistent benchmarks. AM CVn binaries remain an excellent sources to test models which aim to predict the properties of disc accreting systems.</description>

      <title>B[e]-star CI Cam: a high-resolution spectrum atlas in the range of 395$\div$780 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atlas of the spectrum of the B[e] star CI Cam obtained with the 6-meter BTA telescope in combination with the NES spectrograph in the wavelength interval of 395$\div$780 nm with a resolution of $\lambda/\Delta\lambda\ge60\,000$ is presented. The atlas contains about 400 spectral features and illustrates the diversity of spectral features of the unique star, forming in a complex circumstellar environment. The spectrum is dominated by forceful single-peaked HI, HeI emissions and numerous double-peaked permitted and forbidden emissions of ions of chemical elements starting from the CNO triad up to metals (Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Fe) with practically ``rectangular'' profiles. The FeII and [FeII] emissions predominate in the spectrum. However, several other double-peaked forbidden ion emissions were also detected: [VII], [Cr II], [Ni II]. The atlas is presented graphically, with a separate figure corresponding to each echelle order. A list of identified lines, including a number of known interstellar features is presented in table form. CI Cam supergiant status has been confirmed.</description>

      <title>Resolution and calibration effects in high contrast polarimetric imaging of circumstellar scattering regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many circumstellar dust scattering regions have been detected and investigated with polarimetric imaging. However, the quantitative determination of the intrinsic polarization and of dust properties is difficult because of complex observational effects. This work investigates instrumental convolution and polarimetric calibration effect for high contrast imaging polarimetry with the aim to define procedures for accurate measurements of the circumstellar polarization. For this we simulate the instrumental convolution and polarimetric cancellation effects for a Gaussian PSF and an extended PSF_{AO} typical for a modern adaptive optics system. Further, polarimetric zero-point corrections (zp-corrections) are simulated for different cases like coronagraphic observations or systems with barely resolved circumstellar scattering regions. We find that the PSF convolution reduces the integrated azimuthal polarization Q_phi for the scattering region while the net Stokes signals Q and U are not changed. For non-axisymmetric systems a spurious U_phi-signal is introduced. These effects are strong for compact systems but scattering regions can still be detected down to small separations while unresolved scattering regions can be constrained by the central Stokes Q,U signal. The smearing by PSF_{AO} produces an extended, low surface brightness polarization signal changing the angular distribution of the polarization, but the initial signal can be recovered partly from the Stokes Q and U quadrant pattern. A polarimetric zp-correction applied for the removal of offsets from instrumental or interstellar polarization depends on the selected reference region and can also introduce strong bias effects for the azimuthal distribution of the polarization signal. Strategies for the zp-correction are described for coronagraphic data or observations of partly unresolved systems.</description>

      <title>Disc breaking and parametric instability in warped accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first local simulations of disc breaking/tearing in a warped accretion disc. Warps can arise due to a misalignment between the disc and the rotation axis of the central object, or a misalignment with the orbital plane of a binary (or planetary) companion. Warped discs can break into rings, as found in observations of circumbinary protoplanetary discs and global simulations of tilted discs around spinning black holes. In this work we isolate the mechanism of disc breaking in high-resolution, quasi-2D, local (shearing box), hydrodynamic simulations of a Keplerian disc. We consider the evolution of a free (unforced) warp in the wavelike ($\alpha &lt; H/r$) regime. At large warp amplitudes ($\psi_{\text{max}} \gtrsim 1$) the disc breaks into four rings on timescales of around 20 orbits which are separated by gaps of around $\sim 10H_0$. The warp exhibits a rich tapestry of small-scale dynamics, including horizontal sloshing motions, vertical oscillations or bouncing, warp steepening, and shocks. The shocks act as a source of enhanced dissipation which facilitates gap opening and thus disc breaking. At smaller warp amplitudes $\psi_{\text{max}} \lesssim 1$, for which we also develop a quasi-linear theory, the disc does not break, but instead exhibits hydrodynamic parametric instability. We also investigate the effect of viscosity: at small warp amplitudes the parametric instability is damped and the warp propagates as a pure bending wave, while at large warp amplitudes the emerging gaps are partially filled by viscous diffusion.</description>

      <title>Numerical Non-Adiabatic Tidal Calculations with GYRE-tides: The WASP-12 Test Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the tidal evolution of the WASP-12 system using direct numerical calculations with the GYRE-tides code. WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter on a 1.1-day orbit around a slightly evolved F-type star. Its observed orbital decay rate, $|\dot{P}_{\rm orb}/P_{\rm orb}| \approx 3.2\,\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$, provides a strong constraint on stellar tidal dissipation. We confirm that linear tides with radiative damping and convective damping, as currently implemented, are not sufficient to reproduce the observed inspiral timescale. Nevertheless, our calculations, based on fully non-adiabatic forced oscillations in MESA stellar models with convective envelopes, yield dissipation rates that are consistent with previous semi-analytic and adiabatic estimates, confirming the robustness of our numerical framework. As the only open-source, actively maintained tool capable of computing orbital evolution in exoplanet systems, GYRE-tides provides a benchmark calculation for WASP-12 and future applications. Our results validate GYRE-tides as a tool for analyzing combined radiative and convective damping, and indicate that the observed decay rate requires tidal dissipation operating in or near the fully damped regime, which may be achieved through nonlinear damping. These contributions could also be evaluated by computing the wave luminosity at the radiative-convective boundary using our tool. GYRE-tides offers an open-source framework for computing tidal dissipation in short-period exoplanet systems, including the many systems expected to show orbital decay in upcoming Roman surveys.</description>

      <title>BSN-V: The First Detailed Light Curve Modeling of Eight Totally Eclipsing Contact Binary Stars Using Ground-Based and TESS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study broadens our comprehensive investigation of total-eclipse W Ursae Majoris-type contact binaries by analyzing eight additional systems, continuing our previous research. Multiband $BVR_cI_c$ photometric data were obtained at an observatory in Mexico, from which new times of minima were determined. All target systems also had available space-based TESS time-series data. Orbital period variations were studied for eight target systems, showing either linear or parabolic trends. The target systems exhibiting parabolic trends demonstrated a sustained decrease in their orbital periods over time. We modeled the light curves utilizing the PHOEBE Python code in combination with the BSN application. We revisited the relationship between orbital period and the temperature of the hotter component in contact binary systems using an empirical approach. Our analysis identified a clear break at P=0.27 days, separating the systems into two distinct groups for orbital periods shorter than 0.6 days. Following the determination of stellar extinction, absolute parameters for seven systems were estimated employing parallax measurements from Gaia DR3. Based on the components' effective temperatures and masses, the systems were classified into A- and W-subtypes. Their evolutionary states were illustrated using mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagrams.</description>

      <title>STORMY : A Real-time Triggering Framework using Yamagawa Solar Spectrograph for Active Solar Emission Observations with the MWA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the most interesting insights into solar physics and space weather come from studying radio emissions associated with solar activity, which remain inherently unpredictable. Hence, a real-time triggering system is needed for solar observations with the versatile new-generation radio telescopes to efficiently capture these episodes of solar activity with the precious and limited solar observing time. We have developed such a system, Solar Triggered Observations of Radio bursts using MWA and Yamagawa (STROMY) for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the precursor for the low frequency telescope of upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO). It is based on near-real-time data from the Yamagawa solar spectrograph, located at a similar longitude to the MWA. We have devised, implemented, and tested algorithms to perform an effective denoising of the data to identify signatures of solar activity in the Yamagawa data in near real-time. End-to-end tests of triggered observations have been successfully carried out at the MWA. STORMY is operational at the MWA for the routine solar observations, a timely development in the view of the ongoing solar maximum. We present this new observing framework and discuss how it can enable efficient capturing of event-rich solar data with existing instruments, like the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) etc., and pave the way for triggered observing with the SKAO, especially the SKA-Low.</description>

      <title>The complex inner disk of the Herbig Ae star HD 100453 with VLTI/MATISSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner regions of planet-forming disks hold invaluable insights for our understanding of planet formation. The disk around the Herbig star HD 100453 presents one such environment, with an inner disk that is significantly misaligned with respect to the outer disk. This paper expands the existing H-band (PIONIER) and K-band (GRAVITY) interferometric studies of the HD 100453 inner disk to the L-band with the MATISSE VLTI instrument. With snapshot data spanning approximately four years we aim for a more comprehensive understanding of the inner disk structures and their potential time evolution. Based on the MATISSE data obtained, we use a combination of analytical models and image reconstruction to constrain the disk structure. Additionally, we fit a temperature gradient model to the selected wavelength range of PIONIER, GRAVITY and MATISSE to derive physical properties of the inner regions. Our parametric model finds an inclination of $\sim 47.5^\circ$ and a position angle of $\sim 83.6^\circ$, which corroborates the case of strong inner-outer disk misalignment. From the symmetric temperature gradient we derive an inner disk radius around $\sim0.27$ au, with dust surface densities of $\Sigma_{\rm{subl}} \approx 10^{-3.2}$ g/cm$^2$ and vertical optical depth $\tau_{\rm{z, subl}} \approx 0.1-0.06$. Same-night MATISSE and GRAVITY observations indicate the necessity for higher-order asymmetries to explain the interferometric signals, which is further supported by a MATISSE snapshot image reconstruction. The chromatic interferometric data reveal the likely need for higher-order asymmetries to explain the inner disk of HD~100453, suggesting a possible origin in dynamic interactions or disk instabilities. Coordinated multi-wavelength infrared interferometric observations with GRAVITY and MATISSE will be crucial to confirm these findings and uncover its underlying nature.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Identification of Solar Disk and Plages in Kodaikanal Solar Observatory Historical Suncharts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) is one of the oldest solar observatories, possessing an archive of multi-wavelength solar observations, including white light, Ca II K, and H-alpha images spanning over a century. In addition to these observations, KoSO has preserved hand-drawn suncharts (1904-2022), on which various solar features such as sunspots, plages, filaments, and prominences are marked on the Stonyhurst grid with distinct colour coding. In this study, we present the first comprehensive result that includes the entire data set from these suncharts using a supervised Machine Learning model called "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)", firstly to identify the solar disks from the charts (1909-2007), secondly to identify the plages, spanning 9 solar cycles (1916-2007). We train the CNN with the manually identified solar disk and plage. We first detect the solar limb and the North-South line in the suncharts, which enables the extraction of disk centre coordinates, radius, and P-angle. Following that, we use a CNN similar architecture to achieve accurate image segmentation for the identification of plages. We compare plage areas derived from the suncharts with those obtained from Ca II K full-disk observations, and find good agreement that demonstrates the potential application of such an ML technique for historical data. The results of this study further demonstrate the potential application of sunchart data to fill the existing data gaps in the KoSO multi-wavelength observations and contribute toward constructing a composite series over the last century.</description>

      <title>Multi-height probing of horizontal flows in the solar photosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tested whether simultaneous spectropolarimetric imaging in two magnetically sensitive optical spectral lines, which probe two different layers of the solar atmosphere (the photosphere and the temperature minimum), can help constrain the depth variation of horizontal flows. We first tested the feasibility of our method using Fourier local correlation tracking (FLCT) to track physical quantities at different optical depths ($\log\tau_{500}={-1,-2,-3,-4}$) in an atmosphere simulated with the MURaM code. We then inferred the horizontal distribution of the LOS magnetic field component from synthetic spectropolarimetric observations of Fe I 525.0 nm and Mg I b2 spectral lines, applied FLCT to the time sequence of these synthetic magnetograms, and compared our findings with the original height-dependent horizontal velocities. Tracking the LOS magnetic field component (which coincides with the vertical component at the disk center) yields horizontal velocities that, after appropriate temporal and spatial averaging, agree excellently with the horizontal component of the simulated velocities, both calculated at constant $\tau_{500}$ surfaces, up to the temperature minimum ($\log\tau_{500}=-3$). When tracking the temperature at constant $\tau_{500}$ surfaces, this agreement already breaks down completely at the mid photosphere ($\log\tau_{500}=-2$). Tracking the vertical component of the magnetic field inferred from synthetic observations of the Fe I 525.0 nm and the Mg I b2 spectral lines yields a satisfactory inference of the horizontal velocities in the mid-photosphere ($\log\tau_{500}\approx-1$) and the temperature minimum ($\log\tau_{500}\approx-3$), respectively. Our results indicate that high-spatial-resolution spectropolarimetric imaging in solar spectral lines can provide meaningful information about the horizontal plasma velocities over a range of heights.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Turbulent Electron Acceleration and Transport in Solar Flares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are explosive releases of magnetic energy stored in the solar corona, driven by magnetic reconnection. These events accelerate electrons, generating hard X-ray emissions and often display Quasi Periodic Pulsations (QPPs) across the energy spectra. However, the energy transfer process remains poorly constrained, with competing theories proposing different acceleration mechanisms. We investigate electron acceleration and transport in a flaring coronal loop by solving a time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation. Our model incorporates transient turbulent acceleration, simulating the effects of impulsive energy input to emulate the dynamics of time-dependent reconnection processes. We compute the density-weighted electron flux, a diagnostic directly comparable to observed X-ray emissions, across the energy and spatial domains from the corona to the chromosphere. We investigate different time-dependent functional forms of the turbulent acceleration, finding that the functional form of the acceleration source maintains its signature across energy bands (1 to 100 keV) with a response time that is energy dependent (with higher energy bands displaying a longer response time). In addition, we find that (a) for a square pulse the switch on and off response time is different; (b) for a sinusoidal input the periodicity is preserved; and (c) for a damped sinusoidal the decay rate increases with density and higher energy bands lose energy faster. This work presents a novel methodology for analyzing electron acceleration and transport in flares driven by time-dependent sources.</description>

      <title>Observations of sulfuretted species in HL Tau</title>

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks inherit their chemical composition from their natal molecular cloud, but the extent to which this material is preserved versus reset through chemical reprocessing remains an open question. Understanding this balance is a major topic in astrochemistry. Comparing the chemical composition of the envelope and the protoplanetary disk is key to solving the topic. The goal of this paper is to investigate the chemical differences between the disk and the surrounding envelope by comparing the column density ratios of a few selected species in each region. The source we focus on is HL Tau. We present new NOEMA observations of HL Tau targeting the following species: CS, H2CO, H2S, and SO2. We produced zeroth-, first-, and second-moment maps for the species where emission was detected and used them to analyze the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of the different molecules in the disk and the envelope. We derived the column densities and compared the values derived for the envelope and disk. We also computed the rotational diagram for the SO2 detected transitions. Assuming two different temperature regimes, 17 and 58 K, we derived column densities for the species surveyed in the disk and compared them with values derived for the envelope. We find large differences in the derived column density ratios of the surveyed molecules, especially for N(CS)/N(H2S), which is 40 to 50 times larger in the envelope. We attribute these variations to the different excitation and UV-irradiation regimes in the disk and envelope. We also note strong gradients in the ratios between different positions of the disk and tentatively attribute them to different levels of turbulence at different azimuths. The observed differences in molecular ratios in the envelope and the disk are suggestive of chemical reprocessing of the gas during the formation and evolution of the protoplanetary disk.</description>

      <title>Observing bright pulsating white dwarfs with PLATO: A new window into the late stages of stellar evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the scientific case for exploiting the capabilities of the PLATO mission to study bright pulsating white dwarfs across a wide spectral range, including hydrogen-deficient types (GW Vir and DBV stars) and hydrogen-rich classes (classical DAVs, pulsating extremely low-mass DA white dwarfs, and ultra-massive DA white dwarfs). PLATOs exceptional photometric precision, long-duration continuous monitoring, and extensive sky coverage promise transformative advances in white dwarf asteroseismology. Our key objectives include probing the internal structure and chemical stratification of white dwarfs, detecting secular changes in pulsation modes over extended timescales, and discovering rare or previously unknown classes of pulsators. To assess feasibility, we constructed a sample of 650 white dwarf candidates identified within PLATOs Southern LOPS2 field using the PLATO complementary science catalogue combined with Gaia DR3, and derived atmospheric parameters through photometric modeling. This sample comprises 118 DA white dwarfs (including 23 ZZ Ceti candidates), and 41 non-DAs (including 35 DBV candidates). Simulated observations using PlatoSim demonstrate that PLATO will be capable of detecting white dwarf pulsation modes with amplitudes as low as 0.1 mma depending on stellar magnitude, observation duration, pixel location, and the number of contributing cameras. We provide detailed detection limits and visibility forecasts for known pulsators across a representative range of these parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize strong synergies with Gaia astrometry, TESS photometry, and targeted spectroscopic campaigns, which together will enable robust mode identification and detailed stellar modeling. Collectively, these efforts will unlock unprecedented insights into white dwarf origins, evolution and internal physics, and the fate of their planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Centennial solar EUV irradiance from ionospheric currents: Varying sunspot-EUV irradiance relation and modified spot-facula ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspots depict large variability during the last 100 years, a period called the Modern Maximum (MM). However, other variables are needed to study the long-term evolution, e.g., of weaker fields and different radiative emissions. Recently, the relation between sunspots and the F10.7 and F30 radio fluxes and the MgII index (proxies of EUV irradiance) was found to vary during the last 70 years so that a relative sunspot dominance over EUV in the 1950s-1960s changed to EUV dominance in the 2000s (Mursula et al., 2024). Here we use data from eight long-operating observatories to calculate the yearly range of daily variation of the geomagnetic Y-component, the rY index, for the last 137 years. The rY index correlates very well with the MgII index and the solar F30 radio flux. These three indices have no trend relative to each other. On the other hand, the F10.7 flux has a significant trend with respect to the three co-varying EUV indices (MgII, F30, rY). Therefore, the rY index replaces F10.7 as the best long-term EUV proxy, and extends the MgII index by 90 years. We verify that all the four EUV proxies (rY, MgII, F30, F10.7) have an increasing trend with respect to sunspots during the last 50-70 years. This is valid both for sunspot numbers and group numbers. We find that the relation between rY index and sunspots has a quadratic evolution over the MM. The Sun has more sunspots relative to EUV irradiance during the growth and maximum of the MM, while the opposite is true during its decay. We estimate that the MgII index increases by 24\% of its solar cycle variation with respect to the sunspot number during the last 70 years. Our results indicate a systematic difference in the evolution between sunspots (photosphere) and plages (chromosphere) with long-term solar activity. The implied varying spot-facula ratio has consequences to the stellar evolution of the Sun and Sun-like stars.</description>

      <title>The TEQUILA catalog of variables in TESS full-frame images: Differential photometry light curves from the first two years of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar variability and transient events provide critical insights into astrophysics, accelerated by missions like CoRoT, Kepler, and K2. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) adds a unique combination of long baseline and all-sky coverage, though extracting light curves from full-frame images (FFIs) is challenging due to scattered light and blending. We processed TESS FFIs to produce TEQUILA (TESS quick-look and light curve analysis), a comprehensive catalog of variable point sources from the prime mission, enabling diverse studies without requiring raw data processing. We used difference image analysis, constructing reference images from quality-filtered FFIs for each CCD across sectors 1-26. Iterative subtraction mitigated systematics, and light curves were created using aperture photometry for sources varying in residual images. The pipeline yields over six million light curves, including stellar variables, transients, systematics, and moving objects. Approximately $6 \times 10^5$ span multiple sectors, with roughly $10^3$ from continuous viewing zones. We achieve median differential variability noise of $10^{-3}$ to $10^0$ for sources between 5.0 and 16.0 Tmag, while typical photometric RMS variability ranges from $10^{-2}$ to $10^1$. A convolutional neural network identifies light curves caused by instrumental noise, assigning a confidence score to each classification. To avoid confusion with astrophysical variables, we also flag light curves prompted by known Solar System objects (SSOs). All light curves are accessible via MAST as a High-Level Science Product. This catalog serves as a discovery tool for new variables; future work will refine methods and extend coverage to the TESS extended mission.</description>

      <title>Historical Reconstruction of Solar Surface Magnetism from Cycle 1-24 Using the Synthetic Active Region Generator (SARG) and the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The historical reconstruction of the Sun's surface magnetic field remains a persistent challenge, limiting our ability to investigate the long-term global properties of the Sun, including the evolution of the large-scale magnetic field, solar cycle prediction, reconstruction of total solar irradiance (TSI), and secular solar variability. In this study, we employ the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model in conjunction with our newly developed Synthetic Active Region Generator (SARG) to construct a catalog of synthetic active regions (ARs) spanning Solar Cycles 1-24 (1755-2020). We use the SIDC/SILSO sunspot number version 2.0 as the sole input governing the properties of the synthetic ARs in this catalog. This SARG catalog is then incorporated into the AFT model, which simulates the emergence of new ARs on the Sun, which are then transported under the influence of surface flows to produce maps of the full-Sun radial photospheric magnetic field over the entire 265-year period. We modulate the active region tilt for each cycle in order to ensure that the polar fields are consistent with the solar cycle amplitudes. We find that the polar fields derived from these simulations exhibit excellent correlation (r &gt; 0.8) with observational proxies, including polar faculae counts and Ca ii K polar network indices. Daily synchronic maps from these simulations for the entire 265-year period are made publicly available to support a wide range of applications beyond those presented in this work.</description>

      <title>PROJECT-J: the shocking H2 outflow from HH46</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the H2 emission observed in the HH46 Class I system as part of PROJECT-J (Protostellar Jets Cradle Tested with JWST), to investigate the origin and excitation of the warm molecular outflow. We used NIRSpec and MIRI spectral maps (1.6-27.9 microns) to trace the structure and physical conditions of the outflow. By fitting the H2 rotational diagrams with a multi-temperature gas model, we derived key physical parameters including temperature, extinction, column densities, and the ortho-to-para ratio. This information is combined with a detailed kinematical analysis and comparison with irradiated shock models.
  We find no evidence of H2 temperature or velocity stratification from the axis to the edge of the outflow, as would be expected in MHD disk-wind models and as observed in other outflows. Instead, the observations suggest that the H2 emission arises from shock interactions between jet bow shocks and/or wide-angle winds with the ambient medium and cavity walls. NIRSpec emission and velocity maps reveal expanding molecular shells, likely driven by the less luminous source in the binary system. We infer an accretion rate of less than 10^-9 solar masses per year for the secondary source, approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of the primary.
  The H2 emission is consistent with excitation by low-velocity (approximately 10 km/s) J-type shocks, irradiated by an external UV field that may originate from strong dissociative shocks driven by the atomic jet. Future JWST observations will further constrain the evolution of the expanding shell and the mechanisms driving the outflow.</description>

      <title>Evidence of 1:1 slope between rocky Super-Earths and their host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the composition of rocky exoplanets and their host stars is fundamental to understanding planetary formation and evolution. However, previous studies have been limited by inconsistent datasets, observational biases and methodological differences. This study investigates the compositional relationship between rocky exoplanets and their host stars, utilizing a self-consistent and homogeneous dataset of 21 exoplanets and their 20 host stars. By applying sophisticated interior structure modeling and comprehensive chemical analysis, we identify a potential 1:1 best-fit line between the iron-mass fraction of planets and their host stars equivalent with a slope of $m = 0.94^{+1.02}_{-1.07}$ and intercept of $c = -0.02^{+0.31}_{-0.29}$. This results are consistent at the 1$\sigma$ level with other homogeneous studies, but not with heterogeneous samples that suggest much steeper best-fit lines. Although, our results remain tentative due to sample size and data uncertainties, the updated dataset significantly reduces the number of super-Mercuries from four to one, but it remains that several high-density planets are beyond what a primordial origin would suggest. The planets in our sample have a wider range of compositions compared to stellar equivalent values, that could indicate formation pathways away from primordial or be the result of random scattering owing to current mass-radius uncertainties as we recover the observed outliers in mock population analysis $\sim15\%$ of the time. To truly determine whether the origin is primordial with a 1:1 true relation, we find that sample of at least 150 planets is needed and that stars that are iron enrich or depleted are high value targets.</description>

      <title>The Optical Evolution of the Tycho Supernova Remnant over Three Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a series of images of the Tycho supernova remnant at eight epochs extending over thirty years: 1986-2016. In addition to our H{\alpha} images, we have obtained matched continuum images which we subtract to reveal faint emission, including a far more extensive network of optical knots and filaments than reported previously. The deepest images also show an extremely faint, fairly diffuse arc of emission surrounding much of the circumference of Tycho to the southeast and south, coinciding with the rim of the radio/X-ray shell. We have measured proper motions for 46 filaments, including many fainter ones near the Tycho outer rim. Our measurements are generally consistent with previous ones by Kamper and vandenBergh (1978), but ours have far greater precision. Most optical filaments at the shell rim have expansion indices reasonably consistent with the Sedov value (0.40), while the interior filaments have somewhat smaller values, as expected. From the combination of proper motions of filaments at the shell rim and shock velocity at the same positions, one should be able to calculate the distance to Tycho by simple geometry. Determination of the shock velocity from broad Balmer-line profiles is subject to model uncertainties, but the availability of dozens of such filaments with a range of conditions offers the possibility to substantially improve the distance determination for Tycho.</description>

      <title>Resonant structures in exozodiacal clouds created by exo-Earths in the habitable zone of late-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth-like exoplanets can create resonant structures in exozodiacal dust through mean motion resonances (MMRs). These structures not only suggest the presence of such planets, but also act as potential noise sources in future mid-infrared (MIR) nulling interferometry observations. We aim to investigate how resonant structures in exozodiacal dust vary across stellar spectral types (F4--M4), and to evaluate how stellar wind drag affects their morphology and brightness in mature planetary systems. We conducted numerical simulations of dust dynamics, extending earlier studies by including spectral type variation in stellar wind drag in addition to Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag. Our models represented systems of a few Gyr hosting an Earth-like exoplanet in the habitable zone (HZ). We produced spatially resolved maps of optical depth and thermal emission for different stellar spectral types. Our simulations showed that resonant ring structures were formed for all stellar spectral types considered. In particular, we found that stellar wind drag played a critical role in shaping dust dynamics around old M-type stars, where it could dominate over PR drag by a factor of approximately 44. This reduced the contrast of resonant rings relative to the background disk, compared to cases without spectral type variation in stellar wind. Across different spectral types, the optical depth contrast of the resonant ring increased for lower-mass stars, assuming a fixed background level. Asymmetric thermal emission distributions were derived across all spectral types, which peaked for K-type stars. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating both resonant dynamics and stellar wind effects when modeling exozodiacal dust around stars of different spectral types.</description>

      <title>A Deep Multimodal Multi--Head Neural Network for Joint Estimation of Stellar Age, Lifetime, and Evolutionary Stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of stellar parameters -- stellar age, lifetime, and evolutionary stage -- remains a fundamental challenge in astrophysics. We introduce a hybrid deep learning architecture combining multimodal spectroscopic and photometric data from SDSS DR17. The model comprises a Multi-Layer Perceptron for numerical features and a CNN with a Vision Transformer for spectra, with three output heads for age, lifetime, and evolutionary stage prediction. Training labels are derived from MIST v1.2 isochrones, with evolutionary stage binned into five classes (Hot, Medium, Cool, Subgiant, Red Giant). We conduct multi-phase evaluation: Phase I explores model architectures and data balancing strategies, Phase II tunes architectural complexity, and Phase III optimizes the multi-task loss composition. The final model achieves a balance between precision (Age RMSE 0.093 in $\log(\mathrm{yrs})$) and physical realism. Monte Carlo Dropout confirms well-calibrated uncertainties, enabling meaningful astrophysical interpretation and establishing a new benchmark for multimodal stellar parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts from White Dwarf Binary Mergers: Isolated and Triple-Induced Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in both young and old stellar populations suggests multiple formation pathways, beyond just young magnetars from core-collapse supernovae. A promising delayed channel involves the formation of FRB-emitting neutron stars through merger- or accretion-induced collapse of a massive white dwarf (WD). By simulating a realistic stellar population with both binaries and triples, we identify pathways to WD collapse that could produce FRB candidates. We find that (i) triple dynamics open new merger channels inaccessible to isolated binaries, significantly enhancing the overall merger rate; (ii) triple-induced mergers broaden the delay-time distribution, producing long-delay ($\gtrsim1$-8~Gyr) events largely independent of metallicity, alongside a shorter-delay population ($\lesssim100$~Myr) of rapid mergers; (iii) these long delays naturally yield FRBs in older environments such as quiescent host galaxies and galactic halos; (iv) when convolved with the cosmic star-formation history, binary channels track the star-formation rate ($z_{\rm peak} \sim 2$), while triple channels peak later ($z_{\rm peak} \sim 1$), giving a combined local source rate of $R_0 \approx 2\times10^4~{\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, consistent with observations; and (v) applying the same framework to Type~Ia supernovae, we find that triples extend the delay-time tail and roughly double the Ia efficiency relative to binaries, yielding rates and redshift evolution in good agreement with observations. If FRBs originate from the collapse of WDs, our results establish triples, alongside binaries, as a crucial and previously overlooked formation pathway whose predicted rates, host demographics, and redshift evolution offer clear tests for upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>A Smooth Transition from Giant Planets to Brown Dwarfs from the Radial Occurrence Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the occurrence rates of celestial objects is a valuable way to study their origins and evolution. Giant planets and brown dwarfs produce large Doppler signatures that are easily detectable by modern instrumentation, and legacy radial velocity (RV) surveys have now achieved full orbital coverage for periods $\lesssim$30 years. However, the Doppler method's sensitivity to companion minimum mass $M_c \sin i$ -- as opposed to true mass $M_c$ -- prevents unambiguous characterization using RVs alone, as purported giant planets may be brown dwarfs or stars on inclined orbits. Here we combined legacy RVs with absolute astrometry to re-fit the orbits of 195 companions from the California Legacy Survey. Nearly 50% (8/18) of the ``brown dwarfs" ($M_c \sin i$=13--80 $M_{Jup}$) we refit had true masses above 80 $M_{Jup}$. We incorporated our orbital posteriors and target sensitivity maps into a Poisson likelihood model to calculate occurrence as a function of true companion mass $M_c$ (0.8--80 $M_{Jup}$) and separation $a$ (0.3--30 AU). The semi-major axis distributions of objects in this range vary smoothly with mass, with Jupiter analogs favoring an abrupt increase in occurrence near 1 AU and brown dwarfs exhibiting a gradual enhancement at wider separations. Marginalized companion occurrence between 1--10 AU decreases smoothly with mass, with brown dwarfs having the lowest occurrence rate: $0.9^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$%. Jupiter analogs are 10 times as common as brown dwarfs per mass interval in this range, demonstrating that the brown dwarf desert extends to 10 AU. The smooth variation in these distributions disfavors a sharp transition mass between ``bottom-up" core accretion and ``top-down" gravitational instability formation mechanisms, and rather suggests that these processes may produce companions in overlapping mass ranges.</description>

      <title>On the planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo: Evidence from a Lagrangian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether planetary motions influence the solar magnetic cycle has remained an open question due to the lack of a rigorous physical mechanism. Here we develop a Lagrangian framework based on the Virial theorem to show that planetary orbital angular momentum modulates the Sun's rotation through barycentric dynamics, consistent with angular momentum conservation. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to sunspot number (SSN) and terrestrial length-of-day (LOD) records spanning the past 250 years, we identify two non-linear trends plus 11 common pseudo-cycles whose periods match those of planetary resonances (LR$^{*}$). We then demonstrate that a reduced nonlinear $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo model, forced solely by the summed planetary right ascension RA(t), reproduces both the Schwabe cycle and its multi-decadal envelope, including the Dalton Minimum and the Modern Maximum. These results provide strong evidence, based on a physically-grounded model, that the solar dynamo is weakly forced by planetary motion, suggesting that the solar dynamo, classically viewed as autonomous, may in fact behave as a synchronized system.</description>

      <title>Spectrophotometric evidence for a metal-bearing, carbonaceous, and pristine interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is only the second confirmed cometary object known to enter the Solar System from interstellar space. Cosmogonic considerations suggest that this body may possess relatively high tensile strength and a substantial metal fraction. We present photometric observations along its inbound trajectory toward perihelion, together with a spectroscopic comparison to pristine carbonaceous chondrites from the NASA Antarctic collection. The spectral similarities indicate that 3I/ATLAS may be a primitive carbonaceous object, likely enriched in native metal and undergoing significant aqueous alteration during its approach to the Sun, experiencing cryovolcanism as we could expect for a pristine Trans-Neptunian Object. We propose that the combination of elevated metal abundance and abundant water ice can account for the unusual coma morphology and chemical products reported to date. To do so, corrosion of fine-grained metal grains can originate energetic Fischer-Tropsch reactions, generating specific chemical products into the coma that are not so common in other comets because most of them formed in the outer solar system and didn't inherited so much metal. Interstellar objects such as 3I/ATLAS provide rare opportunities to investigate physical and chemical processes in distant minor bodies of our own Solar System, including trans-Neptunian objects and Oort Cloud comets.</description>

      <title>A search for photometric variability towards the globular cluster M3 with the TWenty Inch Survey Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the commissioning results and first scientific observations from the newly installed TWIST observatory - a 50 cm telescope equipped with an sCMOS camera providing a $36.1\times24.1$ arcmin$^2$ field of view - housed in the former SuperWASP-North enclosure. We conducted a 67-night, 199-day baseline white-light monitoring campaign centred on the globular cluster M3 aimed at characterizing stellar variability within the cluster while also assessing the photometric performance of the newly commissioned system. We report the discovery of four new SX Phoenicis variables (V301-304), confirm their cluster membership, and identify fundamental-mode pulsation in one, allowing an independent period-luminosity-based distance estimate to M3. We revisited 231 previously known RR Lyrae stars, providing updated period measurements for 203 and white-light amplitudes for 198. We detected Blazhko-like modulation in 53 stars and characterized the modulation parameters for 28. Notably, we measure periods and amplitudes for the unclassified variables V286 and V287 for the first time. We also identify three foreground flaring M dwarfs, and assess the feasibility of detecting microlensing events in M3, concluding that expected rates are negligible. Alongside the scientific results, we introduce a new correction technique for flat-field images affected by scattered light and present a full characterization of the observatory's photometric capabilities. These results demonstrate the scientific utility of TWIST for high-cadence time-domain surveys using modest-aperture instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Predicting partially observable dynamical systems via diffusion models with a multiscale inference scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.</description>

      <title>Refractive neutrino masses in the solar DM halo: Can the dark-LMA solution be revived?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos can acquire "refractive masses" as a consequence of their interactions with ultralight dark matter (DM). We explore a model with two additional sterile neutrinos and an ultralight scalar field which acts as DM and interacts with all five neutrinos. We show that the effective $5 \times 5$ Hamiltonian for neutrino propagation can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix $\mathbb{P}$ parametrized by 6 mixing angles and 1 complex phase. When active-sterile mixing angles are small, we identify a parametrization for $\mathbb{P}$ that reduces neutrino propagation inside the Sun to a two-flavor problem for a uniform DM background. In the presence of a DM halo inside the Sun, however, the propagation shows additional features in the region of halo dominance. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the electron neutrino survival probability in the presence of the DM halo. We show that this probability has a strong dependence on the neutrino production region even for a fixed energy, and numerically calculate the effects of averaging over these production regions. Comparisons with the re-interpreted solar data, in the light of possible active-sterile neutrino conversions, would allow putting bounds on the halo parameters. Finally, we examine the possibility of reviving the dark-LMA solution in this context, where the survival probability spectrum can have attractive features aligned with the measurements at Super-Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Evolution of binaries containing a hot subdwarf and a white dwarf to double white dwarfs, and double detonation supernovae with hypervelocity runaway stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs have the potential to evolve into a variety of explosive transients. These systems could also explain hypervelocity runaway stars such as US 708. We use the detailed binary evolution code MESA to evolve hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars interacting in binaries. We explore their evolution towards double detonation supernovae, helium novae, or double white dwarfs. Our grid of 3120 models maps from initial conditions such as orbital period and masses of hot subdwarf and white dwarf to these outcomes. The minimum amount of helium required to ignite the helium shell that leads to a double detonation supernova in our grid is $\approx 0.05 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, likely too large to produce spectra similar to normal type Ia supernovae, but compatible with inferred helium shell masses from some observed peculiar type I supernovae. We also provide the helium shell masses for our double white dwarf systems, with a maximum He shell mass of $\approx 0.18\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. In our double detonation systems, the orbital velocity of the surviving donor star ranges from $\approx 450 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ to $\approx 1000 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Among the surviving donors, we also estimate the runaway velocities of proto-white dwarfs, which have higher runaway velocities than hot subdwarf stars of the same mass. Our grid will provide a first-order estimate of the potential outcomes for the observation of binaries containing hot subdwarfs and white dwarfs from future missions like Gaia, LSST, and LISA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary stars are fundamental to astrophysics, providing critical insights into stellar evolution, galactic dynamics, and fundamental physics. However, the high dimensionality of orbital parameters and observational constraints present significant challenges in statistically characterizing their properties. In this study, we propose and implement a novel algorithm, the Differential Velocity Cumulative Distribution (DVCD), to analyze binary star systems using radial velocity data. The DVCD method demonstrates superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches, reducing computation time by factors of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ under comparable conditions.
  We applied the DVCD algorithm to red giant samples from APOGEE DR16, dividing the dataset into 16 subsets based on $\log g$ and M/H. Our findings reveal that the binary fraction decreases with decreasing surface gravity and increasing metallicity, offering valuable constraints on the evolutionary processes of binary stars. This study underscores the potential of the DVCD method for large-scale statistical analyzes of binary systems.</description>

Abstract: We extended the $O-C$ diagram for V965 Cep with all currently available observations in the Johnson V filter and added unfiltered ones. The new, up-to-date $O-C$ diagram shows that the seeming period change previously revealed by the author does not occur uniformly. Instead, the near-parabolic part of the $O-C$ diagram can be a part of a periodic curve. This could be a sign of the second body in the system. Based on our observations, we also estimated the $B-V$ index of the star to be $0.48 \pm 0.05$ at maximum brightness and $0.57 \pm 0.05$ at minimum brightness.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XV. Updated calibrations of fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys combined with Gaia distances are enabling reliable estimates of fundamental parameters for hundreds of Galactic O-type stars and the full range of spectral types and luminosity classes. Here we provide updated, statistically robust empirical calibrations of the fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars, as well as of their absolute visual magnitudes (Mv) and bolometric corrections (BC), based on high-quality observational data. We perform a homogeneous analysis of a sample of 358 Galactic O-type stars, combining high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia distances. A subset of 234 stars meeting strict quality criteria involving parallax, extinction, and multi-band photometry was used to derive empirical calibrations of fundamental parameters. For those same stars, calibrated parameters were estimated from their measured Mv using the derived relations, allowing us to assess the internal consistency and predictive power of the calibrations. We present updated spectral-type-based calibrations of fundamental parameters for luminosity classes V, III, and I. Compared to previous works, we find systematic shifts, particularly in effective temperature for dwarfs and in Mv across all classes, which propagate into derived quantities. Applying the Mv calibrations to the full sample yields consistent estimates of radius and luminosity, while spectroscopic mass (Msp) shows significant scatter. We also evaluate the FW3414 parameter (from the Hbeta line) as a calibrator for Mv, useful in large surveys lacking reliable spectral classification. Excluding SB1 systems has a noticeable impact only on the Msp calibration for LC V. These updated empirical calibrations offer a robust reference for Galactic O-type stars and will support studies of massive star populations in both Galactic and extragalactic contexts, particularly in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Masses and Radiative Transfer Modeling of HD 698: a Be Binary in Evolutionary Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the early post-mass-transfer binary HD 698 (V742 Cas) combining high-resolution optical spectroscopy, long-baseline interferometry, and radiative-transfer modeling. Counter-phased radial-velocity curves yield a circular orbit with P=55.927+/-0.001 d and component masses M_Be=7.48+/-0.07 M_sun and M_comp=1.23+/-0.02 M_sun. The Be primary is traced by broad H alpha wings, while narrow metallic absorption lines arise from a slowly rotating companion. The interferometric separation implies a dynamical distance of 888+/-5 pc. The spectral energy distribution is reproduced with E(B-V)=0.321+/-0.016 and a viscous decretion disk of base density rho_0~5x10^-12 g cm^-3 at r=R_eq, declining radially as rho(r)~r^-n with n=3.0. The companion is luminous and inflated, with T_eff=10.0(+0.2,-0.1) kK, R_comp=13.1+/-0.2 R_sun, and log(L/L_sun)=3.19, contributing significantly to the flux (L_comp/L_Be~0.3). Spectral line mismatches further suggest a hydrogen-poor, CNO-processed atmosphere, consistent with a stripped-envelope star. HD 698 thus adds to the emerging class of Be+bloated OB binaries, capturing a brief post-mass-transfer phase when the donor remains spectroscopically detectable prior to the subdwarf stage.</description>

      <title>A new estimate of the zero-point shift of the Gaia DR3 parallaxes obtained from a comparison with VLBI measurements of masers and radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most complete sample of radio stars and masers with trigonometric parallaxes measured by the VLBI method, common with the Gaia EDR3 and Gaia DR3 catalogs, has been compiled using literature data. The sample contains 151 stars. An analysis of the differences in parallaxes and proper motions of Gaia-VLBI stars has been performed. A new estimate of the systematic shift of the Gaia parallax zero point relative to the inertial coordinate system has been obtained: $\Delta\pi=-0.038\pm0.011$ mas. The obtained estimates of the relative rotation rates confirm the absence of a significant rotation of the Gaia\,DR3 system relative to the extragalactic coordinate system, which in this case is represented by VLBI measurements.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>
