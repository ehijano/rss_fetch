      <title>Genealogies of records of stochastic processes with stationary increments as unimodular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a stationary sequence $X=(X_n)$ of integer-valued random variables with mean $m \in [-\infty, \infty]$. Let $S=(S_n)$ be the stochastic process with increments $X$ and such that $S_0=0$. For each time $i$, draw an edge from $(i,S_i)$ to $(j,S_j)$, where $j&gt;i$ is the smallest integer such that $S_j \geq S_i$, if such a $j$ exists. This defines the record graph of $X$.
  It is shown that if $X$ is ergodic, then its record graph exhibits the following phase transitions when $m$ ranges from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. For $m&lt;0$, the record graph has infinitely many connected components which are all finite trees. At $m=0$, it is either a one-ended tree or a two-ended tree. For $m&gt;0$, it is a two-ended tree.
  The distribution of the component of $0$ in the record graph is analyzed when $X$ is an i.i.d. sequence of random variables whose common distribution is supported on $\{-1,0,1,\ldots\}$, making $S$ a skip-free to the left random walk. For this random walk, if $m&lt;0$, then the component of $0$ is a unimodular typically re-rooted Galton-Watson Tree. If $m=0$, then the record graph rooted at $0$ is a one-ended unimodular random tree, specifically, it is a unimodular Eternal Galton-Watson Tree. If $m&gt;0$, then the record graph rooted at $0$ is a unimodularised bi-variate Eternal Kesten Tree.
  A unimodular random directed tree is said to be record representable if it is the component of $0$ in the record graph of some stationary sequence. It is shown that every infinite unimodular ordered directed tree with a unique succession line is record representable. In particular, every one-ended unimodular ordered directed tree has a unique succession line and is thus record representable.</description>

      <title>Two sided long-time optimization singular control problems for L\'evy processes and Dynkin's games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relationship between two sided discounted singular control problems and Dynkin games is established for real valued L\'evy processes. In addition, the solution of a two-sided ergodic singular control problem is obtained as the limit of the corresponding solution of the discounted one. With these results, we conclude that the optimal controls within the class of cadlag strategies can be in fact found in the class of reflecting barriers controls for both problems, and solved through some deterministic equations. To illustrate the results, three examples are given: compound Poisson processes with two-sided exponential jumps with and without Gaussian component, and stable processes.</description>

      <title>Hairer-Quastel universality for KPZ -- polynomial smoothing mechanisms, general nonlinearities and Poisson noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of weakly asymmetric continuous microscopic growth models with polynomial smoothing mechanisms, general nonlinearities and a Poisson type noise. We show that they converge to the KPZ equation after proper rescaling and re-centering, where the coupling constant depends nontrivially on all details of the smoothing and growth mechanisms in the microscopic model. This confirms some of the predictions in [HQ18].
  The proof builds on the general discretisation framework of regularity structures ([EH19]), and employs the idea of using the spectral gap inequality to control stochastic objects as developed and systematised in [LOTT21, HS24], together with a new observation on structures of the Malliavin derivatives in our situation.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for SDEs with irregular drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, concerning SDEs with H\"older continuous drifts, which are merely dissipative at infinity, and SDEs with piecewise continuous drifts, we investigate the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for underlying additive functionals and reveal the corresponding rates of convergence. To establish the limit theorems under consideration, the exponentially contractive property of solution processes under the (quasi-)Wasserstein distance plays an indispensable role. In order to achieve such contractive property, which is new and interesting in its own right for SDEs with H\"older continuous drifts or piecewise continuous drifts, the reflection coupling method is employed and meanwhile a sophisticated test function is built.</description>

      <title>Theory on new fractional operators using normalization and probability tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a theory on L-fractional differential equations was developed in the work [arXiv:2403.00341]. These are based on normalizing the Caputo operator, so that alternative properties hold, such as smoothness of the solution, finite derivative at the initial instant, and units time$^{-1}$ of the system. The present paper follows that line of research. On the one hand, we show how a rescaling of fractional operators with bounded kernels may help circumvent their documented deficiencies, for example, the inconsistency at zero or the lack of inverse integral operator. On the other hand, we build a novel class of linear operators with memory effects to extend the L-fractional and the ordinary derivatives, using probability tools. A Mittag-Leffler-type function is introduced to solve linear problems, and nonlinear equations are solved with power series (as an analogue of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem), illustrating the methods for the SIR model. The inverse operator is constructed, and a fundamental theorem of calculus and an existence-and-uniqueness result for differential equations are proved. A conjecture on deconvolution is raised, that would permit completing the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>A strong law of large numbers for real roots of random polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random polynomials $p_n(x)=\xi_0+\xi_1+\dots+\xi_n x^n$ whose coefficients are independent and identically distributed with zero mean, unit variance, and bounded $(2+\epsilon)^{th}$ moment (for some $\epsilon&gt;0$), also known as the Kac polynomials. Let $N_n$ be the number of real roots of $p_n$. In this paper, answering a question from Igor Pritsker, we prove that almost surely the following convergence holds: \begin{eqnarray*} \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{N_n}{\log n} &amp;=&amp; \frac 2 \pi. \end{eqnarray*} This convergence can be viewed as a strong law of large numbers for the real roots of random Kac polynomials.</description>

      <title>Rigid characterizations of probability measures through independence, with applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three equivalent characterizations of probability measures through independence criteria are given. These characterizations lead to a family of Brascamp--Lieb-type inequalities for relative entropy, determine equilibrium states and sharp rates of convergence for certain linear Boltzmann-type dynamics, and unify an assortment of $L^2$ inequalities in probability.</description>

      <title>Dynamic minimisation of the commute time for a one-dimensional diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated in part by a problem in simulated tempering (a form of Markov chain Monte Carlo) we seek to minimise, in a suitable sense, the time it takes a (regular) diffusion with instantaneous reflection at 0 and 1 to travel to $1$ and then return to the origin (the so-called commute time from 0 to 1). Substantially extending results in a previous paper, we consider a dynamic version of this problem where the control mechanism is related to the diffusion's drift via the corresponding scale function. We are only able to choose the drift at each point at the time of first visiting that point and the drift is constrained on a set of the form $[0,\ell)\cup(i,1]$. This leads to a type of stochastic control problem with infinite dimensional state.</description>

      <title>An invariance principle for the 2d weakly self-repelling Brownian polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large-scale behaviour of the Self-Repelling Brownian Polymer (SRBP) in the critical dimension $d=2$. The SRBP is a model of self-repelling motion, which is formally given by the solution a stochastic differential equation driven by a standard Brownian motion and with a drift given by the negative gradient of its own local time. As with its discrete counterpart, the "true" self-avoiding walk (TSAW) of [D.J. Amit, G. Parisi, &amp; L. Peliti, Asymptotic behaviour of the "true" self-avoiding walk, Phys. Rev. B, 1983], it is conjectured to be logarithmically superdiffusive, i.e. to be such that its mean-square displacement grows as $t(\log t)^\beta$ for $t$ large and some currently unknown $\beta\in(0,1)$. The main result of the paper is an invariance principle for the SRBP under the weak coupling scaling, which corresponds to scaling the SRBP diffusively and simultaneously tuning down the strength of the self-interaction in a scale-dependent way. The diffusivity for the limiting Brownian motion is explicit and its expression provides compelling evidence that the $\beta$ above should be $1/2$. Further, we derive the scaling limit of the so-called environment seen by the particle process, which formally solves a non-linear singular stochastic PDE of transport-type, and prove this is given by the solution of a stochastic linear transport equation with enhanced diffusivity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive explicit sharp two-sided estimates for the Dirichlet heat kernels for a class of subordinate diffusions with continuous components when the scaling order of purely discontinuous part of the subordinator is between $0$ and $1$ including $1$ in $C^{1, \alpha}(\alpha\in (0, 1])$ open sets. As a corollary, we obtain the sharp two-sided estimates for Green functions of these processes in bounded $C^{1, \alpha}$ open sets.</description>

      <title>On discrete-time arrival processes and related random motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider three kinds of discrete-time arrival processes: transient, intermediate and recurrent, characterized by a finite, possibly finite and infinite number of events, respectively. In this context, we study renewal processes which are stopped at the first event of a further independent renewal process whose inter-arrival time distribution can be defective. If this is the case, the resulting arrival process is of an intermediate nature. For non-defective absorbing times, the resulting arrival process is transient, i.e.\ stopped almost surely. For these processes we derive finite time and asymptotic properties. We apply these results to biased and unbiased random walks on the d-dimensional infinite lattice and as a special case on the two-dimensional triangular lattice. We study the spatial propagator of the walker and its large time asymptotics. In particular, we observe the emergence of a superdiffusive (ballistic) behavior in the case of biased walks. For geometrically distributed stopping times, the propagator converges to a stationary non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), which is universal in the sense that it is independent of the stopped process. In dimension one, for both light- and heavy-tailed step distributions, the NESS has an integral representation involving alpha-stable distributions.</description>

      <title>Exact Multi-Point Correlations in the Stochastic Heat Equation for Strictly Sublinear Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE) in $(1+1)$ dimensions with delta Dirac initial data and spacetime white noise. We prove exact large-time asymptotics for multi-point correlations of the SHE for strictly sublinear space coordinates. The sublinear condition is optimal, in the sense that different asymptotics are known to occur when the space coordinates grow linearly [Lin 2023, Theorem 1.1]. Lastly, a notable feature of our result is that it confirms the connection between multi-point correlations in the SHE and the ground state of the Hamiltonian of the delta-Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Property B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If an $n$-uniform hypergraph can be 2-colored, then it is said to have property B. Erd\H{o}s (1963) was the first to give lower and upper bounds for the minimal size $m(n)$ of an $n$-uniform hypergraph without property B. His asymptotic upper bound $O(n^22^n)$ still is the best we know, his lower bound $2^{n-1}$ has seen a number of improvements, with the current best $\Omega$ $(2^n\sqrt{n/\log(n)})$ established by Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan (2000). Cherkashin and Kozik (2014) provided a simplified proof of this result, using Pluh\'ar's (2009) idea of a random greedy coloring. In the present paper, we use a refined version of this argument to obtain improved lower bounds on $m(n)$ for small values of $n$. We also study $m(n,v)$, the size of the smallest $n$-hypergraph without property B having $v$ vertices.</description>

Abstract: For a class of evolution equations that possibly have only local solutions, we introduce a stochastic component that ensures that the solutions of the corresponding stochastically perturbed equations are global. The class of partial differential equations amenable for this type of treatment includes the 3D Navier-Stokes equation, the rotating shallow water equation (viscous and inviscid), 3D Euler equation (in vorticity form), 2D Burgers' equation and many other fluid dynamics models.</description>

      <title>On Geometrically Convex Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometrically convex functions constitute an interesting class of functions obtained by replacing the arithmetic mean with the geometric mean in the definition of convexity. As recently suggested, geometric convexity may be a sensible property for financial risk measures ([7,13,4]).
  We introduce a notion of GG-convex conjugate, parallel to the classical notion of convex conjugate introduced by Fenchel, and we discuss its properties. We show how GG-convex conjugation can be axiomatized in the spirit of the notion of general duality transforms introduced in [2,3].
  We then move to the study of GG-convex risk measures, which are defined as GG-convex functionals defined on suitable spaces of random variables. We derive a general dual representation that extends analogous expressions presented in [4] under the additional assumptions of monotonicity and positive homogeneity. As a prominent example, we study the family of Orlicz risk measures. Finally, we introduce multiplicative versions of the convex and of the increasing convex order and discuss related consistency properties of law-invariant GG-convex risk measures.</description>

      <title>Higher-order spring-coupled multilevel Monte Carlo method for invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A higher-order change-of-measure multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is developed for computing weak approximations of the invariant measures of SDE with drift coefficients that do not satisfy the contractivity condition. This is achieved by introducing a spring term in the pairwise coupling of the MLMC trajectories employing the order 1.5 strong It\^o--Taylor method. Through this, we can recover the contractivity property of the drift coefficient while still retaining the telescoping sum property needed for implementing the MLMC method.
  We show that the variance of the change-of-measure MLMC method grows linearly in time $T$ for all $T &gt; 0$, and for all sufficiently small timestep size $h &gt; 0$. For a given error tolerance $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we prove that the method achieves a mean-square-error accuracy of $O(\epsilon^2)$ with a computational cost of $O(\epsilon^{-2} \big\vert \log \epsilon \big\vert^{3/2} (\log \big\vert \log \epsilon \big\vert)^{1/2})$ for uniformly Lipschitz continuous payoff functions and $O \big( \epsilon^{-2} \big\vert \log \epsilon \big\vert^{5/3 + \xi} \big)$ for discontinuous payoffs, respectively, where $\xi &gt; 0$. We also observe an improvement in the constant associated with the computational cost of the higher-order change-of-measure MLMC method, marking an improvement over the Milstein change-of-measure method in the aforementioned seminal work by M. Giles and W. Fang. Several numerical tests were performed to verify the theoretical results and assess the robustness of the method.</description>

      <title>On Wilks' joint moment formulas for embedded principal minors of Wishart random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1934, the American statistician Samuel S. Wilks derived remarkable formulas for the joint moments of embedded principal minors of sample covariance matrices in multivariate normal populations, and he used them to compute the moments of sample statistics in various applications related to multivariate linear regression. These important but little-known moment results were extended in 1963 by the Australian statistician A. Graham Constantine using Bartlett's decomposition. In this note, a new proof of Wilks' results is derived using the concept of iterated Schur complements, thereby bypassing Bartlett's decomposition. Furthermore, Wilks' open problem of evaluating joint moments of disjoint principal minors of Wishart random matrices is related to the Gaussian product inequality conjecture.</description>

      <title>Tail Optimality and Performance Analysis of the Nudge-M Scheduling Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that the response time of First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling can be stochastically and asymptotically improved upon by the {\it Nudge} scheduling algorithm in case of light-tailed job size distributions. Such improvements are feasible even when the jobs are partitioned into two types and the scheduler only has information about the type of incoming jobs (but not their size).
  In this paper we introduce Nudge-$M$ scheduling, where basically any incoming type-1 job is allowed to pass any type-2 job that is still waiting in the queue given that it arrived as one of the last $M$ jobs. We prove that Nudge-$M$ has an asymptotically optimal response time within a large family of Nudge scheduling algorithms when job sizes are light-tailed. Simple explicit results for the asymptotic tail improvement ratio (ATIR) of Nudge-$M$ over FCFS are derived as well as explicit results for the optimal parameter $M$. An expression for the ATIR that only depends on the type-1 ad type-2 mean job sizes and the fraction of type-1 jobs is presented in the heavy traffic setting.
  The paper further presents a numerical method to compute the response time distribution and mean response time of Nudge-$M$ scheduling provided that the job size distribution of both job types follows a phase-type distribution (by making use of the framework of Markov modulated fluid queues with jumps).</description>

      <title>Estimation of parameters and local times in a discretely observed threshold diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a simple mean reverting diffusion process, with piecewise constant drift and diffusion coefficients, discontinuous at a fixed threshold. We discuss estimation of drift and diffusion parameters from discrete observations of the process, with a generalized moment estimator and a maximum likelihood estimator. We develop the asymptotic theory of the estimators when the time horizon of the observations goes to infinity, considering both cases of a fixed time lag (low frequency) and a vanishing time lag (high frequency) between consecutive observations. In the setting of low frequency observations and infinite time horizon we also study the convergence of three local time estimators, that are already known to converge to the local time in the setting of high frequency observations and fixed time horizon. We find that these estimators can behave differently, depending on the assumptions on the time lag between observations.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation of a leader by the increasing number of followers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the connected two-time correlator of the maximum $M_N(t)$ of $N$ independent Gaussian stochastic processes (GSP) characterised by a common correlation coefficient $\rho$ that depends on the two times $t_1$ and $t_2$. We show analytically that this correlator, for fixed times $t_1$ and $t_2$, decays for large $N$ as a power law $N^{-\gamma}$ (with logarithmic corrections) with a decorrelation exponent $\gamma = (1-\rho)/(1+ \rho)$ that depends only on $\rho$, but otherwise is universal for any GSP. We study several examples of physical processes including the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurst exponent $H$ and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. For the fBm, $\rho$ is only a function of $\tau = \sqrt{t_1/t_2}$ and we find an interesting ``freezing'' transition at a critical value $\tau= \tau_c=(3-\sqrt{5})/2$. For $\tau &lt; \tau_c$, there is an optimal $H^*(\tau) &gt; 0$ that maximises the exponent $\gamma$ and this maximal value freezes to $\gamma= 1/3$ for $\tau &gt;\tau_c$. For the OU process, we show that $\gamma = {\rm tanh}(\mu \,|t_1-t_2|/2)$ where $\mu$ is the stiffness of the harmonic trap. Numerical simulations confirm our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Supercritical percolation on finite transitive graphs I: Uniqueness of the giant component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.12778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(G_n)_{n \geq 1} = ((V_n,E_n))_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of finite, connected, vertex-transitive graphs with volume tending to infinity. We say that a sequence of parameters $(p_n)_{n \geq 1}$ in $[0,1]$ is supercritical with respect to Bernoulli bond percolation $\mathbb P_p^G$ if there exists $\varepsilon &gt;0$ and $N&lt;\infty$ such that \[
  \mathbb P_{(1-\varepsilon)p_n}^{G_n} \left( \text{the largest cluster contains at least $\varepsilon |V_n|$ vertices}\right) \geq \varepsilon \] for every $n\geq N$ with $p_n &lt;1$. We prove that if $(G_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is sparse, meaning that the degrees are sublinear in the number of vertices, then the supercritical giant cluster is unique with high probability in the sense that if $(p_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is supercritical then \[
  \lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb P_{p_n}^{G_n} \left( \text{the second largest cluster contains at least $c|V_n|$ vertices} \right) = 0 \] for every $c&gt;0$. This result is new even under the stronger hypothesis that $(G_n)_{n \geq 1}$ has uniformly bounded vertex degrees, in which case it verifies a conjecture of Benjamini (2001). Previous work of many authors had established the same theorem for complete graphs, tori, hypercubes, and bounded degree expander graphs, each using methods that are highly specific to the examples they treated. We also give a complete solution to the problem of supercritical uniqueness for dense vertex-transitive graphs, establishing a simple necessary and sufficient isoperimetric condition for uniqueness to hold.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomial duality and unitary symmetries of multi--species ASEP$(q,\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and higher--spin vertex models via $^*$--bialgebra structure of higher rank quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel, general method to produce orthogonal polynomial dualities from the $^*$--bialgebra structure of Drinfeld--Jimbo quantum groups. The $^*$--structure allows for the construction of certain \textit{unitary} symmetries, which imply the orthogonality of the duality functions. In the case of the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{n+1})$, the result is a nested multivariate $q$--Krawtchouk duality for the $n$--species ASEP$(q,\boldsymbol{\theta})$. The method also applies to other quantized simple Lie algebras and to stochastic vertex models.
  As a probabilistic application of the duality relation found, we provide the explicit formula of the $q-$shifted factorial moments (namely the $q$-analogue of the Pochhammer symbol) for the two--species $q$--TAZRP (totally asymmetric zero range process).</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomial duality of a two-species asymmetric exclusion process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine type D ASEP, a two--species interacting particle system which generalizes the usual asymmetric simple exclusion process. For certain cases of type D ASEP, the process does not give priority for one species over another, even though there is nontrivial interaction between the two species. For those specific cases, we prove that the type D ASEP is self--dual with respect to an independent product of $q$--Krawtchouk polynomials. The type D ASEP was originally constructed in arXiv:2011.13473, using the type D quantum groups $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{so}_6)$ and $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{so}_8)$. That paper claimed that certain states needed to be "discarded'' in order to ensure non--negativity. Here, we also provide a more efficient argument for the same claim.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the energy landscape near the ground state of a model of a single particle in a random potential with trivial topology. More precisely, we find the large dimensional limit of the Hessian spectrum at the global minimum of the Hamiltonian $X_N(x) +\frac\mu2 \|x\|^2, x\in\rz^N,$ when $\mu$ is above the phase transition threshold so that the system has only one critical point. Here $X_N$ is a locally isotropic Gaussian random field. The same idea is also applied to study the more general model of elastic manifold. In the replica symmetric regime, our results confirm the predictions of Fyodorov and Le Doussal made in 2018 and 2020 using the replica method.</description>

Abstract: We consider the i.i.d. Bernoulli field $\mu_p$ with occupation density $p \in (0,1)$ on a possibly non-regular countably infinite tree with bounded degrees. For large $p$, we show that the quasilocal Gibbs property, i.e. compatibility with a suitable quasilocal specification, is lost under the deterministic transformation which removes all isolated ones and replaces them by zeros, while a quasilocal specification does exist at small $p$. Our results provide an example for an independent field in a spatially non-homogeneous setup which loses the quasilocal Gibbs property under a local deterministic transformation.</description>

Abstract: We answer an open problem posed by Mossel--Oleszkiewicz--Sen regarding relations between $p$-log-Sobolev inequalities for $p\in(0,1]$. We show that for any interval $I\subset(0,1]$, there exist $q,p\in I$, $q&lt;p$, and a measure $\mu$ for which the $q$-log-Sobolev inequality holds, while the $p$-log-Sobolev inequality is violated. As a tool we develop certain necessary and closely related sufficient conditions characterizing those inequalities in the case of birth-death processes on $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Strong survival and extinction for branching random walks via a new order for generating functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general discrete-time branching random walks on a countable set $X$. According to these processes, a particle at $x\in X$ generates a random number of children and places them at (some of) the sites of $X$, not necessarily independently nor with the same law at different starting vertices $x$.We introduce a new type of stochastic ordering of branching random walks, generalizing the germ order introduced by Hutchcroft in arXiv:2011.06402, which relies on the generating function of the process. We prove that given two branching random walks with law $\mathbf{\mu}$ and $\mathbf{\nu}$ respectively, with $\mathbf{\mu} \ge \mathbf{\nu}$, then in every set where there is extinction according to $\mathbf{\mu}$, there is extinction also according to $\mathbf{\nu}$. Moreover, in every set where there is strong local survival according to $\mathbf{\nu}$, there is strong local survival also according to $\mathbf{\nu}$, provided that the supremum of the global extinction probabilities, for the $\mathbf{\nu}$-process, taken over all starting points $x$, is strictly smaller than 1. We also extend a result of Moyal which claims that, under some conditions, the global extinction probability for a branching random walk is the only fixed point of its generating function, whose supremum over all starting coordinates, may be equal to 1.</description>

We characterize when their joint distributions are also exponential families with the same parameter, improving data reduction. Further we show that the permutation-uniform subclass of these chains permit interpretation as an independent, identically distributed sequence on the same state space. We then apply these ideas to temporal exponential random graph models, for which permutation uniformity is well suited, and discuss mean-parameter convergence, dyadic independence, and exchangeability. Our framework facilitates our introducing a new network model; simplifies analysis of some network and autoregressive models from the literature, including by permitting closed-form expressions for maximum likelihood estimates for some models; and facilitates applying standard tools to longitudinal-network Markov chains from either asymptotics or single-observation exponential random graph models.</description>

      <title>The coalescent in finite populations with arbitrary, fixed structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coalescent is a stochastic process representing ancestral lineages in a population undergoing neutral genetic drift. Originally defined for a well-mixed population, the coalescent has been adapted in various ways to accommodate spatial, age, and class structure, along with other features of real-world populations. To unify and further generalize these variants, we introduce an abstract formulation of the coalescent that applies to a broad class of neutral drift models. Our formalism allows for arbitrary -- but fixed -- spatial, age, sex, and class structure, with haploid or diploid genetics and any fixed mating pattern. We represent the coalescent as a random sequence of mappings $\mathcal{C} = \left(C_t\right)_{t=0}^\infty$ from a finite set $G$ to itself, representing the ancestry of alleles at a single genetic locus. $G$ represents the ``sites'' (in individuals, in particular locations and/or classes) at which these alleles can live. The state $C_t:G \to G$ maps each site $g \in G$ to the site containing $g$'s ancestor, $t$ time-steps into the past. Using this representation, we define and analyze coalescence time, coalescence branch length, mutations prior to coalescence, and stationary probabilities of identity-by-descent and identity-by-state. For low mutation, we provide a recipe for computing identity-by-descent and identity-by-state probabilities via the coalescent. Applying our results to a diploid population with arbitrary sex ratio $r$, we find that measures of genetic dissimilarity, among any set of sites, are scaled by $4r(1-r)$ relative to the even sex ratio case.</description>

      <title>Scalable couplings for the random walk Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in coupling methods for Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms: they facilitate convergence quantification and unbiased estimation, while exploiting embarrassingly parallel computing capabilities. Motivated by these, we consider the design and analysis of couplings of the random walk Metropolis algorithm which scale well with the dimension of the target measure. Methodologically, we introduce a low-rank modification of the synchronous coupling that is provably optimally contractive in standard high-dimensional asymptotic regimes. We expose a shortcoming of the reflection coupling, the status quo at time of writing, and we propose a modification which mitigates the issue. Our analysis bridges the gap to the optimal scaling literature and builds a framework of asymptotic optimality which may be of independent interest. We illustrate the applicability of our proposed couplings, and the potential for extending our ideas, with various numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A computation of the covariance between two linear statistics for the Jellium model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend previous results providing an exact formula for the variance of a linear statistic for the Jellium model, a one-dimensional model of Statistical mechanics obtained from the $k \longrightarrow 0^{+}$ limit of the Dyson log-gas. For such a computation of the covariance, in comparison to previous work for computations of the log-gas covariance, we obtain a formula between two linear statistics, given arbitrary functions $f$ and $g$ over the real line, that is dependent upon an asymptotic approximation of the Jellium probability distribution function from large $N$ deviations, and from an effective saddle-point action.</description>

      <title>Minimum algebraic connectivity and maximum diameter: Aldous--Fill and Guiduli--Mohar conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aldous and Fill (2002) conjectured that the maximum relaxation time for the random walk on a connected regular graph with $n$ vertices is $(1+o(1)) \frac{3n^{2}}{2\pi ^{2}}$. A conjecture by Guiduli and Mohar (1996) predicts the structure of graphs whose algebraic connectivity $\mu $ is the smallest among all connected graphs whose minimum degree $\delta $ is a given $d$. We prove that this conjecture implies the Aldous--Fill conjecture for odd $d$. We pose another conjecture on the structure of $d$-regular graphs with minimum $\mu $, and show that this also implies the Aldous--Fill conjecture for even $d$. In the literature, it has been noted empirically that graphs with small $\mu $ tend to have a large diameter. In this regard, Guiduli (1996) asked if the cubic graphs with maximum diameter have algebraic connectivity smaller than all others. Motivated by these, we investigate the interplay between the graphs with maximum diameter and those with minimum algebraic connectivity. We show that the answer to Guiduli problem in its general form, that is for $d$-regular graphs for every $d\ge 3$ is negative. We aim to develop an asymptotic formulation of the problem. It is proven that $d$-regular graphs for $d\ge 5$ as well as graphs with $\delta =d$ for $d\ge 4$ with asymptotically maximum diameter, do not necessarily exhibit the asymptotically smallest $\mu$. We conjecture that $d$-regular graphs (or graphs with $\delta =d$) that have asymptotically smallest $\mu $, should have asymptotically maximum diameter. The above results rely heavily on our understanding of the structure as well as optimal estimation of the algebraic connectivity of nearly maximum-diameter graphs, from which the Aldous--Fill conjecture for this family of graphs also follows.</description>

      <title>The one-sided cycle shuffles in the symmetric group algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06274v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of shuffling operators on the symmetric group $S_n$, which includes the top-to-random shuffle. The general shuffling scheme consists of removing one card at a time from the deck (according to some probability distribution) and re-inserting it at a (uniformly) random position further below. Rewritten in terms of the group algebra $\mathbb{R}[S_n]$, our shuffle corresponds to right multiplication by a linear combination of the elements \[t_i:=\text{cyc}_{i}+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1}+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1,i+2}+\cdots+\text{cyc}_{i,i+1,\ldots,n}\in \mathbb{R}[S_n]\] for all $i\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ (where $\text{cyc}_{j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_p}$ stands for a $p$-cycle).
  We compute the eigenvalues of these shuffling operators and of all their linear combinations. In particular, we show that the eigenvalues of right multiplication by a linear combination $\lambda_1t_1+\lambda_2t_2+\cdots+\lambda_nt_n$ are the numbers $\lambda_1m_{I,1}+\lambda_2m_{I,2}+\cdots+\lambda_nm_{I,n}$, where $I$ ranges over the subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}$ that contain no two consecutive integers; here $m_{I,i}$ are certain integers. We compute the multiplicities of these eigenvalues and show that if they are all distinct, the shuffling operator is diagonalizable. To this purpose, we show that the operators of right multiplication by $t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n$ on $\mathbb{R}[S_n]$ are simultaneously triangularizable (via a combinatorially defined basis). The results stated here over $\mathbb{R}$ for convenience are actually stated and proved over an arbitrary commutative ring $\mathbf{k}$.
  We finish by describing a strong stationary time for the random-to-below shuffle, which is the shuffle in which the card that moves below is selected uniformly at random, and we give the waiting time for this event to happen.</description>

Abstract: We study the intersecting family process initially studied in \cite{BCFMR}. Here $k=k(n)$ and $E_1,E_2,\ldots,E_m$ is a random sequence of $k$-sets from $\binom{[n]}{k}$ where $E_{r+1}$ is uniformly chosen from those $k$-sets that are not already chosen and that meet $E_i,i=1,2,\ldots,r$. We prove some new results for the case where $k=cn^{1/3}$ and for the case where $k\gg n^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Slit-slide-sew bijections for constellations and quasiconstellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend so-called slit-slide-sew bijections to constellations and quasiconstellations. We present an involution on the set of hypermaps given with an orientation, one distinguished corner, and one distinguished edge leading away from the corner while oriented in the given orientation. This involution reverts the orientation, exchanges the distinguished corner with the distinguished edge in some sense, slightly modifying the degrees of the incident faces in passing, while keeping all the other faces intact.
  The construction consists in building a canonical path from the distinguished elements, slitting the map along it, and sewing back after sliding by one unit along the path. The involution specializes into a bijection interpreting combinatorial identities linking the numbers of constellations or quasiconstellations with a given face degree distribution, where the degree distributions differ by one $+1$ and one $-1$. In particular, this allows to recover the counting formula for constellations or quasiconstellations with a given face degree distribution.
  Our bijections furthermore provide an algorithm for sampling a hypermap uniformly distributed among constellations or quasiconstellations with prescribed face degrees.</description>

      <title>The doubly asymmetric simple exclusion process, the colored Boolean process, and the restricted random growth model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process (mASEP) is a Markov chain in which particles of different species hop along a one-dimensional lattice. This paper studies the doubly asymmetric simple exclusion process $\mathrm{DASEP}(n,p,q)$ in which $q$ particles with species $1, \dots, p$ hop along a circular lattice with $n$ sites, but also the particles are allowed to spontaneously change from one species to another. In this paper, we introduce two related Markov chains called the colored Boolean process and the restricted random growth model, and we show that the DASEP lumps to the colored Boolean process, and the colored Boolean process lumps to the restricted random growth model. This allows us to generalize a theorem of David Ash on the relations between sums of steady state probabilities. We also give explicit formulas for the stationary distribution of $\mathrm{DASEP}(n,2,2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the $L_p$ Minkowski problem in generalized Gaussian probability space, where this kind of probability space was first proposed in information theory by the remarkable works [47] by Lutwak-Yang-Zhang and [42] by Lutwak-Lv-Yang-Zhang. The main focus of this article is on the existence of this problem. While the variational method is used to consider the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of normalized Minkowski problem when $p\in \mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$, we mainly focus on the existence of generalized Gaussian Minkowski problem without normalization required in smooth category for $p\geq1$. In addition, there are the Brunn-Minkowski inequalities about the generalized Gaussian volume.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution in Random Polynomials and Systems of Random Holomorphic Sections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14631v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses an equidistribution problem concerning the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections of positive line bundles on compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and random polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ in the setting of a compact subset. For random polynomials, we consider non-orthonormal bases and prove an equidistribution result which are more general than the previously acquired ones for non-discrete probability measures. More precisely, our result demonstrates that the equidistribution holds true even when the random coefficients in the basis representation are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and moreover, they are not constrained to any particular probability distribution function. For random holomorphic sections, by extending the concept of a sequence of asymptotically Bernstein-Markov measures introduced by Levenberg, Bloom and Bayraktar in their recent paper to the setting of holomorphic line bundles over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds, we derive a global equidistribution theorem related to the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections for large tensor powers of a fixed line bundle for any codimension $k$. In both settings using the variance estimation technique in another study of the author with Bojnik plays an important role.</description>

      <title>MIM-Reasoner: Learning with Theoretical Guarantees for Multiplex Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplex influence maximization (MIM) asks us to identify a set of seed users such as to maximize the expected number of influenced users in a multiplex network. MIM has been one of central research topics, especially in nowadays social networking landscape where users participate in multiple online social networks (OSNs) and their influences can propagate among several OSNs simultaneously. Although there exist a couple combinatorial algorithms to MIM, learning-based solutions have been desired due to its generalization ability to heterogeneous networks and their diversified propagation characteristics. In this paper, we introduce MIM-Reasoner, coupling reinforcement learning with probabilistic graphical model, which effectively captures the complex propagation process within and between layers of a given multiplex network, thereby tackling the most challenging problem in MIM. We establish a theoretical guarantee for MIM-Reasoner as well as conduct extensive analyses on both synthetic and real-world datasets to validate our MIM-Reasoner's performance.</description>

Abstract: We establish large deviation estimates related to the Darling--Kac theorem and generalized arcsine laws for occupation and waiting times of ergodic transformations preserving an infinite measure, such as non-uniformly expanding interval maps with indifferent fixed points. For the proof, we imitate the study of generalized arcsine laws for occupation times of one-dimensional diffusion processes and adopt a method of double Laplace transform.</description>
