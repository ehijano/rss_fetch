      <title>Chern-Simons theory, decomposition, and the A model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss how gauging one-form symmetries in Chern-Simons theories is implemented in an A-twisted topological open string theory. For example, the contribution from a fixed H/Z bundle on a three-manifold M, arising in a BZ gauging of H Chern-Simons, for Z a finite subgroup of the center of H, is described by an open string worldsheet theory whose bulk is a sigma model with target a Z-gerbe (a bundle of one-form symmetries) over T^* M, of characteristic class determined by the H/Z bundle. We give a worldsheet picture of the decomposition of one-form-symmetry-gauged Chern-Simons in three dimensinos, and we describe how a target-space constraint on bundles arising in the gauged Chern-Simons theory has a natural worldsheet realization. Our proposal provides examples of the expected correspondence between worldsheet global higher-form symmetries, and target-space gauged higher-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Long Range Asymptotic Baxter-Bethe Ansatz for N=4 BFKL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov regime of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory can be explicitly solved up to the L+1 order in weak coupling by uncovering a novel long-range asymptotic Baxter-Bethe ansatz for trajectories with L scalar fields. The set of equations we have found is reminiscent of the Beisert-Eden-Staudacher equations for local operators but instead applies to non-local operators corresponding to the horizontal Regge trajectories. We also verify and give new predictions for the light-ray operator spectrum by resummation of the leading singularities in our result.</description>

      <title>Equivariant localization and gluing rules in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher derivative supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete the proof of the conjecture in arXiv:2111.06903 regarding the form of gravitational building blocks in higher derivative supergravity and examine the related gluing rules. The derivation, based on certain assumptions, combines the BVAB equivariant localization formula (on non-compact spaces) and the direct evaluation of the action on the Omega background in AdS$_4$, arXiv:2212.10590. Utilizing the superconformal gravity formalism and avoiding equations of motion ensures our results are valid at any perturbative order in the Newton constant. As an application, we illustrate the holographic predictions for supersymmetric M2-brane partition functions. We conclude with a to-do list of related calculations in effective supergravity and string theory, aiming for full quantum control of BPS backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Line and surface defects in 5D N=2 SCFT from matter-coupled F(4) gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric solutions of matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity in the forms of $AdS_2\times S^3$- and $AdS_3\times S^2$-sliced domain walls with a non-vanishing two-form field from the supergravity multiplet. These two types of solutions holographically describe conformal line and surface defects within five-dimensional $N=2$ SCFTs, respectively. In the case of $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group obtained by coupling $F(4)$ supergravity to three vector multiplets, we find charged domain wall solutions describing holographic RG flows between two supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua with a running two-form field supporting the line and surface defects. For a particular case of one vector multiplet with $SO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group, we find solutions describing RG flows from an $AdS_6$ vacuum to physically acceptable singular geometries in the presence of defects. This class of solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory using a consistent truncation obtained from $SO(5,5)$ exceptional field theory with half-maximal structures.</description>

      <title>Effective potential in leading logarithmic approximation in non-renormalisable $SO(N)$ scalar field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the effective potential for non-renormalisable scalar SO(N) symmetric theories leads to recurrence relations for the coefficients of the leading logarithms. These relations can be transformed into generalised renormalization-group (RG) equation which can be analyzed in detail. In some special cases this equation can be solved exactly.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills theory from the worldline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct off-shell vertex operators for the bosonic spinning particle. Using the language of homotopy algebras, we show that the full nonlinear structure of Yang-Mills theory, including its gauge transformations, is encoded in the commutator algebra of the worldline vertex operators. To do so, we deform the worldline BRST operator by coupling it to a background gauge field and show that the coupling is consistent on a suitable truncation of the Hilbert space. On this subspace, the square of the BRST operator is proportional to the Yang-Mills field equations, which we interpret as an operator Maurer-Cartan equation for the background. This allows us to define further vertex operators in different ghost numbers, which correspond to the entire $L_\infty$ algebra of Yang-Mills theory. Besides providing a precise map of a fully nonlinear field theory into a worldline model, we expect these results will be valuable to investigate the kinematic algebra of Yang-Mills, which is central to the double copy program.</description>

      <title>Graviton reggeization and high energy gravitational scattering of scalar particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a high energy scattering of free scalar particles through a gravitational field. The amplitude of the scattering in this limit is governed by reggeized gravitons. Therefore, we discuss an appearance of the reggeized gravitons in the framework of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and consider Lipatov's effective action for the reggeized gravitons. We calculate the trajectory of the corresponding $t$-channel amplitude in the framework and thereafter define the leading order amplitude of scattering of two massive scalar particles. A difference of the amplitude obtained at high energy limit from the amplitude in Newton's (low energy) limit is discussed. It is demonstrated, that the graviton's propagator reggeization leads to the amplification of the high energy amplitude. Effectively, this enhancement of the amplitude appears as a redefinition of the masses of particles involved in the scattering. An impact factor of the interaction of scalar particle with the reggeized gravitons is also calculated and possible applications of the approach are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Quantization of Modified Maxwell Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified Maxwell electrodynamics, or ModMax for short, is the unique nonlinear extension of Maxwell's theory that preserves its notable symmetries: conformal invariance and electromagnetic duality. ModMax has been studied extensively at the classical level, however remains largely untouched in a quantum context due to its non-analytic nature.
  In this thesis, we perform the perturbative quantization of this theory. Using the background field method and dimensional regularization, we obtain novel corrections by calculating the one loop quantum effective action. These corrections vanish in a background with constant field strength, and are not of the form of the classical theory for a general background field. Motivated by the corrections obtained for ModMax, we applied the method developed to quantize ModMax to its two dimensional analogue theory. We similarly obtain the one loop quantum effective action for this theory in a general background by evaluating all one loop Feynman diagrams. In addition, we study the divergence of the separate infinite series of two vertex diagrams.</description>

      <title>De Sitter space, complexity, and the double-scaled SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological horizon has an associated entropy suggesting that it might encode a quantum mechanical system on its surface. This has motivated extending the principles of the anti-de Sitter (AdS) space/ conformal field theory (CFT) correspondence to static patch holography. Some of our understanding of the AdS/CFT holography has been catalyzed by exploring the geometric duals to quantum information observables in the CFT side of the correspondence. In particular, holographic complexity captures the evolution of the black hole interior, which is conjectured to be dual to a measure of the difficulty in preparing a quantum circuit on the CFT side. Motivated by these developments, we will propose complexity observables defined in geometric terms for an asymptotically dS spacetime and its putative quantum mechanical dual system. To sharply define complexity observables in the static patch of dS space, they will be anchored to a time-like Dirichlet surface where the dual theory is located, called the stretched horizon. While static patch holography needs much more development in order to reach a level of understanding of the likes of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we hope that the work reported in this thesis allows for crucial steps in this direction.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Harvesting and Quantum Discord of Alpha Vacua in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CPT invariant vacuum states of a scalar field in de Sitter space, called $\alpha$-vacua, are not unique. We explore the $\alpha$-vacua from the quantum information perspective by a pair of Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors coupled to a scalar field with either monopole or dipole coupling, which are in time-like zero separation or space-like antipodal separation. The analytical form of the reduced final state of the UDW detector is derived. We study the entanglement harvesting and quantum discord of the reduced state, which characterize the quantum entanglement and quantum correlation of the underlying $\alpha$-vacua, respectively. Our results imply that the quantum entanglement gravitated by de Sitter gravity behaves quite differently for time-like and space-like separations. It experiences "sudden death" for the former and grows for the latter as the measuring time or the value of $\alpha$ increases. This demonstrates the nonlocal nature of quantum entanglement. For the quantum discord, we find no "sudden death" behavior, and it experiences superhorizon suppression, which explains the superhorizon decoherence in the inflationary universe scenario. Overall, the time-like or space-like quantum entanglement and correlation behave differently on their dependence of $\alpha$, measuring time and spectral gaps, with details discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>Conformal Yang-Mills field in (A)dS space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinary-derivative (second-derivative) Lagrangian formulation of classical conformal Yang-Mills field in the (A)dS space of six, eight, and ten dimensions is developed. For such conformal field, we develop two gauge invariant Lagrangian formulations which we refer to as generic formulation and decoupled formulation. In both formulations, the usual Yang-Mills field is accompanied by additional vector and scalar fields, where the scalar fields are realized as Stueckelberg fields. In the generic formulation, the usual Yang-Mills field is realized as a primary field, while the additional vector fields are realized as auxiliary fields. In the decoupled formulation, the usual Yang-Mills field is realized as massless field, while the additional vector fields together with the Stueckelberg are realized as massive fields. Some massless/massive fields appear with the wrong sign of kinetic terms, hence demonstrating explicitly that the considered model is not unitary. The use of embedding space method allows us to treat the isometry symmetries of (A)dS space manifestly and obtain conformal transformations of fields in a relatively straightforward way. Accompanying each vector field by the respective gauge parameter, we introduce an extended gauge algebra. Levy-Maltsev decomposition of such algebra is noted. Use of the extended gauge algebra setup allows us to present concise form for the Lagrangian and gauge transformations of the conformal Yang-Mills field.</description>

      <title>Vanishing conditions for higher order couplings in heterotic theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For compactifications of heterotic string theory, we elucidate simple cohomological conditions that lead to the vanishing of superpotential n-point couplings for all n. These results generalize some vanishing theorems for Yukawa couplings that have previously appeared in the literature to all higher orders. In some cases, these results are enough to show that certain fields do not appear in the perturbative superpotential at all. We illustrate our discussion with a number of concrete examples. In some cases, our results can be confirmed by showing that symmetries indeed forbid the couplings that vanish. In many, however, no such symmetries are known to exist and, as such, the infinite sets of vanishing couplings that are found are surprising from a four-dimensional perspective.</description>

      <title>On the stability of fracton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of fracton gravity, a variant of linearized gravity where the gauge symmetry is restricted to longitudinal diffeomorphisms. These transformations can be connected to a spacetime generalization of dipole symmetry, hence the tag fracton. We find that fracton gravity features an instability in the spin-1 sector corresponding to solutions with growing amplitude. This dynamical instability can be removed by tuning the couplings of the theory. Nonetheless, the Hamiltonian for the spin-1 modes remains always unbounded from below when evaluated on the classical solutions. We find no other sources of instability in the spin-2 or spin-0 sectors. We analyze in detail the canonical formulation and the constraints arguing that neither auxiliary fields nor gauge-fixing conditions can be employed to remove the problematic vector modes or stabilize them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider coupled gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations of a family of five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell solutions that describes both magnetized black strings and horizonless topological stars. We find that the odd perturbations of this background lead to a master equation with five Fuchsian singularities and compute its quasinormal mode spectrum using three independent methods: Leaver, WKB and numerical integration. Our analysis confirms that odd perturbations always decay in time, while spherically symmetric even perturbations may exhibit for certain ranges of the magnetic fluxes instabilities of Gregory-Laflamme type for black strings and of Gross-Perry-Yaffe type for topological stars. This constitutes evidence that topological stars and black strings are classically stable in a finite domain of their parameter space.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Amplitudes from Holographic Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrollian amplitudes are flat space amplitudes written in position space at null infinity which can be re-interpreted as correlators in a putative dual Carrollian CFT. We argue that these amplitudes are the natural objects obtained in the flat space limit of AdS Lorentzian boundary correlators. The flat limit is taken entirely in position space by introducing Bondi coordinates in the bulk. From the bulk perspective, this procedure makes it manifest that the flat limit of any Witten diagram is the corresponding flat space Feynman diagram. It also makes explicit the fact that the flat limit in the bulk is implemented by a Carrollian limit at the boundary. We systematically analyse tree-level two, three and four-point correlators. Familiar features such as the distributional nature of Carrollian amplitudes and the presence of a bulk point singularity arise naturally as a consequence of requiring a finite and non-trivial Carrollian limit.</description>

      <title>Maximal hypersurface in a D-dimensional dynamical spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15537v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we set up a variational problem to arrive at the equation of the maximal hypersurface in the interior of a spherically symmetric evolving trapped region. In the first part of the article, we present the Lagrangian and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations that maximize the interior volume of a trapped region that is formed dynamically due to infalling matter in D-dimensions, with and without the cosmological constant. In the second part, we explore the properties of special radii, which we call Reinhart radii, that play a crucial role in approximating the maximal interior volume of a black hole. We derive a formula to locate these Reinhart radii in terms of coordinate invariants like area radius, principle values of the energy-momentum tensor, Misner-Sharp mass, and cosmological constant. Based on this formula, we estimate the location of Reinhart radii in various scenarios: (a) the case of static BTZ black holes in (2 + 1)-dimensions and for the Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-de Sitter, and Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black holes in D-dimensions. We plot the location of the Reinhart radii in relation to the event horizon and cosmological horizon in a static D-dimensional scenario, (b) cosmological case: we prove that these Reinhart radii do not exist for homogeneous evolving dust for the zero and negative cosmological constant but exist in the presence of positive cosmological constant when the scale factor is greater than a critical value. We also show the relation between these Reinhart radii and Kodama vectors.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses and mixing from milli-charged dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple extension to the Standard Model, wherein neutrinos naturally attain small Majorana masses through a one-loop radiative mechanism featuring particles within the loops characterized by milli-charges. Unlike the conventional scotogenic model, our approach avoids imposing a discrete symmetry or expanding the gauge sector. The minuscule electric charges ensure the stability of the lightest particle within the loop as a viable dark matter candidate. Our investigation systematically scrutinizes the far-reaching phenomenological implications arising from these minuscule charges.</description>

Abstract: Under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure, it is believed that quarks and gluons (particles that mediate the interaction between quarks) can be "free" in a given volume. This hypothetical phase of matter is called plasma of quarks and gluons, QGP for its acronym in English. It is speculated that it existed in the first moments after the \textit{Big Bang} and that it exists inside N\^eutron stars due to the enormous energy density in these places. These conditions of very high temperature and energy density can be reproduced in the laboratory with the collision of heavy ions in an ultra-relativistic regime in accelerators such as the RHIC and the LHC. However, due to the extremely short duration of the QGP phase after the collision, we were unable to directly observe the plasma, only the so-called \textit{final observables}, such as the particles generated by this set of quarks, gluons and energy and the distribution of momentum of these particles. Therefore, mathematical modeling is an essential tool in understanding the behavior of the system, for example, to have an idea of the value of viscosities in this phase.</description>

      <title>Insights into Gravitinos Abundance, Cosmic Strings and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kahler potential. Our study reveals that this model can overcome the {\eta}-problem found in F-term models. Additionally, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Perturbation theory reveals that Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) evolve according to second-order effects arising from first-order curvature perturbations. In fact, the spectral energy density of these waves is particularly relevant to Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties. The dimensionless string tension significantly influences the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings post-inflation. Finally, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings is influenced by the energy scales of inflation and string formation.</description>

      <title>Manipulation and creation of domain-wall skyrmions in chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the capture of a magnetic skyrmion into a domain wall (DW) structure in thin films of chirally magnetic type of materials like $[{\rm Pt}({\rm Co/Ni})_M/{\rm Ir}_N]$ and find that in the respective ground states of the DW and the skyrmion, they repel each other. However, rotating the DW's phase away from the stable phase using local external magnets may cause the successful capture and hence creation of a stable bound state of a magnetic skyrmion and a DW. We also find that inaccurate manipulation of the DW's phase may destroy the magnetic skyrmion by inducing its shrinkage. En passant, we find the possibility of pair creation of a skyrmion anti-DW-skyrmion pair and a creation of two skyrmions from a decaying meron pair (MP) on the DW. Finally, we contemplate the operation of capturing magnetic skyrmions into DWs as a part in a larger toolbox of spintronic applications, including memory and computing.</description>

Abstract: We propose a very simple toy model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-supersymmetric quantum system and show, via Klein's construction, how to understand the system as being an $N=2$ supersymmetric system with an extra $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading. That is, the commutation/anticommutation rules are defined via the standard boson/fermion rules, but the system still has an underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading that needs to be taken into account.</description>

      <title>A new class of non-Einstein pp-wave solutions to quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a new family of exact vacuum solutions to quadratic gravity that describe pp-waves with two-dimensional wave surfaces that can have any prescribed constant curvature. When the wave surfaces are flat we recover the Peres waves obtained by Madsen, a subset of which forms precisely the vacuum pp-waves of general relativity. If, on the other hand, the wave surfaces have non-vanishing constant curvature then all our solutions are non-Einstein (i.e. they do not solve Einstein's equations in vacuum, with or without cosmological constant) and we find that the curvature is linearly related to the value of the cosmological constant. We show that the vacuum field equations reduce to a simple linear biharmonic equation on the curved wave surfaces, and as consequence, the general solution can be written down. We also provide some simple explicit examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial approaches to quantum gravity such as Quantum Regge Calculus and Spin Foams include configurations where bulk edges can become arbitrarily large while keeping the lengths of the boundary edges small. Such configurations pose significant challenges in Euclidean Quantum Regge Calculus, as they lead to infinities for the partition function and length expectation values. Here we investigate such configurations in three-dimensional Lorentzian Quantum Regge Calculus, and find that the partition function and length expectation values remain finite. This shows that the Lorentzian approach can avoid a key issue of the Euclidean approach. We also find that the space of configurations, for which bulk edges can become very large, is much richer than in the Euclidean case. In particular, it includes configurations with irregular light-cone structures, which lead to imaginary terms in the Regge action and branch cuts along the Lorentzian path integral contour. Hence, to meaningfully define the Lorentzian Regge path integral, one needs to clarify how such configurations should be handled.</description>

      <title>Loop-induced masses for the first two generations with optimum flavour violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mechanism for the masses of third, second, and first generation charged fermions at the tree, 1-loop, and 2-loop levels, respectively, is proposed. The fermionic self-energy corrections that lead to this arrangement are induced through heavy vector bosons of a new gauged flavour symmetry group $G_F$. It is shown that a single Abelian group suffices as $G_F$. Moreover, the gauge charges are optimized to result in relatively smaller flavour violations in processes involving the first and second generation fermions. The scheme is explicitly implemented on the Standard Model fermions in an anomaly-free manner and is shown to be viable with observed charged fermion masses and quark mixings. Constraints from flavour violations dictate the lower limit on the new physics scale in these types of frameworks. Through optimal flavour violation, it is shown that nearly two orders of magnitude improvement can be achieved on the lower limit, leading to the new physics scale $\ge 10^3$ TeV in this case. Further improvements are possible at the cost of the down quark mass deviating more than $3 \sigma$ from its value extracted from lattice calculations. Options for inducing tiny masses for light neutrinos are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Explicit Hamiltonian representations of meromorphic connections and duality from different perspectives: a case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose the explicit studies of $\hbar$-deformed meromorphic connections in $\mathfrak{gl}_3(\mathbb{C})$ with an unramified irregular pole at infinity of order $r_\infty=3$ and its spectral dual corresponding to the $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ Painlev\'{e} $4$ Lax pair with one vanishing monodromy at the finite pole. Using the apparent singularities and their dual partners on the spectral curves as Darboux coordinates, we obtain the Hamiltonian evolutions, their reductions to only one non-trivial direction, the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno tau-functions, the fundamental symplectic two-forms and some associated Hermitian matrix models on both sides. We then prove that the spectral duality connecting both sides extends to all these aspects as an explicit illustration of generalized Harnad's duality. We finally propose a conjecture relating the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno differential as the $\hbar=0$ evaluation of the Hamiltonian differential in these Darboux coordinates that could provide insights on the geometric interpretation of the $\hbar$ formal parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reports an extensive study of three-dimensional topological ordered phases that, in one of the directions behave like usual topological order concerning mobility of excitations, but in the perpendicular plane manifest type-II fracton physics dictated by a fractal subsystem symmetry. We obtain an expression for the ground state degeneracy, which depends intricately on the sizes of the plane, signaling a strong manifestation of ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The ground state degeneracy can be interpreted in terms of spontaneous/explicit breaking of fractal subsystem symmetries. We also study the boundary physics, which in turn is useful to understand the connection with certain two-dimensional phases. Finally, we derive a low-energy but not long-distance effective field theory, by Higgsing a fractal $U(1)$ symmetry and taking the deep IR limit. This description embodies in a natural way several aspects of the phases, such as the content of generalized global symmetries, the role of fractal symmetries on the mobility of excitations, the anomalies, and the boundary physics.</description>

      <title>Towards 2-dimensional non-commutative integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We collect evidence that the notion of path-ordered non-abelian integration admits an extension to two dimensions. We propose the corresponding notion of non-abelian 2-form along the lines of Lie algebroid theory and argue it is an appropriate one. The processes of parallel transport and integration turn out to be subtly different in the 2-dimensional case; we discuss parallel transport along surfaces and present an indirect definition of a non-abelian integral. This integral includes, for specific choices of 2-forms, both abelian integrals and the continuous limit of Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula as special cases; it interpolates between those cases and broadly generalizes them, allowing, for example, an analog of path-exponential with local, point-depending commutators to be spoken about. We comment on all these objects, their relations, gauge symmetries and geometrical meaning, and roughly sketch a plausible order-by-order procedure for obtaining formulas for non-abelian integrals. The exposition is reasonably concrete, relying on no notions more abstract than sections of vector bundles and homotopies.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the structure of a cosmic string wake, considering both the effects of regular and quantum pressure terms. We consider the total fluid to consist of a combination of baryons and dark matter. Hence, we are also able to study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the distribution of baryons inside the wake. We focus on parameter values for the superfluid dark matter which allow a MONDian explanation of galaxy rotation curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear response of four dimensional magnetized black holes and regular topological stars arising from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions. We consider both radial and nonradial perturbations and study the stability of these solutions, both in the frequency and in the time domain. Due to the presence of magnetic fluxes in the background, axial (i.e., odd-parity) gravitational perturbations are coupled to polar (i.e., even-parity) electromagnetic perturbations (Type-I sector) whereas polar gravitational and scalar perturbations are coupled to axial electromagnetic ones (Type-II sector). We provide a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of the radial perturbations and of the Type I sector, finding no evidence of linear instabilities (besides the already known Gregory-Laflamme instability of black strings occurring only in a certain range of the parameters), even despite the fact that the effective potential for radial perturbations of topological stars is negative and divergent near the inner boundary. Ultracompact topological stars exhibit long-lived trapped modes that give rise to echoes in the time-domain response. Their prompt response is very similar to that of the corresponding black hole with comparable charge-to-mass ratio. This provides a concrete realization of ultracompact objects arising from a well-defined theory. The numerical analysis of the Type-II sector will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine explicitly the modular flow and the modular Hamiltonian for massless free fermions in diamonds on a cylinder in 1+1 dimensions. We consider both periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions, the ground state in the antiperiodic case and the most general family of quasi-free zero-energy ground states in the periodic case, which depend on four parameters and are generally mixed. While for the antiperiodic ground state and one periodic ground state (the maximally mixed zero-temperature state) the modular data is known, our results for the generic ground state in the periodic case are completely new. We find that generically both the modular flow and the modular Hamiltonian are non-local, and we show that in the parametric limit where the state becomes pure the modular data becomes local. Moreover, even in the local case the modular flow generically mixes the two chiralities. This kind of behavior has not been observed previously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Found is the complete nonlinear action of multiple D$0$-brane system (mD$0$) in three dimensional type II superspace which is invariant under rigid $D=3$ ${\cal N}=2$ spacetime supersymmetry and under local worldline supersymmetry generalizing the $\kappa-$symmetry of single D$0$-brane action. We show that a particular representative of this family of actions can be obtained by dimensional reduction of the action of $D=4$ non-Abelian multiwaves (nAmW), the $D=4$ counterpart of 11D multiple M-wave (mM0) action, that we have also constructed in this paper. This reduction results in an action with is nonlinear due to the presence of a certain function ${\cal M}({\cal H})$ of the relative motion Hamiltonian ${\cal H}$, the counterpart of which enters the 4D nAmW action linearly. Curiously, the action possesses double supersymmetry also for an arbitrary function ${\cal M}({\cal H})$. In particular for ${\cal M}=\text{const}$ we find a dynamical system describing the sum of single D$0$ action and the action of 1d dimensional reduction of the $D=3$ ${\cal N}=2$ SYM coupled to the worldline supergravity induced by the embedding of the center of energy motion into the $D=3$ ${\cal N}=2$ superspace.</description>

      <title>Generalized Black Hole Entropy is von Neumann Entropy</title>

Abstract: It was recently shown that the von Neumann algebras of observables dressed to the mass of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole or an observer in de Sitter are Type II, and thus admit well-defined traces. The von Neumann entropies of "semi-classical" states were found to be generalized entropies. However, these arguments relied on the existence of an equilibrium (KMS) state and thus do not apply to, e.g., black holes formed from gravitational collapse, Kerr black holes, or black holes in asymptotically de Sitter space. In this paper, we present a general framework for obtaining the algebra of dressed observables for linear fields on any spacetime with a Killing horizon. We prove, assuming the existence of a stationary (but not necessarily KMS) state and suitable decay of solutions, a structure theorem that the algebra of dressed observables always contains a Type II factor "localized" on the horizon. These assumptions have been rigorously proven in most cases of interest. Applied to the algebra in the exterior of an asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, where the fields are dressed to the black hole mass and angular momentum, we find a product of a Type II$_{\infty}$ algebra on the horizon and a Type I$_{\infty}$ algebra at past null infinity. In Schwarzschild-de Sitter, despite the fact that we introduce an observer, the quantum field observables are dressed to the perturbed areas of the black hole and cosmological horizons and is the product of Type II$_{\infty}$ algebras on each horizon. In all cases, the von Neumann entropy for semiclassical states is given by the generalized entropy. Our results suggest that in all cases where there exists another "boundary structure" (e.g., an asymptotic boundary or another Killing horizon) the algebra of observables is Type II$_{\infty}$ and in the absence of such structures (e.g., de Sitter) the algebra is Type II$_{1}$.</description>

      <title>Boundary vertex algebras for 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 SCFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of boundary Vertex Operator Algebras (VOAs) of topologically twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 SCFTs. This is a recently introduced class of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs that by definition have zero-dimensional Higgs and Coulomb branches. We briefly explain why it is reasonable to obtain rational VOAs at the boundary of their topological twists. When a rank-0 SCFT is realized as the IR fixed point of a $\mathcal{N}=2$ Lagrangian theory, we propose a technique for the explicit construction of its topological twists and boundary VOAs based on deformations of the holomorphic-topological twist of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ microscopic description. We apply this technique to the $B$ twist of a newly discovered family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 SCFTs ${\mathcal T}_r$ and argue that they admit the simple affine VOAs $L_r(\mathfrak{osp}(1|2))$ at their boundary. In the simplest case, this leads to a novel level-rank duality between $L_1(\mathfrak{osp}(1|2))$ and the minimal model $M(2,5)$. As an aside, we present a TQFT obtained by twisting a 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ QFT that admits the $M(3,4)$ minimal model as a boundary VOA and briefly comment on the classical freeness of VOAs at the boundary of 3d TQFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in the non-trivial transverse space is studied by the renormalization group technique. The single loop approximation is adopted.
  Five real fixed points are found and the high-energy behaviour of the propagators is correspondingly calculated. As without odderon, the asymptotic is modulated by logarithms of energy in certain rational powers. Movement of coupling constants away from the fixed points is investigated both analytically (close to the fixed points) and numerically (far away). In the former case attraction occurs only in restricted domains of initial coupling constants. More generally in one third of the cases the coupling constants instead grow large indicating the breakdown of the single loop approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a consistent first principles prescription to compute gravitational R\'enyi entropy using Hayward corner terms. For Euclidean solutions to Einstein gravity, we compute R\'enyi entropy of Hartle--Hawking and fixed--area states by cutting open a manifold containing a conical singularity into a wedge with a corner. The entropy functional for fixed--area states is equal to the corner term itself, having a flat-entanglement spectrum, while extremization of the functional follows from the variation of the corner term under diffeomorphisms. Notably, our method does not require regularization of the conical singularity, and naturally extends to higher-curvature theories of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of crossed products in correctly elucidating the operator algebraic approach to quantum field theories. In the gravitational context, the crossed product simultaneously promotes von Neumann algebras associated with subregions in diffeomorphism covariant quantum field theories from type III to type II, and provides the necessary ingredients to gravitationally dress operators, thereby enforcing the constraints of the theory. In this note we enhance the crossed product construction to the context of general gauge theories with arbitrary combinations of internal and spacetime local symmetries. This is done by leveraging the correspondence between the crossed product and the extended phase space. We then undertake a detailed study of constraint quantization from the perspective of a generic crossed product algebra. We study and compare four distinct approaches to constraint quantization from this point of view: refined algebraic quantization, BRST quantization, path integral quantization, and the commutation theorem for crossed products. Far from simply reproducing existing analyses, the operator algebraic viewpoint sheds new light on old problems by reformulating the dressing of operators in terms of conditional expectations and other closely related projection maps. We conclude by applying our approach to the constraint quantization of three distinct gauge theories including a discussion of gravity on null hypersurfaces.</description>

Abstract: Geometric engineering is a collection of tools developed to establish dictionaries between local singularities in string theory and (supersymmetric) quantum fields. Extended operators and defects, as well as their higher quantum numbers captured by topological symmetries, can be encoded within geometric engineering dictionaries. In this paper we revisit and clarify aspects of these techniques, with special emphasis on 't Hooft anomalies, interpreted from the SymTFT perspective as obstructions to the existence of Neumann boundary conditions. These obstructions to gauging higher symmetries are captured via higher link correlators for the SymTFT on spheres. In this work, we give the geometric engineering counterpart of this construction in terms of higher links of topological membranes. We provide a consistency check in the context of 5D SCFTs with anomalous 1-form symmetries, where we give two independent derivations of the anomaly in terms of higher links, one purely field theoretical and the other purely geometrical. Along the way, we also recover the construction of non-invertible duality defects in 4D $\mathcal N=4$ SYM from a geometric engineering perspective.</description>

      <title>Geometry from Integrability: Multi-Leg Fishnet Integrals in Two Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalise the geometric analysis of square fishnet integrals in two dimensions to the case of hexagonal fishnets with three-point vertices. Our results support the conjecture that fishnet Feynman integrals in two dimensions, together with their associated geometry, are completely fixed by their Yangian and permutation symmetries. As a new feature for the hexagonal fishnets, the star-triangle identity introduces an ambiguity in the graph representation of a given Feynman integral. This translates into a map between different geometric interpretations attached to a graph. We demonstrate explicitly how these fishnet integrals can be understood as Calabi-Yau varieties, whose Picard-Fuchs ideals are generated by the Yangian over the conformal algebra. In analogy to elliptic curves, which represent the simplest examples of fishnet integrals with four-point vertices, we find that the simplest examples of three-point fishnets correspond to Picard curves with natural generalisations at higher loop orders.</description>

Abstract: Computing leading higher curvature contributions to thermodynamic quantities of AdS black hole is drastically simplified once the higher curvature terms are expressed in terms of powers of Weyl tensor by applying proper field redefinitions, avoiding the usual complications caused by higher derivative Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) term or surface counterterms. We establish the method by computing the Euclidean action of general rotating AdS black holes in five dimensional quadratic curvature theories with or without supersymmetry and verifying the results numerically. Our result is the state of the art for charged rotating AdS black holes in five dimensional minimal gauged supergravity including corrections from all three supersymmetric curvature squared terms. Our approach facilitates precision tests in the AdS/CFT correspondence and should be applicable in diverse dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Covariant and Manifestly Projective Invariant Formulation of Thomas-Whitehead Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thomas-Whitehead (TW) gravity is a recently formulated projectively invariant extension of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Projective geometry was used long ago by Thomas et. al. to succinctly package equivalent paths encoded by the geodesic equation. Projective invariance in gravity has further origins in string theory through a geometric action constructed from the method of coadjoint orbits using the Virasoro Algebra. A projectively invariant connection arises from this construction, a part of which is known as the diffeomorphism field. TW gravity exploits projective Gauss-Bonnet terms in the action functional to endow the diffeomorphism field with dynamics, while allowing the theory to collapse to general relativity in the limit that the diffeomorphism field vanishes and the connection becomes Levi-Civita. In the original formulation of TW gravity, the diffeomorphism field is projectively invariant but not tensorial and the connection is projectively invariant but not affine. In this paper we reformulate TW gravity in terms of projectively invariant tensor fields and a projectively invariant covariant derivative, derive field equations respecting these symmetries, and show that the field equations obtained are classically equivalent across formulations. This provides a 'Rosetta Stone' between this newly constructed covariant and projective invariant formulation of TW gravity and the original formulation that was manifestly projective invariant, but not covariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an enlarged BRST framework to treat the large gauge transformations of a given quantum field theory. It determines the associated infinitely many Noether charges stemming from a gauge fixed and BRST invariant Lagrangian, a result that cannot be obtained from Noether's second theorem. The geometrical significance of this result is highlighted by the construction of a trigraded BRST covariant phase space, allowing a BRST invariant gauge fixing procedure. This provides an appropriate framework for determining the conserved BRST Noether current of the global BRST symmetry and the associated global Noether charges. The latter are found to be equivalent with the usual classical corner charges of large gauge transformations. It allows one to prove the gauge independence of their physical effects at the perturbative quantum level. In particular, the underlying BRST fundamental canonical relation provides the same graded symplectic brackets as in the classical covariant phase space. A unified Lagrangian Ward identity for small and large gauge transformations is built. It consistently decouples into a bulk part for small gauge transformations, which is the standard BRST--BV quantum master equation, and a boundary part for large gauge transformations. The boundary part provides a perturbation theory origin for the invariance of the Hamiltonian physical $\mathcal{S}$-matrix under asymptotic symmetries. Holographic anomalies for the boundary Ward identity are studied and found to be solutions of a codimension one Wess--Zumino consistency condition. Such solutions are studied in the context of extended BMS symmetry. Their existence clarifies the status of the $1$-loop correction to the subleading soft graviton theorem.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Brower-Goddard extension of the Veneziano and Virasoro-Shapiro four-point amplitudes obtained by generalizing the Koba-Nielsen integrals to $d$-dimensional conformally invariant integrals. The amplitudes derived from this framework exhibit polynomial residues and can be shown to adhere to polynomial bounds at high energies. In odd dimensions, the amplitudes decompose into sums of three partial amplitudes, enabling the formulation of general amplitude relations that subsume the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) formula as a particular case. The amplitudes contain multiple tachyons in their spectra. Still, we demonstrate that their residues comply with the positivity conditions mandated by unitarity for spacetime dimensions at or below critical values $D_\text{crit}(d)$, where $D_\text{crit}(6)=26$ and $D_\text{crit}(\infty)=10$. In closing, we contemplate physical applications for membranes and potential extensions of the formalism.</description>

      <title>Structure of Massive Gauge/Gravity Scattering Amplitudes, Equivalence Theorems, and Extended Double-Copy with Compactified Warped Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in the compactified 5-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. We present systematic formulations of the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) for warped KK theories in $R_\xi^{}$ gauge, where the GAET connects the scattering amplitudes of longitudinal KK gauge bosons to that of the corresponding KK Goldstone bosons and the GRET connects the scattering amplitudes of KK gravitons of helicity-zero (helicity-one) to that of the corresponding gravitational KK Goldstone bosons. We analyze the structure of 3-point and 4-point scattering amplitudes of massive KK gauge bosons and of massive KK gravitons as well as their corresponding Goldstone bosons. We first prove the GAET and GRET explicitly for the fundamental 3-point KK gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes. We then demonstrate that the validity of the GAET and GRET for 4-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes can be reduced to the validity of GAET and GRET for 3-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes at tree level. With these, we study the double-copy construction of KK scattering amplitudes in the warped gauge/gravity theories. We newly realize the double-copy for massive 3-point full gauge/gravity amplitudes at tree level under proper correspondences of color-kinematics and of gauge/gravity couplings, whereas we can construct the double-copy for 4-point KK gauge/gravity amplitudes to the leading order (LO) of high energy expansion. We further demonstrate that this LO double-copy construction can be extended to $N$-point KK scattering amplitudes with $N\geqslant 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I point out that Gross-Neveu theory with SO(3) isospin in three spacetime dimensions -- proposed recently, for instance, as an effective description of the N\'eel transition in certain spin-orbital liquids -- also hosts quantum criticality of a more exotic kind. The ordered phase breaks SO(3) spontaneously, but the SO(3)-N\'eel order parameter vanishes. The fermionic bilinear order parameter is, instead, a biadjoint with respect to SO(3); unlike its N\'eel cousin, it constitutes an interaction-induced insulator. Furthermore, I show that the N\'eel and biadjoint order parameters can be combined to transform as an adjoint under SU(3) symmetry; the symmetry is emergent at the critical point separating the symmetric semimetal and the biadjoint insulator, but only if the flavour number is small enough, suggesting order-parameter fluctuations and the interplay between different channels play a crucial role in stabilizing the enlarged symmetry. In candidate SO(3) spin-orbital liqiuds, thermodynamic critical exponents carry fingerprints of "spinons". The existence of an independent universality class in addition to the N\'eel transition opens the possibility of posing further constraints on spinon properties from thermodynamic measurements near criticality alone.</description>

Abstract: The bound on the proton lifetime is one of a small handful of observations that constrains physics not far from the Planck scale. This calls for a calculation of the proton lifetime in quantum gravity. Here, we calculate how quantum fluctuations of the metric impact four-fermion interactions which mediate proton decay. We find that quantum gravity lowers the scaling dimension of the four-fermion interaction, suppressing proton decay and raising the proton lifetime significantly. As a special case, we analyze asymptotically safe quantum gravity, in which we discover that proton-decay-mediating four-fermion interactions are strictly zero.</description>

Abstract: In asymptotically flat spacetimes, bearing the null geodesics reaching the future null infinity in mind, we propose new concepts, the "dark horizons" as generalizations of the photon sphere. They are defined in terms of the structure of escape/capture cones of photons with respect to a unit timelike vector field. More specifically, considering a two-sphere that represents a set of emission directions of photons, the dark horizons are located at positions where a hemisphere is marginally included in the capture and escape cones, respectively. We show that both of them are absent in the Minkowski spacetime, while they exist in spacetimes with black hole(s) under a certain condition. We derive the general properties of the dark horizons in spherically symmetric spacetimes and explicitly calculate the locations of the dark horizons in the Vaidya spacetime and the Kerr spacetime.</description>

When applying this formalism to the particular case of a Lagrange top, in the formulation with a diagonal inertia tensor the potential energy has more complicated form as compared with that assumed in the literature on dynamics of a rigid body. This implies the corresponding improvements in equations of motion. Therefore, we revised this case, presenting several examples of analytical solutions to the improved equations. The case of precession without nutation has a surprisingly rich relationship between the rotation and precession rates, and this is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Kennedy-Tasaki transformation and non-invertible symmetry in lattice models beyond one dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit operator representation (via a sequential circuit and projection to symmetry subspaces) of Kramers-Wannier duality transformation in higher-dimensional subsystem symmetric models generalizing the construction in the 1D transverse-field Ising model. Using the Kramers-Wannier duality operator, we also construct the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation that maps subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases to spontaneous subsystem symmetry breaking phases, where the symmetry group for the former is either $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This generalizes the recently proposed picture of one-dimensional Kennedy-Tasaki transformation as a composition of manipulations involving gauging and stacking symmetry-protected topological phases to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Excitonic quantum criticality: from bilayer graphene to narrow Chern bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of excitonic quantum phase transitions describing the evolution of a bilayer metallic state to an inter-layer coherent state where excitons condense. We argue that such transitions can be continuous and exhibit a non-Fermi liquid counterflow response ${\rho_{\mathrm{counterflow}}(\omega)\sim\omega^{2/z}}$ that directly encodes the dynamical critical exponent $z$. Our calculations are performed within a controlled expansion around $z = 2$. This physics is relevant to any system with spin, valley, or layer degrees of freedom. We consider two contexts for excitonic quantum criticality: (1) a weakly interacting graphene bilayer, and (2) a system of two narrow, half-filled Chern bands at zero external magnetic field, with total Chern number $C_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$, which may soon be realizable in moir\'{e} materials. The latter system hosts a time-reversed pair of composite Fermi liquid states, and the condensation of excitons of the composite fermions leads to an exotic exciton insulator* state with a charge neutral Fermi surface. Our work sheds new light on the physics of inter-layer coherence transitions in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and low-energy scattering of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice quantum chromodynamics results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations in the Interior of Black Holes and Backreactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of the quantum field perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. The interior of the black hole is like an anisotropic cosmological background which expands in one extended direction while contracting in azimuthal directions. Solving the quantum mode functions approximately, we calculate the expectation values of physical quantities such as the energy density $\langle \rho \rangle$ and pressure $\langle P\rangle$ as measured by an observer in the interior of the black hole. We employ a combination of the $\zeta$ function regularization and dimensional regularization schemes to regularize the UV divergences in the energy momentum tensor associated to these quantum perturbations. By solving the Einstein field equations, we calculate the quantum backreactions induced in the background geometry. We speculate that the effects of quantum fluctuations in the interior of the black hole can be measured by the exterior observer.</description>

      <title>Light rings and causality for nonsingular ultracompact objects sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of nonsingular ultracompact objects regularized by nonlinear electrodynamics. The phenomenon of birefringence causes photons of different polarizations to propagate with respect to two distinct metrics, which manifests itself in the appearance of additional light rings surrounding the ultracompact object. We analyze the observational consequences of this result and illustrate our findings based on three regular black hole models commonly considered in the literature. We find that nonsingular horizonless ultracompact objects sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics possess an odd number of light rings and discuss the viability of this effective description of their properties. In addition, we compare the phase velocities of polarized light rays propagating in nonsingular geometries sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics to the corresponding phase velocity in the Schwarzschild spacetime and demonstrate that regularizing the singularity by means of a theory that does not adhere to the Maxwell weak-field limit may lead to the emergence of acausal regions.</description>
