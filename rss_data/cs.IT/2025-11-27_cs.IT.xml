      <title>WiRainbow: Single-Antenna Direction-Aware Wi-Fi Sensing via Dispersion Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Wi-Fi signals have emerged as a powerful tool for contactless sensing. During the sensing process, obtaining target direction information can provide valuable contextual insights for various applications. Existing direction estimation methods typically rely on antenna arrays, which are costly and complex to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present WiRainbow, a novel approach that enables single-antenna-based direction awareness for Wi-Fi sensing by leveraging the dispersion effect of frequency-scanning antennas (FSAs), which can naturally steer Wi-Fi subcarriers toward distinct angles during signal transmission. To address key challenges in antenna design and signal processing, we propose a coupled-resonator-based antenna architecture that significantly expands the narrow Field-of-View inherent in conventional FSAs, improving sensing coverage. Additionally, we develop a sensing signal-to-noise-ratio-based signal processing framework that reliably estimates target direction in multipath-rich environments. We prototype WiRainbow and evaluate its performance through benchmark experiments and real-world case studies, demonstrating its ability to achieve accurate, robust, and cost-effective direction awareness for diverse Wi-Fi sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Access Point Coordination in Agentic AI Wi-Fi with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show that any interior point of an open interval on the real line can be interpreted as a pair of dual Fr\'echet quasi-arithmetic means associated with dual metric distances. A Riemannian interpretation of the Euclidean line brings to light a novel concept of dual scales of means, grounded in convex duality and of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a unified approach to characterize the set of all feasible signals subject to privacy constraints. The Blackwell frontier of feasible signals can be decomposed into minimum informative signals achieving the Blackwell frontier of privacy variables, and conditionally privacy-preserving signals. A complete characterization of the minimum informative signals is then provided. We apply the framework to ex-post privacy (including differential and inferential privacy) and to constraints on posterior means of arbitrary statistics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Lighting Control in Visible Light Systems: An Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Illumination Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor visible light communication (VLC) is a promising sixth-generation (6G) technology, as its directional and sensitive optical signals are naturally suited for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, current research mainly focuses on maximizing data rates and sensing accuracy, creating a conflict between high performance, high energy consumption, and user visual comfort. This paper proposes an adaptive integrated sensing, communication, and illumination (ISCI) framework that resolves this conflict by treating energy savings as a primary objective. The framework's mechanism first partitions the receiving plane using a geometric methodology, defining an activity area and a surrounding non-activity area to match distinct user requirements. User location, determined using non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, then acts as a dynamic switch for the system's optimization objective. The system adaptively shifts between minimizing total transmit power while guaranteeing communication and illumination performance in the activity area and maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) uniformity in the non-activity area. Numerical results confirm that this adaptive ISCI approach achieves 53.59% energy savings over a non-adaptive system and improves SNR uniformity by 57.79%, while satisfying all illumination constraints and maintaining a mean localization error of 0.071 m.</description>

      <title>Blind Turbo Demodulation for Differentially Encoded OFDM with 2D Trellis Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB)-like systems employ differentially encoded (DE) phase-shift keying (PSK) for transmission. While turbo-DE-PSK receivers offer substantial performance gains through iterative decoding by making the DE-PSK an inner code, they rely on accurate channel estimation without pilots, which is a key challenge in DAB-like scenarios. This paper develops a fully blind turbo-DE-PSK scheme that jointly estimates channel phase, channel gain, and noise variance directly from the received signal. The design leverages a two-dimensional (2D) trellis decomposition for blind phase estimation, complemented by power-based estimators for channel gain and noise variance. We provide a comprehensive system assessment across practical system parameters, including inner code length, phase quantization, and 2D block size. Simulation results show that the blind 2D turbo demodulator approaches the performance of receivers with perfect channel knowledge and remains robust under realistic transmission conditions.</description>

      <title>Subjective Depth and Timescale Transformers: Learning Where and When to Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.</description>

      <title>Nearly Tight Lower Bounds for Relaxed Locally Decodable Codes via Robust Daisies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a nearly optimal lower bound on the length of linear relaxed locally decodable codes (RLDCs). Specifically, we prove that any $q$-query linear RLDC $C\colon \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}^n$ must satisfy $n = k^{1+\Omega(1/q)}$. This bound closely matches the known upper bound of $n = k^{1+O(1/q)}$ by Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (STOC 2004).
  Our proof introduces the notion of robust daisies, which are relaxed sunflowers with pseudorandom structure, and leverages a new spread lemma to extract dense robust daisies from arbitrary distributions.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the privacy amplification of arbitrary channels via the contraction of $f_\alpha$-divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11473v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the privacy amplification of channels that do not necessarily satisfy any LDP guarantee by analyzing their contraction behavior in terms of $f_\alpha$-divergence, an $f$-divergence related to R\'enyi-divergence via a monotonic transformation. We present bounds on contraction for restricted sets of prior distributions via $f$-divergence inequalities and present an improved Pinsker's inequality for $f_\alpha$-divergence based on the joint range technique by Harremo\"es and Vajda. The presented bound is tight whenever the value of the total variation distance is larger than 1/$\alpha$. By applying these inequalities in a cross-channel setting, we arrive at strong data processing inequalities for $f_\alpha$-divergence that can be adapted to use-case specific restrictions of input distributions and channel. The application of these results to privacy amplification shows that even very sparse channels can lead to significant privacy amplification when used as a post-processing step after local differentially private mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the set of lumpable Markov chains over a finite state space, with respect to a fixed lumping function, generally does not form an exponential family of stochastic matrices. In this work, we explore efficiently verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for families of lumpable transition matrices to form exponential families. To this end, we develop a broadly applicable dimension-based method for determining whether a given family of stochastic matrices forms an exponential family.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Minimax Bounds and an Optimal Lyapunov Policy in Queueing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an original minimax framework for finite-time performance analysis in queueing control and propose a surprisingly simple Lyapunov-based scheduling policy with superior finite-time performance. The framework quantitatively characterizes how the expected total queue length scales with key system parameters, including the capacity of the scheduling set and the variability of arrivals and departures across queues. To our knowledge, this provides the first firm foundation for evaluating and comparing scheduling policies in the finite-time regime, including nonstationary settings, and shows that the proposed policy can provably and empirically outperform classical MaxWeight in finite time. Within this framework, we establish three main sets of results. First, we derive minimax lower bounds on the expected total queue length for parallel-queue scheduling via a novel Brownian coupling argument. Second, we propose a new policy, LyapOpt, which minimizes the full quadratic Lyapunov drift-capturing both first- and second-order terms-and achieves optimal finite-time performance in heavy traffic while retaining classical stability guarantees. Third, we identify a key limitation of the classical MaxWeight policy, which optimizes only the first-order drift: its finite-time performance depends suboptimally on system parameters, leading to substantially larger backlogs in explicitly characterized settings. Together, these results delineate the scope and limitations of classical drift-based scheduling and motivate new queueing-control methods with rigorous finite-time guarantees.</description>

      <title>Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many complex systems - be they financial, natural, or social - are composed of units - such as stocks, neurons, or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationship between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series shares a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average, while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not, and, if so, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, with the major contribution to the underlying negative subgraph coming from the subcortical structures (and, to a lesser extent, from the limbic regions). At the mesoscopic level, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion, instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model, reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</description>

      <title>Category learning in deep neural networks: Information content and geometry of internal representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In humans and other animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii) building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near, the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.</description>
