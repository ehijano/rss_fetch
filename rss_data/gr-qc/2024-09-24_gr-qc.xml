      <title>Classical and quantum analysis of gravitational singularity from Raychaudhuri equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work deals with the Raychaudhuri equation (RE) to examine the space-time singularity both from classical and quantum point of view. The RE has been looked upon in terms of a classical linear Harmonic oscillator and Focusing theorem has been studied. Also, the Raychaudhuri scalar has been shown to affect the convergence and singularity formation in Black-holes and cosmology. Finally, resolution of initial big-bang singularity has been attempted quantum mechanically in two ways namely by canonical quantization and by formulation of Bohmian trajectories.</description>

      <title>Temporal Pound-Rebka experiment as gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the classical tests of general relativity is the precision measurements by Pound and Rebka of red-shift/blue-shift of photons in a gravitational field. In this essay, we lay out a temporal version of the Pound-Rebka experiment. The emission and absorption of photons occurs at different times, rather than at different spatial locations as in the original Pound-Rebka experiment. This temporal Pound-Rebka experiment is equivalent to a gravitational Aharonov-Bohm Effect and is testable via current or near future satellite experiments.</description>

      <title>ESIGMAHM: An Eccentric, Spinning inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model with Higher Modes for the detection and characterization of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a time-domain inspiral-merger-ringdowm (IMR) waveform model ESIGMAHM constructed within a framework we named ESIGMA for coalescing binaries of spinning black holes on moderately eccentric orbits (Huerta et al. (2018) [Phys. Rev. D 97, 024031]). We now include the effect of black hole spins on the dynamics of eccentric binaries, as well as model sub-dominant waveform harmonics emitted by them. The inspiral evolution is described by a consistent combination of latest results from post-Newtonian theory, self-force, and black hole perturbation theory. We assume that these moderately eccentric binaries radiate away most of their orbital eccentricity before merger, and seamlessly connect the eccentric inspiral with a numerical relativity based surrogate waveform model for mergers of spinning binaries on quasi-circular orbits. We validate ESIGMAHM against eccentric Numerical Relativity simulations, and also against contemporary effective-one-body and phenomenological models in the quasi-circular limit. We find that ESIGMAHM achieves match values greater than $99\%$ for quasi-circular spin-aligned binaries with mass ratios up to $8$, and above $97\%$ for non-spinning and spinning eccentric systems with small or positively aligned spins. Using IMRESIGMA, we quantify the impact of orbital eccentricity on GW signals, showing that next-generation detectors can detect eccentric sources up to $10\%$ louder than quasi-circular ones. We also show that current templated LIGO-Virgo searches will lose more than $10\%$ of optimal SNR for about $20\%$ of all eccentric sources by using only quasi-circular waveform templates. The same will result in a $25\%$ loss in detection rate for eccentric sources with mass ratios $m_1/m_2\geq 4$. Our results highlight the need for including eccentricity and higher-order modes in GW source models and searches for asymmetric eccentric BBH signals.</description>

      <title>Linearly Interacting Barrow Holographic Dark Energy in Modified Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Barrow holographic dark energy (BHDE) model using the apparent horizon as the infrared (IR) cut-off and ensuring thermodynamic consistency. However, the results show that the BHDE model without any interaction does not yield the accelerated expansion of the universe. Including a linear interaction solves the acceleration and dark energy equation of state parameter problems.</description>

      <title>Weakly magnetized black holes in Einstein-ModMax theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories of non-linear electrodynamics inherently describe deviations from Maxwell theory in the strong field regime. Among these, ModMax electrodynamics stands out as a unique one-parameter generalization of Maxwell theory that preserves both conformal invariance and electromagnetic duality. In this paper, we investigate the extension of Wald's magnetization within the framework of Einstein-ModMax theory, concentrating on static charged and accelerating black holes. Additionally, we examine the influence of external magnetic fields on the motion of charged test particles in the vicinity of a charged black hole.</description>

      <title>Constrained transit cosmological models in $f(R,L_{m},T)$-gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate constrained transit cosmological models in the most recent proposed modified gravity theory, $f(R,L_{m},T)$-gravity. We obtain the modified field equations for a flat homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime metric. We constrain the equation of continuity by imposing the equation of state for the perfect fluid source $p=-\frac{1}{3}\rho+p_{0}$ so that we get energy conservation equation as $\dot{\rho}+3H(\rho+p)=0$, (because generally, energy conservation law is not satisfied in $f(R,L_{m},T)$-gravity). Using this constraint, we establish a relation between the energy density parameters $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{r0}$, and $\Omega_{f0}$ and the Hubble function. After that, we made observational constraints on $H(z)$ to obtain the best-fit present values of $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{r0}$, and $H_{0}$. Then, we use these best-fit values of energy parameters to investigate cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, the effective equation of state $\omega_{eff}$, and the energy density parameters $\Omega_{m}$, $\Omega_{r}$, and $\Omega_{f}$ to learn more about the components and history of the expanding universe. We found an effective EoS parameter in the range $-1\le \omega_{eff}\le\frac{1}{3}$ with a deceleration-acceleration transition redshift value of $z_{t}=0.6377, 0.6424$ along two datasets cosmic chronometer (CC) and Pantheon SNIa, respectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring a Novel Feature of Ellis Spacetime: Insights into Scalar Field Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied neutral and charged massive particles dynamics in Ellis spacetime in the presence of the external scalar field. Focusing on the circular motion of massive particles, the impact of an external scalar field on the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) position is analyzed, revealing a non-linear relationship with the scalar field parameter. Perturbation techniques are employed to investigate oscillatory motion near stable orbits in the Ellis spacetime, yielding analytical expressions for radial and angular oscillations. The throat of the wormhole has been constrained by comparing theoretical and observational results for fundamental frequencies of particles from quasars. Finally, scalar and gravitational perturbations in the Ellis spacetime have been studied. It is shown that the equation for the scalar profile function is fully independent from the tensor functions, and the solution can be represented in terms of the confluent Heun function. However, it has been shown that equations for the tensor profile functions strongly depend on the scalar profile functions in the Ellis spacetime, and they are reduced to the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation. Finally, numerical solutions to the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation for the radial functions in the Ellis spacetime have been presented.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Fittest: Testing Superradiance Termination with Simulated Binary Black Hole Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superradiance instability of rotating black holes leads to the formation of an ultralight boson cloud with distinctive observational signatures, making black holes an effective probe of ultralight dark matter. However, around black holes in a binary system, the superradiance effect of such clouds can be terminated by tidal perturbations from the companion, leading to cloud depletion. In this study, we perform the first analysis of the impact of this termination effect on superradiant black hole binaries which are realistically modelled after their statistics in our Galaxy. Working with a dataset of approximately $10^7$ black hole binaries simulated using the Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) population synthesis code, we identify the superradiant candidates and those that manage to survive the termination effect. We then calculate the cloud survival rate for various boson masses and black hole spin models. Our findings reveal that the $l=m=1$ cloud modes are generally stable against termination, whereas the $l=m=2$ modes can be significantly affected, with survival rates dropping below $10\%$ for boson masses below approximately $0.5\times 10^{-12}$ eV. In addition, our analysis indicates that clouds that overcome termination typically exhibit a higher superradiant growth rate and therefore a higher detectability.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ghost Pilgrim Dark Energy Fractal Cosmology with Observational Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore dark energy models, mainly ghost, generalized ghost, and generalized ghost pilgrim dark energy models within the framework of fractal cosmology. To obtain solutions for the field equations, we employ a parameterization of the deceleration parameter as proposed by \textit{R.K. Tiwari}. By utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we impose constraints on the free parameters of the derived solutions. The analysis is based on observational datasets, including 57 data points from the Observational Hubble Data ($OHD$) and, 1048 points from the $Pantheon$ Supernovae sample. This approach allows us to assess the viability of the dark energy models in describing the current cosmic expansion. According to the effective equation-of-state parameter, the model maintains itself in the quintessence era and ultimately switches into the Einstein-de Sitter model. Furthermore, we investigate the statefinder, jerk, snap, and lerk parameters. The energy conditions of each model satisfy the weak and null energy conditions but violate the strong energy condition. We find that the $Om(z)$ curves for the data samples exhibit a consistently negative slope throughout the entire range.</description>

      <title>Accelerated parameter estimation of supermassive black hole binaries in LISA using meshfree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be capable of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the milli-Hertz band. Among various sources, LISA will detect the coalescence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Accurate and rapid inference of parameters for such sources will be important for potential electromagnetic follow-up efforts. Rapid Bayesian inference with LISA includes additional complexities as compared to current generation terrestrial detectors in terms of time and frequency dependent antenna response functions. In this work, we extend a recently developed, computationally efficient technique that uses meshfree interpolation methods to accelerate Bayesian reconstruction of compact binaries. Originally developed for second-generation terrestrial detectors, this technique is now adapted for LISA parameter estimation. Using the full inspiral, merger, and ringdown waveform (PhenomD) and assuming rigid adiabatic antenna response function, we show faithful inference of SMBHB parameters from GW signals embedded in stationary, Gaussian instrumental noise. We discuss the computational cost and performance of the meshfree approximation method in estimating the GW source parameters.</description>

      <title>Searching for small primordial black holes in planets, asteroids and here on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small primordial black holes could be captured by rocky planets or asteroids, consume their liquid cores from inside and leave hollow structures. We calculate the surface density and surface tension of a hollow structure around a black hole and compare them with the density and compressive strength of various materials that appear in nature to find the allowed parameter space. For example, granite or iron can support a hollow asteroid/planetoid/moon of the size of up to $0.1 R_\oplus$. Along the same lines, future civilizations might build spherical structures around black holes to harvest their energy. Using the strongest material that we currently know how to make (multiwall carbon nanotube), to withstand gravity of one solar mass black hole, the shell must be constructed at distances larger than $10^4 R_\odot$. Alternatively, a fast black hole can leave a narrow tunnel in a solid object while passing through it. For example, a $10^{22}$g black hole should leave a tunnel with a radius of $0.1$ micron, which is large enough to be seen by an optical microscope. We could look for such micro-tunnels here on Earth in very old rocks, or even glass or other solid structures in very old buildings. While our estimate gives a very small probability of finding such tunnels, looking for them does not require expensive equipment and long preparation, and the payoff might be significant.</description>

      <title>Modified Schwarzschild spacetime in Ricci-flat brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering an ansatz for $1+3+n$ dimensional static spacetime with uniform $n$-branes stacked in three-dimensional rotationally symmetric space, we found different classes of vacuum solutions of Einstein field equations. We analyzed these solutions through the Newtonian limit, Kretschmann scalar, and conserved energy from Landau--Lifshitz stress-energy pseudotensor. This revealed unusual physical properties for a class of solutions with nontrivial extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime with extra dimensions. Positive conserved energy is associated with repulsive gravity and physical singularity on the horizon, while negative conserved energy implies gravitational attraction and naked singularity. This sets the Schwarzschild solution in a broader context and provides new possible testing grounds for general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Kundt solutions to vacuum Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG) proposed by Harada and find numerous solutions in four dimensions and in higher dimensions. In CKG theory the cosmological constant appears as an integration constant, and hence, is naturally embedded in the theory. However, by considering Kundt solutions to CKG we seemingly open Pandora's box: We find so many solutions so a selection criterium is needed in CKG to explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <title>Bardeen-Dirac Stars in AdS Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a static spherical symmetric Bardeen-Dirac Stars (BDSs) in the four-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, which consists of the electromagnetic field and Dirac field coupled to gravity. We investigate the ADM mass, Noether charge and light rings of BDSs in AdS spacetime. In asymptotically Minkowski spacetime, the maximum frequency of BDSs is one. However, we observe that the maximum frequency of BDSs increases as the cosmological constant decreases in AdS spacetime. Additionally, BDSs can exhibit extreme behavior at low frequencies, refer to as Frozen Bardeen-Dirac stars (FBDSs) in AdS spacetime. FBDSs have a critical event horizon, where the metric function gtt is very close to zero. The matter is entirely encapsulated by this critical horizon, highly concentrated within it. When the magnetic charge is fixed, the FBDSs gradually disappear as the cosmological constant decreases.</description>

      <title>Generic Modified Teukolsky Formalism beyond General Relativity for Spherically Symmetric Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves has inaugurated a new era for testing gravitational theories in strong-field, nonlinear regimes. Gravitational waves emit during the ringdown phase of binary black hole mergers and from extreme mass ratio inspirals are particularly sensitive to the properties of black holes, making them crucial for probing deviations from general relativity. These studies need a robust foundation in black hole perturbation theory beyond general relativity. While existing studies have employed black hole perturbation theories to explore modifications beyond general relativity, they often focus on specific alternative theories or phenomenological models of quantum gravity. In this paper, we establish a modified decoupled Teukolsky formalism that is broadly applicable to spherically symmetric spacetimes without requiring a predetermined gravitational Lagrangian. This formalism uses the Newman-Penrose framework, which utilizes curvature perturbations characterized by Weyl scalars, to accommodate a wider class of spacetimes beyond general relativity. Our approach correctly handles non-Ricci-flat backgrounds and circumvents subtle analytical issues associated with effective potentials that are present in other modified Teukolsky formalisms.</description>

      <title>Cosmological eras with the neutrino non-relativistic transition in RTB gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories based on the Ricci and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, or the short name Ricci-trace-based (RTB) theories, represent a gravitational approach based on the Ricci scalar $R$, and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $g^{\mu\nu}T_{\mu\nu} = T$. This theory fits into gravitational models of the type $f(R, T) = R + f(T)$, where $f(T)$ is an arbitrary function of $T$. In this study, we explore a cosmological scenario within the context of RTB models, investigating in detail the cosmological consequences of the coupling between matter and geometry. In order to address this issue, we propose a toy model in which the non-relativistic cosmological neutrino transition plays a role in the cosmic evolution since the effective total energy-momentum tensor trace is affected in this process. We raise questions about the coupling of neutrinos with geometry during this transition, providing a detailed analysis of how RTB gravity deals with this phenomenon and the impact of neutrinos on cosmological dynamics. In summary, we show that the coupling of cosmological neutrinos with $T$ dependent cosmologies is severely challenged.</description>

      <title>Finite-Element Simulations of Rotating Neutron Stars with Anisotropic Crusts and Continuous Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Mountains'', or non-axisymmetrical deformations in the elastic crust of rotating neutron stars are efficient radiators of continuous gravitational waves. Recently, small anisotropies were observed in the solid innermost inner core of the Earth. We implement three-dimensional finite-element simulations to study mountains sourced by modest anisotropies in the solid crust of rotating neutron stars. We find that anisotropic mountains may be detectable by current ground-based gravitational-wave detectors and might explain several observed phenomena, confirming the results of a previous work on less realistic neutron star models. In particular, we find that a slightly anisotropic neutron star crust that changes its rotation rate modestly can support an ellipticity of a few $\times$ 10$^{-9}$, which is equivalent to the upper bounds on the ellipticity of some nearby and rapidlly spinning pulsars.</description>

      <title>Effective potential approach to study hydrodynamics and particle dynamics in Kerr geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the exact form of effective potential in Kerr geometry from the general relativistic radial momentum equation. The effective potential accurately mimics the general relativistic features, over the entire range of the spin parameter $-1&lt;a&lt;1$. We obtain the exact expression of the rate of dragging of inertial frames that can be used to study the relativistic precession of twisted accretion disks that are formed when the disk outskirts are tilted relative to the equatorial plane of the black hole. We then present an effective potential that provides a simplistic approach to study particle dynamics using physical concepts analogous to the Newtonian physics. We compare the equatorial as well as off-equatorial particle trajectories obtained using our potential with the general relativistic solutions. We find that our approach can capture the salient features of Kerr geometry and is applicable to studies of accretion processes around Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>Formation of Trapped Surfaces in Geodesic Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical results of the formation of trapped surfaces for the Einstein vacuum equation relying on the geodesic foliation, rather than the double null foliation used in all previous results, starting with the seminal work of Christodoulou \cite{Chr1} and continued in \cite{KRodn}, \cite{An}, \cite{AnLuk}, \cite{KLR}, \cite{An1}. The main advantage of the method is that it only requires information on the incoming curvature along the incoming initial null hypersurface. The result is based on a version of the non-integrable PT frame introduced in \cite{KS:Kerr} and \cite{GKS}, associated to the geodesic foliation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the chaotic dynamics of spinless extended bodies in a wide class of spherically symmetric spacetimes, which encompasses black-hole scenarios in many modified theories of gravity. We show that a spherically symmetric pulsating ball may have chaotic motion in this class of spacetimes. The cases of the Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m and Ay{\'o}n-Beato-Garc{\'i}a black holes are analyzed in detail. The equations of motion for the extended bodies are obtained according to Dixon's formalism, up to quadrupole order. Then, we use Melnikov's method to show the presence of homoclinic intersections, which imply chaotic behavior, as a consequence of our assumption that the test body has an oscillating radius.</description>

      <title>Exact Results On the Number of Gravitons Radiated During Binary Inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an exact formula $F(e) = 2 \hbar \frac{dN}{dJ}$ which provides a concrete estimate for the total number and angular momentum of gravitons emitted during the nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes. We show that the function $F(e)$ is a slowly growing monotonic function of the eccentricity $0 \le e \le 1$ and $F(1) = 1.012\, 815 \, 967 \,259 \,511 \cdots $. We confirm and extend the results of Page for the function $F(e)$. We also get an exact result for the ratio $\nu (e_i) = \frac{2\hbar N(L_i, e_i)}{L_i}$ of the sum of the spin angular momentum magnitudes of gravitons emitted to the magnitude $L_i$ of the total angular momentum emitted in the graviational waves by inspiraling binary black holes. If the orbit starts off with unit eccentricity $e_i=1$, we get the exact value $\nu(1) = 1.002\, 268\, 666\, 2 \pm 10^{-10}$ which confirms the Page conjecture. We also show that the formula $F(e)$ for gravitons emitted can be determined by a single function.</description>

      <title>The magnetic black hole solution under nonlinear electrodynamics theory, its EM-gravity coupled perturbation and superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a series of exact solutions to Einstein-Maxwell equation under nonlinear electrodynamics theory (NED), which are considered as a natural extension of the dyonic RN solution. Our results are based on a general premise demanding a spherically symmetric spacetime but with few restrictions on the specific form of the EM action. We discuss some of its characteristics including ADM mass, quasi-local mass, asymptotic behavior, energy condition and so on. We study the EM-gravity coupled perturbation in this spacetime using Newman-Penrose (NP) form, which can be regarded as a small generalization of this method. We also generalize the former formula computing energy and angular momentum flux from the black hole horizon to study the super radiance of the Dirac field in this spacetime.</description>

      <title>Recovering Injected Astrophysics from the LISA Galactic Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the successful recovery of common envelope ejection efficiency assumed in a simulated population of double white dwarf binaries like those which may be observed by the future LISA mission. We simulate the formation of double white dwarf binaries by using the COSMIC population synthesis code to sample binary formation conditions such as initial mass function, metallicity of star formation, initial orbital period, and initial eccentricity. These binaries are placed in the m12i synthetic Milky-Way-like galaxy, and their signal-to-noise ratio for the LISA instrument is estimated, considering a galactic gravitational wave foreground informed by the population. Through the use of Fisher estimates, we construct a likelihood function for the measurement error of the LISA-bright DWD binaries (&gt; 20 SNR, fGW &gt; 5mHz), in their gravitational wave frequency (fGW) and chirp mass. By repeating this process for different assumptions of the common envelope ejection efficiency, we apply Bayesian hierarchical inference to find the best match to an injected astrophysical assumption for a fiducial population model. We conclude that the impact of common envelope ejection efficiency on the mass transfer processes involved in double white dwarf formation may be statistically relevant in the future observed LISA population, and that constraints on binary formation may be found by comparing simulated populations to a future observed population.</description>

      <title>A speed limit on tachyon fields from cosmological and fine-structure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rolling tachyon is a non-canonical scalar field model well motivated in string theory which naturally predicts variations of the fine-structure constant. Such variations can in principle lead to interesting observable consequences, but they can also lead to extremely tight constraints on these kinds of models. In this work we subject the rolling tachyon model evolving in a variety of potentials to current data and show that most cosmologically interesting evolutions are already strongly excluded. We find $|1+w_0| &lt; 10^{-3}$ from cosmological data and $|1+w_0| &lt; 10^{-9}$ from fine-structure data, leaving the rolling tachyon to either play a role almost entirely equivalent to a cosmological constant or that of a test field. We also find that in most of the allowed parameter space the field evolves very slowly, allowing its evolution to be approximated as an equivalent canonical scalar field.</description>

      <title>$C^{0}$-inextendibility of FLRW spacetimes within a subclass of axisymmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the proof of the $C^0$-inextendibility of Schwarzschild by Sbierski, the past decade has seen renewed interest in showing low-regularity inextendibility for known spacetime models. Specifically, a lot of attention has been paid to FLRW spacetimes and there is an ever growing array of results in the literature. Apart from hoping to provide a concise summary of the state of the art we present an extension of work by Galloway and Ling on $C^0$-inextendibility of certain FLRW spacetimes within a subclass of spherically symmetric spacetimes, to $C^0$-inextendibility within a subclass of axisymmetric spacetimes. Notably our result works in the case of flat FLRW spacetimes with $a(t)\to 0$ for $t\to 0^+$, a setting where other known $C^0$-inextendibility results for FLRW spacetimes due to Sbierski do not apply.</description>

      <title>Reductions of GKZ Systems and Applications to Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A powerful approach to computing Feynman integrals or cosmological correlators is to consider them as solution to systems of differential equations. Often these can be chosen to be Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) systems. However, their naive construction introduces a significant amount of unnecessary complexity. In this paper we present an algorithm which allows for reducing these GKZ systems to smaller subsystems if a parameter associated to the GKZ systems is resonant. These simpler subsystems can then be solved separately resulting in solutions for the full system. The algorithm makes it possible to check when reductions happen and allows for finding the associated simpler solutions. While originating in the mathematical theory of D-modules analyzed via exact sequences of Euler-Koszul homologies, the algorithm can be used without knowledge of this framework. We motivate the need for such reduction techniques by considering cosmological correlators on an FRW space-time and solve the 1-loop, 2-vertex correlator in this way. It turns out that this integral exemplifies an interesting relation between locality and the reduction of the differential equations.</description>

      <title>Finite complexity of the ER=EPR state in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ER=EPR conjecture states that quantum entanglement between boundary degrees of freedom leads to the emergence of bulk spacetime itself. Although this has been tested extensively in String Theory for asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes, its implications for an accelerating universe, such as our own, remain less explored. Assuming a cosmic version of ER=EPR for de Sitter space, we explore computational complexity corresponding to long-range entanglement responsible for bulk states on spacelike hypersurfaces. Rather remarkably, we find that the complexity (per unit volume) of the Euclidean vacuum, as an entangled state over two boundary CFT vacua, is finite both in the UV and the IR, which provides additional evidence for cosmic ER=EPR. Our result seems to be a universal feature of spacetimes with horizons and is explicitly independent of the details of the model under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the first direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO--Virgo collaboration in 2015, the size of the gravitational-wave transient catalog has grown to nearly 100 events, with more than as many observed during the ongoing fourth observing run. Extracting astrophysical/cosmological information from these observations is a hierarchical Bayesian inference problem. GWPopulation is designed to provide simple-to-use, robust, and extensible tools for hierarchical inference in gravitational-wave astronomy/cosmology. It has been widely adopted for gravitational-wave astronomy, including producing flagship results for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. While designed to work with observations of compact binary coalescences, GWPopulation may be available to a wider range of hierarchical Bayesian inference problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the greatest debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for (ii) and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. The purity loss for a free quantum particle is evaluated and shown to be extremely inefficient for elementary particles but very effective for those at the Planck scale. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would easily leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a no-boundary proposal for a subregion of the universe. In the classical approximation, this density matrix involves finding a specific classical solution of the equations of motion with no boundary. Beyond the usual no boundary condition at early times, we also have another no boundary condition in the region we trace out. We can find the prescription by starting from the usual Hartle-Hawking proposal for the wavefunction on a full slice and tracing out the unobserved region in the classical approximation. We discuss some specific subregions and compute the corresponding solutions. These geometries lead to phenomenologically unacceptable probabilities, as expected.
  We also discuss how the usual Coleman de Luccia bubble solutions can be interpreted as a possible no boundary contribution to the density matrix of the universe. These geometries lead to local (but not global) maxima of the probability that are phenomenologically acceptable.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmological first-order phase transitions with precise hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational wave spectrum generated by sound waves during a cosmological phase transition, incorporating several advancements beyond the current state-of-the-art. Rather than relying on the bag model or similar approximations, we derive the equation of state directly from the effective potential. This approach enables us to accurately determine the hydrodynamic quantities, which serve as initial conditions in a generalised hybrid simulation. This simulation tracks the fluid evolution after bubble collisions, leading to the generation of gravitational waves. Our work is the first self-consistent numerical calculation of gravitational waves for the real singlet extension of the standard model. Our computational method is adaptable to any particle physics model, offering a fast and reliable way to calculate gravitational waves generated by sound waves. With fewer approximations, our approach provides a robust foundation for precise gravitational wave calculations and allows for the exploration of model-independent features of gravitational waves from phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of using gravitational wave (GW) signals from rotating core-collapse supernovae to probe the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter. By generating GW signals from simulations with various EOSs, we train machine learning models to classify them and evaluate their performance. Our study builds on previous work by examining how different machine learning models, parameters, and data preprocessing techniques impact classification accuracy. We test convolutional and recurrent neural networks, as well as six classical algorithms: random forest, support vector machines, naive Bayes, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and eXtreme gradient boosting. All models, except naive Bayes, achieve over 90 per cent accuracy on our dataset. Additionally, we assess the impact of approximating the GW signal using the general relativistic effective potential (GREP) on EOS classification. We find that models trained on GREP data exhibit low classification accuracy. However, normalizing time by the peak signal frequency, which partially compensates for the absence of the time dilation effect in GREP, leads to a notable improvement in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Kalman tracking and parameter estimation of continuous gravitational waves with a pulsar timing array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous nanohertz gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries may be detectable with pulsar timing arrays. A novel search strategy is developed, wherein intrinsic achromatic spin wandering is tracked simultaneously with the modulation induced by a single gravitational wave source in the pulse times of arrival. A two-step inference procedure is applied within a state-space framework, such that the modulation is tracked with a Kalman filter, which then provides a likelihood for nested sampling. The procedure estimates the static parameters in the problem, such as the sky position of the source, without fitting for ensemble-averaged statistics such as the power spectral density of the timing noise, and therefore complements traditional parameter estimation methods. It also returns the Bayes factor relating a model with a single gravitational wave source to one without, complementing traditional detection methods. It is shown via astrophysically representative software injections in Gaussian measurement noise that the procedure distinguishes a gravitational wave from pure noise down to a characteristic wave strain of $h_0 \approx 2 \times 10^{-15}$. Full posterior distributions of model parameters are recovered and tested for accuracy. There is a bias of $\approx 0.3$ rad in the marginalised one-dimensional posterior for the orbital inclination $\iota$, introduced by dropping the so-called `pulsar terms'. Smaller biases $\lesssim 10 \%$ are also observed in other static parameters.</description>

      <title>Rosen-Morse potential and gravitating kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in a special type of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity-scalar model, where both the dilaton and the scalar matter fields have noncanonical kinetic terms, it is possible to construct kink solutions whose linear perturbation equation is a Schr\"odinger-like equation with Rosen-Morse potential. For this potential, eigenvalues and wave functions of the bound states, if had any, can be derived by using the standard shape invariance procedure. Depending on the values of the parameters, the stability potential can be reflective or reflectionless. There can be an arbitrary number of shape modes, but the zero mode is always absent.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Corrections to Near-Extremal Black Hole Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on the quantum mechanics of near-extremal non-supersymmetric black holes has identified a characteristic $T^{3/2}$ scaling of the low temperature black hole partition function. This result has only been derived using the path integral in the near-horizon region and relies on many assumptions. We discuss how to derive the $T^{3/2}$ scaling for the near-extremal rotating BTZ black hole from a calculation in the full black hole background using the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev (DHS) formula, which expresses the 1-loop determinant of a thermal geometry in terms of a product over the quasinormal mode spectrum. We also derive the spectral measure for fields of any spin in Euclidean BTZ and use it to provide a new proof of the DHS formula and a new, direct derivation of the BTZ heat kernel. The computations suggest a path to proving the $T^{3/2}$ scaling for the asymptotically flat 4d Kerr black hole.</description>

      <title>Search for a Gravitational-Wave Background from Sound Speed Resonance from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) originating from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) with the sound speed resonance (SSR) effect using data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's first three observing runs. The SSR mechanism, characterized by an oscillating sound speed squared term, can induce a nonperturbative parametric amplification of specific perturbation modes during inflation, leading to enhanced primordial curvature perturbations and a significant SIGW signal. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the model parameters describing the SGWB spectrum from the SSR effect. Our results show no statistically significant evidence for the presence of such a signal in the current data. Consequently, we place an upper limit of $|\tau_0| \lesssim 5.9 \times 10^3$ s at $95\%$ confidence level on the start time of the oscillation in the SSR model. These results demonstrate the capability of current gravitational wave detectors to probe inflation models through the SSR mechanism and paves the way for future searches with improved sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Probing $\Lambda$CDM through the Weyl potential and machine learning forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For years, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and cold dark matter (CDM) model ($\Lambda\text{CDM}$) has stood as a cornerstone in modern cosmology and serves as the predominant theoretical framework for current and forthcoming surveys. However, the latest results shown by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), along other cosmological data, show hints in favor of an evolving dark energy. Given the elusive nature of dark energy and the imperative to circumvent model bias, we introduce a novel null test, derived from Noether's theorem, that uses measurements of the Weyl potential (the sum of the spatial and temporal distortion) at different redshifts. In order to assess the consistency of the concordance model we quantify the precision of this null test through the reconstruction of mock catalogs based on $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ using forthcoming survey data, employing Genetic Algorithms, a machine learning technique. Our analysis indicates that with forthcoming LSST-like and DESI-like mock data our consistency test will be able to rule out several cosmological models at around 4$\sigma$ and help to check for tensions in the data.</description>

      <title>A Phase Space Approach to the Conformal Construction of Non-Vacuum Initial Data Sets in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a uniform (and unambiguous) procedure for scaling the matter fields in implementing the conformal method to parameterize and construct solutions of Einstein constraint equations with coupled matter sources. The approach is based on a phase space representation of the space-time matter fields after a careful $n+1$ decomposition into spatial fields $B$ and conjugate momenta $\Pi_B$, which are specified directly and are conformally invariant quantities. We show that if the Einstein-matter field theory is specified by a Lagrangian which is diffeomorphism invariant and involves no dependence on derivatives of the space-time metric in the matter portion of the Lagrangian, then fixing $B$ and $\Pi_B$ results in conformal constraint equations that, for constant-mean curvature initial data, semi-decouple just as they do for the vacuum Einstein conformal constraint equations. We prove this result by establishing a structural property of the Einstein momentum constraint that is independent of the conformal method: For an Einstein-matter field theory which satisfies the conditions just stated, if $B$ and $\Pi_B$ satisfy the matter Euler-Lagrange equations, then (in suitable form) the right-hand side of the momentum constraint on each spatial slice depends only on $B$ and $\Pi_B$ and is independent of the space-time metric. We discuss the details of our construction in the special cases of the following models: Einstein-Maxwell-charged scalar field, Einstein-Proca, Einstein-perfect fluid, and Einstein-Maxwell-charged dust. In these examples we find that our technique gives a theoretical basis for scaling rules, such as those for electromagnetism, that have worked pragmatically in the past, but also generates new equations with advantageous features for perfect fluids that allow direct specification of total rest mass and total charge in any spatial region.</description>

      <title>GWFish: A simulation software to evaluate parameter-estimation capabilities of gravitational-wave detector networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important step in the planning of future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors and of the networks they will form is the estimation of their detection and parameter-estimation capabilities, which is the basis of science-case studies. Several future GW detectors have been proposed or are under development, which might also operate and observe in parallel. These detectors include terrestrial, lunar, and space-borne detectors. In this paper, we present GWFish, a new software to simulate GW detector networks and to calculate measurement uncertainties based on the Fisher-matrix approximation. GWFish models the impact of detector motion on PE and makes it possible to analyze multiband scenarios, i.e., observation of a GW signal by different detectors in different frequency bands. We showcase a few examples for the Einstein Telescope (ET) including the sky-localization of binary neutron stars, and ET's capability to measure the polarization of GWs.</description>

      <title>Probing general relativistic spin-orbit coupling with gravitational waves from hierarchical triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave packets propagating in inhomogeneous media experience a coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom and, as a consequence, follow spin-dependent trajectories. These phenomena, well known in optics and condensed matter physics, are referred to as spin Hall effects. Similarly, the gravitational spin Hall effect is expected to affect the propagation of gravitational waves on curved spacetimes. In this general-relativistic setup, the curvature of spacetime acts as impurities in a semiconductor or inhomogeneities in an optical medium, leading to a frequency- and polarization-dependent propagation of wave packets. In this letter, we study this effect for strong-field lensed gravitational waves generated in hierarchical triple black hole systems in which a stellar-mass binary merges near a more massive black hole. We calculate how the gravitational spin Hall effect modifies the gravitational waveforms and show its potential for experimental observation. If detected, these effects will have profound implications for astrophysics and tests of general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate new dyonic black holes of massive gravity sourced by generalized quasitopological electromagnetism in arbitrary dimensions. We begin by deriving the exact solution to the field equations defining these black holes and look at how graviton's mass, dimensionality parameter, and quasitopological electromagnetic field affect the horizon structure of anti-de Sitter dyonic black holes. We also explore the asymptotic behaviour of the curvature invariants at both the origin and infinity to analyze the geometric structure of the resultant black holes. We also compute the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of these dyonic black holes with the help of established techniques and known formulas. After investigating the relevancy of first law, we look at how various parameters influence the local thermodynamic stability of resultant black hole solution. We also examine how thermal fluctuations affect the local stability of dyonic black holes in massive gravity. Finally, we study the shadow cast of the black hole.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the universe's expansion in $ f(R, L_{m}) $ gravity for a particular form of $ f(R, L_{m})=\frac{R}{2}+L_{m}^{n}$. The field equations for flat FLRW metric with matter Lagrangian $ L_{m}=\rho$ are derive. Hubble parameter in terms of red-shift$(z)$ are derived using the linear form of Equation of State (EoS) parameter $ \omega=w_{0}+w_{1}z $. By using Bayesian statistical techniques based on $ \chi^{2}$-minimization technique, we have obtained the best fit values of the model parameters of this model for cosmic chronometer and supernovae Pantheon datasets. The evolution of the equation of state parameter$(\omega)$, energy density $ (\rho) $, pressure $\mathit{(p)}$ cosmographic parameters, and the impact of the energy conditions with best-fit values of the model parameters are all thoroughly examined. We have also analyze Om diagnostic's behavior and determine the present age of universe for this model.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the subsolar-mass black hole candidate SSM200308 from the second part of the third observing run of Advanced LIGO-Virgo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A follow-up of a subsolar black hole candidate identified in the second part of the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration is carried out. With a search signal-to-noise ratio of $8.90$ and a false-alarm rate of 1 per 5 years, close to the usual thresholds for claiming a gravitational-wave event, we cannot exclude a noise origin. A complete Bayesian parameter estimation of this candidate, denoted SSM200308, reveals that if the signal originates from a compact binary coalescence, the component masses are $m_1= 0.62^{+0.46}_{-0.20} M_{\odot}$ and $m_2 = 0.27^{+0.12}_{-0.10} M_{\odot}$ (90% credible intervals) with at least one component being firmly subsolar, below the minimum mass of a neutron star. This discards the hypothesis that the signal comes from a standard binary neutron star. The signal coherence test between the two LIGO detectors brings support to a compact object coalescence origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the time evolution of matter-gravity coupling can provide a natural explanation to the apparent Hubble tension, since it induces a modification of the Friedman equation with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the low redshift variation of the coupling can can affect the distance of the anchors used to calibrate supernovae (SNe), while higher redshift observations are not affected. The effects of a time varying gravity coupling only manifest on sufficiently long time scales, such as in cosmological observations at different redshifts, and if ignored lead to apparent tensions in the values of cosmological parameters estimated with observations from different epochs of the Universe history.</description>

      <title>General geometry realized by four-scalar model and application to $f(Q)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a model including four scalar fields coupled with general gravity theories, which is a generalization of the two-scalar model proposed in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{103} (2021) no.4, 044055, where it has been shown that any given spherically symmetric static/time-dependent spacetime can be realized by using the two-scalar model. We show that by using the four-scalar model, we can construct a model that realizes any given spacetime as a solution even if the spacetime does not have a spherical symmetry or any other symmetry. We also show that by imposing constraints on the scalar fields by using the Lagrange multiplier fields, the scalar fields become non-dynamical and they do not propagate. This tells that there does not appear any sound which is usually generated by the density fluctuation of the fluid. In this sense, the model with the constraints is a most general extension of the mimetic theory in JHEP \textbf{11} (2013), 135, where there appears an effective dark matter. The dark matter is non-dynamical and it does not collapse even under gravitational force. Our model can be regarded as a general extension of any kind of fluid besides dark matter. We may consider the case that the potential of the scalar fields vanishes and the model becomes a non-linear $\sigma$ model. Then our formulation gives a mapping from the geometry of the spacetime to the geometry of the target space of the non-linear $\sigma$ model via gravity theory although the physical meaning has not been clear. We also consider the application of the model to $f(Q)$ gravity theory, which is based on a non-metricity tensor and $Q$ is a scalar quantity constructed from the non-metricity tensor. ...</description>

Abstract: A novel theory was proposed earlier to model systems with thermal gradients, based on the postulate that the spatial and temporal variation in temperature can be recast as a variation in the metric. Combining the variation in the metric due to the thermal variations and gravity, leads to the concept of thermal gravity in a 5-D space-time-temperature setting. When the 5-D Einstein field equations are projected to a 4-D space, they result in additional terms in the field equations. This may lead to unique phenomena such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar particles in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This theory, originally conceived in a quantum mechanical framework, is now adapted to explain the galaxy rotation curves. A galaxy is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. A parameter called the "degree of thermalization" is introduced to model partially thermalized systems. The generalization of thermal gravity to partially thermalized systems, leads to the theory of many-body gravity. The theory of many-body gravity is now shown to be able to explain the rotation curves of the Milky Way and the M31 (Andromeda) galaxies, to a fair extent. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for 63 galaxies, with their galactic masses spanning three orders of magnitude, has been replicated. Finally, the wide binary star (WBS) system is touched upon.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the existence of nontensorial gravitational-wave polarizations from individual supermassive black hole binaries with pulsar timing arrays</title>

Abstract: With the strong evidence for a gravitational wave (GW) background in the nanohertz frequency band from pulsar timing arrays, the detection of continuous GWs from individual supermassive black hole binaries is already at the dawn. Utilizing continuous GWs to test theories of gravity, especially to test the polarizations of GWs is becoming more and more realistic. In this theoretical study, assuming a detection of signals from individual supermassive binary black holes, we use the null stream to estimate the capability of identifying the nontensorial polarizations of GWs. We consider cases for the nontensorial polarizations where the dipole radiation and quadrupole radiation dominate separately. With a frequentist method, we estimate the threshold of the nontensor-to-tensor relative amplitude above which extra polarizations can be detected. We also conduct Bayesian analysis to estimate parameters with the null stream data. Our treatment provides a data-analysis methodology using the null stream to probe the nontensorial GW polarizations with pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Love-C relations for elastic hybrid stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory to study matter under extreme densities. Recent observations from gravitational and electromagnetic waves have enabled constraints on NS properties, such as tidal deformability (related to the tidal Love number) and stellar compactness. Although each of these two NS observables depends strongly on the stellar internal structure, the relation between them (called the Love-C relation) is known to be equation-of-state insensitive. In this study, we investigate the effects of a possible crystalline phase in the core of hybrid stars (HSs) on the mass-radius and Love-C relations, where HSs are a subclass of NS models with a quark matter core and a nuclear matter envelope with a sharp phase transition in between. We find that both the maximum mass and the corresponding radius increase as one increases the stiffness of the quark matter core controlled by the speed of sound, while the density discontinuity at the nuclear-quark matter transition effectively softens the equations of state. Deviations of the Love-C relation for elastic HSs from that of fluid NSs become more pronounced with a larger shear modulus, lower transition pressure, and larger density gap and can be as large as 60%. These findings suggest a potential method for testing the existence of distinct phases within HSs, though deviations are not large enough to be detected with current measurements of the tidal deformability and compactness.</description>

      <title>Using the shadow of a black hole to examine the energy exchange between axion matter and a rotating black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that a \textit{slowly} rotating axion-modified black hole resulting from the backreaction of an axion field on a rotating Kerr black hole can have a \textit{D-shaped} shadow as that for a \textit{highly} counter-rotating Kerr black hole. This attributes to the fact that the energy exchange between the axion matter and the black hole influences the rotation of the black hole, so the black hole angular momentum first decreases to zero and then the black hole starts to rotate to the opposite direction. Further increasing the coupling leads to \textit{``human-face-like" shaped} shadows and new lensing due to the chaotic scattering, which are novel and drastically different from Kerr black hole. Our analysis provides the first counterexample to that slowly rotating black hole has nearly circular shadow.</description>

      <title>The Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect in inflationary cosmological perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simplest model of inflation is based around an inflaton field that starts in a coherent false vacuum state with a positive cosmological constant, rolls slowly to the true vacuum and relaxes to it via reheating. We examine whether the scale of the transition from coherence to chaoticity can be examined via the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, in parallel with analogous problems of heavy ion physics (the ``pion laser'' and the thermalizing glasma).
  We develop an ansatz which contains a definition of ''chaoticity'' which parallels that of the usual setups where HBT is used.
  However, we also discuss the differences between the inflationary setup and more mainstream uses of HBT and conclude that these are more significant than the similarities, making the use of the developed methodology uncertain.</description>

      <title>Shadow and quasinormal modes of the rotating Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black holes</title>

Abstract: The Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) black hole model is an extension of classical black hole solutions in general relativity, incorporating quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects via the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. The Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian describes the nonlinear corrections to Maxwell's equations due to virtual electron-positron pair production in a strong electromagnetic field. When this Lagrangian is coupled with Einstein's field equations, it leads to modified black hole solutions that take into account these quantum corrections. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the screening parameter, acting as an effective dielectric constant endowed in a vacuum due to such QED effects, on the properties of the rotating and electrically charged Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black holes (EEH). To this aim, we analyzed and discussed findings as to how the screening parameter, affects certain black hole properties such as null regions, shadow cast and its observables, and quasinormal modes (QNMs) relative to the Kerr and Kerr-Newman cases. We find that the presence of a screened charge due to the associated QED effects in this screened Maxwell theory might noticeably alter the properties of black holes, offering insights into the interplay between gravity and quantum field effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization holonomy is analytically determined for a class of closed, spherical trajectories of light transiting a black hole in the Kerr metric. The leading order geometric optics approximation admits a closed-form expression of such paths, and sets of source/receiver locations are quantified for a spectrum of black hole angular momenta. A conserved, conformal Yano-Killing scalar is then exploited to determine the evolving polarization. Polarization holonomy, the angle between outgoing and incoming polarizations, is quantified for the spectrum of admissible direct and retrograde trajectories. This offers a means of experimentally measuring Gravitational Faraday Rotation from a single, stationary position.</description>

      <title>Teukolsky equation for near-extremal black holes beyond general relativity: near-horizon analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations on the near-horizon region of extremal and near-extremal rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein gravity. We find a decoupled modified Teukolsky equation that rules the gravitational perturbations and that separates into an angular and a radial equation. The angular equation leads to a deformation of the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, while the radial equation takes the same form as in Kerr except for a modification of the angular separation constants. We provide a detailed analysis of the corrections to these angular separation constants and find analytic results for axisymmetric modes as well as in the eikonal limit. As an application, we reproduce recent results that show that extremal Kerr black holes in higher-derivative gravity become singular under certain deformations and extend them by including parity-breaking corrections, which we show lead to the same effect. Finally, we obtain constraints on the form of the full modified Teukolsky radial equation by demanding that it has the right near-horizon limit. These results serve as an stepping stone towards the study of quasinormal modes of near-extremal black holes in higher-derivative extensions of GR.</description>

      <title>You shall not pass! -- explicit diffeomorphism violation "no-go" constraints and discontinuities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper collects several results in the study of the explicit symmetry-breaking limit of the effective-field theory (EFT) description of diffeomorphism and local Lorentz-symmetry breaking, where we generalize a subset of the EFT framework (the ``minimal" sector). It is well known that no-go constraints may arise in cases of explicit symmetry-breaking in curved spacetime as a consequence of the Bianchi identities; we show in this work that certain terms in the action can be countenanced and used to cancel would-be no-go constraints, at least in the linearized gravity limit. Nonetheless, we go on to find more potential issues, and we show that one particular explicit breaking subset of the EFT, while evading direct no-go constraints, results in a discontinuity - unsuppressed additional polarizations for gravitational waves. In a general treatment of the explicit breaking EFT, but confined to linearized gravity, we explicitly show the existence of an extra degree of freedom, independent of coordinates. We find extra polarizations of gravitational waves in the solutions, with a scalar mode unsuppressed by any coefficient, which could render these cases ruled out by observations.</description>

      <title>Bosonic and fermionic coherence of N-partite states in the background of a dilaton black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the N-partite coherences of GHZ and W states for free bosonic and fermionic fields when any n observers hover near the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. We derive the more general analytical expressions for N-partite coherence, encompassing both physically accessible and inaccessible coherences in the context of the dilaton black hole. It has been found that the coherence of the bosonic field is greater than that of the fermionic field, while the entanglement of the fermionic field is greater than that of the bosonic field in dilaton spacetime. Additionally, the coherence of the W state is greater than that of the GHZ state, whereas the entanglement of the GHZ state is greater than that of the W state in curved spacetime. These results suggest that we should utilize suitable quantum resources and different types of particles for relativistic quantum information tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the longstanding issue of general covariance in effective models of quantum gravity, which arises when canonical quantum gravity leads to a semiclassical model described by an effective Hamiltonian constraint. In spherically symmetric models, the concept of general covariance is formulated into precise equations. Applying the minimal requirements proposed to ensure general covariance, we derive the equations for the effective Hamiltonian constraint with the aid of imposing demands on Dirac observables. The equations yield two candidates for effective Hamiltonian constraints dependent on a quantum parameter. The resulting quantum modified black hole spacetimes are analyzed, and they overcome the limitations seen in similar spacetimes from previous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stationary rotating cylindrically symmetric dust spacetimes. We first show that the Maitra spacetime is the unique non-rigidly (non null shear scalar) rotating solution with a regular axis and that is the most general one of the field equations. We are also able to demonstrate what Maitra's paper does not show, where the solution is merely stated without any demonstration. Then we find that the non-rigidly rotating spacetimes, not necessarily regular, can be matched, across timelike cylindrical hypersurfaces, to a one-parameter family of stationary vacuum exteriors given by the Weyl class but not to the Lewis class, generalizing a result by Bonnor and Steidman. Among other properties, it is shown that the amount of rotating dust packed inside a cylinder is bigger if it is rigidly rotating than non-rigidly rotating. Finally, we show that in the non-rigidly rotating cases the fluid necessarily has vorticity and the spacetimes are not silent, where the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor is non-zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Revisiting Einstein's gravitational theory, we build a five-dimensional braneworld. Within this framework, one announces the appearance of symmetric and asymmetric domain walls. Furthermore, it examines the emergent four-dimensional gravity from a theory with non-canonical dynamics. Exploring the physical and mathematical aspects, e.g., brane's energy density and the Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum, one verifies that brane splitting is absent in the canonical and non-canonical theories. Additionally, we note the localization of the four-dimensional fluctuation projection on the 3-branes, which ensures the theory's stability. Thereby, one can conclude that the behavior of gravitational perturbations of the domain wall maintains a profile similar to a stable and non-localizable tower of massive modes. In contrast, within the brane core, the matter sector generates new barriers and potential wells, resulting in massive modes with approximately symmetric amplitudes. However, the non-canonical dynamics generate massive modes with asymmetric amplitudes far from the 3-brane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is not easy to treat the spacetime with horizon(s) in the standard mimetic gravity. The solution to this problem has been presented in Phys.~Lett.~B 830 (2022), 137140, where it was suggested to modify the Lagrange multiplier constraint.
  In this paper, by using the improved formulation, we investigate the cosmology and black holes in mimetic gravity with scalar potential and in the scalar mimetic $F(R)$ gravity. The inflationary era and dark energy epoch for the above theories are presented as specific examples from the general reconstruction scheme which permits to realise any universe expansion history via the choice of the corresponding scalar potential or function $F(R)$. Two black hole solutions including the Schwarzschild and Hayward ones are constructed. The shadow and the radius of the photon sphere for the above black holes are found. The explicit confrontation of the black hole shadow radius with the observational bounds from M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$ objects is done. It is demonstrated that they do not conflict with Event Horizon Telescope observations.</description>

      <title>On the KG-constrained general disformal transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although with great successes in explaining phenomena and natural behaviour involving the Universe or a part thereof, the General Theory of Relativity is far from a complete theory. Focusing on its extension within the framework of scalar tensor theory, we investigate the transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action under the general disformal transformation coupled with a set of triple KG constraints. The idea is that the general disformal transformation leads to an extremely complicated action necessitating a set of constraints to tame the resulting form. Motivated by previous studies on the invertibility and invariance of the massless Klein-Gordon equation under the general disformal transformation, we identify three constraints that significantly simplifies the transformed Einstein-Hilbert action. In four spacetime dimensions, we find that the transformed action is a sum of the original action and a disformal contribution involving a six-term Lagrangian that includes the Ricci tensor coupled to a sum of derivatives of scalar fields and kinetic terms. In three spacetime dimensions, the disformal contribution becomes a five-term Lagrangian. Lastly, in two spacetime dimensions, the Einstein-Hilbert action is invariant under the constrained disformal transformation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze a thin disk around the distorted Kerr black hole (DKB) within the framework of general relativity using an axisymmetric solution of the Einstein equations. We consider this accretion disk around the Kerr black hole in an external gravitational field up to the quadrupole moment and discuss the key aspects of black hole accretion disk theory. Our findings indicate that the presence of a quadrupole moment significantly influences the radiation emitted from the accretion disk. While the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) remains largely unchanged, the magnitude of the radiation flux, as well as the shape, orientation, and energy distribution of the accretion disk, are affected. The direction of distortion of the event horizon determines whether the disk becomes more oblate or prolate, impacting observed variations in maximum height, position, and temperature. Furthermore, the quadrupole moment alters the geometry of the black hole's spacetime, which can influence the efficiency of energy extraction from the black hole's spin, an important factor in powering emissions from accretion disks. We obtain dynamical quantities around a distorted rotating black hole disk. Additionally, we examine how rotation influences the dynamics of the DKB. We also investigate the effects of varying the viscosity coefficient on the behavior of the DKB.</description>

Abstract: The light rays trajectories in Kerr metric, resulting from Fermat's principle, are considered from the point of view of integrable systems. It is shown how the counterpart of Carter constant emerges as a result of coupling-constant metamorphosis. The latter provides a convenient method of describing the null geodesics in Kerr metric.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlating dark sirens and galaxies: constraints on $H_0$ from GWTC-3 of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the cross-correlation technique to infer the Hubble constant ($H_0$) of the Universe using gravitational wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts (dark sirens) from the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) and the photometric galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISE-SuperCOSMOS, and combine these with the bright siren measurement of $H_0$ from GW170817. The posterior on $H_0$ with only dark sirens is uninformative due to the small number of well-localised GW sources. Using the eight well-localized dark sirens and the binary neutron star GW170817 with EM counterpart, we obtain a value of the Hubble constant $H_0= 75.4_{-6}^{+11}$ km/s/Mpc (median and 68.3$\%$ equal-tailed interval (ETI)) after marginalizing over the matter density and the GW bias parameters. This measurement is mostly driven by the bright siren measurement and any constraint from dark sirens is not statistically significant. In the future, with more well-localized GW events, the constraints on expansion history will improve.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Dilaton Weyl Multiplet of 4D, ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ Conformal Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new dilaton Weyl multiplet of ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ conformal supergravity in four dimensions. This is constructed by reinterpreting the equations of motion of an on-shell hypermultiplet as constraints that render some of the fields of the standard Weyl multiplet composite. The independent bosonic components include four scalar fields and a triplet of gauge two-forms. The resulting, so-called, hyper-dilaton Weyl multiplet defines a $24+24$ off-shell representation of the local ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ superconformal algebra. By coupling the hyper-dilaton Weyl multiplet to an off-shell vector multiplet compensator, we obtain one of the two minimal $32+32$ off-shell multiplets of ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ Poincar\'e supergravity constructed by M\"uller in 1986. On-shell, this contains the minimal ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ Poincar\'e supergravity multiplet together with a hypermultiplet where one of its physical scalars plays the role of a dilaton, while its three other scalars are dualised to a triplet of real gauge two-forms. Interestingly, a $BF$-coupling induces a scalar potential for the dilaton without a standard gauging.</description>

      <title>A test of MOND and Emergent Gravity with SMACS J0723.3-7327 using eROSITA observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a test of MOND and Verlinde's Emergent Gravity using the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723-7327, which has been recently imaged using the eROSITA X-ray telescope as well as with JWST. We test MOND using two independent methods. The first method involves comparing the dynamical MOND mass and baryonic mass, while the second method entails a comparison of the MOND-estimated temperature with the observed temperature. We then compare the unseen mass predicted by Emergent Gravity with the estimated dark matter mass. We find that MOND shows a mass discrepancy in the central regions at high significance levels. The observed temperature profile is in marginal disagreement with that in the MOND paradigm. However, the Emergent Gravity Theory agrees in accurately accounting for the dynamical mass in the inner regions within $1\sigma$. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the earlier tests on other clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for subsolar mass primordial black holes (PBHs) poses a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, extended signal duration, and computational cost demands, compared to solar mass binary black hole events. In this paper, we explore the possibility of investigating the mass range between subsolar and planetary masses, which is not accessible using standard matched filtering and continuous wave searches. We propose a systematic approach employing the Viterbi algorithm, a dynamic programming algorithm that identifies the most likely sequence of hidden Markov states given a sequence of observations, to detect signals from small mass PBH binaries. We formulate the methodology, provide the optimal length for short-time Fourier transforms, and estimate sensitivity. Subsequently, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Viterbi algorithm in identifying signals within mock data containing Gaussian noise. Our approach offers the primary advantage of being agnostic and computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>Universal relations for anisotropic interacting quark stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting quark stars, which are entirely composed of interacting quark matter including perturbative QCD corrections and color superconductivity, can meet constraints from various pulsar observations. In realistic scenarios, pressure anisotropies are expected in the star's interior. Recently, the stellar structural properties of anisotropic interacting quark stars have been investigated. In this study, we further explore the universal relations (URs) related to the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability $\Lambda$, compactness $C$, and the $f$-mode nonradial pulsation frequency for such stars. Our results reveal that these approximate URs generally hold, being insensitive to both the EOS variations as well as to the presence of anisotropy. In contrast to previous studies on anisotropic neutron stars, we find that more positive anisotropy tends to enhance the $I-\Lambda$ and $I-C$ URs, but weakens the $C-\Lambda$ UR. For all the URs involving $f$-mode frequency, we find that they are enhanced by the inclusion of anisotropy (whether positive or negative). Utilizing these URs and the tidal deformability constraint from the GW170817 event, we put limits on the structural properties of isotropic and anisotropic quark stars, such as the moment of inertia $I_{1.4}$, the canonical radius $R_{1.4}$ and the canonical $f$-mode frequency $f_{f,1.4}$, all of which are very different compared to those of neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We propose a candidate Compton amplitude which is valid for any (integer) quantum spin and free from any spurious poles. We consider the cases of electromagnetism and gravity. We obtain such amplitudes by calculating the corresponding ones from superstring theory involving states on the leading Regge trajectory. To extract the associated field-theory amplitudes a few considerations in the form of simple physical constraints are required, such as: Soft momentum transfer, compactification of polarizations and consistent factorization in the physical channels. We believe the present exploration will be significantly relevant for the physics of compact binary systems with spin.</description>

      <title>Quantum focusing conjecture in two-dimensional evaporating black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum focusing conjecture (QFC) for two-dimensional evaporating black holes. The QFC is closely related to the behavior of the generalized entropy -- the sum of the area entropy for a given co-dimension two surface and the entanglement entropy for quantum fields outside the area. In the context of the black hole evaporation, the entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation is decreasing after the Page time, and therefore it is not obvious whether the QFC holds in the black hole evaporation process especially after the Page time. One of the present authors previously addressed this problem in a four-dimensional spherically symmetric dynamical black hole model and showed that the QFC is satisfied. However the background spacetime considered was approximated by the Vaidya metric, and quantum effects of matters in the semiclassical regime is not fully taken into consideration. It remains to be seen if the QFC in fact holds for exact solutions of the semiclassical Einstein equations. In this paper, we address this problem in a two-dimensional dynamical black hole of the Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius (RST) model, which allows us to solve the semiclassical equations of motion exactly. We first give a suitable definition of the quantum expansion in two-dimensions and then prove that the QFC is satisfied for evaporating black holes in the RST model with the island formation taken into account.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are a common prediction in many grand unified theories and a promising source of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In this paper, we point out that the GW signal from cosmic strings produced at a comparatively low energy scale, $v \lesssim 10^9 \textrm{GeV}$, exhibits several novel features that are not present in the case of high-scale cosmic strings. Our findings notably include (i) a sharp cutoff frequency $f_{\rm cut}$ in the GW spectrum from the fundamental oscillation mode on closed string loops and (ii) an oscillating pattern in the total GW spectrum from all oscillation modes whose local minima are located at integer multiples of $f_{\rm cut}$. These features reflect the fact that string loops produced in the early Universe fail to shrink to zero size because of GW emission within the age of the Universe, if their tension is low enough. In addition, they offer an exciting opportunity to directly probe the discrete spectrum of oscillation modes on closed string loops in GW observations. For strings produced at a scale $v \sim 10^9\textrm{GeV}$, the novel features in the GW spectrum are within the sensitivity reach of future experiments such as BBO and DECIGO.</description>

      <title>The impact of a primordial gravitational wave background on LISA resolvable sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is a common prediction in various models of the early Universe. Despite constraints at different frequency ranges and claims of detection in the nHz range by Pulsar Timing Arrays, the amplitude and spectral dependence of the SGWB in the mHz range remain largely unknown. Plausible models of early Universe Physics predict a wide range of SGWB amplitudes, from undetectable to exceeding the constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. This paper explores the potential impact of a prominent primordial SGWB on LISA's main scientific targets. Our main analyses focuses on Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs). By employing publicly available MBHB population models and state-of-the-art LISA's forecasting pipeline, we analyze the effects of the SGWB on MBHB detections. We find that the decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio induced by a strong primordial GWB can significantly reduce the number of detectable events, compromise the precision of constraints, and even hinder sky localization for some events. We also examine the impact of the SGWB on Stellar Origin Black Hole Binaries (SOBHBs) and Galactic Binaries (GBs), which are fainter sources than MBHBs. Depending on the spectral properties of the SGWB, we conclude that these sources could be either marginally affected or rendered completely undetectable. This largely unexplored aspect raises critical questions about the potential challenges posed by a prominent SGWB to LISA's astrophysical objectives, including MBHBs, SOBHBs, and GBs.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantum field theory of tachyons is unphysical</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tachyons have fascinated generations of physicists due to their peculiar behavior, but they did not solve any real physical problem. This changed with the recent work of Dragan and Ekert, who have shown that superluminal observers may be related to the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM), since they require introducing non-determinism and wave-like behavior at the fundamental level. In fact, both classical and quantum field theory of tachyons have been constructed. Unfortunately, we will show that the latter theory contains several flaws, mostly caused by adapting incorrect results due to other authors, which puts the aforementioned program in question. In particular, unlike Feinberg, we show that tachyon microcausality violation spoils fundamental features of QFT such as statistical independence of distant measurements, and it negatively affects constructing Lorentz invariant scattering theory of tachyons. Moreover, the Feynman propagator, which was adapted from Dhar and Sudarshan, is shown to violate unitarity, the tachyonic vacuum is unstable due to radiatively generated tachyon self-interactions, and an interpolating tachyon field likely does not satisfy the LSZ asymptotic condition. Our analysis indicates that a covariant QFT of tachyons seems impossible, hence superluminal observers are unphysical and cannot be used to derive QM.</description>

      <title>Witnessing mass-energy equivalence with trapped atom interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimental setup to probe the interplay between the quantum superposition principle and the gravitational time dilation arising from the mass-energy equivalence. It capitalizes on state-of-the-art atom interferometers that can keep atoms trapped in a superposition of heights in Earth's gravitational field for exceedingly long times reaching minute-scale. Our proposal consists of adding two additional laser pulses to the existing setups that would set up a clock trapped at a superposition of heights reading a quantum superposition of relativistic proper times. We develop a method to include relativistic corrections to Bloch oscillations which describe the trapped part of the interferometer. As a result, we derive all the trajectories arising in this setup, the phases acquired by different trajectories in the interferometer, and demonstrate that the effect of superposition of proper times would manifest itself in the interference pattern in two distinct ways: as visibility modulations, and as a shift of the resonant frequency of the atom. We argue that the latter might be observable with current technology.</description>

      <title>Combining pre- and post-recombination new physics to address cosmological tensions: case study with varying electron mass and sign-switching cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that the Hubble tension may call for a combination of both pre- and post-recombination new physics. Motivated by these considerations, we provide one of the first concrete case studies aimed at constructing such a viable combination. We consider models that have individually worked best on either end of recombination so far: a spatially uniform time-varying electron mass leading to earlier recombination (also adding non-zero spatial curvature), and a sign-switching cosmological constant inducing an AdS-to-dS transition within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model. When confronted against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Type Ia Supernovae data, we show that no combination of these ingredients can successfully solve the Hubble tension. We find that the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ plays a critical role, driving important physical scales in opposite directions: the AdS-to-dS transition requires a larger $\Omega_m$ to maintain the CMB acoustic scale fixed, whereas the varying electron mass requires a smaller $\Omega_m$ to maintain the redshift of matter-radiation equality fixed. Despite the overall failure, we use our results to draw general model-building lessons, highlighting the importance of assessing tension-solving directions in the parameter space of new physics parameters and how these correlate with shifts in other standard parameters, while underscoring the crucial role of $\Omega_m$ in this sense.</description>

By considering the changes in the cosmological constant and Newton's constant, the gravitational thermodynamics of AdS black holes can be extended. This corresponds to including the central charge $C$ and its chemical potential $\mu$ to the conventional pairs of temperature vs. entropy $(T, S)$, electric potential vs. charge $(\tilde{\Phi},\tilde{Q})$, and field theory pressure vs. volume $(p,\mathcal{V})$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables in the dual CFT. Here we have dived further and taken a dyonic system. So the conventional pairs for potential and charges become electric potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_e)$ and magnetic potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_m)$. In all the 16 ensembles that we examined, we found that only some have interesting phase behavior. For ensembles $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, C )$ and $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we notice a first and second order phase transition. For the ensemble $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{\Phi}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we see a confined/deconfined phase transition. At a temperature that depends on $\mu$, we discover a zeroth-order phase transition between a high- and low-entropy phase in the fixed $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$. Since in our study of the parametric plots, the fixed eight $p$ ensembles exhibit no critical behavior, or $p-\mathcal{V}$ criticality, the CFT state dual to a classical charged black hole cannot be a Van der Waals fluid.</description>

      <title>Robustness of neutron star merger simulations to changes in neutrino transport and neutrino-matter interactions</title>

Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers play an important role in nuclear astrophysics: their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals carry information about the equation of state of cold matter above nuclear saturation density, and they may be one of the main sources of r-process elements in the Universe. Neutrino-matter interactions during and after merger impact the properties of these electromagnetic signals, and the relative abundances of the produced r-process elements. Existing merger simulations are however limited in their ability to realistically model neutrino transport and neutrino-matter interactions. Here, we perform a comparison of the impact of the use of state-of-the art two-moment or Monte-Carlo transport schemes on the outcome of merger simulations, for a single binary neutron star system with a short-lived neutron star remnant ($(5-10)\,{\rm ms}$). We also investigate the use of different reaction rates in the simulations. While the best transport schemes generally agree well on the qualitative impact of neutrinos on the system, differences in the behavior of the high-density regions can significantly impact the collapse time and the properties of the hot tidal arms in this metastable merger remnant. The chosen interaction rates, transport algorithm, as well as recent improvements by Radice et al to the two-moment algorithms can all contribute to changes at the $(10-30)\%$ level in the global properties of the merger remnant and outflows. The limitations of previous moment schemes fixed by Radice et al also appear sufficient to explain the large difference that we observed in the production of heavy-lepton neutrinos in a previous comparison of Monte-Carlo and moment schemes in the context of a low mass binary neutron star system.</description>

      <title>Poincare Invariance in Discrete Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07536</link>

Abstract: A formulation of discrete gravity was recently proposed based on defining a lattice and a shift operator connecting the cells. Spinors on such a space will have rotational SO(d) invariance which is taken as the fundamental symmetry. Inspired by lattice QCD, discrete analogues of curvature and torsion were defined that go smoothly to the corresponding tensors in the continuous limit. In this paper, we show that the absence of diffeomorphism invariance could be replaced by requiring translational invariance in the tangent space by enlarging the tangent space from SO(d) to the inhomogeneous Lorentz group ISO(d) to include translations. We obtain the ISO(d) symmetry by taking instead the Lie group SO(d + 1) and perform on it Inonu-Wigner contraction. We show that, just as for continuous spaces, the zero torsion constraint converts the translational parameter to a diffeomorphism parameter, thus explaining the effectiveness of this formulation.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>

Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>
