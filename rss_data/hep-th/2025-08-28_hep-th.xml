      <title>On a non-geometric approach to noncommutative gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize the non-geometrical construction of gauge theories, due to S. Deser, to a noncommutative setting. We show that in a free theory, along with the usual local N\"{o}ther current, there is another conserved current, which is non-local. Using the latter as a source for self-interaction, after a well-defined consistency procedure, we arrive at noncommutative gauge theories. In the non-abelian case, the standard restriction, namely that the theory should be $U(N)$ in the fundamental representation, emerges as a consequence of the requirement that the non-local current be Lie algebra valued.</description>

      <title>Contact 4d Chern-Simons theory: Generalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine and generalize the results of e-Print: 2307.10428 [hep-th], where evidence in favor of applying the non-Abelian localization method to handle the 4d Chern-Simons theory path integral formulation was presented. We show, via duality manipulations and invoking some symplectic geometry results, both inspired by the Beasley-Witten work e-Print: 0503126 [hep-th], that the path integral of a regularized version of the 4d Chern-Simons theory, formally takes the canonical symplectic form required by the method of non-Abelian localization. The new theory is defined on a deformed quotient space and interpolates between the conventional 3d Chern-Simons theory on a Seifert manifold M e-Print: 0503126 [hep-th], trivially embedded into $\mathbb{R}\times \text{M}$, and the Costello-Yamazaki e-Print: 1908.02289 [hep-th] 4d Chern-Simons theory defined on the same 4d manifold. It is also shown that the regularized theory is consistent, following an idea of Beasley e-Print: 0911.2687 [hep-th], with the insertion of coadjoint orbit defects of the 1d Chern-Simons theory type. This approach opens the possibility for using exact path integral methods to explore the quantum integrable structure of certain 2d integrable sigma models of the non-ultralocal type, which are widely known to be somehow immune to the use of more traditional quantization methods, like the algebraic Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian after a local quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the entanglement Hamiltonian in a system of one-dimensional free fermions, following a local joining quench of two initially disconnected half-chains in their ground states. Applying techniques of conformal field theory, we obtain a local expression where the left- and right-moving components of the energy density are associated with different weight functions. The results are then compared to numerical calculations for the hopping chain, which requires to consider a proper continuum limit of the lattice entanglement Hamiltonian, obtaining a good agreement with the field-theory prediction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos, Thermalization, and Non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we numerically investigate whether quantum thermalization occurs during the time evolution induced by a non-local Hamiltonian whose spectra exhibit integrability. This non-local and integrable Hamiltonian is constructed by combining two types of integrable Hamiltonians. From the time dependence of entanglement entropy and mutual information, we find that non-locality can evolve the system into the typical state. On the other hand, the time dependence of logarithmic negativity shows that the non-locality can destroy the quantum correlation. These findings suggest that the quantum thermalization induced by the non-local Hamiltonian does not require the quantum chaoticity of the system.</description>

      <title>The pure spinor superparticle and 10D super-Yang-Mills amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a prescription for computing tree-level scattering amplitudes in 10D super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory using the pure spinor worldline formalism. The pure spinor formalism has proven to be a powerful framework for studying supersymmetric field theories, providing manifestly covariant and BRST-invariant formulations of amplitudes. By incorporating the worldline approach, we construct a first-quantized representation of SYM amplitudes in 10D, where interactions are encoded through the insertion of vertex operators along the particle's trajectory. We explicitly compute the N-point function, demonstrating an agreement with the limit $\alpha' \to 0$ of open superstring amplitudes and confirming that the kinematic numerators satisfy the expected BRST relations. Our results establish the pure spinor worldline formalism as a tool for studying scattering amplitudes and suggest further applications to 11D supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a quantization of the Yang--Mills theory with an internal symmetry group $SO(1,n)$ treated as a unified theory of all interactions. In one-loop calculations, we show that Einstein gravity can be considered as an approximation to gauge theory. We discuss the role of the Chern-Simons wave functions in the quantization.</description>

      <title>The 11D pure spinor ghost number zero vertex operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 11D pure spinor worldline has been proved to successfully describe the physical states of 11D supergravity in a manifestly super-Poincar\'e covariant fashion. Within this framework, the computation of scattering amplitudes requires the existence of vertex operators carrying different ghost numbers. A recent no-go theorem demonstrated the impossibility of constructing a ghost number zero vertex operator consistent with 11D supergravity in the minimal pure spinor formalism. In this letter, we overcome this obstruction by working in the non-minimal formulation of the 11D pure spinor superparticle. We construct, for the first time, a ghost number zero vertex operator with a remarkably compact structure when expressed in terms of physical operators. We further verify that it satisfies the expected descent relation with the ghost number one vertex operator, and that its commutator with the ghost number three single-particle vertex reproduces the two-particle superfield recently introduced in the literature.</description>

      <title>Tree-level 11D supergravity amplitudes from the pure spinor worldline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a pure spinor worldline formalism for computing tree-level scattering amplitudes in 11D supergravity. Focusing first on the 4-point amplitude, we demonstrate that our prescription is consistent with BRST symmetry and gauge invariance, and that the resulting expression is invariant under permutation of the external particles. Remarkably, the amplitude admits a compact representation in pure spinor superspace and agrees precisely with the result obtained via perturbiner methods. We further extend our construction to the N-point case, proposing a general correlator that preserves BRST closure and gauge invariance, thereby offering a systematic framework for higher-point computations in 11D supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis contains of two parts: The first part is a pedagogical introduction into the field of bosonic SFT. After discussing some general properties we expect, Witten's open SFT and Zwiebach's closed SFT are presented in detail. This means we set up the action, explain the algebraical and geometrical structure and mention physical applications. In the open case we review the most important analytic solutions including the necessary operator technology whileas in the closed case we focus on quantization and the more elaborate construction of the vertices. The second part contains of reprints of papers completed within the PhD: 2301.13182, 2402.00308, 2410.16228 and 2411.15123.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the lens hyperbolic gamma solution to the star-star relation and the flipping relation from three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $S^3_b/\mathbb{Z}_r$. We explore that a certain limit of the star-star relation yields the latter symmetry transformation, which exchanges the edge interactions of two outer spins with a centrally sited spin. Furthermore, we obtain more solutions to the flipping relation in terms of the hyperbolic gamma, basic hypergeometric, and the Euler gamma functions.</description>

      <title>Regular and Floquet bases for gauge and gravity theories: a non perturbative approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main topic of the paper is represented by the change of basis, in Heun-type equations, from the one of decaying (at two singular points) solutions to that of Floquet solutions. Crucial in the connection relations is the phase acquired by the Floquet solutions by going from a (ir)regular singularity to another. The new 'kink method' is exploited to compute the quantum momentum of the Floquet solutions as convergent series, explicitly at all orders. Hence, upon integrating it term by term, the acquired phase can be derived explicitly as a similar series. Since Heun equation and its confluences describe ${\cal N}=2$ SYM theories in the NS background as quantisation of Seiberg-Witten differentials and also appear in perturbations of gravity solutions, tests and predictions in both domains can be made. A very encouraging test is the matching of the acquired phase with the dual gauge period, $A_D$, as given by the Nekrasov instanton function. Actually, the procedure can be considered an alternative to instanton computations. On the gravity side, results for the wave functions are at leading order compatible with analogous expressions found by studying the Teukolsky (or others, like Regge-Wheeler) equation. Besides, the whole construction can represent an useful approach to these equations at all orders, shedding also light on non-perturbative contributions, which should reveal very interesting for the consequences in gravity perturbations.</description>

      <title>Infinite towers of 2d symmetry algebras from Carrollian limit of 3d CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Carrollian limit of OPE blocks of scalar primaries, spin-1 currents and the stress tensor in 3-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT$_3$). We demonstrate that these OPE blocks decompose into OPE blocks of towers of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ modes labeled by negative integer dimensions. We present two applications of this construction. We first show that the current-scalar-scalar and stress tensor-scalar-scalar OPE blocks in CFT$_3$ reduce to $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ OPE blocks from which towers of conformally soft photon and graviton theorems can be derived. We then show that the CFT$_3$ OPE blocks of, respectively, current and stress tensor components dual to positive helicity gluons and gravitons in AdS$_4$ become $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ blocks of conformally soft gluons and gravitons which imply the $S$ and $w_{1 + \infty}$ algebras of celestial CFT.</description>

      <title>(Un)solvable Matrix Models for BPS Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a family of complex matrix models computing the protected two- and three-point correlation functions in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Our description allows us to directly relate the eigenvalue density of the matrix model for ``Huge" operators with $ \Delta \sim N^2$ to the shape of droplets in the dual Lin-Lunin-Maldacena (LLM) geometry. We demonstrate how to determine the eigenvalue distribution for various choices of operators such as those of exponential, character, or coherent state type, which then allows us to efficiently compute one-point functions of light chiral primaries in generic LLM backgrounds. In particular, we successfully match the results for light probes with the supergravity calculations of Skenderis and Taylor. We provide a large $N$ formalism for one-point functions of ``Giant" probes, such as operators dual to giant graviton branes in LLM backgrounds, and explicitly apply it for particular backgrounds. We also explicitly compute the correlator of three huge half-BPS operators of exponential type and stacks of determinant operators by reducing them to the known matrix model problems such as the Potts or $O(n)$ model on random planar graphs. Finally, we point out a curious relation between the correlators of $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS and $\frac{1}{8}$-BPS coherent state operators and the Eguchi-Kawai reduction of the Principal Chiral Model in $2D$ and $3D$ correspondingly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for a vertex operator superalgebra homomorphism from an affine vertex algebra to another vertex superalgebra to be conformal, and an additional criterion that guarantees that this homomorphism is surjective. This situation is applied to W-algebras and W-superalgebras and we list all cases where our criterion applies. This gives many new examples of W-algebras that collapse to affine vertex algebras or are conformal extensions. In particular, we provide many examples of simple W-algebras at non-admissible levels that collapse to admissible level affine vertex algebras.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac fermions in 3+1d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a general method, known as anomaly-matching, to derive new no-go theorems of fermionic lattice models. For our main result, we show that time-reversal invariant 3+1d lattice systems (such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals) can never admit a lone low-energy symmetry-protected Dirac fermion (or node), i.e., it must always come in higher muliplets or be fine-tuned. This theorem holds for both non-interacting and interacting systems as long as the electromagnetic $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ symmetry is a normal subgroup of the microscopic symmetry group $G_{\mathrm{UV}}$; a condition that is ubiquitous in physical $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ preserving lattice models. To show that our theorems are tight, we also explore both well-known and new systems that are converses of the no-go theorem, obtained by forfeiting certain assumptions such as a broken time-reversal symmetry (magnetic Weyl semimetal), a non-compact non-on-site $U(1)$ (almost local Dirac node model), no-symmetry protection (fine-tuned Dirac semimetal), or multiple low-energy Dirac nodes (time-reversal invariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals). We will also explicitly demonstrate that, while this theorem strictly prohibits single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac node, it does allow for other odd numbers of Dirac nodes under certain circumstances, such as three Dirac nodes in the Fu-Kane-Mele diamond lattice model. This is akin to the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem for an odd number of differently-charged chiral fermions, whose lattice realizations are allowed if certain anomaly cancellation conditions are met.</description>

The impurity exhibits four phases $\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment $\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to the expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less consequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\rm imp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows monotonically from $\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that of the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap bound state produces entropy overshoots above $\ln 2$, saturating to $\ln 2$ at high $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether impurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains effectively decoupled, with entropy near $\ln 2$, with some intermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\delta \to 0$. These behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment phases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation towers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the local-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond conventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity contribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of the Heisenberg chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the isotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single edge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J&gt;0$): a \textit{Kondo phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\ln 2$ at $T \to \infty$ to $0$ at $T\to 0$; and an \textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound mode drives $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\ln 2$ as $T \to \infty$ and to $0$ as $T \to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J&lt;0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}\to \ln 2$ as $T \to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\mathrm{imp}}=\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J&lt;0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact diagonalization results.</description>

      <title>Finite-volume analysis and universal scaling signatures near the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantifying the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in QCD through numerical calculations on a discrete space-time lattice, one needs to perform controlled extrapolations to the continuum and infinite-volume limits followed by an extrapolation to the limit of massless light quarks. We discuss here, the results on the latter two limits at still finite lattice spacings. We use here for chiral symmetry breaking, an improved order parameter free of additive and multiplicative divergences and we analyse its volume and quark mass dependence. Comparing to the expected universal behavior in the chiral limit, we quantify deviations from the universal finite-size scaling behavior as function of the light to strange quark mass ratio.</description>

      <title>Conformal Weyl Tensor Dynamics and Stability Analysis in Rotating Black Hole Spacetimes: A Novel Approach to Quasinormal Mode Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical framework for analysing the stability of rotating black hole spacetimes through the conformal properties of the Weyl tensor. By introducing a new conformal invariant constructed from the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor, we derive a master equation governing perturbations that unifies the Teukolsky and Regge-Wheeler- Zerilli formalisms. Our approach reveals previously unrecognised relationships between quasinormal mode frequencies and the conformal structure of the spacetime.We prove two fundamental theorems: (i) the conformal stability criterion, which relates mode stability to the sign-definiteness of our conformal invariant, and (ii) the isospectrality theorem for conformally related black hole spacetimes. Numerical calculations for Kerr black holes demonstrate that our formalism predicts new branches in the quasinormal mode spectrum, with frequencies differing from standard predictions by up to 3.7% in the near-extremal regime. These results have significant implications for gravitational wave astronomy and tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chen and Teo have constructed a two-parameter family of five dimensional, stationary vacuum black hole solutions whose spatial hypersurfaces are asymptotically locally Euclidean with boundary at infinity is $L(2,1)$. Spatial cross sections of the event horizon have topology $S^3$ equipped with inhomogeneous metrics. When the mass is zero, the solution reduces to the trivial product of time with the Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instanton. We show that the spacetime metric can be smoothly extended through an event horizon and that the exterior region is stably causal. We also investigate their geometric and physical properties. In particular, we show that the Smarr relation and first law of black hole mechanics hold and compute the renormalized gravitational action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium thermodynamics far from equilibrium is investigated in terms of a generalized ``Nambu dynamics'' (termed Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)); NNET consists of Nambu dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians and an entropy causing dissipation.
  It is shown that a general complex non-linear non-equilibrium system far from equilibrium can be reduced to a simple NNET, on the basis of an existence proposition of NNET. This proposition is, however, proved only formally, so that there may exist various obstacles to destroy it.
  Non-equilibrium thermodynamics studied in this article is quite general, including the case in which the product of dynamical and affinity forces forms a higher-order mixed tensor.</description>

      <title>The Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture via limit categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce limit categories for cotangent stacks of smooth stacks as an effective version of classical limits of categories of D-modules on them. We develop their general theory and pursue their relation with categories of D-modules. In particular, we establish the functorial properties of limit categories such as the smooth pull-back and projective push-forward. Using the notion of limit categories, we propose a precise formulation of the Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture, proposed by Donagi-Pantev as the classical limit of the de Rham geometric Langlands equivalence. It states an equivalence between the derived categories of moduli stacks of semistable Higgs bundles and limit categories of moduli stacks of all Higgs bundles. We prove the existence of a semiorthogonal decomposition of the limit category into quasi-BPS categories, which are categorical versions of BPS invariants on a non-compact Calabi-Yau 3-fold. This semiorthogonal decomposition is interpreted as a Langlands dual to the semiorthogonal decomposition constructed in our previous work on the category of coherent sheaves on the moduli stack of semistable Higgs bundles. We also construct Hecke operators on limit categories for Higgs bundles. They are expected to be compatible with Wilson operators under our formulation of Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture. The conjectured equivalence implies an equivalence between BPS categories for semistable Higgs bundles, which we expect to be a categorical version of the topological mirror symmetry conjecture for Higgs bundles by Hausel-Thaddeus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Macdonald operator is known to coincide with a certain element of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra in the Fock representation of levels $(1,0)$. A generalization of this operator to higher levels $(r,0)$ can be built using the coproduct structure, it is diagonalized by the generalized Macdonald symmetric functions, indexed by $r$-tuple partitions and depending on $r$ alphabets. In this paper, we extend to the generalized case some of the known formulas obeyed by ordinary Macdonald symmetric functions, such as the $e_1$-Pieri rule or the identity relating them to Whittaker vectors obtained by Garsia, Haiman, and Tesler. We also propose a generalization of the five-term relation, and the Fourier/Hopf pairing. In addition, we prove the factorized expression of the generalized Macdonald kernel conjectured previously by Zenkevich.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Teleparallel Robertson-Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a Chaplygin gas, and then for any polytropic gas cosmological source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity field equations (FEs) for each $k$-parameter value case and the relevant gas equation of state (EoS) to find the new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For flat $k=0$ cosmological case, we find analytical solutions valid for any cosmological scale factor. For curved $k=\pm 1$ cosmological cases, we find new approximated teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for slow, linear, fast and very fast universe expansion cases summarizing by a double power-law function. All the new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications on dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy, Anti-deSitter (AdS) spacetimes and several other cosmological processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a gravitational spin-orbit interaction that can potentially modify the space-time geometry naturally emerges in the framework of Poincar\'e gauge theory. For this purpose, we derive the field equations of a particular model with cubic order invariants and demonstrate the existence of analytical solutions which display an interaction between the intrinsic and extrinsic angular momentum parameters in the gravitational action, in analogy to the spin-orbit interaction arising from atomic and nuclear systems. Due to the highly nonlinear character of the field equations under stationary and axisymmetric conditions, we focus on a degenerate case which simplifies their complexity, at the cost of constraining the geometry to the Kerr space-time. Thereby, our results indicate more general solutions with a spin-orbit interaction beyond the Kerr space-time are expected to arise in the nondegenerate models of Poincar\'e gauge theory.</description>

Abstract: Consider a d-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) $\mathfrak{T}$, with a generalized symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, which may or may not be invertible. We study the action of $\mathcal{S}$ on generalized or $q$-charges, i.e. $q$-dimensional operators. The main result of this paper is that $q$-charges are characterized in terms of the topological defects of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) of $\mathcal{S}$, also known as the ``Sandwich Construction''. The SymTFT is a $(d+1)$-dimensional topological field theory, which encodes the symmetry $\mathcal{S}$ and the physical theory in terms of its boundary conditions. Our proposal applies quite generally to any finite symmetry $\mathcal{S}$, including non-invertible, categorical symmetries. Mathematically, the topological defects of the SymTFT form the Drinfeld Center of the symmetry category $\mathcal{S}$. Applied to invertible symmetries, we recover the result of Part I of this series of papers. After providing general arguments for the identification of $q$-charges with the topological defects of the SymTFT, we develop this program in detail for QFTs in 2d (for general fusion category symmetries) and 3d (for fusion 2-category symmetries).</description>

      <title>Effects of background rotation and anisotropy in the holographic description of type-II superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work concerns the detailed construction of a holographic model for a type-II s-wave superconductor defined on a 5-dimensional anisotropic rotating black hole. We examine the role of rotation and anisotropy on the properties of the superconductor model focusing on the condensate and the AC conductivity, for which we obtain closed formulas, using both analytical and numerical methods. The results reveal that the rotation is responsible for the appearance of a peak and for introducing an exponentially vanishing behavior in the high-frequency limit of the real component of the AC conductivity. Such a behavior aligns with that observed in high-temperature superconductor models and experiments, where the peak and vanishing behavior result from quasiparticle damping, suggesting a relation between the {\it rotation of a black hole} and {\it quasiparticle damping effects} due to impurities or defects in a superconducting material. This relation supplements the holographic dictionary of the gravity/Condensed Matter Theory correspondence. In addition, we provide a detailed construction of the vortex lattice presented in arXiv:2208.05988 and study its behavior as a function of an external uniform magnetic field. Once again, it is shown that the vortex lattice can be continuously deformed along with a change in the vortex population by virtue of the magnetic field, providing a promising avenue for holographically modeling the vortex lattice deformations observed in experimental studies with superconducting materials. As a concrete example, we describe both the vortex lattice deformation and the increment of the vortex population under the action of an external magnetic field in the LiFeAs type-II superconductor. These effects supplement those previously found for the FeSe type-II superconductor studied in arXiv:2208.05988.</description>

Abstract: The D0-brane/Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix theory is a strongly coupled quantum system with an interesting gravity dual. We develop a scheme to derive bootstrap bounds on simple correlators in the matrix theory at infinite $N$ at zero energy by imposing the supercharge equations of motion. By exploiting SO(9) symmetry, we are able to consider single-trace operators involving words of length up to 9 using very modest computational resources. We interpret our initial results as strong evidence that the bootstrap method can efficiently access physics in the strongly coupled, infinite $N$ regime.</description>

Abstract: Within the context of wavefunctions of integrable many-body systems, rational multivariable Baker-Akhiezer (BA) functions were introduced by O. Chalykh, M. Feigin and A. Veselov and, in the case of the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider system, can be associated with a reduction of the Macdonald symmetric polynomials at $t=q^{-m}$ with integer partition labels substituted by arbitrary complex numbers. A parallel attempt to describe wavefunctions of the bispectral trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider problem was made by M. Noumi and J. Shiraishi who proposed a power series that reduces to the Macdonald polynomials at particular values of parameters. It turns out that this power series also reduces to the BA functions at $t=q^{-m}$, as we demonstrate in this letter. This makes the Macdonald polynomials, the BA functions and the Noumi-Shiraishi (NS) series a closely tied {\it triad} of objects, which have very different definitions, but are straightforwardly related with each other. In particular, theory of the BA functions provides a nice system of simple linear equations, while the NS functions provide a nice way to represent the multivariable BA function explicitly with arbitrary number of variables.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical boundary induced current in the cosmic string spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the vacuum current associated with a charged bosonic field operator, induced by a cylindrical boundary in the idealized cosmic string spacetime. In this setup we assume that the cylindrical boundary is coaxial with the string, that by its turn carry a magnetic flux along its core. In order to develop this analysis, we calculate the positive frequency Wightman functions for both regions, inside and outside the boundary. Moreover, we assume that the bosonic field obeys the Robin boundary condition on the cylindrical shell. Using this approach, the analytical expressions for the vacuum bosonic currents are presented in the form of the sum of boundary-free and boundary-induced parts. Because the boundary-free contribution is very well established in literature, our focus here is in the boundary-dependent part. As we will see, our general results are presented in a cylindrically symmetric static structure. Some asymptotic behaviors for the boundary-induced vacuum currents are investigated in various limiting cases. In order to provide a better understanding of these currents, we provide some graphs exhibiting their behavior as function of the distance to the string's core, and on the intensity of the magnetic flux running along it. These plots also present how the parameter associated with the planar angle deficit interfere in the intensity of the corresponding current.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the fully supersymmetric solutions in N=3 and N=4 higher derivative Poincare supergravity theories. We work in the superconformal formalism and show that flat space is the only fully supersymmetric solution in these theories. However, in N=2 Poincare supergravity, three fully supersymmetric solutions exist: Bertotti-Robinson geometry ($AdS_2\times S^2$), flat space and pp wave spacetimes, which are known in the literature. We discuss the reason behind the richer vacua in N=2 supergravity compared to its N=3 and N=4 cousins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert action is well-known to be unbounded below and thus to raise many questions regarding the definition of the gravitational path integral. A variety of works since the late 1980's have suggested that this problem disappears when one fixes a foliation of the spacetime and imposes the corresponding gravitational constraints. However, we show here that this approach fails with various classes of boundary conditions imposed on the foliation: compact slices without boundary, asymptotically flat, or asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter slices. We also discuss the idea of fixing the scalar curvature and Wick-rotating the conformal factor, and show that it also fails to produce an action bounded from below.</description>

      <title>Twisted-Circle Compactifications of SQCD-like Theories and Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and analyse holographic duals to a class of four-dimensional N = 1 SU($N_c$) SQCD-like theories compactified on a circle with an R-symmetry twist. The setup originates from type IIB backgrounds previously proposed as duals to SQCD with $N_f$ fundamental flavours. The U(1) R-symmetry is anomaly-free only if $ N_f = 2N_c$. We implement a supersymmetric twisted-circle reduction, holographically realised through a smoothly shrinking $S^1$ fibered over the internal U(1)$_R$ direction. We obtain new regular type IIB supergravity backgrounds that are valid only if the condition $N_f = 2N_c$ is satisfied--mirroring the anomaly cancellation requirement in the field theory. We compute various field-theoretic observables--including the Chern-Simons level, Wilson loop and the holographic central charge--showing the emergence of a 3D ${\cal N} = 2$ gapped phase consistent with a Chern-Simons TQFT. This work highlights the interplay between anomalies, supersymmetry, and geometry in the holographic realisation of compactified gauge theories with fundamental matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative aspects of entanglement structures in $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turning on the $T\bar{T}$-deformation in a two-dimensional CFT provides a unique window to study explicitly how non-local features arise in the UV as a result of the deformation. A sharp signature is the dynamical emergence of an effective length-scale $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$ that separates the local and non-local regimes of the deformed theory, effectively serving as a UV cut-off for computing observables in the local regime. In this paper, we study this phenomenon through the entanglement structures of the deformed theory. We focus on computing the Renyi entropies of single-interval sub-regions in the deformed vacuum states. We pay particular attention to the interplay between the bare entanglement cut-off inherited from the CFT computation and the effects from the $T\bar{T}$ deformations. Applying the general replica trick to the string theory formulation of $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs, we derive an explicit representation of the deformed replica partition function as a weighted integral of the CFT results evaluated at a dynamical cut-off, which is integrated over. We computed in detail the kernel functions of the integral representation, and performed the saddle-point analysis in the semi-classical limit of small $\mu$. We found that in addition to the perturbative saddle-point which identifies the dynamical cut-off with the bare entanglement cut-off, there exists another non-perturbative saddle-point that identifies the dynamical cut-off with the $T\bar{T}$ length-scale $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$, but whose contribution is exponentially small. We discuss how these non-perturbative effects can shed lights on the mechanism through which the $T\bar{T}$ length-scale may eventually replace the bare counter-part and become the effective entanglement cut-off.</description>

      <title>The CFT of Sen's Formulation of Chiral Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sen's action for chiral bosons in 2 dimensions describes two chiral scalars, one of which couples to the physical metric and one of which couples to a flat metric. It has a generalisation in which the flat metric is replaced by an arbitrary second metric and so can be formulated on any curved world-sheet. When the two metrics are equal, the theory reduces to a $\beta \gamma$ system, giving a non-unitary $c=2$ conformal field theory. We argue that the relation between this and the theory of two chiral bosonic scalars of the same chirality can be viewed as a \lq bosonisation'. We show that the standard vertex operators for the chiral scalars are vertex operators and line operators in the Sen formulation and derive the formulation in the Sen theory of correlation functions in the chiral scalar theory. The flat space Sen theory can be coupled to two different world-sheet metrics in such a way that one scalar couples to one metric and the other to the other metric, so obtaining the general formulation with two metrics.
  In $d=4k+2$ dimensions, the bi-metric action for a $2k$-form gauge field with self-dual field strength reduces, when the two metrics are equal, to a conformal field theory with a $BF$-type action, except that $B$ is a self-dual $d/2$-form and $F$ is a $d/2$-form field strength, $F=dP$. The self-duality of $B$ means that this is not a topological theory but instead represents two self-dual gauge fields. This has a generalisation to a democratic action for $p$-form gauge fields in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantising Chiral Bosons On Riemann Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sen's action in two dimensions governs a chiral boson coupled to a two-dimensional metric together with a second chiral boson that couples to a flat two-dimensional metric. This second scalar decouples from the physical degrees of freedom. The generalisation of this action to one in which the second chiral scalar couples to an arbitrary second metric is used to formulate the theory on an arbitrary two-dimensional manifold. We use this action with both metrics Riemannian (or complex) to formulate the path integral on any Riemann surface. We calculate the partition function in this way and check the result with that calculated using canonical quantisation, and then extend this to multiple chiral bosons. The partition function for chiral scalars taking values on a rational torus is a sum of terms, each of which is the product of two holomorphic functions, one a function of the modulus of the first metric and the other a function of the modulus of the second metric. In particular, for the case of chiral bosons moving on a torus defined by an even self-dual lattice, the partition function is a single product of two such holomorphic functions, not a sum of such terms. This is applied to the heterotic string to give a world-sheet action whose quantisation is modular invariant and free from anomalies. We discuss modular invariance for the moduli of both metrics and the extension to higher genus Riemann surfaces.</description>

Abstract: The massless S-matrix of the pure RR AdS3 X S3 X T4 theory is very similar but not quite the same as Fendley-Intriligator's N=2 S-matrix, in turns related to Sine-Gordon taken at a special coupling. In this short note we review the reason why supersymmetry emerges but with a fractional statistics of the particles. We then use this to obtain a very simple interpolating S-matrix between massless AdS3 and Sine-Gordon, and further find two interpolating S-matrices between these and the mixed-flux relativistic S-matrix, solving the Yang-Baxter equation all the way in-between. They are all relativistic invariant and braiding unitary, can be written in terms of particles with fractional statistics, and they might serve the purpose to embed into a parent integrable system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a new definition of holographic entanglement entropy in the framework of static patch holography for de Sitter space. Using the replica trick and twist operator formalism, we derive an entropy functional in three-dimensional de Sitter space expressed through de Sitter Green's functions. Since the naive Ryu-Takayanagi prescription in de Sitter spacetime fails to satisfy strong subadditivity, we demand that our proposed formula be consistent with the fundamental entropic inequalities. The resulting conditions place nontrivial constraints on the undetermined parameter space of static patch holography. Our results demonstrate that entanglement inequalities provide a sharp diagnostic for candidate definitions of entanglement entropy in de Sitter holography and offer quantitative evidence in support of static patch holography as a consistent framework.</description>

Abstract: A numerical setup for investigating the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between two coherent states is presented for a scalar massive Quantum Field Theory in ($1+1$)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. These states are constructed using smeared Weyl operators compactly supported in two diamond regions belonging to the right Rindler wedge. Using this setup, we verified the known properties of the relative entropy, namely: positivity, increase with the size of the spacetime regions considered, decrease with the increase of the mass parameter. A linear increase with respect to the spatial distance between the two diamond regions is also observed.</description>

      <title>Measuring black hole spin through gravitational lensing of pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new procedure for measuring the spin of a black hole with an unprecedented accuracy based on the gravitational lensing of millisecond pulsars. We derive the basic equations for lensing by a rotating black hole. We show that the frame dragging effect increases the deflection angle of a light ray co-rotating with the black hole. For the primary (secondary) images the angular positions are larger (smaller) for a rotating black hole by an amount on the order of tens of microarcseconds. The differential time delay of images for the case in which the lens is a rotating black hole is smaller than that in the case of non-rotating lens of the same mass, and it can be larger than a few milliseconds. We show that this quantity offers the possibility of reducing the error of spin measurement to less than one percent if we could measure the differential time delay with accuracy of microseconds. We also study relativistic images that are produced by light rays that rotate around the black hole before reaching the observer. The angular positions of relativistic images on the same side as the primary (secondary) image are a few microarcseconds larger (smaller) if the black hole is rotating. Furthermore, the differential time delay between relativistic images is about twelve orders of magnitude larger in the case of rotating lens.</description>

      <title>Excess Radiation from Axion-Photon Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two notable anomalies in radio observations -- the excess radiation in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background, revealed by ARCADE2, and the twice-deeper absorption trough of the global 21cm line, identified by EDGES -- remain unresolved. These phenomena may have a shared origin, as the enhancement of the 21cm absorption trough could arise from excess heating. We investigate this scenario through the framework of axion-like particles (ALPs), showing that the resonant conversion of ALPs into photons can produce a photon abundance sufficient to resolve both anomalies simultaneously. Our model naturally explains the observed radio excess between 0.4 and 10GHz while also enhances the 21cm absorption feature at 78MHz. Furthermore, it predicts a novel power-law scaling of the radio spectrum above 0.5GHz and an additional absorption trough below 30MHz, which could be verified through cross-detection in upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>The Habiro ring of a number field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Habiro ring of a number field $\mathbb{K}$ and modules over it graded by $K_3(\mathbb{K})$. Elements of these modules are collections of power series at each complex root of unity that arithmetically glue with each other after applying a Frobenius endomorphism, and after dividing at each prime by a collection of series that depends solely on an element of the Bloch group.
  The main theorems of this paper concern number fields, their algebraic $K$-theory and its regulator maps (Borel, $p$-adic and \'etale), whereas the explicit collections of series are defined by a careful algebraic analysis of the infinite Pochhammer symbol at roots of unity.
  The origin of the above mentioned power series comes from perturbative Chern--Simons theory and by expansions of the admissible series of Kontsevich--Soibelman, both ultimately related to the infinite Pochhammer symbol. This link suggests that some Donaldson-Thomas invariants have arithmetic meaning and that some elements of the Habiro ring of a number field have enumerative meaning.
  Added subsection 1.1 explaining what the paper is about and subsection 1.8 explaining the relation to perturbative complex Chern-Simons theory.</description>

Abstract: Non-linear differential equations are a fundamental tool to describe different phenomena in nature. However, we still lack a well-established method to tackle stiff differential equations. Here we present a machine learning framework to facilitate the solution of nonlinear multiscale differential equations and, especially, inverse problems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This framework is based on what is called \textit{multi-head} (MH) training, which involves training the network to learn a general space of all solutions for a given set of equations with certain variability, rather than learning a specific solution of the system. This setup is used with a second novel technique that we call Unimodular Regularization (UR) of the latent space of solutions. We show that the multi-head approach, combined with Unimodular Regularization, significantly improves the efficiency of PINNs by facilitating the transfer learning process thereby enabling the finding of solutions for nonlinear, coupled, and multiscale differential equations.</description>

      <title>Twisted gauging and topological sectors in (2+1)d abelian lattice gauge theories</title>

Abstract: Given a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation, we investigate a duality operation that amounts to gauging its invertible 1-form symmetry, followed by gauging the resulting 0-form symmetry in a twisted way via a choice of discrete torsion. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects, which are obtained by gauging the 1-form symmetry along submanifolds of spacetime, and employ the same calculus to realise the duality operators. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians. Whenever a lattice gauge theory is left invariant under the duality operation, we explore the possibility of promoting the self-duality to an internal symmetry. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group.</description>

      <title>Effect of generic dark matter halo on transonic accretion onto galactic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The environment surrounding a black hole or black hole binaries is generally expected to play an important role in understanding various astrophysical phenomena around them. In this paper, we study relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic supermassive black hole dressed with a cold dark matter halo. Focusing on different relativistic dark matter distributions with an inner density spike, we analyze the effect of the dark matter halo on the topology and properties of the accretion flow. Our results show enhancement of disk luminosity in the presence of dark matter, which depends on the nature and properties (halo mass and compactness) of the dark matter distribution. Under the assumptions of our accretion model, the dominant contribution to the disk luminosity for compact and massive halos arises from the inner regions of the accretion flow. Consequently, our analysis indicates that luminosity measurements can serve as an effective probe of the underlying dark matter density spike.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on inflationary models with non-minimally derivative coupling by ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most recent data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) reveals a larger value of the scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, ruling out a broad class of inflationary attractors. In this paper, we consider inflationary models including the power law potential, the hilltop model, the polynomial $\alpha$-attractor and exponential $\alpha-$attractor, with non-minimally derivative coupling in the high friction limit, and show how the models can fit ACT data. We also derive constraints on the model parameters using the latest ACT data.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of nonlocal gravity black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the quasinormal modes of a new class of nonlocal static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions within the framework of the revised Deser-Woodard theory of gravity. These solutions are constructed as linear perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime and are characterized by an inverse power-law behavior of the lapse metric function. We derive the radial profiles of the effective potentials corresponding to scalar, electromagnetic and axial gravitational fluctuations on the BH background. Using the WKB method, complemented by Pad\'e approximants to regularize the trend of the effective potential near its peak, we compute the complex quasinormal mode frequencies associated with each type of perturbation. Our results are examined from both mathematical and physical perspectives, and are substantiated with references to existing literature. In particular, we compare the numerical outcomes with the predictions of the Schwarzschild metric to quantify deviations from the framework of general relativity. When all types of perturbations are combined, the relative deviations of the fundamental modes can reach up to $\sim 12\%$. Finally, we discuss the possibility to place observational bounds in the BH parameter space, based on the predicted sensitivities of future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Stable black holes in lower dimensional $f(\mathbb{Q})$ non-metric gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate exact charged and uncharged black hole solutions in a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime within the framework of quadratic form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ symmetric teleparallel gravity, where $\mathbb{Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar. By adopting spherical symmetry and considering both vanishing and non-vanishing electromagnetic fields, we derive new classes of black hole solutions and analyze their geometric and physical properties. The study demonstrates that the inclusion of quadratic corrections in the gravitational Lagrangian significantly modifies the structure of solutions, producing deviations from the standard BTZ geometry. Invariants such as curvature and non-metricity scalars are calculated to classify the singularity structure and spacetime behavior. Thermodynamic quantities, including Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, are computed, showing consistency with the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we examine the geodesic motion of test particles and derive the effective potential to explore the stability of photon orbits. A notable outcome is the identification of weaker black hole singularities in comparison to General Relativity, attributed to the non-metricity corrections. The possibility of multi-horizon configurations is also explored. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the gravitational, thermodynamic, and dynamical features of lower-dimensional black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity and highlights their distinct characteristics with respect to General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</description>
