      <title>On connected graphs with finite spectral redundancy index and Pythagorean triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates spectral redundancy, a concept initially introduced by Alberto Seeger. Spectral redundancy arises when different connected induced subgraphs of a graph share the same spectral radius in their adjacency spectrum. Let \(b(G)\) denote the total number of non-isomorphic induced subgraphs of \(G\), and \(c(G)\) represents the cardinality of the set of spectral radius of all connected induced subgraphs of \(G\). The spectral redundancy of a graph \( G \) is defined as the ratio \( \frac{b(G)}{c(G)} \). The supremum of this ratio across all graphs in a family is called the spectral redundancy index of that family. We focus on a family of graphs that exhibit spectral redundancy and we find out the spectral redundancy index of this family. Furthermore, we investigate the connection between the spectral redundancy of these graphs and the presence of Pythagorean triplets.</description>

      <title>Identically vanishing $k$-generalized Fibonacci polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fibonacci polynomials are a generalization of the Fibonacci numbers. The $k$-generalized Fibonacci polynomials are a further generalization to $k\ge2$ summands, which satisfy the recurrence $\mathcal{F}_{n,k}(x) = x^{k-1}\mathcal{F}_{n-1,k}(x) +x^{k-2}\mathcal{F}_{n-2,k}(x) +\dots +\mathcal{F}_{n-k,k}(x)$. Most of the attention in the literature iterates the above recurrence upwards to positive values of $n$. We show that, when the recurrence is iterated downwards to negative values of $n$, there are indices where the polynomials $vanish\; identically$. This fact does not seem to have been noted in the literature. There are $k(k-1)/2$ such indices. We enumerate and prove the complete list of such indices. We also employ generating functions to derive combinatorial sums for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci polynomials, both for positive and negative $n$. (Separate generating functions and combinatorial sums are required for positive and negative $n$.) Lastly, we show that, unlike the case for positive $n$, the degree of a $k$-generalized Fibonacci polynomial (where $k\ge3$) does $not$ increase monotonically with $|n|$ for $n&lt;0$. We conjecture a formula for the degree of the polynomial. It has been verified numerically for all values $k=2,\dots,100$ and $1 \le |n| \le 1000$.</description>

      <title>Multiset Metric Dimension of Binomial Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G = (V,E)$ and a subset $R \subseteq V$, we say that $R$ is \textit{multiset resolving} for $G$ if for every pair of vertices $v,w$, the \textit{multisets} $\{d(v,r): r \in R\}$ and $\{d(w,r):r \in R\}$ are distinct, where $d(x,y)$ is the graph distance between vertices $x$ and $y$. The \textit{multiset metric dimension} of $G$ is the size of a smallest set $R \subseteq V$ that is multiset resolving (or $\infty$ if no such set exists). This graph parameter was introduced by Simanjuntak, Siagian, and Vitr\'{i}k in 2017~\cite{simanjuntak2017multiset}, and has since been studied for a variety of graph families. We prove bounds which hold with high probability for the multiset metric dimension of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ in the regime $d = (n-1)p = \Theta(n^{x})$ for fixed $x \in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Preference-restricted parking functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parking function is a function $\pi:[n]\to [n]$ whose $i$th-smallest output is at most $i,$ corresponding to a parking procedure for $n$ cars on a one-way street. We refine this concept by introducing preference-restricted parking functions, which are parking functions with codomain restricted to some $S\subseteq[n]$. Particular choices of $S$ yield new combinatorial interpretations of previous results about variant parking procedures, and new results too. In particular we consider prime parking functions, parking procedures with fewer spots than cars, and parking functions where each spot has space for multiple cars. We also use restricted parking functions to reprove Abel's binomial theorem.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Hecke eigenbases from Ehrhart polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\ell\in\{0,1,\dots,n\}$, we consider the function extracting the $\ell$th coefficient of the Ehrhart polynomials of lattice polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^n$. These functions form a basis of the space of unimodular invariant valuations. We show that, in even dimensions, these functions are in fact simultaneous symplectic Hecke eigenfunctions. We leverage this and apply the theory of spherical functions and their associated zeta functions to prove analytic, asymptotic, and combinatorial results about the arithmetic functions averaging $\ell$th Ehrhart coefficients.</description>

      <title>Positive combinatorial formulae for involution matrix loci and orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{n,a}$ be the set consisting of involutions in symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ with exactly $a$ fixed points and apply the orbit harmonics method to obtain a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n$-module $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$. Liu, Ma, Rhoades, and Zhu figured out a signed combinatorial formula for the graded Frobenius image $\grFrob(R(\MMM_{n,a});q)$ of $R(\MMM_{n,a})$. Our goal is to cancel these signs. Finally, we find two positive combinatorial formulae for $\mathrm{grFrob}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$, yielding potential ways to find a linear basis for $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$ and find a statistic $\mathrm{stat}:\mathcal{M}_{n,a}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ to interpret the Hilbert series $\mathrm{Hilb}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$ of $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cycle rank is one of the depth parameters for digraphs introduced by Eggan in 1963. We show that there exists a function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that every digraph of cycle rank at least $f(k)$ contains a directed cycle chain, a directed ladder, or a directed tree chain of order $k$ as a butterfly minor. We also investigate a new connection between cycle rank and a directed analogue of the weak coloring number of graphs.</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal problems for non-bipartite graphs without odd cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known result of Mantel asserts that every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph $G$ has at most $\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$ edges. Moreover, Erd\H{o}s proved that if $G$ is further non-bipartite, then $e(G)\le \lfloor {(n-1)^2}/{4}\rfloor +1$. Recently, Lin, Ning and Wu [Combin. Probab. Comput. 30 (2021)] established a spectral version by showing that if $G$ is a triangle-free non-bipartite graph on $n$ vertices, then $\lambda (G)\le \lambda (S_1(T_{n-1,2}))$, with equality if and only if $G=S_1(T_{n-1,2})$, where $S_1(T_{n-1,2})$ is obtained from $T_{n-1,2}$ by subdividing an edge. In this paper, we investigate the maximum spectral radius of a non-bipartite graph without some short odd cycles. Let $C_{2\ell +1}(T_{n-2\ell, 2})$ be the graph obtained by identifying a vertex of $C_{2\ell+1}$ and a vertex of the smaller partite set of $T_{n-2\ell ,2}$. We prove that for $1\le \ell &lt; k$ and $n\ge 187k$, if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $\{C_3,\ldots ,C_{2\ell -1},C_{2k+1}\}$-free non-bipartite graph, then $\lambda (G)\le \lambda (C_{2\ell +1}(T_{n-2\ell, 2}))$, with equality if and only if $G=C_{2\ell +1}(T_{n-2\ell, 2})$. This result could be viewed as a spectral analogue of a min-degree result due to Yuan and Peng [European J. Combin. 127 (2025)]. Moreover, our result extends a result of Guo, Lin and Zhao [Linear Algebra Appl. 627 (2021)] as well as a recent result of Zhang and Zhao [Discrete Math. 346 (2023)] since we can get rid of the condition that $n$ is sufficiently large. The argument in our proof is quite different and makes use of the classical spectral stability method and the double-eigenvector technique. The main innovation lies in a more clever argument that guarantees a subgraph to be bipartite after removing few vertices, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Ramsey numbers for sparse graphs versus path or cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any integer $k\ge3$, let $G$ be a connected graph with $n\ge \Omega(k^4)$ vertices and no more than $(1+\frac{1}{ck^2})n$ edges where $c&gt;0$ is a constant, and $P_k$ or $C_k$ a path or cycle with $k$ vertices. In this paper we prove that if $k$ is odd then $r(G,C_k)=2n-1$. Moreover, \[ r(G,P_k)=\max\left\{n+\left\lfloor\frac k2\right\rfloor-1, n+k-2-\alpha'-\gamma\right\}, \] where $\alpha'$ is the independence number of an appropriate subgraph of $G$ and $\gamma=0$ if $k-1$ divides $n+k-3-\alpha'$ and $\gamma=1$ otherwise. Our bound on $n$ in terms of $k$ significantly improves upon the previous bounds $n\ge \Omega(k^{10})$ (from the first result) and $n\ge \Omega(k^{12})$ (from the second result) established by Burr, Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau and Schelp ({\em Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.} 269 (1982), 501--512). % Moreover, the restriction on the number of edges in $G$ is relaxed. This is the first improvement in over 40 years.</description>

      <title>Planar Tur\'an number of quasi-double stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph H, we call a graph $\textit{H-free}$ if it does not contain H as a subgraph. The planar Tur\'an number of a graph H, denoted by $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n, H)$, is the maximum number of edges in a planar H-free graph on n vertices. A (h,k)-quasi-double star $W_{h,k}$, obtained from a path $P_3=v_1v_2v_3$ by adding h leaves and k leaves to the vertices $v_1$ and $v_3$, respectively, is a subclass of caterpillars. In this paper, we study $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,W_{h,k})$ for all $1\le h\le 2\le k\le 5$, and obtain some tight bounds $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,W_{h,k})\leq\frac{3(h+k)}{h+k+2}n$ for $3\le h+k\le 5$ with equality holds if $(h+k+2)\mid n$, and $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,W_{1,5})\le \frac{5}{2}n$ with equality holds if $12\mid n$. Also we show that $\frac{9}{4}n\le ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,W_{2,4})\le \frac{5}{2}n$ and $\frac{5}{2}n\le ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,W_{2,5})\le \frac{17}{6}n$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perfect code in a graph $\Gamma = (V, E)$ is a subset $C$ of $V$ such that no two vertices in $C$ are adjacent and every vertex in $V \setminus C$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $C$. A total perfect code in $\Gamma$ is a subset $C$ of $V$ such that every vertex of $\Gamma$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $C$. In this paper we prove several results on perfect codes and total perfect codes in Cayley graphs of finite abelian groups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for considering a weighted directed graph with an accuracy of up to a given partition of the set of vertices is proposed. The resulting digraph (the splitting graph) does not contain arcs inside each partition element, and the arcs between the partition atoms are calculated in a special way taking into account the arcs of the original directed graph inside the atoms. This accounting is based on minimal trees defined on atoms. A study was made of what information about the original digraph is preserved in its splitting.</description>

      <title>Strong list-chromatic index of subcubic graphs is at most 10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong edge coloring of a graph $G$ is an assignment of colors to the edges of $G$ such that two distinct edges are colored differently if they are incident to a common edge or share an endpoint. The strong chromatic index of a graph $G$, denoted by $\chi_{s}'(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed for a strong edge coloring of $G$. The edge weight of a graph $G$ is defined to be $\max\limits_{uv\in E(G)}\{(d_G(u)+d_G(v))\}$. It was proved in Chen et al in 2020 that every graph with edge weight at most 6 has a strong edge-coloring using at most 10 colors. In this paper, we consider the list version of strong edge-coloring. We strengthen this result by showing that every graph with edge weight at most 6 has a strong list-chromatic index at most 10. Specially, every subcubic graph has a strong list-chromatic index at most 10, which improves a result of Dai et al. in 2018.</description>

      <title>Kernelization for list $H$-coloring for graphs with small vertex cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed graph $H$, in the List $H$-Coloring problem, we are given a graph $G$ along with list $L(v) \subseteq V(H)$ for every $v \in V(G)$, and we have to determine if there exists a list homomorphism $\varphi$ from $(G,L)$ to $H$, i.e., an edge preserving mapping $\varphi: V(G)\to V(H)$ that satisfies $\varphi(v)\in L(v)$ for every $v\in V(G)$. Note that if $H$ is the complete graph on $q$ vertices, the problem is equivalent to List $q$-Coloring. We investigate the kernelization properties of List $H$-Coloring parameterized by the vertex cover number of $G$: given an instance $(G,L)$ and a vertex cover of $G$ of size $k$, can we reduce $(G,L)$ to an equivalent instance $(G',L')$ of List $H$-Coloring where the size of $G'$ is bounded by a low-degree polynomial $p(k)$ in $k$? This question has been investigated previously by Jansen and Pieterse [Algorithmica 2019], who provided an upper bound, which turns out to be optimal if $H$ is a complete graph, i.e., for List $q$-Coloring. This result was one of the first applications of the method of kernelization via bounded-degree polynomials. We define two new integral graph invariants, $c^*(H)$ and $d^*(H)$, with $d^*(H) \leq c^*(H) \leq d^*(H)+1$, and show that for every graph $H$, List $H$-Coloring
  -- has a kernel with $\mathcal{O}(k^{c^*(H)})$ vertices,
  -- admits no kernel of size $\mathcal{O}(k^{d^*(H)-\varepsilon})$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.
  -- Furthermore, if $c^*(H) &gt; d^*(H)$, then there is a kernel with $\mathcal{O}(k^{c^*(H)-\varepsilon})$ vertices where $\varepsilon \geq 2^{1-c^*(H)}$.
  Additionally, we show that for some classes of graphs, including powers of cycles and graphs $H$ where $\Delta(H) \leq c^*(H)$ (which in particular includes cliques), the bound $d^*(H)$ is tight, using the polynomial method. We conjecture that this holds in general.</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal problems for degenerate graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of graphs is called degenerate if it contains at least one bipartite graph. In this paper, we investigate the spectral extremal problems for a degenerate family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$. By employing covering and independent covering of graphs, we establish a spectral stability result for $\mathcal{F}$. Using this stability result, we prove two general theorems that characterize spectral extremal graphs for a broad class of graph families $\mathcal{F}$ and imply several new and known results. Meanwhile, we establish the correlation between extremal graphs and spectral extremal graphs for $\mathcal{F}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detour in a graph is a longest path. This thesis is mainly about connected, non-traceable graphs with the property that each vertex is the start (or end) vertex of a detour. There are also related results on claw-free, 2-connected, non-traceable graphs, and maximal non-traceable graphs.</description>

      <title>Matroids are Equitable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if the ground set of a matroid can be partitioned into $k\ge 2$ bases, then for any given subset $S$ of the ground set, there is a partition into $k$ bases such that the sizes of the intersections of the bases with $S$ may differ by at most one. This settles the matroid equitability conjecture by Fekete and Szab\'o (Electron.~J.~Comb.~2011) in the affirmative. We also investigate equitable splittings of two disjoint sets $S_1$ and $S_2$, and show that there is a partition into $k$ bases such that the sizes of the intersections with $S_1$ may differ by at most one and the sizes of the intersections with $S_2$ may differ by at most two; this is the best possible one can hope for arbitrary matroids.
  We also derive applications of this result into matroid constrained fair division problems. We show that there exists a matroid-constrained fair division that is envy-free up to 1 item if the valuations are identical and tri-valued additive. We also show that for bi-valued additive valuations, there exists a matroid-constrained allocation that provides everyone their maximin share.</description>

      <title>Exact Tur\'{a}n number of the Fano plane in the $\ell_2$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical object in hypergraph Tur\'{a}n theory is the Fano plane $\mathbb{F}$, the unique linear $3$-graph on seven vertices with seven edges. The Tur\'{a}n density and exact Tur\'{a}n number of $\mathbb{F}$, first proposed as a problem by S\'{o}s~\cite{Sos76} in the 1970s, were determined through a sequence of works by De Caen--F\"{u}redi \cite{DCF00}, F\"{u}redi-Simonovits \cite{FS05}, Keevash-Sudakov \cite{KS05}, and Bellmann-Reiher \cite{BR19}.
  Addressing a conjecture of Balogh--Clemen--Lidick\'{y} \cite[Conjecture~3.1]{BCL22a}, we establish an Andr\'{a}sfai-Erd\H{o}s-S\'{o}s-type stability theorem for $\mathbb{F}$ in the $\ell_2$-norm: there exists a positive constant $\varepsilon$ such that for large $n$, every $\mathbb{F}$-free $3$-graph on $n$ vertices with minimum $\ell_2$-norm degree at least $(5/4 - \varepsilon)n^3$ must be bipartite. As a consequence, for large $n$, the balanced complete bipartite $3$-graph is the unique extremal construction for the $\ell_{2}$-norm Tur\'{a}n problem of $\mathbb{F}$, thereby confirming the conjecture of Balogh-Clemen-Lidick\'{y}.
  Our proof includes a refinement of a classical result by Ahlswede-Katona \cite{AK78} on counting stars, and the establishment of an Andr\'{a}sfai-Erd\H{o}s-S\'{o}s-type theorem for a multigraph Tur\'{a}n problem studied by Bellmann-Reiher \cite{BR19}, both of which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Hamilton decompositions of regular tripartite tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K\"uhn and Osthus conjectured in 2013 that regular tripartite tournaments are decomposable into Hamilton cycles. Somewhat surprisingly, Granet gave a simple counterexample to this conjecture almost 10 years later. In this paper, we show that the conjecture of K\"uhn and Osthus nevertheless holds in an approximate sense, by proving that every regular tripartite tournament admits an approximate decomposition into Hamilton cycles. We also study Hamilton cycle packings of directed graphs in the same regime, and show that for large $n$, every balanced tripartite digraph on $3n$ vertices which is $d$-regular for $d\ge (1+o(1))n$ admits a Hamilton decomposition.</description>

      <title>Positivity and universal Pl\"ucker coordinates for spaces of quasi-exponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20229v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quasi-exponential is an entire function of the form $e^{cu}p(u)$, where $p(u)$ is a polynomial and $c \in \mathbb{C}$. Let $V = \langle e^{h_1u}p_1(u), \dots, e^{h_Nu}p_N(u) \rangle$ be a vector space with a basis of quasi-exponentials. We show that if $h_1, \dots, h_N$ are nonnegative and all of the complex zeros of the Wronskian $\operatorname{Wr}(V)$ are real, then $V$ is totally nonnegative in the sense that all of its Grassmann-Pl\"{u}cker coordinates defined by the Taylor expansion about $u=t$ are nonnegative, for any real $t$ greater than all of the zeros of $\operatorname{Wr}(V)$. Our proof proceeds by showing that the higher Gaudin Hamiltonians $T_\lambda^G(t)$ introduced in [ALTZ14] are universal Pl\"ucker coordinates about $u=t$ for the Wronski map on spaces of quasi-exponentials. The result that $V$ is totally nonnegative follows from the fact that $T_\lambda^G(t)$ is positive semidefinite, which we establish using partial traces. We also show that if $h_1 = \cdots = h_N = 0$ then $T_\lambda^G(t)$ equals $\beta^\lambda(t)$, which is the universal Pl\"ucker coordinate for the Wronski map on spaces of polynomials introduced in [KP23].</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for mask polynomials with many cyclotomic divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a nonempty set $A \subset \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, define the mask polynomial $A(X)=\sum_{a\in A} X^a$. Suppose that there are $s_1,\dots,s_k\in\nn\setminus\{1\}$ such that the cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_{s_1},\dots,\Phi_{s_k}$ divide $A(X)$. What is the smallest possible size of $A$? For $k=1$, this was answered by Lam and Leung in 2000. Less is known about the case when $k\geq 2$; in particular, one may ask whether (similarly to the $k=1$ case) the optimal configurations have a simple ``fibered" structure on each scale involved. We prove that this is true in a number of special cases, but false in general, even if further strong structural assumptions are added. Results of this type are expected to have a broad range of applications, including Favard length of product Cantor sets, Fuglede's spectral set conjecture, and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture on integer tilings.</description>

Abstract: It has been conjectured that the toric ideal of the base ring of a discrete polymatroid is generated by symmetric exchange binomials. In the present paper, we give several classes of discrete polymatroids which yield toric ideals generated by symmetric exchange binomials. Especially, we are interested in the discrete polymatroids arising from bounded powers of edge ideals of finite graphs.</description>

      <title>The Directed Disjoint Paths Problem with Congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classic result by Fortune, Hopcroft, and Wyllie [TCS~'80] states that the directed disjoint paths problem is NP-complete even for two pairs of terminals. Extending this well-known result, we show that the directed disjoint paths problem is NP-complete for any constant congestion $c \geq 1$ and~$k \geq 3c-1$ pairs of terminals. This refutes a conjecture by Giannopoulou et al. [SODA~'22], which says that the directed disjoint paths problem with congestion two is polynomial-time solvable for any constant number $k$ of terminal pairs. We then consider the cases that are not covered by this hardness result. The first nontrivial case is $c=2$ and $k = 3$. Our second main result is to show that this case is polynomial-time solvable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider models of block-weighted random planar maps in which possibly decorated maps are decomposed canonically into blocks, each block receiving the weight $u$. These maps present a transition at some critical value $u=u_{cr}$ above which the maps degenerate into Brownian trees. We show that the enumerative properties and critical exponents of the maps at $u=u_{cr}$ and those for $u&lt;u_{cr}$ are connected by duality relations which are precisely those expected in the context of the Liouville quantum gravity description of random surfaces. We illustrate this result by various instances of block-weighted maps: random planar quadrangulations decomposed into simple blocks, Hamiltonian cycles on cubic or bicubic planar maps decomposed into irreducible blocks, and meandric systems.</description>

      <title>Which graph motif parameters count?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a fixed graph H, the function #IndSub(H,*) maps graphs G to the count of induced H-copies in G; this function obviously "counts something" in that it has a combinatorial interpretation. Linear combinations of such functions are called graph motif parameters and have recently received significant attention in counting complexity after a seminal paper by Curticapean, Dell and Marx (STOC'17). We show that, among linear combinations of functions #IndSub(H,*) involving only graphs H without isolated vertices, precisely those with positive integer coefficients maintain a combinatorial interpretation. It is important to note that graph motif parameters can be nonnegative for all inputs G, even when some coefficients are negative.
  Formally, we show that evaluating any graph motif parameter with a negative coefficient is impossible in an oracle variant of #P, where an implicit graph is accessed by oracle queries. Our proof follows the classification of the relativizing closure properties of #P by Hertrampf, Vollmer, and Wagner (SCT'95) and the framework developed by Ikenmeyer and Pak (STOC'22), but our application of the required Ramsey theorem turns out to be more subtle, as graphs do not have the required Ramsey property.
  Our techniques generalize from graphs to relational structures, including colored graphs. Vastly generalizing this, we introduce motif parameters over categories that count occurrences of sub-objects in the category. We then prove a general dichotomy theorem that characterizes which such parameters have a combinatorial interpretation. Using known results in Ramsey theory for categories, we obtain a dichotomy for motif parameters of finite vector spaces as well as parameter sets.</description>

For $m$ interaction vertices, we reduce the exponential base in complexity from $3m$ to $m+2$. The generalizations encompass many models of significant physical interest, including the SU(4) Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice, spinless fermions with frustrated interactions, SU(2) Hubbard model on Kagome lattices, \textit{etc}.</description>

      <title>Quasimodular forms arising from Jacobi's theta function and special symmetric polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ramanujan derived a sequence of even weight $2n$ quasimodular forms $U_{2n}(q)$ from derivatives of Jacobi's weight $3/2$ theta function. Using the generating function for this sequence, one can construct sequences of quasimodular forms of all nonnegative integer weights with minimal input: a weight 1 modular form and a power series $F(X)$. Using the weight 1 form $\theta(q)^2$ and $F(X)=e^{X/2}$, we obtain a sequence $\{Y_n(q)\}$ of weight $n$ quasimodular forms on $\Gamma_0(4)$ whose symmetric function avatars $\widetilde{Y}_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ are the symmetric polynomials $T_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ that arise naturally in the study of syzygies of numerical semigroups. With this information, we settle two conjectures about the $T_n(\pmb{x}^k).$ Finally, we note that these polynomials are systematically given in terms of the Borel-Hirzebruch $\widehat{A}$-genus for spin manifolds, where one identifies power sum symmetric functions $p_i$ with Pontryagin classes.</description>

Abstract: We extend the theory of infinite-exponent partition relations to arbitrary linear order types, with a particular focus on the real number line. We give a complete classification of all consistent partition relations on the real line with countably infinite exponents, and a characterisation of the statement "no uncountable-exponent partition relations hold on the real line", working throughout in ZF without the Axiom of Choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The F-conjecture gives a conjectural description of the ample cone of the Deligne-Mumford moduli space $\overline{M}_{g,n}$. We prove that the $S_n$-symmetric and the non-symmetric F-conjectures are equivalent. We also prove the Strong F-conjecture for $\overline{M}_{0,8}$ (and give an alternative proof for $\overline{M}_{0,7})$. Finally, we derive, as a consequence, the F-conjecture for the moduli space of stable curves $\overline{M}_{g}$ up to genus $g\leq 44$.</description>

      <title>Classification of Minimal Separating Sets of Low Genus Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A minimal separating set in a connected topological space $X$ is a subset $L \subset X$ with the property that $X \setminus L$ is disconnected, but if $L^{\prime}$ is a proper subset of $L$, then $X \setminus L^{\prime}$ is connected. Such sets show up in a variety of contexts. For example, in a wide class of metric spaces, if we choose distinct points p and q, then the set of points x satisfying d(x, p) = d(x, q) is a minimal separating set. In this paper we classify which topological graphs can be realized as minimal separating sets in surfaces of low genus. In general the question of whether a graph can be embedded at all in a surface is a difficult one, so our work is partly computational. We classify graphs embeddings which are minimal separating in a given genus and write a computer program to find all such embeddings and their underlying graphs.</description>

Abstract: Kriz and Thomas showed that every (finite or infinite) graph of tree-width $k \in \mathbb{N}$ admits a lean tree-decomposition of width $k$. We discuss a number of counterexamples demonstrating the limits of possible generalisations of their result to arbitrary infinite tree-width.
  In particular, we construct a locally finite, planar, connected graph that has no lean tree-decomposition.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial enumeration of lattice paths by flaws with respect to a linear boundary of rational slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $a,b$ be fixed positive coprime integers. For a positive integer $g$, write $W_k(g)$ for the set of lattice paths from the startpoint $(0,0)$ to the endpoint $(ga,gb)$ with steps restricted to $\{(1,0), (0,1)\}$, having exactly $k$ flaws (lattice points lying above the linear boundary connecting the startpoint to the endpoint). We determine $|W_k(g)|$ for all $k$ and $g$. The enumeration of lattice paths with respect to a linear boundary while accounting for flaws has a long and rich history, dating back at least to the 1949 results of Chung and Feller. The only previously known values of $|W_k(g)|$ are the extremal cases $k = 0$ and $k = g(a+b)-1$, determined by Bizley in 1954. Our main combinatorial result is that a certain subset of $W_k(g)$ is in bijection with $W_{k+1}(g)$. One consequence is that the value $|W_k(g)|$ is constant over each successive set of $a+b$ values of $k$. This in turn allows us to derive a recursion for $|W_k(g)|$ whose base case is given by Bizley's result for $k=0$. We solve this recursion to obtain a closed form expression for $|W_k(g)|$ for all $k$ and $g$. Our methods are purely combinatorial.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture on the shape-Wilf-equivalence for partially ordered patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partially ordered pattern (abbreviated POP) is a partially ordered set (poset) that generalizes the notion of a pattern when we are not concerned with the relative order of some of its letters. The notion of partially ordered patterns provides a convenient language to deal with large sets of permutation patterns. In analogy to the shape-Wilf-equivalence for permutation patterns, Burstein-Han-Kitaev-Zhang initiated the study of the shape-Wilf-equivalence for POPs which would result in the shape-Wilf-equivalence for large sets of permutation patterns. The main objective of this paper is to confirm a recent intriguing conjecture posed by Burstein-Han-Kitaev-Zhang concerning the shape-Wilf-equivalence for POPs of length $k$. This is accomplished by establishing a bijection between two sets of pattern-avoiding transversals of a given Young diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sequence of representations \(V_n\) of the symmetric group \(S_n\) is called representation (multiplicity) stable if, after some \(n\), the irreducible decomposition of \(V_n\) stabilizes. In particular, Church, Ellenburg and Farb (2015) showed that for fixed \(a\) and \(b\), the space of diagonal harmonics \(DH_n^{a,b}\) exhibits this behavior, with its dimension eventually stabilizing to a polynomial in \(n\). Building on this result, we use the Schedules Formula by Haglund and Loehr (2005) to obtain an explicit combinatorial polynomial for the dimension of the bigraded spaces \(DH_n^{a,b}\). This derivation not only yields the dimension formula but also produces a new sharp stability bound of \(a + b\), and determines the exact degree of the dimension polynomial, which is also \(a + b\).</description>

      <title>Regularization and asymmetric extremal numbers of subdivisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a real $\mu\geq 1$, a graph $H$ is $\mu$-almost-regular if $\Delta(H)\leq \mu \delta(H)$. The celebrated regularization theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits states that for every real $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$ there exists a real $\mu=\mu(\varepsilon)$ such that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\Omega(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ edges contains an $m$-vertex $\mu$-almost-regular subgraph $H$ with $\Omega(m^{1+\varepsilon})$ edges for some $n^{\varepsilon\frac{1-\varepsilon}{1+\varepsilon}}\leq m\leq n$. We develop an enhanced version of it in which the subgraph $H$ also has average degree at least $\Omega(\frac{d(G)}{\log n})$, where $d(G)$ is the average degree of $G$. We then give a bipartite analogue of the enhanced regularization theorem.
  Using the bipartite regularization theorem, we establish upper bounds on the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with part sizes $m$ and $n$ that does not contain a $2k$-subdivision of $K_{s,t}$ or $2k$-multi-subdivisions of $K_p$, thus extending the corresponding work of Janzer to the bipartite setting for even subdivisions. We show these upper bounds are tight up to a constant factor for infinitely many pairs $(m,n)$. The problem for estimating the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with part sizes $m$ and $n$ that does not contain a $(2k+1)$-subdivision of $K_{s,t}$ remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize classic mass partition results dealing with partitions using spheres, parallel hyperplanes, or axis-parallel wedges to the setting of mass assignments. In a mass assignment problem, we assign mass distributions continuously to all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and seek to guarantee the existence of a particular subspace in which more masses can be bisected than those by analyzing the problem in $\mathbb{R}^k$. We prove new mass assignment results for spheres, parallel hyperplanes, and axis-parallel wedges. The proof techniques rely on new Borsuk--Ulam type theorems on spheres and Stiefel manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We introduce inversions tableaux, a new combinatorial model for Schubert polynomials and Stanley symmetric functions that directly specializes to semi-standard Young tableaux in the Grassmannian case. They are a modification of the balanced staircase tableaux of Edelman and Greene. We explicitly describe inversions tableaux that correspond to the lexicographically minimal and maximal monomials in each Schubert polynomial and characterize the unique inversions tableau for dominant permutations. We also characterize the action of generalized chute moves on inversions tableaux, and establish related background that will be used to prove Rubey's chute moves conjecture in upcoming work.</description>

      <title>Finite approximation of free groups I: the $F$-inverse cover problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03273v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite connected graph $\mathcal{E}$ with set of edges $E$, a finite $E$-generated group $G$ is constructed such that the set of relations $p=1$ satisfied by $G$ (with $p$ a word over $E\cup E^{-1}$) is closed under deletion of generators (i.e.~edges). As a consequence, every element $g\in G$ admits a unique minimal set $\mathrm{C}(g)$ of edges (the \emph{content} of $g$) needed to represent $g$ as a word over $\mathrm{C}(g)\cup\mathrm{C}(g)^{-1}$. The crucial property of the group $G$ is that connectivity in the graph $\mathcal{E}$ is encoded in $G$ in the following sense: if a word $p$ forms a path $u\longrightarrow v$ in $\mathcal{E}$ then there exists a $G$-equivalent word $q$ which also forms a path $u\longrightarrow v$ and uses only edges from their content; in particular, the content of the corresponding group element $[p]_G=[q]_G$ spans a connected subgraph of $\mathcal{E}$ containing the vertices $u$ and $v$. As the free group generated by $E$ obviously has these properties, the construction provides another instance of how certain features of free groups can be ``approximated'' or ``simulated'' in finite groups. As an application it is shown that every finite inverse monoid admits a finite $F$-inverse cover. This solves a long-standing problem of Henckell and Rhodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the following question: Suppose that there exist an integer or a non-negative integer solution $x$ to a system $Ax = b$, where the number of non-zero components of $x$ is $n$. The target is, for a given natural number $k &lt; n$, to approximate $b$ with $Ay$ where $y$ is an integer or non-negative integer solution with at most $k$ non-zero components. We establish upper bounds for this question in general. In specific cases, these bounds are tight. If we view the approximation quality as a function of the parameter $k$, then the paper explains why the quality of the approximation increases exponentially as $k$ goes to $n$. This paper is a complete version of an extended abstract that appeared at the 26th International Conference on Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization (IPCO).</description>

Abstract: Pfender \textit{[J. Combin. Theory Ser.

Motivated by this proof, we introduce the notion of codes in pointed metric spaces (in particular on Banach spaces) and derive a nonlinear (functional) Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel-Kabatianskii-Levenshtein-Pfender upper bound for spherical codes. We also introduce nonlinear (functional) Kissing Number Problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to study the evolution of the size (i.e. the number of vertices) of the giant component of a random graph process. It is based on the exploration algorithm called simultaneous breadth-first walk, introduced by Limic in 2019, that encodes the dynamic of the evolution of the sizes of the connected components of a large class of random graph processes. We limit our study to the variant of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph process $(G_n(s))_{s\geq 0}$ with $n$ vertices where an edge connecting a pair of vertices appears at an exponential rate 1 waiting time, independently over pairs. We first use the properties of the simultaneous breadth-first walk to obtain an alternative and self-contained proof of the functional central limit theorem recently established by Enriquez, Faraud and Lemaire in the super-critical regime ($s=\frac{c}{n}$ and $c&gt;1$). Next, to show the versatility of our approach, we prove a functional central limit theorem in the barely super-critical regime ($s=\frac{1+t\epsilon_n}{n}$ where $t&gt;0$ and $(\epsilon_n)_n$ is a sequence of positive reals that converges to 0 such that $(n\epsilon_n^3)_n$ tends to $+\infty$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by partition regularity problems of homogeneous quadratic equations, we prove multiple recurrence and convergence results for multiplicative measure preserving actions with iterates given by rational sequences involving polynomials that factor into products of linear forms in two variables. We focus mainly on actions that are finitely generated, and the key tool in our analysis is a decomposition result for any bounded measurable function into a sum of two components, one that mimics concentration properties of pretentious multiplicative functions and another that mimics vanishing properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions. Crucial to part of our arguments are some new seminorms that are defined by a mixture of addition and multiplication of the iterates of the action, and we prove an inverse theorem that explicitly characterizes the factor of the system on which these seminorms vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18370v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a unified analytic framework that connects simple varieties of trees, Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes and Khinchin families. Using Lagrange's inversion formula, we derive new coefficient-based expressions for extinction probabilities and reinterpret them as boundary phenomena tied to the domain of the inverse of the solution to Lagrange's equation. This perspective reveals a structural bridge between combinatorial and probabilistic models, simplifying classical arguments and yielding new results. It also leads to a computationally efficient method for simulating Galton-Watson processes via power series coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted arithmetic mean. We also provide a characterization for the case when $m=p=2$.</description>
