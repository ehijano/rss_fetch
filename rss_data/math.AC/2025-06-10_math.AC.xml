      <title>Algebraic Geometry of Cactus, Pascal, and Pappus Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rank-three matroids, known as point-line configurations, and their associated matroid varieties, defined as the Zariski closures of their realization spaces. Our focus is on determining finite generating sets of defining equations for these varieties, up to radical, and describing the irreducible components of the corresponding circuit varieties. We generalize the notion of cactus graphs to matroids, introducing a family of point-line configurations whose underlying graphs are cacti. Our analysis includes several classical matroids, such as the Pascal, Pappus, and cactus matroids, for which we provide explicit finite generating sets for their associated matroid ideals. The matroid ideal is the ideal of the matroid variety, whose construction involves a saturation step with respect to all the independence relations of the matroid. This step is computationally very expensive and has only been carried out for very small matroids. We provide a complete generating set of these ideals for the Pascal, Pappus, and cactus matroids. The proofs rely on classical geometric techniques, including liftability arguments and the Grassmann--Cayley algebra, which we use to construct so-called bracket polynomials in these ideals. In addition, we prove that every cactus matroid is realizable and that its matroid variety is irreducible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the local cohomology modules of the binomial edge ideals of the complements of graphs of girth at least 5 using the tools introduced by \`Alvarez Montaner in arXiv:1901.08645. We then use this calculation to compute the depth, dimension, and regularity of these binomial edge ideals.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for dimensions of singularity categories and their annihilators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative noetherian ring. Denote by $\operatorname{mod} R$ the category of finitely generated $R$-modules and by $\operatorname{D^b}(R)$ the bounded derived category of $\operatorname{mod} R$. In this paper, we first investigate localizations and annihilators of Verdier quotients of $\operatorname{D^b}(R)$. After that, we explore upper bounds for the dimension of the singularity category of $R$ and its (strong) generators. We extend a theorem of Liu to the case where $R$ is neither an isolated singularity nor even a local ring. Some of our results are more generally stated in terms of Spanier--Whitehead category of a resolving subcategory.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Macaulay2 package SCMAlgebras. It provides functions for computing the modules of deficiency and the filter ideals, in order to check whether a module or an ideal is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. After the basic algebraic notions and results are recalled, the main features of the package are described through examples</description>

      <title>Bernstein-Sato functional equations for ideals in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an ideal of a regular $\cc$-algebra, its Bernstein-Sato polynomial is the monic polynomial of the lowest degree satisfying an Bernstein-Sato functional equation. We generalize the notion of Bernstein-Sato functional equations to the case of ideals in an $F$-finite ring of positive characteristic $p$, and show the relationship between these equations and Bernstein-Sato roots. By applying this theory, we provide an explicit description of Bernstein-Sato roots of a weighted homogeneous polynomial with an isolated singularity at the origin in characteristic $p$. Moreover, we give multiplicative and additive Thom-Sebastiani properties for the set of Bernstein-Sato roots, which prove the characteristic $p$ analogue of Budur and Popa's question.</description>

      <title>On minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of clique-whiskered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a minimal free resolution of the cover ideals of clique-whiskered graphs. In particular, Cohen--Macaulay chordal graphs, clique corona graphs, and Cohen--Macaulay Cameron--Walker graphs are examples of clique-whiskered graphs. We also introduce multi-clique-whiskered graphs as a generalization of both clique-whiskered graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique-whiskered graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen--Macaulay. Moreover, we provide formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of their edge ideals. Finally, we construct minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of both multi-clique-whiskered graphs and very well-covered graphs.</description>

      <title>On the distances of an element to its conjugates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a valued field $(K,v)$, with a fixed extension of $v$ to the algebraic closure $\overline K$ of $K$, and an element $\theta\in\overline K$, we are interested in the possible values of $\theta-\theta'$ where $\theta'$ runs through all the $K$-conjugates of $\theta$. The study of these values is a classic problem in number theory and ramification theory. However, the classic results focus on tame, and in particular defectless, extensions. In this paper we focus on the study of defect extensions. We want to compare the number of such values to invariants of $\theta$. The main invariant we have in mind is the depth of $\theta$. We present various examples that show that, in the defect case, none of the equivalent of the classic results are true. We also discuss the relation between the number of such values and the number of ramification ideals of the extension $(K(\theta)/K,v)$. In order to do so, we present some results about ramification ideals that have interest on their own.</description>

      <title>Specialization of Difference Equations and High Frobenius Powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study valued fields equipped with an automorphism $\sigma$ which is locally infinitely contracting in the sense that $\alpha\ll\sigma\alpha$ for all $0&lt;\alpha\in\Gamma$. We show that various notions of valuation theory, such as Henselian and strictly Henselian hulls, admit meaningful transformal analogues. We prove canonical amalgamation results, and exhibit the way that transformal wild ramification is controlled by torsors over generalized vector groups. Model theoretically, we determine the model companion: it is decidable, admits a simple axiomatization, and enjoys elimination of quantifiers up to algebraically bounded quantifiers.
  The model companion is shown to agree with the limit theory of the Frobenius action on an algebraically closed and nontrivially valued field. This opens the way to a motivic intersection theory for difference varieties that was previously available only in characteristic zero. As a first consequence, the class of algebraically closed valued fields equipped with a distinguished Frobenius $x\mapsto x^{q}$ is decidable, uniformly in $q$.</description>

      <title>Filtrations of D-modules along semi-invariant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth algebraic variety X with an action of a connected reductive linear algebraic group G, and an equivariant D-module M, we study the G-decompositions of the associated V-, Hodge, and weight filtrations.
  If M is the localization of a D-module S underlying a mixed twistor D-module (e.g. when S is simple) along a semi-invariant function, we determine the weight level of any element in an irreducible isotypic component of M in terms of multiplicities of roots of b-functions. If S underlies a pure Hodge module, we show that the Hodge level is governed by the degrees of another class of polynomials, also expressible in terms of b-functions.
  As an application, if X is an affine spherical variety, we describe these filtrations representation-theoretically in terms of roots of b-functions, and compute all higher multiplier and Hodge ideals associated with semi-invariant functions. Examples include the spaces of general, skew-symmetric, and symmetric matrices, as well as the Freudenthal cubic on the fundamental representation of E_6.</description>
