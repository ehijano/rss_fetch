      <title>Relativistic coupled cluster with completely renormalized and perturbative triples corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have implemented noniterative triples corrections to the energy from coupled-cluster with single and double excitations (CCSD) within the 1-electron exact two-component (1eX2C) relativistic framework. The effectiveness of both the CCSD(T) and the completely renormalized (CR) CC(2,3) approaches are demonstrated by performing all-electron computations of the potential energy curves and spectroscopic constants of copper, silver, and gold dimers in their ground electronic states. Spin-orbit coupling effects captured via the 1eX2C framework are shown to be crucial for recovering the correct shape of the potential energy curves, and the correlation effects due to triples in these systems changes the dissociation energies by about 0.1--0.2 eV or about 4--7\%. We also demonstrate that relativistic effects and basis set size and contraction scheme are significantly more important in Au$_2$ than in Ag$_2$ or Cu$_2$.</description>

      <title>Synergistic integration of physical embedding and machine learning enabling precise and reliable force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The machine learning force field has achieved significant strides in accurately reproducing the potential energy surface with quantum chemical accuracy. However, it still faces significant challenges, e.g., extrapolating to uncharted chemical spaces, interpreting long-range electrostatics, and mapping complex macroscopic properties. To address these issues, we advocate for a synergistic integration of physical principles and machine learning techniques within the framework of a physically informed neural network (PINN). This innovative approach involves the incorporation of physical constraints directly into the parameters of the neural network, coupled with the implementation of a global optimization strategy. We choose the AMOEBA+ force field as the physics-based model for embedding, and then train and test it using the diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) dataset as a case study. The results reveal a significant breakthrough in constructing a precise and noise-robust machine learning force field. Utilizing two training sets with hundreds of samples, our model exhibits remarkable generalization and DFT accuracy in describing molecular interactions and enables a precise prediction of the macroscopic properties such as diffusion coefficient with minimal cost. This work provides a crucial insight into establishing a fundamental framework of PINN.</description>

      <title>Can the combination of in situ differential impedance spectroscopy and 27Al NMR detect incongruent zeolite crystallization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallizing zeolites with isotropic properties is critical to the chemical industry but can be extremely challenging as small deviations in the synthesis conditions can have extreme effects on the final products. Easily implemented in-situ monitoring systems could make a real difference, but very few experimental methodologies cater to the specific needs of applications relying on harsh, hyper-alkaline conditions involving multiphasic systems such as Hydrated Silicate Ionic Liquids. Differential impedance spectroscopy (DIS) promises to enable such studies. It remains highly accurate despite possible electrode degradation or scaling. This study showcases how in-situ differential impedance measurements not only enable reliable detection of crystallization of even minimal amounts of zeolite product but also illustrates how the unique combination of in situ DIS and in situ, 27Al NMR provides insight into complex, incongruent zeolite crystallization processes.</description>

      <title>React-OT: Optimal Transport for Generating Transition State in Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition states (TSs) are transient structures that are key in understanding reaction mechanisms and designing catalysts but challenging to be captured in experiments. Alternatively, many optimization algorithms have been developed to search for TSs computationally. Yet the cost of these algorithms driven by quantum chemistry methods (usually density functional theory) is still high, posing challenges for their applications in building large reaction networks for reaction exploration. Here we developed React-OT, an optimal transport approach for generating unique TS structures from reactants and products. React-OT generates highly accurate TS structures with a median structural root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.053{\AA} and median barrier height error of 1.06 kcal/mol requiring only 0.4 second per reaction. The RMSD and barrier height error is further improved by roughly 25% through pretraining React-OT on a large reaction dataset obtained with a lower level of theory, GFN2-xTB. We envision the great accuracy and fast inference of React-OT useful in targeting TSs when exploring chemical reactions with unknown mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Beyond: Enforcing Physical Constraints in Quantum Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) accelerate simulations of quantum dissipative dynamics. Ensuring that these simulations adhere to fundamental physical laws is crucial, but has been largely ignored in the state-of-the-art NN approaches. We show that this may lead to implausible results measured by violation of the trace conservation. To recover the correct physical behavior, we develop physics-informed NNs that mitigate the violations to a good extend. Beyond that, we introduce an approach enforcing the perfect trace conservation by design.</description>

      <title>A Simple Molecular Model for Hydrated Silicate Ionic Liquids, a Realistic Zeolite Precursor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of zeolites in chemical industry, their formation process is not fully understood due to the complex and heterogeneous structure of traditional synthesis media. Hydrated silicate ionic liquids (HSILs) have been proposed as an alternative. They are truly homogeneous and transparent mixtures with low viscosity, facilitating experimental characterization. Interestingly, their homogeneous nature and simple speciation brings realistic molecular models of a zeolite growth liquid within reach for the first time. In this work, a simple molecular model is developed that gives insight into the crucial role of the alkali cations (sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium). Thereby molecular dynamics simulations are combined with experimental measurements to demonstrate that the HSIL liquid structure strongly depends on the charge density and concentration of the alkali cation. As the water content increases, it transitions from a glassy network with fast ion exchange to an aqueous solution containing long-lasting, solvated ion pairs. Furthermore, simulations reveal that the cation is capable of bringing several silicate monomers together in the glassy network, displaying perfect orientations for condensation reactions that underlie zeolite formation. This work is an important step towards the development of molecular models that can fully describe the early nucleation process of zeolites in combination with experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics and energy gradients in the framework of FMO-LC-TDDFTB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel methodology for simulating the excited-state dynamics of extensive molecular aggregates in the framework of the long-range corrected time-dependent density-functional tight-binding fragment molecular orbital method (FMO-LC-TDDFTB) combined with the mean-field Ehrenfest method. The electronic structure of the system is described in a quasi-diabatic basis composed of locally excited and charge-transfer states of all fragments. In order to carry out nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulatios, we derive and implement the excited-state gradients of the locally excited and charge-transfer states. Subsequently, the accuracy of the analytical excited-state gradients is evaluated. The applicability to the simulation of exciton transport in organic semiconductors is illustrated on a large cluster of anthracene molecules. Additionally, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations of a model system of benzothieno-benzothiophene molecules highlight the methods utility in studying charge-transfer dynamics in organic materials. Our new methodology will facilitate the investigation of excitonic transfer in extensive biological systems, nanomaterials and other complex molecular systems consisting of thousands of atoms.</description>

      <title>Managing Expectations and Imbalanced Training Data in Reactive Force Field Development: an Application to Water Adsorption on Alumina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ReaxFF is a computationally efficient model for reactive molecular dynamics simulations, which has been applied to a wide variety of chemical systems. When ReaxFF parameters are not yet available for a chemistry of interest, they must be (re)optimized, for which one defines a set of training data that the new ReaxFF parameters should reproduce. ReaxFF training sets typically contain diverse properties with different units, some of which are more abundant (by orders of magnitude) than others. To find the best parameters, one conventionally minimizes a weighted sum of squared errors over all data in the training set. One of the challenges in such numerical optimizations is to assign weights so that the optimized parameters represent a good compromise between all the requirements defined in the training set. This work introduces a new loss function, called Balanced Loss, and a workflow that replaces weight assignment with a more manageable procedure. The training data is divided into categories with corresponding "tolerances", i.e. acceptable root-mean-square errors for the categories, which define the expectations for the optimized ReaxFF parameters. Through the Log-Sum-Exp form of Balanced Loss, the parameter optimization is also a validation of one's expectations, providing meaningful feedback that can be used to reconfigure the tolerances if needed. The new methodology is demonstrated with a non-trivial parameterization of ReaxFF for water adsorption on alumina. This results in a new force field that reproduces both rare and frequent properties of a validation set not used for training. We also demonstrate the robustness of the new force field with a molecular dynamics simulation of water desorption from a $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ slab model.</description>

      <title>Isotope shift factors with quantum electrodynamics effects for many-electron systems: A study of the nuclear charge radius of $^{26m}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for calculating the field shift contribution to isotope shifts in many-electron atoms, incorporating quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects, is introduced. We also implement the model QED approach to incorporate QED contribution to the nuclear recoil effect at the high-order correlation effects treatment level. The proposed computational scheme is used to revise the value of the root-mean-square (rms) nuclear charge radius of the isomer of aluminium-26, $^{26m}$Al. This radius is important for the global analysis of the $V_{ud}$ element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. The difference in mean-square nuclear charge radii of $^{27}$Al and $^{26m}$Al, obtained by combining the calculated atomic factors with recently measured isotope shift (IS) of the $3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$ transition in Al, is $0.443(44)(19)~{\rm fm}^2$, where the first and second uncertainties are experimental and theoretical ones, respectively. The latter is reduced by a factor of 4 with respect to the previous study. Using this value and the known value of the rms charge radius of $^{27}$Al, the resultant value $R_c(^{26m}$Al) = 3.132(10)~fm is obtained. With the improved accuracy of the calculated IS factors the error in $R_c(^{26m}$Al) is now dominated by the experimental uncertainty. Similar revision of rms charge radii is made for the $^{28}$Al, $^{29}$Al, $^{30}$Al, $^{31}$Al and $^{32}$Al isotopes using existing IS measurements. Additionally, atomic factors are computed for the {$3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^24s~^2S_{1/2}$}, {$3s^23p~^2P_{1/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$} and {$3s^23p~^2P_{3/2} \to 3s^25s~^2S_{1/2}$} transitions in Al, which can be used in future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Molecular Property Predictions from Small Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a new tool in chemistry to bypass expensive experiments or quantum-chemical calculations, for example, in high-throughput screening applications. However, many machine learning studies rely on small data sets, making it difficult to efficiently implement powerful deep learning architectures such as message passing neural networks. In this study, we benchmark common machine learning models for the prediction of molecular properties on small data sets, for which the best results are obtained with the message passing neural network PaiNN, as well as SOAP molecular descriptors concatenated to a set of simple molecular descriptors tailored to gradient boosting with regression trees. To further improve the predictive capabilities of PaiNN, we present a transfer learning strategy that uses large data sets to pre-train the respective models and allows to obtain more accurate models after fine-tuning on the original data sets. The pre-training labels are obtained from computationally cheap ab initio or semi-empirical models and corrected by simple linear regression on the target data set to obtain labels that are close to those of the original data. This strategy is tested on the Harvard Oxford Photovoltaics data set (HOPV, HOMO-LUMO-gaps), for which excellent results are obtained, and on the Freesolv data set (solvation energies), where this method is unsuccessful due to a complex underlying learning task and the dissimilar methods used to obtain pre-training and fine-tuning labels. Finally, we find that the final training results do not improve monotonically with the size of the pre-training data set, but pre-training with fewer data points can lead to more biased pre-trained models and higher accuracy after fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of layered hybrid organic-inorganic metal-halide perovskites: transition metal, organic cation and perovskite phase effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structural and magnetic properties in layered hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) is key for their design and integration in spin-electronic devices. Here, we have conducted a systematic study on ten compounds to understand the effect of the transition metal (Cu$^{2+}$, Mn$^{2+}$, Co$^{2+}$), organic spacer (alkyl- and aryl-ammonium) and perovskite phase (Ruddlesden-Popper and Dion-Jacobson) on the properties of these materials. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements show that the crystals' structural phase transitions are triggered by the motional freedom of the organic cations as well as by the flexibility of the inorganic metal-halide lattice. In the case of Cu$^{2+}$ HOIPs, an increase of the in-plane anisotropy and a reduction of the octahedra interlayer distance is found to change the behavior of the HOIP from that of a 2D ferromagnet to that of a quasi-3D antiferromagnet. Mn$^{2+}$ HOIPs show inherent antiferromagnetic octahedra intralayer interactions and a phenomenologically rich magnetism, presenting spin-canting, spin-flop transitions and metamagnetism controlled by the crystal anisotropy. Co$^{2+}$ crystals with non-linked tetrahedra show a dominant paramagnetic behavior irrespective of the organic spacer and the perovskite phase. This work demonstrates that the chemical flexibility of HOIPs can be exploited to develop novel layered magnetic materials with tailored magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Photoluminescence by Strain-Engineering in Layered Perovskite Flakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain is an effective strategy to modulate the optoelectronic properties of 2D materials, but it has been almost unexplored in layered hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) due to their complex band structure and mechanical properties. Here, we investigate the temperature-dependent microphotoluminescence (PL) of 2D $(C_6H_5CH_2CH_2NH_3)_2Cs_3Pb_4Br_{13}$ HOIP subject to biaxial strain induced by a $SiO_2$ ring platform on which flakes are placed by viscoelastic stamping. At 80 K, we found that a strain of &lt;1% can change the PL emission from a single peak (unstrained) to three well-resolved peaks. Supported by micro-Raman spectroscopy, we show that the thermomechanically generated strain modulates the bandgap due to changes in the octahedral tilting and lattice expansion. Mechanical simulations demonstrate the coexistence of tensile and compressive strain along the flake. The observed PL peaks add an interesting feature to the rich phenomenology of photoluminescence in 2D HOIPs, which can be exploited in tailored sensing and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformation generation, also known as molecular unfolding (MU), is a crucial step in structure-based drug design, remaining a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. Quantum annealing (QA) has shown great potential for solving certain combinatorial optimization problems over traditional classical methods such as simulated annealing (SA). However, a recent study showed that a 2000-qubit QA hardware was still unable to outperform SA for the MU problem. Here, we propose the use of quantum-inspired algorithm to solve the MU problem, in order to go beyond traditional SA. We introduce a highly-compact phase encoding method which can exponentially reduce the representation space, compared with the previous one-hot encoding method. For benchmarking, we tested this new approach on the public QM9 dataset generated by density functional theory (DFT). The root-mean-square deviation between the conformation determined by our approach and DFT is negligible (less than about 0.5 Angstrom), which underpins the validity of our approach. Furthermore, the median time-to-target metric can be reduced by a factor of five compared to SA. Additionally, we demonstrate a simulation experiment by MindQuantum using quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to reach optimal results. These results indicate that quantum-inspired algorithms can be applied to solve practical problems even before quantum hardware become mature.</description>

Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description>

      <title>Transitions and Thermodynamics on Species Graphs of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>

Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) exhibit complex dynamics governed by their underlying network structure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to study the dynamics of CRNs by representing them on species graphs (S-graphs). By scaling concentrations by conservation laws, we obtain a graph representation of transitions compatible with the S-graph, which allows us to treat the dynamics in CRNs as transitions between chemicals. We also define thermodynamic-like quantities on the S-graph from the introduced transitions and investigate their properties, including the relationship between specieswise forces, activities, and conventional thermodynamic quantities. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this formulation can be developed for a class of irreversible CRNs, while for reversible CRNs, it is related to conventional thermodynamic quantities associated with reactions. The behavior of these specieswise quantities is numerically validated using an oscillating system (Brusselator). Our work provides a novel methodology for studying dynamics on S-graphs, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between the structure and dynamics of chemical reaction networks.</description>

Abstract: Dissolution of CO$_2$ in water followed by the subsequent hydrolysis reactions is of great importance to the global carbon cycle, and carbon capture and storage. Despite enormous previous studies, the reactions are still not fully understood at the atomistic scale. Here, we combined ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with Markov state models to elucidate the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of CO$_2$ in supercritical water both in the bulk and nanoconfined states. The integration of unsupervised learning with first-principles data allows us to identify complex reaction coordinates and pathways automatically instead of a priori human speculation. Interestingly, our unbiased modelling found a novel pathway of dissolving CO$_2$(aq) under graphene nanoconfinement, involving the pyrocarbonate anion (C$_2$O$_5^{2-}$(aq)) as an intermediate state. The pyrocarbonate anion was previously hypothesized to have a fleeting existence in water; however our study reveals that it is a crucial reaction intermediate and stable carbon species in the nanoconfined solutions. We even observed the formation of pyrocarbonic acid (H$_2$C$_2$O$_5$(aq)), which was unknown in water. The unexpected appearance of pyrocarbonates is related to the superionic behavior of the confined solutions. We also found that carbonation reactions involve collective proton transfer along transient water wires, which exhibits concerted behavior in the bulk solution but proceeds stepwise under nanoconfinement. Our study highlights the importance of large oxocarbons in aqueous carbon reactions, with great implications for the deep carbon cycle and the sequestration of CO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Surface Phase Diagrams from Nested Sampling</title>

Abstract: Studies in atomic-scale modeling of surface phase equilibria often focus on temperatures near zero Kelvin due to the challenges in calculating the free energy of surfaces at finite temperatures. The Bayesian-inference-based nested sampling (NS) algorithm allows for modeling phase equilibria at arbitrary temperatures by directly and efficiently calculating the partition function, whose relationship with free energy is well known. This work extends NS to calculate adsorbate phase diagrams, incorporating all relevant configurational contributions to the free energy. We apply NS to the adsorption of Lennard-Jones (LJ) gas particles on low-index and vicinal LJ solid surfaces and construct the canonical partition function from these recorded energies to calculate ensemble averages of thermodynamic properties, such as the constant-volume heat capacity and order parameters that characterize the structure of adsorbate phases. Key results include determining the nature of phase transitions of adsorbed LJ particles on flat and stepped LJ surfaces, which typically feature an enthalpy-driven condensation at higher temperatures and an entropy-driven reordering process at lower temperatures, and the effect of surface geometry on the presence of triple points in the phase diagrams. Overall, we demonstrate the ability and potential of NS for surface modeling.</description>

      <title>Theory of angular momentum transfer from light to molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory describing interaction of structured light, such as light carrying orbital angular momentum, with molecules. The light-matter interaction Hamiltonian we derive is expressed through couplings between spherical gradients of the electric field and the (transition) multipole moments of a particle of any non-trivial rotation point group. Our model can therefore accommodate for an arbitrary complexity of the molecular and electric field structure, and can be straightforwardly extended to atoms or nanostructures. Applying this framework to ro-vibrational spectroscopy of molecules, we uncover the general mechanism of angular momentum exchange between the spin and orbital angular momenta of light, molecular rotation and its center-of-mass motion. We show that the non-zero vorticity of Laguerre-Gaussian beams can strongly enhance certain ro-vibrational transitions that are considered forbidden in the case of non-helical light. We discuss the experimental requirements for the observation of these forbidden transitions in state-of-the-art spatially-resolved spectroscopy measurements.</description>
