      <title>Temperature and Solvent Viscosity Tune the Intermediates During the Collapse of a Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of a polymer chain in solution gets significantly affected by the temperature and the frictional forces arising due to solvent viscosity. Here, using an explicit solvent framework for polymer simulation with the liberty to tune the solvent viscosity, we study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a flexible homopolymer when it is suddenly quenched from an extended coil state in good solvent to poor solvent conditions. Results from our extensive simulations reveal that depending on the temperature $T$ and solvent viscosity, one encounters long-lived sausage-like intermediates following the usual pearl-necklace intermediates. Use of shape factors of polymers allows us to disentangle these two distinct stages of the overall collapse process, and the corresponding relaxation times. The relaxation time $\tau_s$ of the sausage stage, which is the rate-limiting stage of the overall collapse process, follows an anti-Arrhenius behavior in the high-$T$ limit, and the Arrhenius behavior in the low-$T$ limit. Furthermore, the variation of $\tau_s$ with the solvent viscosity provides evidence of internal friction of the polymer, that modulates the overall collapse significantly, analogous to what is observed for relaxation rates of proteins during their folding. This suggests that the origin of internal friction in proteins is plausibly intrinsic to its polymeric backbone rather than other specifications.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the univariant two-phase coexistence line of the tetrahydrofuran hydrate from computer simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the univariant two-phase coexistence line of the hydrate of tetrahydrofuran (THF) is determined from 100 to 1000 bar by molecular dynamics simulations. The study is carried out by putting in contact a THF hydrate phase with a stoichiometric aqueous solution phase. Following the direct coexistence technique, the pressure has been fixed, and the coexistence line has been determined by analyzing if the hydrate phase grows or melts at different values of temperature. The model of water used is the well-known TIP4P/Ice model. We have used two different models of THF based on the transferable parameters for phase equilibria-united atom approach (TraPPE-UA), the original (flexible) TraPPe-UA model as well as a rigid and planar version of it. Overall, at high pressures, small differences have been observed in the results obtained by both models. Also, large differences have been observed in the computational efforts required by the simulations performed using both models, being the rigid and planar version much faster than the original one. The effect of the unlike dispersive interactions between the water and THF molecules has been also analyzed at 250 bar using the rigid and planar THF model. In particular, we have modified the Berthelot combining rule by adding a factor ({\xi}O-THF) that modifies the unlike water-THF dispersive interactions and we have analyzed the effect on the dissociation temperature when {\xi}O-THF is modified from 1.0 (original Berthelot combining rule) to 1.4 (modified Berthelot combining rule). We have extended the study using {\xi}O-THF = 1.4 and the rigid THF model to the rest of the pressures considered in this work, finding an excellent agreement with the scarce experimental data taken from the literature.</description>

      <title>Boundary symmetry breaking of flocking systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a flocking system confined transversally between two infinite reflecting parallel walls separated by a distance $L_\perp$. Infinite or periodic boundary conditions are assumed longitudinally to the direction of collective motion, defining a ring geometry typical of experimental realizations with flocking active colloids. Such a confinement selects a flocking state with its mean direction aligned parallel to the wall, thus breaking explicitly the rotational symmetry locally by a boundary effect. Finite size scaling analysis and numerical simulations show that confinement induces an effective mass term ${M_c} \sim L_\perp^{-\zeta}$ (with positive $\zeta$ being the dynamical scaling exponent of the free theory) suppressing scale free correlations at small wave-numbers. However, due to the finite system size in the transversal direction, this effect can only be detected for large enough longitudinal system sizes (i.e. narrow ring geometries). Furthermore, in the longitudinal direction, density correlations are characterized by an anomalous effective mass term. The effective mass term also enhances the global scalar order parameter and suppresses fluctuations of the mean flocking direction. These results suggest an equivalence between transversal confinement and driving by an homogeneous external field, which breaks the rotational symmetry at the global level.</description>

      <title>Accurate estimation of the normalized mutual information of multidimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the linear Pearson correlation coefficient represents a well-established normalized measure to quantify the interrelation of two stochastic variables $X$ and $Y$, it fails for multidimensional variables such as Cartesian coordinates. Avoiding any assumption about the underlying data, the mutual information $I(X, Y)$ does account for multidimensional correlations. However, unlike the normalized Pearson correlation, it has no upper bound ($I \in [0, \infty)$), i.e., it is not clear if say, $I = 0.4$ corresponds to a low or a high correlation. Moreover, the mutual information (MI) involves the estimation of high-dimensional probability densities (e.g., six-dimensional for Cartesian coordinates), which requires a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, such as the estimator by Kraskov et al. [Phys. Rev. E 69, 066138 (2004)]. As existing methods to normalize the MI cannot be used in connection with this estimator, a new approach is presented, which uses an entropy estimation method that is invariant under variable transformations. The algorithm is numerically efficient and does not require more effort than the calculation of the (un-normalized) MI. After validating the method by applying it to various toy models, the normalized MI between the $C_{\alpha}$ -coordinates of T4 lysozyme is considered and compared to a correlation analysis of inter-residue contacts.</description>

      <title>Variational field theory of macroscopic forces in Coulomb fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the variational field theory framework, we extend our previous mean-field formalism, taking into account the electrostatic correlations of the ions. We employ a general covariant approach and derive a total stress tensor that considers the electrostatic correlations of ions. This is accomplished through an additional term that depends on the autocorrelation function of local electric field fluctuations. Utilizing the derived total stress tensor and applying the mechanical equilibrium condition, we establish a general expression for the disjoining pressure of the Coulomb fluids, confined in a pore with a slit-like geometry. Using this equation, we derive an asymptotic expression for the disjoining pressure in a slit-like pore with non-electrified conductive walls. Present theory is the basis for future modeling of the mechanical stresses that occur in electrode pores with conductive charged walls, immersed in liquid phase electrolytes beyond the mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Using a Fast Adaptive Function Approximator to calculate Protein-Filament Binding Kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cytoskeleton, consisting of biopolymer filaments, molecular motors, and passive crosslinking proteins, provides the internal structure of cells that facilitate movement, growth, and cell division. Understanding the microscopic motor-filament kinetics and dynamics is essential for comprehending macroscopic behaviors of reconstituted cytoskeletal assemblies, such as self-organized flow and active stress. In this study, we employ an adaptive fast Chebyshev approximator based on tree search and parallel computing to accurately recover the equilibrium distribution of crosslinking proteins. Therefore, it satisfies detailed balance in binding through kinetic Monte Carlo sampling while maintaining cost-effectiveness. Additionally, we offer expandable features, including segregating the simulation process via pre-building and allowing the free-loading of different closed-form formulations of the motor's potential energy. Overall, this research contributes to computational advancement in function approximation and has the potential to better describe the evolution of cytoskeletal active matter.</description>

      <title>Active nematic liquid crystals under a quenched random field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling between flow and orientation is a central issue in understanding the collective dynamics of active biofilaments and cells. Active stressess generated by motor activity destroy (quasi-)long-range orientational order and induce chaotic vortex flows. In cellular and subcellular environment, alignment is also hindered by heterogeneous filamentous structures in extracellular matrix and various organelles in a cell. Here we address the effects of a quenched random field on the flow patterns and orientational order in two-dimensional active nematic liquid crystals. We found that the director dynamics is frozen above a critical disorder strength. For sufficiently strong randomness, the orientational correlation function decays exponentially with the distance, reproducing the behavior of passive random-field nematics. In contrast, the flow velocity decreases only gradually as the randomness is increased, and develops a logarithmic spatial correlation for strong disorder. The threshold between the activity- and disorder-dominated regimes is specified and its dependence on the activity parameter is discussed.</description>

      <title>Scattered waves fuel emergent activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particles that scatter waves interact through the waves they scatter. We establish that wave-mediated interactions between dissimilar particles are generically nonreciprocal. This apparent violation of Newton's third law is allowed because the pair of particles does not constitute a closed system; the balance of the system's momentum is carried away by the scattered wave. Nonreciprocal interactions enable collections of scatterers to transduce energy out of a wave and use it to power their own motion. Such wave-matter composites therefore are a form of active matter. Their activity, however, is not an inherent property of the individual particles, nor are the particles simply driven by the wave. Instead, the particles' collective motion is an emergent property of their state of organization. This kind of emergent activity should appear in any context where objects scatter waves. As a concrete example, we combine analysis, experiment and simulation to demonstrate how nonreciprocity and emergent activity arise in collections of acoustically levitated spheres.</description>
