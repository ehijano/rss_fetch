      <title>Optimized Phase Masks for Absorption of Ultra-Broadband Pulses by Narrowband Atomic Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining genetic algorithm and a spatial light modulator we theoretically analyse how to improve a two-photon cascade absorption in atomic ensembles, inspecting the impact of various configurations and parameters in the optimized phase mask. At low atomic densities, we compare the cases of sequential transitions with the two photons coming from the same pulse or from two different pulses. For the former, we predict an enhancement by a factor of $9.5$, similar to what was previously reported in the literature [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 86}, 47 (2002)]. For the later, on the other hand, we obtain an enhancement factor of $26$ times. This absorption of two photons by different pulses is of particular interest for the storage of ultra-broadband single photons by atomic ensembles, in which case the second photon would come from a control pulse. We investigate this process as a function of the atomic density, demonstrating enhancements by factors up to 3 for the two-photon absorption after propagating through large optical depths. However, for the experimental conditions considered in the previous work by Carvalho {et al.} [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 101}, 053426 (2020)], in terms of control power and optical depths, we show that this enhancement in two-photon absorption would still result in just a modest increase of the absorption of a weak probe pulse.</description>

      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of 162Dy Rydberg levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly excited Rydberg states of lanthanides are a promising, yet largely unexplored, playground for quantum studies. Here, we report on the first high-resolution spectroscopy of 162Dy obtained by two-color trap depletion spectroscopy in a magneto-optical trap. The absolute excitation frequency of over 700 states with effective principal quantum number n between 21 and 130 is measured with an accuracy of 20 MHz. Most states are assigned to the 8 different series converging to the first 4f10(5I8)6s(2S1/2) J = 17/2 ionization potential. This energy is measured at EIP = 47901.8265 +/- 0.0008 cm-1, improving the precision of the literature value by over an order of magnitude. A multichannel quantum defect theory approach is used to benchmark and refine the assignments and to characterize six observed perturbing states belonging to higher ionization limits. These results pave the way for using dysprosium in Rydberg-based quantum architectures, leveraging the unique properties arising from its complex electronic structure. They also represent a compelling benchmark for ab-initio calculations of open-shell atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Atomic parity violation in highly charged $^{40,48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate parity-violation-induced E1 amplitudes for the $1s\rightarrow 2s$ and $1s^2 2s\rightarrow 1s^2 3s$ transitions in H- and Li-like ions of $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{208}$Pb. In our analysis, we account for neutron skin effects and nuclear uncertainties for each nucleus. We consider the spin-independent weak-interaction contribution of the $Z^0$ boson described by standard model, as well as the effects of a hypothetical new $Z'$ boson of varying mass. We conclude that the neutron-skin corrections in the $^{40,48}$Ca isotope pair can mostly be neglected when considering $Z'$ boson effects, which is an advantage for the search for new parity-violating physics. On the other hand, both the neutron skin effect and the sensitivity to hypothetical $Z'$ interactions in $^{208}$Pb is shown to be significant.</description>

      <title>Four- and six-photon stimulated Raman transitions for coherent qubit and qudit operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate transitions between electronic angular momentum states with a difference in magnetic quantum numbers $\Delta \mathrm{m_J} = $ 3, 4, and 5 via resonant four- and six-photon stimulated Raman transitions in a single trapped atom. Derivation of the corresponding Rabi frequencies, which are verified experimentally, follows the standard treatment of two-photon transitions including the adiabatic elimination of intermediate states. Finally, we discuss pathways to increase the observed multi-photon transition fidelities to $&gt;99.99\%$, providing a tool for efficient, high-fidelity control of qu\textit{d}its and single-atom logical qubits.</description>

      <title>Rapid state-resolved single-atom imaging of alkaline-earth fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local Hilbert spaces with large dimension are of key interest for quantum information with applications in quantum computing and memories, quantum simulations and metrology. Thanks to its weak coupling to external perturbations, the large ground-state nuclear spin manifold of fermionic alkaline-earth atoms is an exciting resource to explore for quantum information. Simultaneous single atom and state-resolved detection however remains an outstanding challenge limiting the development of novel quantum computing and simulation schemes beyond qubits. Here, we report on a new imaging technique enabling the simultaneous detection of up to four quantum states encoded in the nuclear spin manifold of a single fermionic strontium atom within 100 microseconds, with state-resolved detection fidelities ranging from 0.936 to 0.997. This technique is further used to track the highly coherent nuclear spin dynamics after a quench highlighting the potential of this system for quantum information. These results offer fascinating perspectives for quantum science with multi-electron atoms ranging from qudit-based quantum computing to quantum simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Degenerate mirrorless lasing in thermal vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions were made for the steady-state gain of an orthogonally polarized probe field in a degenerate two-level alkali atom system driven by a linearly polarized continuous-wave pump field in [Opt. Mem. Neural Networks 32 (Suppl 3), S443-S446 (2023)]. Employing linear response theory, we computed the probe absorption spectrum under conditions where the pump was detuned from resonance. The results revealed a sub-natural linewidth dispersive feature near the pump resonance, characterized by both gain and absorption. Furthermore, a distinct pure gain peak emerged at a sideband associated with a dressed-state transition. These phenomena are generally absent outside the ultracold regime due to inhomogeneous broadening, primarily from Doppler effects, which obscure the fine spectral structure. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the sideband gain peak is sustained in the warm vapor regime when both the pump Rabi frequency and detuning exceed the Doppler width, $\Omega_P &gt; \Delta_P \gg \Delta_{Dop}$. Our results can enable degenerate mirrorless lasing in thermal alkali atom vapors, offering a significant enhancement in the signal-to-noise ratio for fluoroscopic remote magnetic sensing applications. The theoretical model studied in this paper is also a complete description of atomic vapors with isolated $J = 2 \to J' = 3$ transitions, such as atomic samarium.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Calculations of the Static and Dynamic Polarizability of BaOH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the static and dynamic polarizability of the barium monohydroxide ($^{138}$BaOH) molecule, using relativistic coupled-cluster theory. By thoroughly investigating the dependence of the calculated polarizabilities on computational parameters (basis set size, treatment of relativity, level of treatment of electron correlation, and vibrational corrections), a procedure to determine uncertainties is constructed and applied. The dipole moment of BaOH is also calculated and compared to experiment, confirming the accuracy of the predicted polarizabilities. The static and dynamic ($\lambda=1064\;\text{nm}$) polarizability was calculated for both the ground state and the (010) vibrational bending mode, the latter state being particularly interesting for a wide range of quantum experiments. The ground state static polarizabilities were calculated to be 200.8(24) a.u. and 297(5) a.u. for the parallel and perpendicular components respectively.</description>
