      <title>Geodesics of charged particle in electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report calculations about the motion of a charged particle in an external electric and magnetic field. The metric for the particle moving on a slope with non-zero traction and coefficient of friction is also evaluated for weak fields. We have geometric solutions in terms of Finsler geometry. We show that our solution metrics belong to the ({\alpha}, \b{eta})-metric class for cases with and without motion on a slope. Further, the external magnetic field is manifested in an additional parameter in the metric. The geodesic spray coefficients under the influence of magnetic field have also been calculated. Finally, we have estimated the indicatrices and geodesics for slippery plane and cone.</description>

      <title>Remarks on "The Modification of Feynman Diagrams in Curved Space-Time"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arXiv preprint 2411.15164v1 \cite{Li:2024ltx} discusses how a weak Schwarzschild spacetime modifies Feynman diagram calculations and the governing equations of scalar and spinor particles. This short review offers an extended analysis on concerning points involving massless particles and limitations of weak-field approximation. Written for the Universit\"at Potsdam lecture \textit{New Developments in Astrophysics, Winter Semester 2024/25}.</description>

      <title>Anomalous fermions and energy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are unusual electron states surprisingly generated by the Dirac equation. The related anomalous fermion qualitatively differs from the usual electron and Majorana ones. It is formed by means of some velocity $\pmb v$, whereas the Dirac equation does not contain $\pmb v$. The anomalous wave function tends to be singular with the cut off singularity on the short length less than the Compton radius and proportional to $v$. The anomalous state is not characterized by parity quantum number due to the finite $\pmb v$. These states can be formed either by a free electron or under the action of a static potential. The anomalous wave function cannot be expanded on usual Dirac eigenfunctions. Thus the usual and anomalous fermions exist independently. The anomalous energy spectrum extends down to the energy of $-10\,GeV$. To get transitions to those levels, with photon emission, one should create in experiment the anomalous fermion that is an electron described by the anomalous wave function.</description>

      <title>2024 'Key Reflections' on the 1824 Sadi Carnot's 'Reflexions' and 200 Year Legacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This author is not a philosopher nor historian of science, but an engineering thermodynamicist. In that regard and in addition to various philosophical "why &amp; how" treatises and existing historical analyses, the physical and logical "what it is" reflections, as sequential Key Points, where a key Sadi Carnot's reasoning infers the next one, along with novel contributions and original generalizations, are presented. We need to keep in mind that in Sadi Carnot's time (early 1800s) the steam engines were inefficient (below 5%, so the heat in and out were comparable within experimental uncertainty, as if caloric were conserved), the conservation of caloric flourished (might be a fortunate misconception leading to the critical analogy with the waterwheel), and many critical thermal-concepts, including the conservation of energy (The First Law) were not even established. Since Clausius and Kelvin earned to be "Fathers of thermodynamics," then Sadi Carnot was 'the ingenious' "Forefather of thermodynamics-to-become".</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic-Complexity Duality: Embedding Computational Hardness as a Thermodynamic Coordinate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a duality between thermodynamics and computational complexity, elevating the difficulty of a computational task to the status of a thermodynamic variable. By introducing a complexity measure C as a novel coordinate, we formulate an extended first law, dU = T dS - p dV + ... + lambda dC, capturing energy costs beyond classical bit erasures. This perspective unifies ideas from Landauer's principle with the combinatorial overhead of hard (e.g., NP-complete) problems, suggesting that algorithmic intractability can manifest as an additional contribution to thermodynamic potentials. We outline how this "complexity potential" might produce phase-transition-like signatures in spin glasses, random constraint satisfaction, or advanced computing hardware near minimal dissipation. We also discuss parallels with previous geometry-information dualities, emphasize the role of complexity in shaping energy landscapes, and propose experimental avenues (in reversible computing or spin-glass setups) to detect subtle thermodynamic signatures of computational hardness. This framework opens a route for systematically incorporating complexity constraints into physical modeling, offering a novel link between the fundamental cost of computation and thermodynamic laws.</description>

      <title>Impossible Galaxies, the Hubble Tension and the Ricci soliton miracle,</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology has begun to show signs of internal inconsistencies under the relentless onslaught of precision data from the James Webb Telescope (JWST), the Hubble Telescope (HST) and other space-based observation platforms as well as those from the ground. The most statistically significant tension, the so-called Hubble Tension currently stands at between 4 {\sigma} to 6 {\sigma} statistical significance. The JWST high resolution images reveal mature and sometimes quenched galaxies at high redshifts (z&gt;6) which standard cosmological models have failed to both predict and explain. This is the impossible galaxies problem. These short comings of the standard model of cosmology have led to a plethora of new models attempting to explain the inconsistencies between theory and observation. Thus far, none of them adequately address these tensions. In this article, we demonstrate that by including a Ricci soliton into Einstein's field equations both tensions can be adequately resolved. The Ricci soliton is sourced from gravitational energy.</description>
