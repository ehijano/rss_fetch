      <title>Predicting NOx emissions in Biochar Production Plants using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global Biochar Industry has witnessed a surge in biochar production, with a total of 350k mt/year production in 2023. With the pressing climate goals set and the potential of Biochar Carbon Removal (BCR) as a climate-relevant technology, scaling up the number of new plants to over 1000 facilities per year by 2030 becomes imperative. However, such a massive scale-up presents not only technical challenges but also control and regulation issues, ensuring maximal output of plants while conforming to regulatory requirements.
  In this paper, we present a novel method of optimizing the process of a biochar plant based on machine learning methods. We show how a standard Random Forest Regressor can be used to model the states of the pyrolysis machine, the physics of which remains highly complex. This model then serves as a surrogate of the machine -- reproducing several key outcomes of the machine -- in a numerical optimization. This, in turn, could enable us to reduce NOx emissions -- a key regulatory goal in that industry -- while achieving maximal output still. In a preliminary test our approach shows remarkable results, proves to be applicable on two different machines from different manufacturers, and can be implemented on standard Internet of Things (IoT) devices more generally.</description>

      <title>Modified Baum-Welch Algorithm for Joint Blind Channel Estimation and Turbo Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind estimation of intersymbol interference channels based on the Baum-Welch (BW) algorithm, a specific implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for training hidden Markov models, is robust and does not require labeled data. However, it is known for its extensive computation cost, slow convergence, and frequently converges to a local maximum. In this paper, we modified the trellis structure of the BW algorithm by associating the channel parameters with two consecutive states. This modification enables us to reduce the number of required states by half while maintaining the same performance. Moreover, to improve the convergence rate and the estimation performance, we construct a joint turbo-BW-equalization system by exploiting the extrinsic information produced by the turbo decoder to refine the BW-based estimator at each EM iteration. Our experiments demonstrate that the joint system achieves convergence in just 4 EM iterations, which is 8 iterations less than a separate system design for a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 6 dB. Additionally, the joint system provides improved estimation accuracy with a mean square error (MSE) of $10^{-4}$. We also identify scenarios where a joint design is not preferable, especially when the channel is noisy (e.g., SNR=2 dB) and the turbo decoder is unable to provide reliable extrinsic information for a BW-based estimator.</description>

      <title>Active Sampling and Gaussian Reconstruction for Radio Frequency Radiance Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) Radiance Field reconstruction is a challenging problem. The difficulty lies in the interactions between the propagating signal and objects, such as reflections and diffraction, which are hard to model precisely, especially when the shapes and materials of the objects are unknown. Previously, a neural network-based method was proposed to reconstruct the RF Radiance Field, showing promising results. However, this neural network-based method has some limitations: it requires a large number of samples for training and is computationally expensive. Additionally, the neural network only provides the predicted mean of the RF Radiance Field and does not offer an uncertainty model. In this work, we propose a training-free Gaussian reconstruction method for RF Radiance Field. Our method demonstrates that the required number of samples is significantly smaller compared to the neural network-based approach. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty model that provides confidence estimates for predictions at any selected position in the scene. We also combine the Gaussian reconstruction method with active sampling, which further reduces the number of samples needed to achieve the same performance. Finally, we explore the potential benefits of our method in a quasi-dynamic setting, showcasing its ability to adapt to changes in the scene without requiring the entire process to be repeated.</description>

      <title>5G NR monostatic positioning with array impairments: Data-and-model-driven framework and experiment results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present an intelligent framework for 5G new radio (NR) indoor positioning under a monostatic configuration. The primary objective is to estimate both the angle of arrival and time of arrival simultaneously. This requires capturing the pertinent information from both the antenna and subcarrier dimensions of the receive signals. To tackle the challenges posed by the intricacy of the high-dimensional information matrix, coupled with the impact of irregular array errors, we design a deep learning scheme. Recognizing that the phase difference between any two subcarriers and antennas encodes spatial information of the target, we contend that the transformer network is better suited for this problem compared to the convolutional neural network which excels in local feature extraction. To further enhance the network's fitting capability, we integrate the transformer with a model-based multiple-signal-classification (MUSIC) region decision mechanism. Numerical results and field tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in accurately calibrating the irregular angle-dependent array error and improving positioning accuracy.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation based Automatic Modulation Recognition for Radio Frequency Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) critically contributes to spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access, and intelligent communications in cognitive radio systems. The introduction of deep learning has greatly improved the accuracy of AMR. However, current automatic identification methods require the input of key parameters such as the carrier frequency, which is necessary to convert the radio frequency (RF) to a base-band signal before it can be used for identification. In addition, the high complexity of deep learning models leads to high computational effort and long recognition times of existing methods, which are difficult to implement in demodulation system deployments. To address the above issues, in this paper, we first use power spectrum analysis to estimate the carrier frequency and signal bandwidth, which realizes the effective conversion from RF signals to base-band signals. This paper chooses the long short-term memory (LSTM) network as the model for automatic identification, which has low implementation complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Finally, by training the LSTM with actual sampling data combined with parameter estimation (PE), the method proposed in this paper can guarantee more than 90% format recognition accuracy.</description>

      <title>On the Joint Beamforming Design for Large-scale Downlink RIS-assisted Multiuser MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have huge potential to improve spectral and energy efficiency in future wireless systems at a minimal cost. However, early prototype results indicate that deploying hundreds or thousands of reflective elements is necessary for significant performance gains. Motivated by this, our study focuses on \emph{large-scale } RIS-assisted multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this context, we propose an efficient algorithm to jointly design the precoders at the base station (BS) and the phase shifts at the RIS to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR). In particular, leveraging an equivalent lower-dimensional reformulation of the WSR maximization problem, we derive a closed-form solution to optimize the precoders using the successive convex approximation (SCA) framework. While the equivalent reformulation proves to be efficient for the precoder optimization, we offer numerical insights into why the original formulation of the WSR optimization problem is better suited for the phase shift optimization. Subsequently, we develop a scaled projected gradient method (SPGM) and a novel line search procedure to optimize RIS phase shifts. Notably, we show that the complexity of the proposed method \emph{scales linearly with the number of BS antennas and RIS reflective elements}. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces both time and computational complexity while achieving higher WSR compared to baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>An SDR-Based Monostatic Wi-Fi System with Analog Self-Interference Cancellation for Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless sensing offers an alternative to wearables for contactless monitoring of human activity and vital signs. However, most existing systems use bistatic setups, which suffer from phase imperfections due to unsynchronized clocks. Monostatic systems overcome this issue, but are hindered by strong self-interference (SI) that require effective cancellation. We present a monostatic Wi-Fi sensing system that uses an auxiliary transmit RF chain to achieve SI cancellation levels of 40 dB, comparable to existing solutions with custom cancellation hardware. We demonstrate that the cancellation filter weights, fine-tuned using least-mean squares, can be directly repurposed for target sensing. Moreover, we achieve stable SI cancellation over 30 minutes in an office environment without fine-tuning, enabling traditional vital sign monitoring using channel estimates derived from baseband samples without the adaptation of the cancellation affecting the sensing channel -- a significant limitation in prior work. Experimental results confirm the detection of small, slow-moving targets, representative for breathing chest movements, at distances up to 10 meters in non-line-of-sight conditions.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Approaches for Harmful Brain Activity Detection Using EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of harmful brain activities, such as seizures and periodic discharges, play a vital role in neurocritical care, enabling timely diagnosis and intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive method for monitoring brain activity, but the manual interpretation of EEG signals are time-consuming and rely heavily on expert judgment. This study presents a comparative analysis of deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and EEGNet, applied to the classification of harmful brain activities using both raw EEG data and time-frequency representations generated through Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). We evaluate the performance of these models use multimodal data representations, including high-resolution spectrograms and waveform data, and introduce a multi-stage training strategy to improve model robustness. Our results show that training strategies, data preprocessing, and augmentation techniques are as critical to model success as architecture choice, with multi-stage TinyViT and EfficientNet demonstrating superior performance. The findings underscore the importance of robust training regimes in achieving accurate and efficient EEG classification, providing valuable insights for deploying AI models in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Turbo Receiver Design with Joint Detection and Demapping for Coded Differential BPSK in Bursty Impulsive Noise Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been recognized that the impulsive noise (IN) generated by power devices poses significant challenges to wireless receivers in practice. In this paper, we assess the achievable information rate (AIR) and the performance of practical turbo receiver designs for a well-established Markov-Middleton IN model. We utilize a commonly used commercial transmission setup consisting of a convolutional encoder, bit-level interleaver, and a differential binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK) symbol mapper. Firstly, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the AIRs of the underlying channel model using DBPSK transmitted symbols across various channel conditions. Additionally, we introduce two robust turbo-like receiver designs. The first design features a separate IN detector and a turbo-demapper-decoder. The second design employs a joint approach, where the extrinsic information of both the detector and demapper is simultaneously updated, forming a turbo-detector-demapper-decoder structure. We show that the joint design consistently outperforms the separate design across all channel conditions, particularly in low AIR situations. However, the maximum performance gain for the channel conditions considered in this paper is merely 0.2 dB, and the joint system incurs significantly greater computational complexity, especially for a high number of turbo iterations. The performance of the two proposed turbo receiver designs is demonstrated to be close to the estimated AIR, with a performance gap dependent on the channel parameters.</description>

      <title>A Novel Multiscale Spatial Phase Estimate with the Structure Multivector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monogenic signal (MS) was introduced by Felsberg and Sommer, and independently by Larkin under the name vortex operator. It is a two-dimensional (2D) analog of the well-known analytic signal, and allows for direct amplitude and phase demodulation of (amplitude and phase) modulated images so long as the signal is intrinsically one-dimensional (i1D). Felsberg's PhD dissertation also introduced the structure multivector (SMV), a model allowing for intrinsically 2D (i2D) structure. While the monogenic signal has become a well-known tool in the image processing community, the SMV is little used, although even in the case of i1D signals it provides a more robust orientation estimation than the MS. We argue the SMV is more suitable in standard i1D image feature extraction due to the this improvement, and extend the steerable wavelet frames of Held et al. to accommodate the additional features of the SMV. We then propose a novel quality map based on local orientation variance that yields a multiscale phase estimate which performs well even when SNR $\ge 1$. The performance is evaluated on several synthetic phase estimation tasks as well as on a fine-scale fingerprint registration task related to the 2D phase demodulation problem.</description>

      <title>Rigid Communication Topologies: Impact on Stability, Safety, Energy Consumption, Passenger Comfort, and Robustness of Vehicular Platoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of rigid communication topologies (RCTs) on the performance of vehicular platoons, aiming to identify beneficial features in RCTs that enhance vehicles behavior. We introduce four performance metrics, focusing on safety, energy consumption, passenger comfort, and robustness of vehicular platoons. The safety metric is based on momentary distances between neighboring vehicles, their relative velocities, and relative accelerations. Thus, to have access to these relative values, we formulate the coupled dynamics between pairs of neighboring vehicles, considering initial conditions (position, velocity, acceleration), leader vehicle's velocity/acceleration trajectory, deployed RCT, and vehicles' parity/disparity. By decoupling the dynamics using a mapping matrix structured on deployed RCT, vehicles' features, and control gains, precise formulations for distance errors, relative velocities, and relative accelerations between all neighboring vehicles, over the travel time, are obtained. Comparing performance metric results across RCTs highlights that downstream information transmission-from vehicles ahead, particularly the leader vehicle, to vehicles behind-significantly enhances platoon stability, safety, energy consumption, and passenger comfort metrics. Conversely, receiving state information from vehicles behind degrades metrics, compromising safety, increasing energy consumption, and reducing passenger comfort. These findings underscore that forward-looking, leader-centric communications between vehicles markedly enhance platoon efficiency and safety.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Sparse Acoustic Array Geometries for Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angle-of-Arrival estimation technology, with its potential advantages, emerges as an intriguing choice for indoor localization. Notably, it holds the promise of reducing installation costs. In contrast to ToF/TDoA based systems, AoA-based approaches require a reduced number of nodes for effective localization. This characteristic establishes a trade-off between installation costs and the complexity of hardware and software. Moreover, the appeal of acoustic localization is further heightened by its capacity to provide cost-effective hardware solutions while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. Consequently, acoustic AoA estimation technology stands out as a feasible and compelling option in the field of indoor localization. Sparse arrays additionally have the ability to estimate the DoA of more sources than available sensors by placing sensors in a specific geometry. In this contribution, we introduce a measurement platform designed to evaluate various sparse array geometries experimentally. The acoustic microphone array comprises 64 microphones arranged in an 8x8 grid, following an Uniform Rectangular Array (URA) configuration, with a grid spacing of 8.255 mm. This configuration achieves a spatial Nyquist frequency of approximately 20.8 kHz in the acoustic domain at room temperature. Notably, the array exhibits a mean spherical error of 1.26{\deg} when excluding higher elevation angles. The platform allows for masking sensors to simulate sparse array configurations. We assess four array geometries through simulations and experimental data, identifying the Open-Box and Nested array geometries as robust candidates. Additionally, we demonstrate the array's capability to concurrently estimate the directions of three emitting sources using experimental data, employing waveforms consisting of orthogonal codes.</description>

      <title>A Secure and Efficient Distributed Semantic Communication System for Heterogeneous Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communications are expected to improve the transmission efficiency in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, the distributed nature of networks and heterogeneity of devices challenge the secure utilization of semantic communication systems. In this paper, we develop a distributed semantic communication system that achieves the security and efficiency during update and usage phases. A blockchain-based trust scheme for update is designed to continuously train and synchronize the system in dynamic IoT environments. To improve the updating efficiency, we propose a flexible semantic coding method base on compressive semantic knowledge bases. It greatly reduces the amount of data shared among devices for system update, and realizes the flexible adjustment of the size of knowledge bases and the number of transmitted signal symbols in model training and inference stages. In the usage phase, a signature mechanism for lossy semantics is introduced to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of the transmitted semantics in lossy semantic communications. We further design a noise-aware differential privacy mechanism, which introduces optimized noise based on the different channel information available to heterogeneous devices. Experiments on text transmission tasks show that the proposed system achieves the protection of the integrity and privacy for exchanged semantics, and reduces the data to be transmitted in the update phase by about $35\%$ to $88\%$, and in the usage phase by $60\%$ compared with related works.</description>

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) systems have shown notable improvements in efficiency, such as reduced latency, higher data rates, and better energy efficiency. However, the resource competition among users will lead to uneven allocation, increased latency, and lower throughput. Fortunately, the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique has emerged as a promising solution for managing interference and optimizing resource allocation in MEC systems. This paper studies an IRS-assisted MEC system with RSMA, aiming to jointly optimize the passive beamforming of the IRS, the active beamforming of the base station, the task offloading allocation, the transmit power of users, the ratios of public and private information allocation, and the decoding order of the RSMA to minimize the average delay from a novel uplink transmission perspective. Since the formulated problem is non-convex and the optimization variables are highly coupled, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to optimize both continuous and discrete variables of the problem. Additionally, to better extract channel features, we design a novel network architecture within the policy and evaluation networks of the proposed algorithm, combining convolutional neural networks and densely connected convolutional network for feature extraction. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm not only exhibits excellent convergence performance but also outperforms various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust RF Fingerprint Identification Using Spectral Regrowth and Carrier Frequency Offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a promising device authentication approach by exploiting the unique hardware impairments as device identifiers. Because the hardware features are extracted from the received waveform, they are twisted with the channel propagation effect. Hence, channel elimination is critical for a robust RFFI system. In this paper, we designed a channel-robust RFFI scheme for IEEE 802.11 devices based on spectral regrowth and proposed a carrier frequency offset (CFO)-assisted collaborative identification mechanism. In particular, the spectral regrowth was utilized as a channel-resilient RFF representation which is rooted in the power amplifier nonlinearity. While CFO is time-varying and cannot be used alone as a reliable feature, we used CFO as an auxiliary feature to adjust the deep learning-based inference. Finally, a collaborative identification was adopted to leverage the diversity in a multi-antenna receiver. Extensive experimental evaluations were performed in practical environments using 10 IEEE 802.11 devices and a universal software radio peripheral (USRP) X310 receiver with 4 antennas. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method against diverse channel conditions and CFO drift, where an average classification accuracy of 92.76% was achieved against channel variations and a 5-month time span, significantly outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Sum-Rate Maximization Algorithm for Fluid Antenna-Assisted ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates a fluid antenna (FA)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, with joint antenna position optimization and waveform design. We consider enhancing the sum-rate maximization (SRM) and sensing performance with the aid of FAs. Although the introduction of FAs brings more degrees of freedom for performance optimization, its position optimization poses a non-convex programming problem and brings great computational challenges. This letter contributes to building an efficient design algorithm by the block successive upper bound minimization and majorization-minimization principles, with each step admitting closed-form update for the ISAC waveform design. In addition, the extrapolation technique is exploited further to speed up the empirical convergence of FA position design. Simulation results show that the proposed design can achieve state-of-the-art sum-rate performance with at least 60% computation cutoff compared to existing works with successive convex approximation (SCA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms.</description>

      <title>Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions and the Accuracy and Dimensionality of Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main result of this thesis is an efficient protocol to determine the frequencies of a signal $C(t)= \sum_k |a_k|^2 e^{i \omega_k t}$, which is given for a finite time, to a high degree of precision. Specifically, we develop a theorem that provides a fundamental precision guarantee. Additionally, we establish an approximation theory for spectral analysis through low-dimensional subspaces that can be applied to a wide range of problems. The signal processing routine relies on a symmetry between harmonic analysis and quantum mechanics. In this context, prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF) are identified as the optimal information processing basis. To establish rigorous precision guarantees, we extend the concentration properties of PSWFs to a supremum bound and an $\ell_2$ bound on their derivatives. The new bounds allow us to refine the truncation estimates for the prolate sampling formula. We also provide a new geometrical insight into the commutation relation between an integral operator and a differential operator, both of which have PSWFs as eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Synthesis Denoisers for Forward-Backward Plug-and-Play Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the behavior of the forward-backward (FB) algorithm when the proximity operator is replaced by a sub-iterative procedure to approximate a Gaussian denoiser, in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion. In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</description>
