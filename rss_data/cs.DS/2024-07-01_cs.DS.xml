      <title>Near Optimal Dual Fault Tolerant Distance Oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dual fault-tolerant distance oracle for undirected and unweighted graphs. Given a set $F$ of two edges, as well as a source node $s$ and a destination node $t$, our oracle returns the length of the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ that avoids $F$ in $O(1)$ time with a high probability. The space complexity of our oracle is $\Tilde{O}(n^2)$ \footnote{$\Tilde{O}$ hides poly$\log n$ factor }, making it nearly optimal in terms of both space and query time. Prior to our work, Pettie and Duan [SODA 2009] designed a dual fault-tolerant distance oracle that required $\Tilde{O}(n^2)$ space and $O(\log n)$ query time. In addition to improving the query time, our oracle is much simpler than the previous approach.</description>

      <title>Steiner Tree Parameterized by Multiway Cut and Even Less</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Steiner Tree problem we are given an undirected edge-weighted graph as input, along with a set $K$ of vertices called terminals. The task is to output a minimum-weight connected subgraph that spans all the terminals. The famous Dreyfus-Wagner algorithm running in $3^{|K|} \mathsf{poly}(n)$ time shows that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the number of terminals. We present fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for Steiner Tree using structurally smaller parameterizations.
  Our first result concerns the parameterization by a multiway cut $S$ of the terminals, which is a vertex set $S$ (possibly containing terminals) such that each connected component of $G-S$ contains at most one terminal. We show that Steiner Tree can be solved in $2^{O(|S|\log|S|)}\mathsf{poly}(n)$ time and polynomial space, where $S$ is a minimum multiway cut for $K$. The algorithm is based on the insight that, after guessing how an optimal Steiner tree interacts with a multiway cut $S$, computing a minimum-cost solution of this type can be formulated as minimum-cost bipartite matching.
  Our second result concerns a new hybrid parameterization called $K$-free treewidth that simultaneously refines the number of terminals $|K|$ and the treewidth of the input graph. By utilizing recent work on $\mathcal{H}$-Treewidth in order to find a corresponding decomposition of the graph, we give an algorithm that solves Steiner Tree in time $2^{O(k)} \mathsf{poly}(n)$, where $k$ denotes the $K$-free treewidth of the input graph. To obtain this running time, we show how the rank-based approach for solving Steiner Tree parameterized by treewidth can be extended to work in the setting of $K$-free treewidth, by exploiting existing algorithms parameterized by $|K|$ to compute the table entries of leaf bags of a tree $K$-free decomposition.</description>

      <title>Fully Dynamic k-Means Coreset in Near-Optimal Update Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in this paper the problem of maintaining a solution to $k$-median and $k$-means clustering in a fully dynamic setting. To do so, we present an algorithm to efficiently maintain a coreset, a compressed version of the dataset, that allows easy computation of a clustering solution at query time. Our coreset algorithm has near-optimal update time of $\tilde O(k)$ in general metric spaces, which reduces to $\tilde O(d)$ in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. The query time is $O(k^2)$ in general metrics, and $O(kd)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  To maintain a constant-factor approximation for $k$-median and $k$-means clustering in Euclidean space, this directly leads to an algorithm update time $\tilde O(d)$, and query time $\tilde O(kd + k^2)$. To maintain a $O(polylog~k)$-approximation, the query time is reduced to $\tilde O(kd)$.</description>

      <title>Maximum Bipartite vs. Triangle-Free Subgraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a (multi)graph $G$ which contains a bipartite subgraph with $\rho$ edges, what is the largest triangle-free subgraph of $G$ that can be found efficiently? We present an SDP-based algorithm that finds one with at least $0.8823 \rho$ edges, thus improving on the subgraph with $0.878 \rho$ edges obtained by the classic Max-Cut algorithm of Goemans and Williamson. On the other hand, by a reduction from Hastad's 3-bit PCP we show that it is NP-hard to find a triangle-free subgraph with $(25 / 26 + \epsilon) \rho \approx (0.961 + \epsilon) \rho$ edges.
  As an application, we classify the Maximum Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problem MaxPCSP($G$,$H$) for all bipartite $G$: Given an input (multi)graph $X$ which admits a $G$-colouring satisfying $\rho$ edges, find an $H$-colouring of $X$ that satisfies $\rho$ edges. This problem is solvable in polynomial time, apart from trivial cases, if $H$ contains a triangle, and is NP-hard otherwise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This text provides an introduction to the field of distributed local algorithms -- an area at the intersection of theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics. We collect many recent results in the area and demonstrate how they lead to a clean theory. We also discuss many connections of local algorithms to areas such as parallel, distributed, and sublinear algorithms, or descriptive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Resilient functions: Optimized, simplified, and generalized</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $n$-bit boolean function is resilient to coalitions of size $q$ if any fixed set of $q$ bits is unlikely to influence the function when the other $n-q$ bits are chosen uniformly. We give explicit constructions of depth-$3$ circuits that are resilient to coalitions of size $cn/\log^{2}n$ with bias $n^{-c}$. Previous explicit constructions with the same resilience had constant bias. Our construction is simpler and we generalize it to biased product distributions.
  Our proof builds on previous work; the main differences are the use of a tail bound for expander walks in combination with a refined analysis based on Janson's inequality.</description>

      <title>Instance-Optimal Private Density Estimation in the Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the density of a distribution from samples is a fundamental problem in statistics. In many practical settings, the Wasserstein distance is an appropriate error metric for density estimation. For example, when estimating population densities in a geographic region, a small Wasserstein distance means that the estimate is able to capture roughly where the population mass is. In this work we study differentially private density estimation in the Wasserstein distance. We design and analyze instance-optimal algorithms for this problem that can adapt to easy instances.
  For distributions $P$ over $\mathbb{R}$, we consider a strong notion of instance-optimality: an algorithm that uniformly achieves the instance-optimal estimation rate is competitive with an algorithm that is told that the distribution is either $P$ or $Q_P$ for some distribution $Q_P$ whose probability density function (pdf) is within a factor of 2 of the pdf of $P$. For distributions over $\mathbb{R}^2$, we use a different notion of instance optimality. We say that an algorithm is instance-optimal if it is competitive with an algorithm that is given a constant-factor multiplicative approximation of the density of the distribution. We characterize the instance-optimal estimation rates in both these settings and show that they are uniformly achievable (up to polylogarithmic factors). Our approach for $\mathbb{R}^2$ extends to arbitrary metric spaces as it goes via hierarchically separated trees. As a special case our results lead to instance-optimal private learning in TV distance for discrete distributions.</description>

      <title>The periodic structure of local consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We connect the mixing behaviour of random walks over a graph to the power of the local-consistency algorithm for the solution of the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). We extend this connection to arbitrary CSPs and their promise variant. In this way, we establish a linear-level (and, thus, optimal) lower bound against the local-consistency algorithm applied to the class of aperiodic promise CSPs. The proof is based on a combination of the probabilistic method for random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi hypergraphs and a structural result on the number of fibers (i.e., long chains of hyperedges) in sparse hypergraphs of large girth. As a corollary, we completely classify the power of local consistency for the approximate graph homomorphism problem by establishing that, in the nontrivial cases, the problem has linear width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consistent hashing is employed in distributed systems and networking applications to evenly and effectively distribute data across a cluster of nodes. This paper introduces BinomialHash, a consistent hashing algorithm that operates in constant time and requires minimal memory. We provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm, offer a pseudo-code implementation, and formally establish its strong theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Prophet Inequalities: Separating Random Order from Order Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04024v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a central object of study in optimal stopping theory. A gambler is sent values in an online fashion, sampled from an instance of independent distributions, in an adversarial, random or selected order, depending on the model. When observing each value, the gambler either accepts it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  The model, in which the gambler selects the arrival order first, and then observes the values, is known as Order Selection. In this model a ratio of $0.7251$ is attainable for any instance. Recently, this has been improved up to $0.7258$ by Bubna and Chiplunkar (2023). If the gambler chooses the arrival order (uniformly) at random, we obtain the Random Order model. The worst case ratio over all possible instances has been extensively studied for at least $40$ years. Through simulations, Bubna and Chiplunkar (2023) also showed that this ratio is at most $0.7254$ for the Random Order model, thus establishing for the first time that carefully choosing the order, instead of simply taking it at random, benefits the gambler. We give an alternative, non-simulation-assisted proof of this fact, by showing mathematically that in the Random Order model, no algorithm can achieve a ratio larger than $0.7235$. This sets a new state-of-the-art hardness for this model, and establishes more formally that there is a real benefit in choosing the order.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for Sorting Under Partial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sorting has a natural generalization where the input consists of: (1) a ground set $X$ of size $n$, (2) a partial oracle $O_P$ specifying some fixed partial order $P$ on $X$ and (3) a linear oracle $O_L$ specifying a linear order $L$ that extends $P$. The goal is to recover the linear order $L$ on $X$ using the fewest number of linear oracle queries.
  In this problem, we measure algorithmic complexity through three metrics: oracle queries to $O_L$, oracle queries to $O_P$, and the time spent. Any algorithm requires worst-case $\log_2 e(P)$ linear oracle queries to recover the linear order on $X$.
  Kahn and Saks presented the first algorithm that uses $\Theta(\log e(P))$ linear oracle queries (using $O(n^2)$ partial oracle queries and exponential time). The state-of-the-art for the general problem is by Cardinal, Fiorini, Joret, Jungers and Munro who at STOC'10 manage to separate the linear and partial oracle queries into a preprocessing and query phase. They can preprocess $P$ using $O(n^2)$ partial oracle queries and $O(n^{2.5})$ time. Then, given $O_L$, they uncover the linear order on $X$ in $\Theta(\log e(P))$ linear oracle queries and $O(n + \log e(P))$ time -- which is worst-case optimal in the number of linear oracle queries but not in the time spent.
  For $c \geq 1$, our algorithm can preprocess $O_P$ using $O(n^{1 + \frac{1}{c}})$ queries and time. Given $O_L$, we uncover $L$ using $\Theta(c \log e(P))$ queries and time. We show a matching lower bound, as there exist positive constants $(\alpha, \beta)$ where for any constant $c \geq 1$, any algorithm that uses at most $\alpha \cdot n^{1 + \frac{1}{c}}$ preprocessing must use worst-case at least $\beta \cdot c \log e(P)$ linear oracle queries. Thus, we solve the problem of sorting under partial information through an algorithm that is asymptotically tight across all three metrics.</description>

      <title>Geometric Thickness of Multigraphs is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a (multi)graph $G = (V,E)$ has geometric thickness $t$ if there exists a straight-line drawing $\varphi : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ and a $t$-coloring of its edges where no two edges sharing a point in their relative interior have the same color. The \textsc{Geometric Thickness} problem asks whether a given multigraph has geometric thickness at most $t$. This problem was shown to be NP-hard for $t=2$ [Durocher, Gethner, and Mondal, CG 2016]. In this paper, we settle the computational complexity of \textsc{Geometric Thickness} by showing that it is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete already for thickness $30$. Moreover, our reduction shows that the problem is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete for $4392$-planar graphs, where a graph is $k$-planar if it admits a topological drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge. In the course of our paper, we answer previous questions on geometric thickness and on other related problems, in particular that simultaneous graph embeddings of $31$ edge-disjoint graphs and pseudo-segment stretchability with chromatic number $30$ are $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete.</description>
