      <title>On Closure Properties of Read-Once Oblivious Algebraic Branching Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the closure properties of read-once oblivious Algebraic Branching Programs (roABPs) under various natural algebraic operations and prove the following.
  - Non-closure under factoring: There is a sequence of explicit polynomials $(f_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n))_n$ that have $\mathsf{poly}(n)$-sized roABPs such that some irreducible factor of $f_n$ does not have roABPs of superpolynomial size in any order.
  - Non-closure under powering: There is a sequence of polynomials $(f_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n))_n$ with $\mathsf{poly}(n)$-sized roABPs such that any super-constant power of $f_n$ does not have roABPs of polynomial size in any order (and $f_n^n$ requires exponential size in any order).
  - Non-closure under symmetric compositions: There are symmetric polynomials $(f_n(e_1,\ldots, e_n))_n$ that have roABPs of polynomial size such that $f_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n)$ do not have roABPs of subexponential size. (Here, $e_1,\ldots, e_n$ denote the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables.)
  These results should be viewed in light of known results on models such as algebraic circuits, (general) algebraic branching programs, formulas and constant-depth circuits, all of which are known to be closed under these operations.
  To prove non-closure under factoring, we construct hard polynomials based on expander graphs using gadgets that lift their hardness from sparse polynomials to roABPs. For symmetric compositions, we show that the circulant polynomial requires roABPs of exponential size in every variable order.</description>

      <title>Man, these New York Times games are hard! A computational perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The New York Times (NYT) games have found widespread popularity in recent years and reportedly account for an increasing fraction of the newspaper's readership. In this paper, we bring the computational lens to the study of New York Times games and consider four of them not previously studied: Letter Boxed, Pips, Strands and Tiles. We show that these games can be just as hard as they are fun. In particular, we characterize the hardness of several variants of computational problems related to these popular puzzle games. For Letter Boxed, we show that deciding whether an instance is solvable is in general NP-Complete, while in some parameter settings it can be done in polynomial time. Similarly, for Pips we prove that deciding whether a puzzle has a solution is NP-Complete even in some restricted classes of instances. We then show that one natural computational problem arising from Strands is NP-Complete in most parameter settings. Finally, we demonstrate that deciding whether a Tiles puzzle is solvable with a single, uninterrupted combo requires polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for planar Arithmetic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arithmetic circuits are a natural well-studied model for computing multivariate polynomials over a field. In this paper, we study planar arithmetic circuits. These are circuits whose underlying graph is planar. In particular, we prove an $\Omega(n\log n)$ lower bound on the size of planar arithmetic circuits computing explicit bilinear forms on $2n$ variables. As a consequence, we get an $\Omega(n\log n)$ lower bound on the size of arithmetic formulas and planar algebraic branching programs computing explicit bilinear forms on $2n$ variables. This is the first such lower bound on the formula complexity of an explicit bilinear form. In the case of read-once planar circuits, we show $\Omega(n^2)$ size lower bounds for computing explicit bilinear forms on $2n$ variables. Furthermore, we prove fine separations between the various planar models of computations mentioned above.
  In addition to this, we look at multi-output planar circuits and show $\Omega(n^{4/3})$ size lower bound for computing an explicit linear transformation on $n$-variables. For a suitable definition of multi-output formulas, we extend the above result to get an $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$ size lower bound. As a consequence, we demonstrate that there exists an $n$-variate polynomial computable by an $n^{1 + o(1)}$-sized formula such that any multi-output planar circuit (resp., multi-output formula) simultaneously computing all its first-order partial derivatives requires size $\Omega(n^{4/3})$ (resp., $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$). This shows that a statement analogous to that of Baur, Strassen (1983) does not hold in the case of planar circuits and formulas.</description>

      <title>Efficient Polynomial Identity Testing Over Nonassociative Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design the first efficient polynomial identity testing algorithms over the nonassociative polynomial algebra. In particular, multiplication among the formal variables is commutative but it is not associative. This complements the strong lower bound results obtained over this algebra by Hrube\v{s}, Yehudayoff, and Wigderson (2010) and Fijalkow, Lagarde, Ohlmann, and Serre (2021) from the identity testing perspective. Our main results are the following:
  (1) We construct nonassociative algebras (both commutative and noncommutative) which have no low degree identities. As a result, we obtain the first Amitsur-Levitzki type theorems over nonassociative polynomial algebras. As a direct consequence, we obtain randomized polynomial-time black-box PIT algorithms for nonassociative polynomials which allow evaluation over such algebras.
  (2) On the derandomization side, we give a deterministic polynomial-time identity testing algorithm for nonassociative polynomials given by arithmetic circuits in the white-box setting. Previously, such an algorithm was known with the additional restriction of noncommutativity.
  (3) In the black-box setting, we construct a hitting set of quasipolynomial-size for nonassociative polynomials computed by arithmetic circuits of small depth. Understanding the black-box complexity of identity testing, even in the randomized setting, was open prior to our work.</description>

      <title>A Dichotomy Theorem for Multi-Pass Streaming CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a dichotomy result for $p$-pass streaming algorithms for all CSPs and for up to polynomially many passes. More precisely, we prove that for any arity parameter $k$, finite alphabet $\Sigma$, collection $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-ary predicates over $\Sigma$ and any $c\in (0,1)$, there exists $0&lt;s\leq c$ such that:
  1. For any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there is a constant pass, $O_{\varepsilon}(\log n)$-space randomized streaming algorithm solving the promise problem $\text{MaxCSP}(\mathcal{F})[c,s-\varepsilon]$. That is, the algorithm accepts inputs with value at least $c$ with probability at least $2/3$, and rejects inputs with value at most $s-\varepsilon$ with probability at least $2/3$.
  2. For all $\varepsilon&gt;0$, any $p$-pass (even randomized) streaming algorithm that solves the promise problem $\text{MaxCSP}(\mathcal{F})[c,s+\varepsilon]$ must use $\Omega_{\varepsilon}(n^{1/3}/p)$ space.
  Our approximation algorithm is based on a certain linear-programming relaxation of the CSP and on a distributed algorithm that approximates its value. This part builds on the works [Yoshida, STOC 2011] and [Saxena, Singer, Sudan, Velusamy, SODA 2025]. For our hardness result we show how to translate an integrality gap of the linear program into a family of hard instances, which we then analyze via studying a related communication complexity problem. That analysis is based on discrete Fourier analysis and builds on a prior work of the authors and on the work [Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, Velingker, Velusamy, J.ACM 2024].</description>

      <title>On guarded extensions of MMSNP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04234v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feder and Vardi showed that the class Monotone Monadic SNP without inequality (MMSNP) has a P vs NP-complete dichotomy if and only if such a dichotomy holds for finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Moreover, they showed that none of the three classes obtained by removing one of the defining properties of MMSNP (monotonicity, monadicity, no inequality) has a dichotomy. The overall objective of this paper is to study the gaps between MMSNP and each of these three superclasses, where the existence of a dichotomy remains unknown. For the gap between MMSNP and Monotone SNP without inequality, we study the class Guarded Monotone SNP without inequality (GMSNP) introduced by Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter, and prove that GMSNP has a dichotomy if and only if a dichotomy holds for GMSNP problems over signatures consisting of a unique relation symbol. For the gap between MMSNP and MMSNP with inequality, we introduce a new class MMSNP with guarded inequality, that lies between MMSNP and MMSNP with inequality and that is strictly more expressive than the former and still has a dichotomy. For the gap between MMSNP and Monadic SNP without inequality, we introduce a logic that extends the class of Matrix Partitions in a similar way how MMSNP extends finite-domain CSP, and pose an open question about the existence of a dichotomy for this class. Finally, we revisit the theorem of Feder and Vardi, which claims that the class NP embeds into MMSNP with inequality. We give a detailed proof of this theorem as it ensures no dichotomy for the right-hand side class of each of the three gaps.</description>

      <title>The Planted Orthogonal Vectors Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $k$-Orthogonal Vectors ($k$-OV) problem we are given $k$ sets, each containing $n$ binary vectors of dimension $d=n^{o(1)}$, and our goal is to pick one vector from each set so that at each coordinate at least one vector has a zero. It is a central problem in fine-grained complexity, conjectured to require $n^{k-o(1)}$ time in the worst case.
  We propose a way to \emph{plant} a solution among vectors with i.i.d. $p$-biased entries, for appropriately chosen $p$, so that the planted solution is the unique one. Our conjecture is that the resulting $k$-OV instances still require time $n^{k-o(1)}$ to solve, \emph{on average}.
  Our planted distribution has the property that any subset of strictly less than $k$ vectors has the \emph{same} marginal distribution as in the model distribution, consisting of i.i.d. $p$-biased random vectors. We use this property to give average-case search-to-decision reductions for $k$-OV.</description>

      <title>Sign-Rank of $k$-Hamming Distance is Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the sign-rank of the $k$-Hamming Distance matrix on $n$ bits is $2^{O(k)}$, independent of the number of bits $n$. This strongly refutes the conjecture of Hatami, Hatami, Pires, Tao, and Zhao (RANDOM 2022), and Hatami, Hosseini, and Meng (STOC 2023), repeated in several other papers, that the sign-rank should depend on $n$. This conjecture would have qualitatively separated margin from sign-rank (or, equivalently, bounded-error from unbounded-error randomized communication). In fact, our technique gives constant sign-rank upper bounds for all matrices which reduce to $k$-Hamming Distance, as well as large-margin matrices recently shown to be irreducible to $k$-Hamming Distance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computation with Correlated Measurements: Implications for the Complexity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2004, Aaronson introduced the complexity class $\mathsf{PostBQP}$ ($\mathsf{BQP}$ with postselection) and showed that it is equal to $\mathsf{PP}$. In this paper, we define a new complexity class, $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$, a modification of $\mathsf{BQP}$ which has the power to perform correlated measurements, i.e. measurements that output the same value across a partition of registers. We show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is exactly equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$, placing it "just above" $\mathsf{PP}$. In fact, we show that other metaphysical modifications of $\mathsf{BQP}$, such as $\mathsf{CBQP}$ (i.e. $\mathsf{BQP}$ with the ability to clone arbitrary quantum states), are also equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Furthermore, we show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is self-low with respect to classical queries. In contrast, if it were self-low under quantum queries, the counting hierarchy ($\mathsf{CH}$) would collapse to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Finally, we introduce a variant of rational degree that lower-bounds the query complexity of $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14326v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward.
  This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is tight.
  Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage. Our protocol can be naturally extended to a protocol that learns the eigenvalues of Pauli terms within any subset $A$ of a Pauli channel with $O(\log\log(|A|)/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements.</description>

      <title>New Lower-bounds for Quantum Computation with Non-Collapsing Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons and Lee introduced the complexity class PDQP (which was original labeled naCQP), an alteration of BQP enhanced with the ability to obtain non-collapsing measurements, samples of quantum states without collapsing them. Although PDQP contains SZK, it still requires $\Omega(N^{1/4})$ queries to solve unstructured search. We formulate an alternative equivalent definition of PDQP, which we use to prove the positive weighted adversary lower-bounding method, establishing multiple tighter bounds and a trade-off between queries and non-collapsing measurements. We utilize the technique in order to analyze the query complexity of the well-studied majority and element distinctness problems. Additionally, we prove a tight $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ bound on search. Furthermore, we use the lower-bound to explore PDQP under query restrictions, finding that when combined with non-adaptive queries, we limit the speed-up in several cases.</description>

      <title>Testing classical properties from quantum data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Properties of Boolean functions can often be tested much faster than the functions can be learned. However, this advantage usually disappears when testers are limited to random samples of a function $f$--a natural setting for data science--rather than queries. In this work we initiate the study of a quantum version of this "data science scenario": quantum algorithms that test properties of $f$ solely from quantum data in the form of copies of the function state $|f\rangle \propto \sum_x|x,f(x)\rangle$.
  $\bullet$ New tests. For three well-established properties--monotonicity, symmetry, and triangle-freeness--we show that the speedup lost when restricting classical testers to sampled data can be recovered by quantum algorithms operating solely from quantum data.
  $\bullet$ Inadequacy of Fourier sampling. Our new testers use techniques beyond quantum Fourier sampling, and we show that this necessary. In particular, there is no constant-complexity tester for symmetry relying solely on Fourier sampling and random classical samples.
  $\bullet$ Classical queries vs. quantum data. We exhibit a testing problem that can be solved from $O(1)$ classical queries but that requires $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ function state copies. The Forrelation problem provides a separation of the same magnitude in the opposite direction, so we conclude that quantum data and classical queries are "maximally incomparable" resources for testing.
  $\bullet$ Towards lower bounds. We also begin the study of lower bounds for testing from quantum data. For quantum monotonicity testing, we prove that the ensembles of Goldreich et al. (2000) and Black (2023), which give exponential lower bounds for classical sample-based testing, do not yield any nontrivial lower bounds for testing from quantum data. New insights specific to quantum data will be required for proving copy complexity lower bounds for testing in this model.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Frobenius Number via Gomory's Relaxation and Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*}
  \exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*}
  \exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*}
  In this work, we show that \begin{equation*}
  F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$.
  From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$.
  Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.</description>
