      <title>Current status of the CMS Inner Tracker upgrade for HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the High Luminosity programme of the LHC collider (called HL-LHC), planned to start in 2030, the instantaneous luminosity will be increased from \num{\sim 2e34}~\si{cm^{-2}s^{-1}} to an unprecedented figure of about \num{\sim 7.5e34}~\si{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}. This will allow the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) to collect up to \num{\sim 4000}~\si{fb^{-1}} of integrated luminosity over a decade.
  In order to cope with the much higher pp-collisions rate, CMS will undergo an extensive improvement known as \pII upgrade: in particular, the silicon tracker system will be entirely replaced to comply with the extremely challenging experimental conditions.
  This contribution will review the main upgrades of the CMS Inner Tracker and will present the most relevant design and technological choices. Moreover, the ongoing validation of prototypes and the preparation for the large-scale production will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Design and FPGA Implementation of WOMBAT: A Deep Neural Network Level-1 Trigger System for Jet Substructure Identification and Boosted $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ Tagging at the CMS Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the physics performance, trigger efficiency, and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of machine learning (ML)-based algorithms for Lorentz-boosted $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ tagging within the CMS Level-1 Trigger (L1T) under Phase-1 conditions. The proposed algorithm, WOMBAT (Wide Object ML Boosted Algorithm Trigger), comprises a high-performance Master Model (W-MM) and a quantized, FPGA-synthesizable Apprentice Model (W-AM), benchmarked against the standard Single Jet 180 and the custom rule-based JEDI (Jet Event Deterministic Identifier) triggers.
  All algorithms process calorimeter trigger primitive data to localize boosted $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ jets. Outputs are post-processed minimally to yield real-valued $(\eta, \phi)$ jet coordinates at trigger tower granularity.
  Trigger rates are evaluated using 2023 CMS ZeroBias data (0.64 fb$^{-1}$), with efficiency assessed via a Monte Carlo sample of $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ offline reconstructed AK8 jets. W-MM achieves a 1 kHz rate at an offline jet $p_T$ threshold of 146.8 GeV, 40.6 GeV lower than Single Jet 180, while maintaining comparable signal efficiency. W-AM reduces the threshold further to 140.4 GeV, with reduced efficiency due to fixed-output constraints and limited multi-jet handling.
  FPGA implementation targeting the Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX690T confirms that W-AM meets resource constraints with a pre-place-and-route latency of 22 clock cycles (137.5 ns). In contrast, JEDI requires excessive resource usage and a 56-cycle latency, surpassing the 14-cycle L1T budget.
  Originally developed for Run-3 CMS L1T, WOMBAT serves as a proof-of-concept for Phase-2 triggers, where hardware advances will enable online deployment of more sophisticated ML-based L1T systems.</description>

      <title>STORI2024: Tests of Amorphous Carbon-coated Storage Cells for a Polarized Gas Target at LHCb and Further Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the LHC beams cannot be polarized, introducing a dense polarized gas target at the LHCb experiment at CERN, to be operated concurrently with beam-beam collisions, will facilitate fixed-target interactions to explore a new energy regime of spin physics measurements. Unfortunately, typical surface coatings, such as water, Teflon, or aluminum, commonly used to avoid polarization losses, are prohibited due to restrictions imposed by vacuum and beam policies. Using the former atomic beam source for the polarized target at ANKE/COSY (Forschungszentrum J\"ulich), an accompanying Lamb-shift polarimeter and a storage cell chamber inside a superconducting magnet, provide a perfect test stand to investigate the properties of a storage cell coated with amorphous carbon. A significant recombination rate, ranging from $93\%$ to $100\%$, as well as preservation of polarization during recombination surpassing $74\%$, were observed. We successfully produced H$_2$ molecules with a nuclear polarization of P$\sim 0.59$. In addition, we could produce polarized H$_3^+$ ions for the first time and observed the shift of the axis of rotation within HD molecules.</description>

      <title>The High Voltage Splitter board for the JUNO SPMT system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) in southern China is designed to study neutrinos from nuclear reactors and natural sources to address fundamental questions in neutrino physics. Achieving its goals requires continuous operation over a 20-year period. The small photomultiplier tube (small PMT or SPMT) system is a subsystem within the experiment composed of 25600 3-inch PMTs and their associated readout electronics. The High Voltage Splitter (HVS) is the first board on the readout chain of the SPMT system and services the PMTs by providing high voltage for biasing and by decoupling the generated physics signal from the high-voltage bias for readout, which is then fed to the front-end board. The necessity to handle high voltage, manage a large channel count, and operate stably for 20 years imposes significant constraints on the physical design of the HVS. This paper serves as a comprehensive documentation of the HVS board: its role in the SPMT readout system, the challenges in its design, performance and reliability metrics, and the methods employed for production and quality control.</description>

      <title>Compensated LGAD optimisation through van der Pauw test structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new gain implant design has recently been introduced to enhance the radiation resistance of low-gain avalanche diodes (LGADs) to the extreme fluences anticipated in future hadron colliders like FCC-hh. This design utilises an engineered compensation of two opposing types of doping implants, requiring a thorough analysis of their evolution due to irradiation. To this end, the experimental measurements of their initial test structures have been compared with Technology CAD simulations both before and after irradiation.
  From the measurement-simulation comparison regarding C-V characteristics, the donor removal at high initial donor concentrations ($&gt;10^{16}$ at/cm$^3$) used in Compensated LGADs has been studied, along with how donor co-implantation influences the beneficial effect of carbon to slow acceptor removal. Furthermore, an innovative application of van der Pauw test structures, typically employed by foundries to monitor process quality, has been implemented. The doping removal of the single implants used in Compensated LGADs has been estimated by examining the variation in sheet resistance with irradiation through these structures.</description>

      <title>Design and optimisation of radiation resistant AC- and DC-coupled resistive LGADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future high-energy physics experiments require a paradigm shift in radiation detector design. In response to this challenge, resistive LGADs that combine Low Gain Avalanche Diode technology with resistive readout have been developed. The prototypes created so far, employing AC-coupled contacts, have demonstrated impressive performance, achieving a temporal resolution of 38 ps and a spatial resolution of 15 $\mu$m with a pixel pitch of 450 $\mu$m.
  To tackle some of the issues encountered up to this point, particularly the non-uniform response across the entire surface of the detector, a new version with DC-coupled contacts has recently been developed. The Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD simulations that have guided the design of their first production, released by the Fondazione Bruno Kessler in November 2024, will be presented below along with a concise summary of the history of the prototypes with AC-coupled contacts.</description>

      <title>A prototype reactor-antineutrino detector based on $^6$Li-doped pulse-shaping-discriminating plastic scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An aboveground 60-kg reactor-antineutrino detector prototype, comprised of a 2-dimensional array of 36 $^{6}$Li-doped pulse shape sensitive plastic scintillator bars, is described. Each bar is 50~cm long with a square cross section of 5.5~cm. Doped with $^{6}$Li at 0.1\% by mass, the detector is capable of identifying correlated energy depositions for the detection of reactor antineutrinos via the inverse-beta-decay reaction. Each bar is wrapped with a specular reflector that directs photons towards PMTs mounted at both ends of the bar. This paper highlights the construction, key features, and main performance characteristics of the system. The system, which relies on multiple observables such as PSD, energy, position, and timing, is capable of detecting IBD-like neutron-correlated backgrounds, long-lived decay chains, and cosmogenic isotopes.</description>

      <title>Further Characterisation of Digital Pixel Test Structures Implemented in a 65 nm CMOS Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of MAPS for future tracking detectors will have to meet stringent requirements placed on them. One such detector is the ALICE ITS3 that aims to be very light at 0.07% X/X$_{0}$ per layer and have a low power consumption of 40 mW/cm$^{2}$ by implementing wafer-scale MAPS bent into cylindrical half layers. To address these challenging requirements, the ALICE ITS3 project, in conjunction with the CERN EP R&amp;D on monolithic pixel sensors, proposed the Tower Partners Semiconductor Co. 65 nm CMOS process as the starting point for the sensor. After the initial results confirmed the detection efficiency and radiation hardness, the choice of the technology was solidified by demonstrating the feasibility of operating MAPS in low-power consumption regimes, &lt; 50 mW/cm$^{2}$, while maintaining high-quality performance. This was shown through a detailed characterisation of the Digital Pixel Test Structure (DPTS) prototype exposed to X-rays and ionising beams, and the results are presented in this article. Additionally, the sensor was further investigated through studies of the fake-hit rate, the linearity of the front-end in the range 1.7-28 keV, the performance after ionising irradiation, and the detection efficiency of inclined tracks in the range 0-45$^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Realistic Monte Carlo simulations of silicon 4D-trackers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-guided design represents a fundamental contribution towards the development of modern semiconductor devices aiming to reach high-performance particle detection, identification and tracking, and constitutes a strategic element of the new detector R&amp;D roadmap. At the same time, the complexity of microelectronic structures and the related detection systems is drastically increasing, also thanks to the progressive scaling down of the design rules with the process technology. Owing to the capability to embed a detailed description of the ionization mechanism into a device-level framework, as well as capture the stochastic nature of signal formation, the Monte Carlo (MC) approach has become the most recommended strategy to achieve reliable predictions of the dynamic properties of particle detectors in realistic settings such as in-beam experiments. This work gives an overview of the key aspects characterizing MC tools, with particular emphasis on the Garfield++ simulation toolkit. To this end, the analysis of some specific case studies related to the design of silicon particle detectors for timing and 4D-tracking in both current and future high-energy physics experiments will be presented, showing the comparison of measured and simulated figures-of-merit and highlighting strengths and open challenges of this approach. The examples are intentionally chosen from the family of Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors, as they represent some of the most promising and relevant advancements in particle detection, and because the CMOS monolithic integration offers the most versatile platform for testing the robustness of numerical designs.</description>

      <title>Performance of a SiPM-based, plastic scintillator muon veto prototype for CUPID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CUPID will be a next-generation experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay in the inverted mass ordering regime. The reduction of backgrounds in the region of interest is critical to the performance of the experiment. Despite its underground location, muon-induced events will be a non-negligible source of backgrounds for CUPID, and mitigating them is critical to achieving CUPID's target sensitivity. Module prototypes were designed, built, and characterized for a muon veto. CUPID's muon veto system must fit within the physical constraints of the existing infrastructure while maximizing geometrical coverage. A modular system of plastic scintillator panels with embedded plastic wavelength-shifting fibers connected to silicon photomultiplier light detectors is proposed for the CUPID muon tagger. The 100$\times$50 cm$^2$ panel prototype presented here exhibited a light yield of ($57.2 \pm 4.0$) p.e. per MeV, with a position reconstruction resolution of 25$\times$ 25 cm$^2$. This design also achieves a detection efficiency of $(98\pm1)\%$. This paper describes the development, characterization, and testing of prototype modules for the CUPID muon veto. We compare the light yield, uniformity, and position reconstruction potential of different prototype designs.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Newtonian Noise May Constrain Third-Generation Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced gravitational-wave detector designs are pushing towards lower frequencies, where certain types of noise, previously considered negligible, may come to dominate the detectors' noise budgets. In particular, we revisit atmospheric Newtonian noise, caused by the fluctuating gravitational field as regions of high and low gas density move past the detector. We consider density perturbations both due to pressure waves (infrasound) and due to advected temperature fluctuations. In the absence of detailed site-specific models of topography, airflow, and building design, we present general scaling formulae that estimate the spectrum of atmospheric Newtonian noise, and show how it is affected by broad detector design choices. We confirm previous analyses that show that atmospheric Newtonian noise is not likely a strong contributor to advanced LIGO; however, it will be a dominant factor for third-generation detectors targeting low frequencies, with the low-frequency cutoff principally constrained by the depth of the detector underground.</description>

      <title>Development of precession Lorentz transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) is a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging of magnetic textures, including their dynamics under external stimuli and ultrafast nonequilibrium conditions. However, magnetic imaging is often hindered by non-magnetic diffraction contrast arising from inhomogeneous sample deformation or a non-parallel electron beam. In this study, we develop a precession LTEM system that can suppress diffraction contrast by changing the incident angle of the electron beam relative to the sample in a precessional manner. By comparing LTEM images acquired at different precession angles ($\theta$), we show that diffraction contrast is significantly reduced with increasing $\theta$. However, large $\theta$ values lead to an undesired broadening of the magnetic contrast, highlighting the importance of optimizing $\theta$. Furthermore, defocus-dependent measurements reveal that magnetic contrast is particularly improved at small defocus values, suggesting that precession LTEM can achieve higher spatial resolution. These findings demonstrate the potential of precession LTEM as a powerful technique for studying magnetic dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Based on a large set of visual observations, the mean apparent magnitude of BlueBird satellites is 3.44, while the mean of magnitudes adjusted to a uniform distance of 1000 km is 3.84. Near zenith the spacecraft can be as bright as magnitude 0.5. While these spacecraft are bright enough to impact astronomical observations, they can for periods be fainter than the BlueWalker 3 prototype satellite. A model for their brightness shows that design changes since the BlueWalker 3 mission can explain the behavior of BlueBird.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>

Abstract: Silica is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature, enabling their analysis at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La- APT). In this study, we show that UV and deep-UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>

      <title>Design, fabrication and initial test of a novel 3D-Trench sensor utilizing 8-inch CMOS compatible technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3D silicon sensor has demonstrated excellent performances (signal collection, detection efficiency, power consumption, etc.) comparable or even better with respect to the traditional planar sensor of the ATLAS Detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), especially after the high irradiation fluence, mainly due to the shorter drift length of the generated carriers. These characteristics have made it the most attractive technology for the detection and track reconstruction of charged particles for the High Energy Physics (HEP). In addition, its application is also being explored in astronomy, microdosimetry and medical imaging. This paper will present the design and fabrication of a novel 3D-Trench sensor which features an enclosed deep trench surrounding the central columnar cathode. This novel sensor has been fabricated on the 8-inch COMS pilot line at the Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS) where ultra-narrow etch width of 0.5 {\mu}m and the ultra-high depth-to-width ratio (aspect ratio) (&gt;70) have been achieved. Its preliminary simulation and characterization results including electrostatic potential, electric field, Current-Voltage (IV), Capacitance-Voltage (CV), Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE) and Timing Performance before irradiation will be presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Development of a Neutron Imager using CMOS Pixelated Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We acquired an image of the Siemens Star Chart using the ${}^{10}$B-INTPIX4 CMOS pixelated imager at J-PARC MLF BL21 (NOVA). The image blurriness, characterized by a root mean square (rms) value of 17 $\mu$m in the line spread function, corresponds to an rms beam divergence of 2.7 mrad. for the neutron beam. This is equivalent to the L/D ratio of 370. The contrast of the image was analyzed as a function of structural scale of the chart, and based on this contrast, the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the imaging system was evaluated. The results indicate that the structure corresponding to the 50% cutoff is 12 line-space pairs per mm.</description>

      <title>Reweighting simulated events using machine-learning techniques in the CMS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data analyses in particle physics rely on an accurate simulation of particle collisions and a detailed simulation of detector effects to extract physics knowledge from the recorded data. Event generators together with a GEANT-based simulation of the detectors are used to produce large samples of simulated events for analysis by the LHC experiments. These simulations come at a high computational cost, where the detector simulation and reconstruction algorithms have the largest CPU demands. This article describes how machine-learning (ML) techniques are used to reweight simulated samples obtained with a given set of model parameters to samples with different parameters or samples obtained from entirely different simulation programs. The ML reweighting method avoids the need for simulating the detector response multiple times by incorporating the relevant information in a single sample through event weights. Results are presented for reweighting to model variations and higher-order calculations in simulated top quark pair production at the LHC. This ML-based reweighting is an important element of the future computing model of the CMS experiment and will facilitate precision measurements at the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Dielectric waveguide setup tested with a superconducting millimeter-wave Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at milli-Kelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and test a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz. These results show no evident influence of atomic two-level systems in the cavity.</description>
