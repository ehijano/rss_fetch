      <title>AI Noether -- Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Laws Derived by AI Systems and Canonical Knowledge via Abductive Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert) enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.</description>

      <title>From Affine to Polynomial: Synthesizing Loops with Branches via Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring software correctness remains a fundamental challenge in formal program verification. One promising approach relies on finding polynomial invariants for loops. Polynomial invariants are properties of a program loop that hold before and after each iteration. Generating such invariants is a crucial task in loop analysis, but it is undecidable in the general case. Recently, an alternative approach to this problem has emerged, focusing on synthesizing loops from invariants. However, existing methods only synthesize affine loops without guard conditions from polynomial invariants. In this paper, we address a more general problem, allowing loops to have polynomial update maps with a given structure, inequations in the guard condition, and polynomial invariants of arbitrary form.
  We use algebraic geometry tools to design and implement an algorithm that computes a finite set of polynomial equations whose solutions correspond to all nondeterministic branching loops satisfying the given invariants. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of invariants for which we present a significantly more efficient algorithm. In other words, we reduce the problem of synthesizing loops to find solutions of multivariate polynomial systems with rational entries. This final step is handled in our software using an SMT solver.</description>

      <title>Improving NLSAT for Nonlinear Real Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Model-Constructing Satisfiability Calculus (MCSAT) framework has been applied to SMT problems over various arithmetic theories. NLSAT, an implementation using cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) for explanation, is especially competitive for nonlinear real arithmetic (NRA) constraints. However, current Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)-style algorithms only consider literal information when making decisions, and thus ignore the influence of clauses on arithmetic variables. This limitation may lead NLSAT to encounter unnecessary conflicts due to suboptimal literal choices. To address this issue, we analyze conflicts caused by literal decisions and incorporate clause-level information that directly affects arithmetic variables. We propose two main algorithmic improvements: a clause-level feasible-set-based look-ahead mechanism and an arithmetic propagation-based branching heuristic. We implement our solver, named clauseSMT, based on a dynamic variable ordering framework. Experiments indicate that clauseSMT is competitive on nonlinear real arithmetic problems compared with existing SMT solvers (CVC5, Z3, YICES2), and it outperforms all of them on satisfiable instances of SMT(QF_NRA) in SMT-LIB. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Pattern Division Random Access (PDRA) for M2M Communications with Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the pattern-domain pilot design paradigm based on a "superposition of orthogonal-building-blocks" with significantly larger contention space to enhance the massive machine-type communications (mMTC) random access (RA) performance in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.Specifically, the pattern-domain pilot is constructed based on the superposition of $L$ cyclically-shifted Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. The pattern-domain pilots exhibit zero correlation values between non-colliding patterns from the same root and low correlation values between patterns from different roots. The increased contention space, i.e., from N to $\binom{N}{L}$, where $\binom{N}{L}$ denotes the number of all L-combinations of a set N, and low correlation valueslead to a significantly lower pilot collision probability without compromising excessively on channel estimation performance for mMTC RA in massive MIMO systems.We present the framework and analysis of the RA success probability of the pattern-domain based scheme with massive MIMO systems.Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed pattern division random access (PDRA) scheme achieves an appreciable performance gain over the conventional one,while preserving the existing physical layer virtually unchanged. The extension of the "superposition of orthogonal-building-blocks" scheme to "superposition of quasi-orthogonal-building-blocks" is straightforward.</description>
