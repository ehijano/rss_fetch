      <title>Quasi-isospectral higher-order Hamiltonians via a reversed Lax pair construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for constructing quasi-isospectral higher-order Hamiltonians from time-independent Lax pairs by reversing the conventional interpretation of the Lax pair operators. Instead of treating the typically second-order $L$-operator as the Hamiltonian, we take the higher-order $M$-operator as the starting point and construct a sequence of quasi-isospectral operators via intertwining techniques. This procedure yields a variety of new higher-order Hamiltonians that are isospectral to each other, except for at least one state. We illustrate the approach with explicit examples derived from the KdV equation and its extensions, discussing the properties of the resulting operators based on rational, hyperbolic, and elliptic function solutions. In some cases, we present infinite sequences of quasi-isospectral Hamiltonians, which we generalise to shape-invariant differential operators capable of generating such sequences. Our framework provides a systematic mechanism for generating new integrable systems from known Lax pairs.</description>

      <title>KP solitons and the Schottky uniformization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real and regular soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy have been classified in terms of the totally nonnegative (TNN) Grassmannians. These solitons are referred to as KP solitons, and they are expressed as singular (tropical) limits of shifted Riemann theta functions. In this talk, for each element of the TNN Grassmannian, we construct a Schottky group, which uniformizes the Riemann surface associated with a real finite-gap solution. Then we show that the KP solitons are obtained by degenerating these finite-gap solutions.</description>

      <title>On correlation functions of the open XYZ spin 1/2 chain with boundary fields related by a constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the quantum XYZ open spin-1/2 chain with boundary fields. We focus on the particular case in which the six boundary parameters are related by a single constraint enabling us to describe part of the spectrum by standard Bethe equations. We derive for this model exact representations for a set of elementary blocks of correlation functions, hence generalising to XYZ the results obtained in the XXZ open case in arXiv:2208.10097. Our approach is also similar to the approach proposed in the XXZ case arXiv:2208.10097: we solve the model by Sklyanin's version of the quantum Separation of Variables, using Baxter's Vertex-IRF transformation; in this framework, we identify a basis of local operators with a relatively simple action on the transfer matrix eigenstates; we then use the solution of the quantum inverse problem and our recent formulae on scalar products of separate states arXiv:2402.04112 to compute some of the corresponding matrix elements, which can therefore be considered as elementary building blocks for the correlation functions. The latter are expressed in terms of multiple sums in the finite chain, and as multiple integrals in the thermodynamic limit. Our results evidence that, once the basis of local operators is properly chosen, the corresponding building blocks for correlation functions have a similar structure in the XXX/XXZ/XYZ open chains, and do not require any insertion of non-local "tail operators".</description>

      <title>Steady state representations for the harmonic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we discuss how the matrix product solution for the steady state of the harmonic process is obtained from the solutions already known in the literature, i.e. the closed-form expression derived in arXiv:2107.01720 and the nested integral form obtained in arXiv:2307.02793 and arXiv:2307.14975. Our results clarify the relation between the three representations of the steady state and provide the matrix product solution that has not been available for this model before.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering transform via affine map: applications to high-speed nonlinear optical communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work present an affine map approximation for solving the inverse scattering problem related to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger model of signal propagation in high-speed coherent optical communication. Numerical simulations indicate that accurate recovery of the transmitted bit sequence can be achieved using only the continuous part of the Lax spectrum at the fiber output, thereby allowing the discrete (soliton) spectrum to be disregarded. We observed that the numerically evaluated rank of the resulting affine map matrix equals the number of bits per transmitted sequence, and we utilize this to derive a reduced order affine map.</description>

      <title>From fully-nonlinear to semilinear evolution equations: two symmetry-integrable examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we derive two examples of fully-nonlinear symmetry-integrable evolution equations with algebraic nonlinearities, namely one class of 3rd-order equations and a 5th-order equation. To achieve this we study the equations' Lie-B\"acklund symmetries and apply multipotentialisations, hodograph transformations and generalised hodograph transformations to map the equations to known semilinear integrable evolution equations. As a result of this, we also obtain interesting symmetry-integrable quasilinear equations of order five and order seven, which we display explicitly.</description>

      <title>Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</description>

      <title>Integrability of homogeneous exact magnetic flows on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider motion of a material point placed in a constant homogeneous magnetic field in $\mathbb R^n$ and also motion restricted to the sphere $S^{n-1}$. While there is an obvious integrability of the magnetic system in $\mathbb R^n$, the integrability of the system restricted to the sphere $S^{n-1}$ is highly non-trivial. We prove complete integrability of the obtained restricted magnetic systems for $n\le 6$. The first integrals of motion of the magnetic flows on the spheres $S^{n-1}$, for $n=5$ and $n=6$, are polynomials of the degree $1$, $2$, and $3$ in momenta. We prove noncommutative integrability of the obtained magnetic flows for any $n\ge 7$ when the systems allow a reduction to the cases with $n\le 6$. We conjecture that the restricted magnetic systems on $S^{n-1}$ are integrable for all $n$.</description>
