      <title>Proactive Service Assurance in 5G and B5G Networks: A Closed-Loop Algorithm for End-to-End Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The customization of services in Fifth-generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) networks relies heavily on network slicing, which creates multiple virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure, tailored to meet specific requirements of distinct applications, using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). It is imperative to ensure that network services meet the performance and reliability requirements of various applications and users, thus, service assurance is one of the critical components in network slicing. One of the key functionalities of network slicing is the ability to scale Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in response to changing resource demand and to meet Customer Service Level agreements (SLAs).
  In this paper, we introduce a proactive closed-loop algorithm for end-to-end network orchestration, designed to provide service assurance in 5G and B5G networks. We focus on dynamically scaling resources to meet key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to each network slice and operate in parallel across multiple slices, making it scalable and capable of managing completely automatically real-time service assurance. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively fulfills service assurance requirements for different network slice types, thereby minimizing network resource utilization and reducing the over-provisioning of spare resources.</description>

      <title>ML KPI Prediction in 5G and B5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network operators are facing new challenges when meeting the needs of their customers. The challenges arise due to the rise of new services, such as HD video streaming, IoT, autonomous driving, etc., and the exponential growth of network traffic. In this context, 5G and B5G networks have been evolving to accommodate a wide range of applications and use cases. Additionally, this evolution brings new features, like the ability to create multiple end-to-end isolated virtual networks using network slicing. Nevertheless, to ensure the quality of service, operators must maintain and optimize their networks in accordance with the key performance indicators (KPIs) and the slice service-level agreements (SLAs).
  In this paper, we introduce a machine learning (ML) model used to estimate throughput in 5G and B5G networks with end-to-end (E2E) network slices. Then, we combine the predicted throughput with the current network state to derive an estimate of other network KPIs, which can be used to further improve service assurance. To assess the efficiency of our solution, a performance metric was proposed. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that our KPI prediction model outperforms those derived from other methods with the same or nearly the same computational time.</description>

      <title>DCP and VarDis: An Ad-Hoc Protocol Stack for Dynamic Swarms and Formations of Drones -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, swarms or formations of drones have received increased interest both in the literature and in applications. To dynamically adapt to their operating environment, swarm members need to communicate wirelessly for control and coordination tasks. One fundamental communication pattern required for basic safety purposes, such as collision avoidance, is beaconing, where drones frequently transmit information about their position, speed, heading, and other operational data to a local neighbourhood, using a local broadcast service. In this paper, we propose and analyse a protocol stack which allows to use the recurring-beaconing primitive for additional purposes. In particular, we propose the VarDis (Variable Dissemination) protocol, which creates the abstraction of variables to which all members of a drone swarm have (read) access, and which can naturally be used for centralized control of a swarm, amongst other applications. We describe the involved protocols and provide a mainly simulation-based performance analysis of VarDis.</description>

      <title>Defining Problem from Solutions: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Its Applications for Next-Generation Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance optimization is a critical concern in networking, on which Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved great success. Nonetheless, DRL training relies on precisely defined reward functions, which formulate the optimization objective and indicate the positive/negative progress towards the optimal. With the ever-increasing environmental complexity and human participation in Next-Generation Networking (NGN), defining appropriate reward functions become challenging. In this article, we explore the applications of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) in NGN. Particularly, if DRL aims to find optimal solutions to the problem, IRL finds a problem from the optimal solutions, where the optimal solutions are collected from experts, and the problem is defined by reward inference. Specifically, we first formally introduce the IRL technique, including its fundamentals, workflow, and difference from DRL. Afterward, we present the motivations of IRL applications in NGN and survey existing studies. Furthermore, to demonstrate the process of applying IRL in NGN, we perform a case study about human-centric prompt engineering in Generative AI-enabled networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using both DRL and IRL techniques and prove the superiority of IRL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LLM-ABR, the first system that utilizes the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to autonomously design adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms tailored for diverse network characteristics. Operating within a reinforcement learning framework, LLM-ABR empowers LLMs to design key components such as states and neural network architectures. We evaluate LLM-ABR across diverse network settings, including broadband, satellite, 4G, and 5G. LLM-ABR consistently outperforms default ABR algorithms.</description>

      <title>SMaRTT-REPS: Sender-based Marked Rapidly-adapting Trimmed &amp; Timed Transport with Recycled Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of machine learning (ML) workloads in datacenters, existing congestion control (CC) algorithms fail to deliver the required performance at scale. ML traffic is bursty and bulk-synchronous and thus requires quick reaction and strong fairness. We show that existing CC algorithms that use delay as a main signal react too slowly and are not always fair. We design SMaRTT, a simple sender-based CC algorithm that combines delay, ECN, and optional packet trimming for fast and precise window adjustments. At the core of SMaRTT lies the novel QuickAdapt algorithm that accurately estimates the bandwidth at the receiver. We show how to combine SMaRTT with a new per-packet traffic load-balancing algorithm called REPS to effectively reroute packets around congested hotspots as well as flaky or failing links. Our evaluation shows that SMaRTT alone outperforms EQDS, Swift, BBR, and MPRDMA by up to 50% on modern datacenter networks.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Optimization of Wireless Communication and Computing Resource Allocation based on Multi-Agent Federated Weighting Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled wireless communication systems continue their evolution, distributed learning has gained widespread attention for its ability to offer enhanced data privacy protection, improved resource utilization, and enhanced fault tolerance within wireless communication applications. Federated learning further enhances the ability of resource coordination and model generalization across nodes based on the above foundation, enabling the realization of an AI-driven communication and computing integrated wireless network. This paper proposes a novel wireless communication system to cater to a personalized service needs of both privacy-sensitive and privacy-insensitive users. We design the system based on based on multi-agent federated weighting deep reinforcement learning (MAFWDRL). The system, while fulfilling service requirements for users, facilitates real-time optimization of local communication resources allocation and concurrent decision-making concerning computing resources. Additionally, exploration noise is incorporated to enhance the exploration process of off-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for wireless channels. Federated weighting (FedWgt) effectively compensates for heterogeneous differences in channel status between communication nodes. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms baseline methods significantly in terms of throughput, calculation latency, and energy consumption improvement.</description>

      <title>Guided-Mutation Genetic Algorithm for Mobile IoT Network Relay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a communication scheme which allows various objects to exchange several types of information, enabling functions such as home automation, production management, healthcare, etc. Moreover, energy-harvesting (EH) technology is considered for IoT environment in order to reduce the need for management and enhance maintainability. However, since environments considering outdoor elements such as pedestrians, vehicles and drones have been on the rise recently, it is important to consider mobility when designing an IoT network management scheme. In order to handle this challenge, prior research has made an attempt to solve this problem via variational autoencoder (VAE) and backward-pass rate evaluation method. In this article, we propose a guided-mutation genetic algorithm (GMGA) to derive a sub-optimal relaying topology for IoT systems considering energy-harvesting. Furthermore, we propose a mobility-aware iterative relaying topology algorithm, which calculates the sub-optimal relaying topology of current time frame using the topology result of the previous one. Simulation results verify that our proposed scheme effectively solves formulated IoT network problems compared to other conventional schemes, and also effectively handles IoT environments in terms of mobility.</description>

Abstract: The core network is experiencing bandwidth capacity constraints as internet traffic grows. As a result, the notion of a Multi-band flexible-grid optical network was established to increase the lifespan of an optical core network. In this paper, we use the C+L band for working traffic transmission and the S-band for protection against failure. Furthermore, we compare the proposed method with the existing ones.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Control-Theoretic Safety Guarantees for Dynamic Network Bridging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing complex cooperative tasks in safety-critical environments poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Systems, especially under conditions of partial observability. This work introduces a hybrid approach that integrates Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with control-theoretic methods to ensure safe and efficient distributed strategies. Our contributions include a novel setpoint update algorithm that dynamically adjusts agents' positions to preserve safety conditions without compromising the mission's objectives. Through experimental validation, we demonstrate significant advantages over conventional MARL strategies, achieving comparable task performance with zero safety violations. Our findings indicate that integrating safe control with learning approaches not only enhances safety compliance but also achieves good performance in mission objectives.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Immersive Communication: The Next Frontier in Internet-of-Senses Through 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has been a transformative concept, and as we approach 2030, a new paradigm known as the Internet of Senses (IoS) is emerging. Unlike conventional Virtual Reality (VR), IoS seeks to provide multi-sensory experiences, acknowledging that in our physical reality, our perception extends far beyond just sight and sound; it encompasses a range of senses. This article explores existing technologies driving immersive multi-sensory media, delving into their capabilities and potential applications. This exploration includes a comparative analysis between conventional immersive media streaming and a proposed use case that lever- ages semantic communication empowered by generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). The focal point of this analysis is the substantial reduction in bandwidth consumption by 99.93% in the proposed scheme. Through this comparison, we aim to underscore the practical applications of generative AI for immersive media while addressing the challenges and outlining future trajectories.</description>

      <title>A Fast Percolation-Dijkstra Routing Method for Mega-Constellation Backbone Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real-time routing for satellite communication of the mega-constellations is being challenged due to the large-scale of network nodes, especially on devices with limited computation such as onboard embedded systems. In this paper, a fast routing method is proposed for mega-constellation backbone networks. Firstly, inspired by the regularity and sparse characteristics of mega-constellations, the 4-degree percolation theory is proposed to describe the node search process. Then, dynamic minimum search and mapping methods are used to narrow down the traversal range. The proposed method performs as well as the heap-optimized Dijkstra algorithm with less memory space and dynamic access. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can significantly reduce routing computation time, especially on the onboard, edge-computing or other computation-limited devices.</description>

      <title>Deep transfer learning for intrusion detection in industrial control networks: A comprehensive review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Globally, the external internet is increasingly being connected to industrial control systems. As a result, there is an immediate need to protect these networks from a variety of threats. The key infrastructure of industrial activity can be protected from harm using an intrusion detection system (IDS), a preventive mechanism that seeks to recognize new kinds of dangerous threats and hostile activities. This review examines the most recent artificial-intelligence techniques that are used to create IDSs in many kinds of industrial control networks, with a particular emphasis on IDS-based deep transfer learning (DTL). DTL can be seen as a type of information-fusion approach that merges and/or adapts knowledge from multiple domains to enhance the performance of a target task, particularly when labeled data in the target domain is scarce. Publications issued after 2015 were considered. These selected publications were divided into three categories: DTL-only and IDS-only works are examined in the introduction and background section, and DTL-based IDS papers are considered in the core section of this review. By reading this review paper, researchers will be able to gain a better grasp of the current state of DTL approaches used in IDSs in many different types of network. Other useful information, such as the datasets used, the type of DTL employed, the pre-trained network, IDS techniques, the evaluation metrics including accuracy/F-score and false-alarm rate, and the improvements gained, are also covered. The algorithms and methods used in several studies are presented, and the principles of DTL-based IDS subcategories are presented to the reader and illustrated deeply and clearly</description>
