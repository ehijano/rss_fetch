      <title>Hidden quantum-classical correspondence in chaotic billiards revealed by mutual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Avoided level crossings, commonly associated with quantum chaos, are typically interpreted as signatures of eigenstate hybridization and spatial delocalization, often viewed as ergodic spreading. We show that, contrary to this expectation, increasing chaos in quantum billiards enhances mutual information between conjugate phase space variables, revealing nontrivial correlations. Using an information-theoretic decomposition of eigenstate entropy, we demonstrate that spatial delocalization may coincide with increased mutual information between position and momentum. These correlations track classical invariant structures in phase space and persist beyond the semiclassical regime, suggesting a robust information-theoretic manifestation of quantum-classical correspondence.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity Induces Cyclops States in Kuramoto Networks with Higher-Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder is often seen as detrimental to collective dynamics, yet recent work has shown that heterogeneity can enhance network synchronization. However, its constructive role in stabilizing nontrivial cooperative patterns remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show that frequency heterogeneity among oscillators can induce stable Cyclops and cluster states in Kuramoto networks with higher-mode coupling, even though these states are unstable in the identical oscillator case. Cyclops states, introduced in [Munyaev et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 107021 (2023)], feature two synchronized clusters and a solitary oscillator, requiring a delicate phase balance. Surprisingly, heterogeneity alone is sufficient to stabilize these patterns across a broad range of detuning values without needing to be compensated by other forms of disorder or external tuning. We introduce a mesoscopic collective coordinate approach that connects microscopic frequency structure, captured by the solitary oscillator's influence, with mean-field cluster-level stability. This constructive approach identifies favorable ranges of heterogeneity and suitable initial conditions for inducing robust multi-state dynamics, offering a foundation for their analysis in broader classes of heterogeneous biological and engineering networks.</description>

      <title>Phase alignment in a lattice of exciton-polaritonic Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics of exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensate is examined by means of the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation including non-Markovian coupling to the excitonic reservoir. Attention is concentrated on properties of the condensate lattice created by laser beams providing incoherent pumping of the reservoir. It is shown that phase ordering of the lattice depends on temperature. The crossover between the in-phase (``ferromagnetic'') and the checkboard (``antiferromagnetic'') orders is accompanied by variation of the steady-state condensate density. Also it is shown that the condensate lattices can retain ordered pattern for temperatures which are much higher than the critical temperature of a single spot, probably due to suppression of the modulational instability.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation for Learning in Lagrangian Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for training dynamical systems governed by Lagrangian mechanics using Equilibrium Propagation. Our approach extends Equilibrium Propagation -- initially developed for energy-based models -- to dynamical trajectories by leveraging the principle of action extremization. Training is achieved by gently nudging trajectories toward desired targets and measuring how the variables conjugate to the parameters to be trained respond. This method is particularly suited to systems with periodic boundary conditions or fixed initial and final states, enabling efficient parameter updates without requiring explicit backpropagation through time. In the case of periodic boundary conditions, this approach yields the semiclassical limit of Quantum Equilibrium Propagation. Applications to systems with dissipation are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Spectral anomalies and broken symmetries in maximally chaotic quantum maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral statistics such as the level spacing statistics and spectral form factor (SFF) are widely expected to accurately identify ``ergodicity'', including the presence of underlying macroscopic symmetries, in generic quantum systems ranging from quantized chaotic maps to interacting many-body systems. By studying various quantizations of maximally chaotic maps that break a discrete classical symmetry upon quantization, we demonstrate that this approach can be misleading and fail to detect macroscopic symmetries. Notably, the same classical map can exhibit signatures of different random matrix symmetry classes in short-range spectral statistics depending on the quantization. While the long-range spectral statistics encoded in the early time ramp of the SFF are more robust and correctly identify macroscopic symmetries in several common quantizations, we also demonstrate analytically and numerically that the presence of Berry-like phases in the quantization leads to spectral anomalies, which break this correspondence. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that long-range spectral rigidity remains directly correlated with ergodicity in the quantum dynamical sense of visiting a complete orthonormal basis.</description>

      <title>Scaling law for membrane lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membrane configurations in the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix model are unstable due to the existence of flat directions in the potential and the decay process can be seen as a realization of chaotic scattering. In this note, we compute the lifetime of a membrane in a reduced model. The resulting lifetime exhibits scaling laws with respect to energy, coupling constant and a cut-off scale. We numerically evaluate the scaling exponents, which cannot be fixed by the dimensional analysis. Finally, some applications of the results are discussed.</description>
