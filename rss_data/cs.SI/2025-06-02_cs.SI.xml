      <title>Exploring the Non-uniqueness of Node Co-occurrence Matrices of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs extend traditional networks by capturing multi-way or group interactions. Given the complexity of hypergraph data and the wide range of methodology available for pairwise network analysis, hypergraph data is often projected onto a weighted and undirected network. The simplest of these projections, often referred to as a node co-occurrence matrix, is known to be non-unique, as distinct non-isomorphic hypergraphs can produce the same weighted adjacency matrix. This non-uniqueness raises important questions about the structural information lost during the projection and how to efficiently quantify the complexity of the original hypergraph. Here we develop a search algorithm to identify all hypergraphs corresponding to a given projection, analyze its runtime, and explore its parallelisability. Applying this algorithm to projections derived from a random hypergraph model, we characterize conditions under which projections are non-unique. Our findings provide a new framework and set of computational tools to investigate projections of hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Catching Stray Balls: Football, fandom, and the impact on digital discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how emotional responses to football matches influence online discourse across digital spaces on Reddit. By analysing millions of posts from dozens of subreddits, it demonstrates that real-world events trigger sentiment shifts that move across communities. It shows that negative sentiment correlates with problematic language; match outcomes directly influence sentiment and posting habits; sentiment can transfer to unrelated communities; and offers insights into the content of this shifting discourse. These findings reveal how digital spaces function not as isolated environments, but as interconnected emotional ecosystems vulnerable to cross-domain contagion triggered by real-world events, contributing to our understanding of the propagation of online toxicity. While football is used as a case-study to computationally measure affective causes and movements, these patterns have implications for understanding online communities broadly.</description>

      <title>A High-Performance Evolutionary Multiobjective Community Detection Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community structure is a key feature of complex networks, underpinning a diverse range of phenomena across social, biological, and technological systems. While traditional methods, such as Louvain and Leiden, offer efficient solutions, they rely on single-objective optimization, often failing to capture the multifaceted nature of real-world networks. Multi-objective approaches address this limitation by considering multiple structural criteria simultaneously, but their high computational cost restricts their use in large-scale settings. We propose HP-MOCD, a high-performance, fully parallel evolutionary algorithm based on NSGA-II, designed to uncover high-quality community structures by jointly optimizing conflicting objectives. HP-MOCD leverages topology-aware genetic operators and parallelism to efficiently explore the solution space and generate a diverse Pareto front of community partitions. Experimental results on large synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that HP-MOCD consistently outperforms existing multi-objective methods in runtime, while achieving superior or comparable detection accuracy. These findings position HP-MOCD as a scalable and practical solution for community detection in large, complex networks.</description>

      <title>Behavioral alignment in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orderly behaviors observed in large-scale groups, such as fish schooling and the organized movement of crowds, are both ubiquitous and essential for the survival and stability of these systems. Such complex collective behaviors often emerge from simple local interactions and strategy adjustments among individuals. Understanding how these basic rules shape complex group dynamics has long been a significant scientific challenge. Historically, research has predominantly focused on imitation and social learning, where individuals adopt the strategies of more successful peers to refine their behavior. However, in recent years, an alternative learning approach, self-exploration and introspective learning, has garnered increasing attention. In this paradigm, individuals assess their own circumstances and select strategies that best align with their specific conditions. Two primary forms of this learning are coordination and anti-coordination, where individuals align with and diverge from the local majority, respectively. In this study, we analyze networked systems of coordinating and anti-coordinating individuals, exploring the combined effects of system dynamics, network structure, and behavioral patterns. We address several practical questions, including the number of equilibria, their characteristics, the equilibrium time, and the resilience of systems. We find that the number of equilibrium states can be extremely large, even increasing exponentially with minor alternations to the network structure. Moreover, the network structure has a significant impact on the average equilibrium time. Despite the complexity of these findings, variations can be captured by a single, simple network characteristic: the average path length. Our research offers valuable insights into how modifications to the interaction structure can influence behavioral alignment in social networks.</description>

      <title>Whose Name Comes Up? Auditing LLM-Based Scholar Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b, llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender, ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist, replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance), under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars. Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly recommendations.</description>

      <title>Effects of higher-order interactions and homophily on information access inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of information through socio-technical systems determines which individuals are the first to gain access to opportunities and insights. Yet, the pathways through which information flows can be skewed, leading to systematic differences in access across social groups. These inequalities remain poorly characterized in settings involving nonlinear social contagion and higher-order interactions that exhibit homophily. We introduce a enerative model for hypergraphs with hyperedge homophily, a hyperedge size-dependent property, and tunable degree distribution, called the $\texttt{H3}$ model, along with a model for nonlinear social contagion that incorporates asymmetric transmission between in-group and out-group nodes. Using stochastic simulations of a social contagion process on hypergraphs from the $\texttt{H3}$ model and diverse empirical datasets, we show that the interaction between social contagion dynamics and hyperedge homophily -- an effect unique to higher-order networks due to its dependence on hyperedge size -- can critically shape group-level differences in information access. By emphasizing how hyperedge homophily shapes interaction patterns, our findings underscore the need to rethink socio-technical system design through a higher-order perspective and suggest that dynamics-informed, targeted interventions at specific hyperedge sizes, embedded in a platform architecture, offer a powerful lever for reducing inequality.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Level-Wise News Article Clustering via Multilingual Matryoshka Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual large language model embeddings are increasingly utilized for topic modeling and clustering. However, current methods often scale poorly, rely on opaque similarity metrics, and struggle in multilingual settings. In this work, we present a novel, scalable, interpretable, hierarchical, and multilingual approach to clustering news articles and social media data. To do this, we first train multilingual Matryoshka embeddings that can determine story similarity at varying levels of granularity based on which subset of the dimensions of the embeddings is examined. This embedding model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2022 Task 8 test dataset (Pearson $\rho$ = 0.816). Once trained, we develop an efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm that leverages the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings to identify unique news stories, narratives, and themes. We conclude by illustrating how our approach can identify and cluster stories, narratives, and overarching themes within real-world news datasets.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Codemixing in Chats: The NUS ABC Codemixed Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code-mixing involves the seamless integration of linguistic elements from multiple languages within a single discourse, reflecting natural multilingual communication patterns. Despite its prominence in informal interactions such as social media, chat messages and instant-messaging exchanges, there has been a lack of publicly available corpora that are author-labeled and suitable for modeling human conversations and relationships. This study introduces the first labeled and general-purpose corpus for understanding code-mixing in context while maintaining rigorous privacy and ethical standards. Our live project will continuously gather, verify, and integrate code-mixed messages into a structured dataset released in JSON format, accompanied by detailed metadata and linguistic statistics. To date, it includes over 355,641 messages spanning various code-mixing patterns, with a primary focus on English, Mandarin, and other languages. We expect the Codemix Corpus to serve as a foundational dataset for research in computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and NLP applications.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Higher-Order Analysis of Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying patterns of relations among the units of a complex system from measurements of their activities in time is a fundamental problem with many practical applications. Here, we introduce a method that detects dependencies of any order in multivariate time series data. The method first transforms a multivariate time series into a symbolic sequence, and then extract statistically significant strings of symbols through a Bayesian approach. Such motifs are finally modelled as the hyperedges of a hypergraph, allowing us to use network theory to study higher-order interactions in the original data. When applied to neural and social systems, our method reveals meaningful higher-order dependencies, highlighting their importance in both brain function and social behaviour.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Spread of Epidemics on Networks with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing effective strategies for controlling epidemic spread by vaccination is an important question in epidemiology, especially in the early stages when vaccines are limited. This is a challenging question when the contact network is very heterogeneous, and strategies based on controlling network properties, such as the degree and spectral radius, have been shown to be effective. Implementation of such strategies requires detailed information on the contact structure, which might be sensitive in many applications. Our focus here is on choosing effective vaccination strategies when the edges are sensitive and differential privacy guarantees are needed. Our main contributions are $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private algorithms for designing vaccination strategies by reducing the maximum degree and spectral radius. Our key technique is a private algorithm for the multi-set multi-cover problem, which we use for controlling network properties. We evaluate privacy-utility tradeoffs of our algorithms on multiple synthetic and real-world networks, and show their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Beyond Attention: Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics with Emergent Interpretable Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is critical in applications such as traffic prediction, energy demand modeling, and weather monitoring. While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores, introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure interpretability.
  We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder, outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a 21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline.
  Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity in dynamic graph-based domains.</description>

      <title>Analysis of LLM Bias (Chinese Propaganda &amp; Anti-US Sentiment) in DeepSeek-R1 vs. ChatGPT o3-mini-high</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape public understanding and civic decisions, yet their ideological neutrality is a growing concern. While existing research has explored various forms of LLM bias, a direct, cross-lingual comparison of models with differing geopolitical alignments-specifically a PRC-system model versus a non-PRC counterpart-has been lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating DeepSeek-R1 (PRC-aligned) against ChatGPT o3-mini-high (non-PRC) for Chinese-state propaganda and anti-U.S. sentiment. We developed a novel corpus of 1,200 de-contextualized, reasoning-oriented questions derived from Chinese-language news, presented in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. Answers from both models (7,200 total) were assessed using a hybrid evaluation pipeline combining rubric-guided GPT-4o scoring with human annotation. Our findings reveal significant model-level and language-dependent biases. DeepSeek-R1 consistently exhibited substantially higher proportions of both propaganda and anti-U.S. bias compared to ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which remained largely free of anti-U.S. sentiment and showed lower propaganda levels. For DeepSeek-R1, Simplified Chinese queries elicited the highest bias rates; these diminished in Traditional Chinese and were nearly absent in English. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 occasionally responded in Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese queries and amplified existing PRC-aligned terms in its Chinese answers, demonstrating an "invisible loudspeaker" effect. Furthermore, such biases were not confined to overtly political topics but also permeated cultural and lifestyle content, particularly in DeepSeek-R1.</description>

      <title>Public versus Less-Public News Engagement on Facebook: Patterns Across Bias and Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of social media as a news platform has raised significant concerns about the influence and societal impact of biased and unreliable news on these platforms. While much research has explored user engagement with news on platforms like Facebook, most studies have focused on publicly shared posts. This focus leaves an important question unanswered: how representative is the public sphere of Facebook's entire ecosystem? Specifically, how much of the interactions occur in less-public spaces, and do public engagement patterns for different news classes (e.g., reliable vs. unreliable) generalize to the broader Facebook ecosystem?
  This paper presents the first comprehensive comparison of interaction patterns between Facebook's more public sphere (referred to as public in paper) and the less public sphere (referred to as private). For the analysis, we first collect two complementary datasets: (1) aggregated interaction data for all Facebook posts (public + private) for 19,050 manually labeled news articles (225.3M user interactions), and (2) a subset containing only interactions with public posts (70.4M interactions). Then, through discussions and iterative feedback from the CrowdTangle team, we develop a robust method for fair comparison between these datasets.
  Our analysis reveals that only 31% of news interactions occur in the public sphere, with significant variations across news classes. Engagement patterns in less-public spaces often differ, with users, for example, engaging more deeply in private contexts. These findings highlight the need to examine both public and less-public engagement to fully understand news dissemination on Facebook. The observed differences hold important implications on content moderation, platform governance, and policymaking, contributing to healthier online discourse.</description>

      <title>BTS: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Tie Strength Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19214v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid rise of online social networks underscores the need to understand the heterogeneous strengths of online relationships. Yet, efforts to assess tie strength (TS) are hindered by the lack of ground-truth labels, differing research perspectives, and limited model performance in real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce BTS, a comprehensive Benchmark for Tie Strength prediction, aiming to establish a standardized foundation for evaluating and advancing TS prediction methodologies. Specifically, our contributions are: TS Pseudo-Label Techniques -- we categorize TS into seven standardized pseudo-labeling techniques based on prior literature; TS Dataset Collection -- we present a representative collection of three social networks and perform data analysis by investigating the class distributions and correlations across the generated pseudo-labels; TS Pseudo-Label Evaluation Framework -- we propose a standardized framework to evaluate the pseudo-label quality from the perspective of tie resilience; Benchmarking -- we evaluate existing tie strength prediction model performance using the BTS dataset collection, exploring the effects of different experiment settings, models, and evaluation criteria on the results. Furthermore, we derive key insights to enhance existing methods and shed light on promising directions for future research in this domain. The BTS dataset collection, along with the curation codes, and experimental scripts are all available at: https://github.com/XueqiC/Awesome-Tie-Strength-Prediction.</description>

      <title>A Generalisation of Voter Model: Influential Nodes and Convergence Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an undirected graph G, representing a social network, where each node is blue or red, corresponding to positive or negative opinion on a topic. In the voter model, in discrete time rounds, each node picks a neighbour uniformly at random and adopts its colour. Despite its significant popularity, this model does not capture some fundamental real-world characteristics such as the difference in the strengths of individuals connections, individuals with neutral opinion on a topic, and individuals who are reluctant to update their opinion. To address these issues, we introduce and study a generalisation of the voter model. Motivating by campaigning strategies, we study the problem of selecting a set of seeds blue nodes to maximise the expected number of blue nodes after some rounds. We prove that the problem is NP- hard and provide a polynomial time approximation algorithm with the best possible approximation guarantee. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic graph data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms. We also investigate the convergence properties of the model. We prove that the process could take an exponential number of rounds to converge. However, if we limit ourselves to strongly connected graphs, the convergence time is polynomial and the period (the number of states in convergence) divides the length of all cycles in the graph.</description>

      <title>Towards Collaborative Anti-Money Laundering Among Financial Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Money laundering is the process that intends to legalize the income derived from illicit activities, thus facilitating their entry into the monetary flow of the economy without jeopardizing their source. It is crucial to identify such activities accurately and reliably in order to enforce anti-money laundering (AML). Despite considerable efforts to AML, a large number of such activities still go undetected. Rule-based methods were first introduced and are still widely used in current detection systems. With the rise of machine learning, graph-based learning methods have gained prominence in detecting illicit accounts through the analysis of money transfer graphs. Nevertheless, these methods generally assume that the transaction graph is centralized, whereas in practice, money laundering activities usually span multiple financial institutions. Due to regulatory, legal, commercial, and customer privacy concerns, institutions tend not to share data, restricting their utility in practical usage. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that supports performing AML over multiple institutions while protecting the security and privacy of local data. To evaluate, we construct Alipay-ECB, a real-world dataset comprising digital transactions from Alipay, the world's largest mobile payment platform, alongside transactions from E-Commerce Bank (ECB). The dataset includes over 200 million accounts and 300 million transactions, covering both intra-institution transactions and those between Alipay and ECB. This makes it the largest real-world transaction graph available for analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods can effectively identify cross-institution money laundering subgroups. Additionally, experiments on synthetic datasets also demonstrate that our method is efficient, requiring only a few minutes on datasets with millions of transactions.</description>

      <title>The Language of Influence: Sentiment, Emotion, and Hate Speech in State Sponsored Influence Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-sponsored influence operations (SIOs) have become a pervasive and complex challenge in the digital age, particularly on social media platforms where information spreads rapidly and with minimal oversight. These operations are strategically employed by nation-state actors to manipulate public opinion, exacerbate social divisions, and project geopolitical narratives, often through the dissemination of misleading or inflammatory content. Despite increasing awareness of their existence, the specific linguistic and emotional strategies employed by these campaigns remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of sentiment, emotional valence, and abusive language across 2 million tweets attributed to influence operations linked to China, Iran, and Russia, using Twitter's publicly released dataset of state-affiliated accounts. We identify distinct affective and rhetorical patterns that characterize each nation's digital propaganda. Russian campaigns predominantly deploy negative sentiment and toxic language to intensify polarization and destabilize discourse. In contrast, Iranian operations blend antagonistic and supportive tones to simultaneously incite conflict and foster ideological alignment. Chinese activities emphasize positive sentiment and emotionally neutral rhetoric to promote favorable narratives and subtly influence global perceptions. These findings reveal how state actors tailor their information warfare tactics to achieve specific geopolitical objectives through differentiated content strategies.</description>

      <title>Homophily Enhanced Graph Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs, addressing the challenge of label scarcity. In this paper, we highlight the significance of graph homophily, a pivotal factor for graph domain alignment, which, however, has long been overlooked in existing approaches. Specifically, our analysis first reveals that homophily discrepancies exist in benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that homophily discrepancies degrade GDA performance from both empirical and theoretical aspects, which further underscores the importance of homophily alignment in GDA. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel homophily alignment algorithm that employs mixed filters to smooth graph signals, thereby effectively capturing and mitigating homophily discrepancies between graphs. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Bypassing Skip-Gram Negative Sampling: Dimension Regularization as a More Efficient Alternative for Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide range of graph embedding objectives decompose into two components: one that enforces similarity, attracting the embeddings of nodes that are perceived as similar, and another that enforces dissimilarity, repelling the embeddings of nodes that are perceived as dissimilar. Without repulsion, the embeddings would collapse into trivial solutions. Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) is a popular and efficient repulsion approach that prevents collapse by repelling each node from a sample of dissimilar nodes. In this work, we show that when repulsion is most needed and the embeddings approach collapse, SGNS node-wise repulsion is, in the aggregate, an approximate re-centering of the node embedding dimensions. Such dimension operations are more scalable than node operations and produce a simpler geometric interpretation of the repulsion. Our theoretical result establishes dimension regularization as an effective and more efficient, compared to skip-gram node contrast, approach to enforcing dissimilarity among embeddings of nodes. We use this result to propose a flexible algorithm augmentation framework that improves the scalability of any existing algorithm using SGNS. The framework prioritizes node attraction and replaces SGNS with dimension regularization. We instantiate this generic framework for LINE and node2vec and show that the augmented algorithms preserve downstream link-prediction performance while reducing GPU memory usage by up to 33.3% and training time by 23.4%. Moreover, we show that completely removing repulsion (a special case of our augmentation framework) in LINE reduces training time by 70.9% on average, while increasing link prediction performance, especially for graphs that are globally sparse but locally dense. In general, however, repulsion is needed, and dimension regularization provides an efficient alternative to SGNS.</description>

      <title>Can Graph Neural Networks Learn Language with Extremely Weak Text Supervision?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While great success has been achieved in building vision models with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) over internet-scale image-text pairs, building transferable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with CLIP pipeline is challenging because of the scarcity of labeled data and text supervision, different levels of downstream tasks, and the conceptual gaps between domains. In this work, to address these issues, we propose a multi-modal prompt learning paradigm to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. We demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize GNNs to unseen classes with extremely weak text supervision. The code is available at https://github.com/Violet24K/Morpher.</description>

      <title>Are We in the AI-Generated Text World Already? Quantifying and Monitoring AIGT on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, it remains unclear how prevalent AIGTs are on social media. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify and monitor the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024, using the AI Attribution Rate (AAR) as the metric. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs on social media differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>What makes a good feedforward computational graph?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As implied by the plethora of literature on graph rewiring, the choice of computational graph employed by a neural network can make a significant impact on its downstream performance. Certain effects related to the computational graph, such as under-reaching and over-squashing, may even render the model incapable of learning certain functions. Most of these effects have only been thoroughly studied in the domain of undirected graphs; however, recent years have seen a significant rise in interest in feedforward computational graphs: directed graphs without any back edges. In this paper, we study the desirable properties of a feedforward computational graph, discovering two important complementary measures: fidelity and mixing time, and evaluating a few popular choices of graphs through the lens of these measures. Our study is backed by both theoretical analyses of the metrics' asymptotic behaviour for various graphs, as well as correlating these metrics to the performance of trained neural network models using the corresponding graphs.</description>

      <title>S3AND: Efficient Subgraph Similarity Search Under Aggregated Neighbor Difference Semantics (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the past decades, the \textit{subgraph similarity search} over a large-scale data graph has become increasingly important and crucial in many real-world applications, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics network analytics, knowledge graph discovery, and many others. While previous works on subgraph similarity search used various graph similarity metrics such as the graph isomorphism, graph edit distance, and so on, in this paper, we propose a novel problem, namely \textit{subgraph similarity search under aggregated neighbor difference semantics} (S$^3$AND), which identifies subgraphs $g$ in a data graph $G$ that are similar to a given query graph $q$ by considering both keywords and graph structures (under new keyword/structural matching semantics). To efficiently tackle the S$^3$AND problem, we design two effective pruning methods, \textit{keyword set} and \textit{aggregated neighbor difference lower bound pruning}, which rule out false alarms of candidate vertices/subgraphs to reduce the S$^3$AND search space. Furthermore, we construct an effective indexing mechanism to facilitate our proposed efficient S$^3$AND query answering algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our S$^3$AND approach over both real and synthetic graphs under various parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Governance (HAIG): A Trust-Utility Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the HAIG framework for analysing trust dynamics across evolving human-AI relationships. Current categorical frameworks (e.g., "human-in-the-loop" models) inadequately capture how AI systems evolve from tools to partners, particularly as foundation models demonstrate emergent capabilities and multi-agent systems exhibit autonomous goal-setting behaviours. As systems advance, agency redistributes in complex patterns that are better represented as positions along continua rather than discrete categories, though progression may include both gradual shifts and significant step changes. The HAIG framework operates across three levels: dimensions (Decision Authority Distribution, Process Autonomy, and Accountability Configuration), continua (gradual shifts along each dimension), and thresholds (critical points requiring governance adaptation). Unlike risk-based or principle-based approaches, HAIG adopts a trust-utility orientation, focusing on maintaining appropriate trust relationships that maximise utility while ensuring sufficient safeguards. Our analysis reveals how technical advances in self-supervision, reasoning authority, and distributed decision-making drive non-uniform trust evolution across both contextual variation and technological advancement. Case studies in healthcare and European regulation demonstrate how HAIG complements existing frameworks while offering a foundation for alternative approaches that anticipate governance challenges before they emerge.</description>
