      <title>TeleEval-OS: Performance evaluations of large language models for operations scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks, and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity, we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic NLP, knowledge Q&amp;A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10 open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications operation scheduling.</description>

      <title>EvalNet: A Practical Toolchain for Generation and Analysis of Extreme-Scale Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diversity of communication paths in a network - especially non-minimal paths - is a key enabler of performance at extreme scales. We present EvalNet, a toolchain for scalable generation and analysis over 25 important network topologies, such as Slim Fly, PolarFly, and Orthogonal Fat Trees, with a strong focus on path diversity metrics. EvalNet provides an extensive and fine-grained analysis of shortest and non-shortest paths, including their multiplicities, lengths, and interference. It supports exact measurement and visualization of bandwidth and throughput between every router pair, enabling unprecedented insight into routing potential. EvalNet also includes detailed models for construction cost and power consumption, and interfaces seamlessly with established simulators, which we tune to support large-scale evaluations on low-cost hardware. Using EvalNet, we deliver the widest and most comprehensive path diversity study to date, demonstrating how path diversity underpins throughput and scalability, and facilitating progress towards new frontiers in extreme-scale network design.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Deployment Considerations of Post-Quantum Cryptography for Consumer Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing threatens the security foundations of consumer electronics (CE). Preparing the diverse CE ecosystem, particularly resource-constrained devices, for the post-quantum era requires quantitative understanding of quantum-resistant cryptography (PQC) performance. This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform performance analysis of leading PQC Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signatures (NIST standards/candidates) compared against classical RSA/ECC. We evaluated execution time, communication costs (key/signature sizes), and memory footprint indicators on high-performance (macOS/M4, Ubuntu/x86) and constrained platforms (Raspberry Pi 4/ARM). Our quantitative results reveal lattice-based schemes, notably NIST standards ML-KEM (Kyber) and ML-DSA (Dilithium), provide a strong balance of computational efficiency and moderate communication/storage overhead, making them highly suitable for many CE applications. In contrast, code-based Classic McEliece imposes significant key size challenges, while hash-based SPHINCS+ offers high security assurance but demands large signature sizes impacting bandwidth and storage. Based on empirical data across platforms and security levels, we provide specific deployment recommendations tailored to different CE scenarios (e.g., wearables, smart home hubs, mobile devices), offering guidance for manufacturers navigating the PQC transition.</description>
