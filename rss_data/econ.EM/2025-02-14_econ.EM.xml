      <title>On (in)consistency of M-estimators under contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider robust location-scale estimators under contamination. We show that commonly used robust estimators such as the median and the Huber estimator are inconsistent under asymmetric contamination, while the Tukey estimator is consistent. In order to make nuisance parameter free inference based on the Tukey estimator a consistent scale estimator is required. However, standard robust scale estimators such as the interquartile range and the median absolute deviation are inconsistent under contamination.</description>

      <title>Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines portfolio selection using predictive models for portfolio returns. Portfolio selection is a fundamental task in finance, and a variety of methods have been developed to achieve this goal. For instance, the mean-variance approach constructs portfolios by balancing the trade-off between the mean and variance of asset returns, while the quantile-based approach optimizes portfolios by considering tail risk. These methods often depend on distributional information estimated from historical data using predictive models, each of which carries its own uncertainty. To address this, we propose a framework for predictive portfolio selection via conformal prediction , called \emph{Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection} (CPPS). Our approach forecasts future portfolio returns, computes the corresponding prediction intervals, and selects the portfolio of interest based on these intervals. The framework is flexible and can accommodate a wide range of predictive models, including autoregressive (AR) models, random forests, and neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CPPS framework by applying it to an AR model and validate its performance through empirical studies, showing that it delivers superior returns compared to simpler strategies.</description>

      <title>Bayesian penalized empirical likelihood and MCMC sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel methodological framework called Bayesian Penalized Empirical Likelihood (BPEL), designed to address the computational challenges inherent in empirical likelihood (EL) approaches. Our approach has two primary objectives: (i) to enhance the inherent flexibility of EL in accommodating diverse model conditions, and (ii) to facilitate the use of well-established Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling schemes as a convenient alternative to the complex optimization typically required for statistical inference using EL. To achieve the first objective, we propose a penalized approach that regularizes the Lagrange multipliers, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the problem while accommodating a comprehensive set of model conditions. For the second objective, our study designs and thoroughly investigates two popular sampling schemes within the BPEL context. We demonstrate that the BPEL framework is highly flexible and efficient, enhancing the adaptability and practicality of EL methods. Our study highlights the practical advantages of using sampling techniques over traditional optimization methods for EL problems, showing rapid convergence to the global optima of posterior distributions and ensuring the effective resolution of complex statistical inference challenges.</description>

      <title>Bridging Root-$n$ and Non-standard Asymptotics: Dimension-agnostic Adaptive Inference in M-Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript studies a general approach to construct confidence sets for the solution of population-level optimization, commonly referred to as M-estimation. Statistical inference for M-estimation poses significant challenges due to the non-standard limiting behaviors of the corresponding estimator, which arise in settings with increasing dimension of parameters, non-smooth objectives, or constraints. We propose a simple and unified method that guarantees validity in both regular and irregular cases. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive width analysis of the proposed confidence set, showing that the convergence rate of the diameter is adaptive to the unknown degree of instance-specific regularity. We apply the proposed method to several high-dimensional and irregular statistical problems.</description>
