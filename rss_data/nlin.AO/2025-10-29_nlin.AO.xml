      <title>Collective Motion from Quantum-Inspired Open Dynamics with Self-Perception Coupling: A Bloch Approximation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cognition, the perception of external stimuli and the self-referential awareness of one's own perceptual process are two distinct but interacting operations. We propose a quantum-inspired framework in which both the self state and the perception state are treated as coupled open quantum systems evolving across two different timescales. The fast perceptual subsystem captures adaptive sensing under coherent and dissipative influences, while the self subsystem evolves on a slower timescale, integrating perceptual feedback into a stable internal state. Their mutual coupling forms a closed informational loop, where the self-state biases perception, and perception continually reshapes the self. A macroscopic collective order emerges from the interplay of feedback, dissipation, and coherence. Although the Lindblad formalism rigorously captures microscopic quantum dynamics, the Bloch representation offers a far more tractable and intuitive description by compressing the evolution into observable quantities such as polarization, alignment, and coherence decay. Within this framework, we further identify several meaningful dynamical indicators, such as the collective order parameter, the degree of self-coherence, and the volitional inertia inferred from hysteresis-like loops, which together provide a quantitative characterization of emergent coordination and adaptation in a self-perception coupled system. Unlike traditional models of active matter that rely on instantaneous interaction rules, the introduction of an internal, slow-evolving self-subsystem integrates the history of perceptual interactions to capture adaptive and memory-dependent behavior.</description>

      <title>Graph conductance, synchronization, and a new bottleneck measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a quantification of the main bottleneck to flow over a graph, the network property of conductance plays an important role in the process of synchronization of network-coupled dynamical systems. Diffusive coupling terms serve not only to exchange information between nodes within a networked system, but ultimately to dissipate the entropy of the collective dynamic state down toward that which can be associated with a single dynamic node when the synchronization manifold is stable. While the graph conductance can characterize the coupling strength that is required to maintain widespread synchronization across a majority of the nodes in such a system, it offers no guarantee for a stable synchronization manifold, which involves all nodes in the system. We define a new measure called the synchronization bottleneck of a graph, which we denote by $\Xi$; this new network property provides a quantification of the limiting bottleneck of the flow between any subset of nodes (regardless of its order) and the rest of the networked system. This quantity does control the coupling strength required for a stable synchronization manifold for a large class of dynamical systems. Solving for this quantity is combinatorial, as is the case with conductance, but heuristics based on this optimization problem can guide decentralized strategies for improving global synchronizability.</description>

      <title>Exploring Emergent Topological Properties in Socio-Economic Networks through Learning Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how individual learning behavior and structural dynamics interact is essential to modeling emergent phenomena in socioeconomic networks. While bounded rationality and network adaptation have been widely studied, the role of heterogeneous learning rates both at the agent and network levels remains under explored. This paper introduces a dual-learning framework that integrates individualized learning rates for agents and a rewiring rate for the network, reflecting real-world cognitive diversity and structural adaptability.
  Using a simulation model based on the Prisoner's Dilemma and Quantal Response Equilibrium, we analyze how variations in these learning rates affect the emergence of large-scale network structures. Results show that lower and more homogeneously distributed learning rates promote scale-free networks, while higher or more heterogeneously distributed learning rates lead to the emergence of core-periphery topologies. Key topological metrics including scale-free exponents, Estrada heterogeneity, and assortativity reveal that both the speed and variability of learning critically shape system rationality and network architecture. This work provides a unified framework for examining how individual learnability and structural adaptability drive the formation of socioeconomic networks with diverse topologies, offering new insights into adaptive behavior, systemic organization, and resilience.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced long-range order drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that memory, in the form of slow degrees of freedom, can induce a phase of long-range order (LRO) in locally-coupled fast degrees of freedom, producing power-law distributions of avalanches. In fact, such memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems. Here, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no memory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with local feedforward couplings: only the first layer contains memory, while downstream layers are memory-free and locally interacting. Analytical arguments and simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling downstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor long-range interactions. This establishes a simple, yet generic mechanism for propagating collective activity through media without fine tuning to criticality, with testable implications for neuromorphic systems and laminar information flow in the brain cortex.</description>
