      <title>Anomalous thermal activation of the electron glass dynamics in a-InOx and granular aluminum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the temperature dependence of the electrical glassy dynamics in insulating amorphous indium oxide (a-InOx) and granular Al films. We use non-isothermal gate voltage protocols, which can reveal changes in the dynamics induced by the temperature, when logarithmic relaxations devoid of characteristic times are at work. We demonstrate that, contrary to almost 20 years of opposite belief, the dynamics of amorphous indium oxide films in the liquid helium temperature range is thermally activated, i.e. it slows down under cooling and accelerates upon heating. Amorphous indium oxide thus adds to the list of glassy disordered systems in which we already demonstrated thermal activation, which includes granular Al and amorphous NbxSi1-x films. Moreover, measurements up to 40 K in a-InOx and granular Al films reveal the close similarity between the two systems and a very anomalous character of the thermal activation, with an effective activation energy increasing with T as T^2 . We so far have no explanation for it. Its further study and understanding may be important for the physics of electron glasses.</description>

      <title>False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16567v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</description>

      <title>Building Intuition for Dynamical Mean-Field Theory: A Simple Model and the Cavity Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) is a powerful theoretical framework for analyzing systems with many interacting degrees of freedom. This tutorial provides an accessible introduction to DMFT. We begin with a linear model where the DMFT equations can be derived exactly, allowing readers to develop clear intuition for the underlying principles. We then introduce the cavity method, a versatile approach for deriving DMFT equations for non-linear systems. The tutorial concludes with an application to the generalized Lotka--Volterra model of interacting species, demonstrating how DMFT reduces the complex dynamics of many-species communities to a tractable single-species stochastic process. Key insights include understanding how quenched disorder enables the reduction from many-body to effective single-particle dynamics, recognizing the role of self-averaging in simplifying complex systems, and seeing how collective interactions give rise to non-Markovian feedback effects.</description>

      <title>Beyond fragmented dopant dynamics in quantum spin lattices: Robust localization and sub-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.</description>

      <title>Constructing material network representations for intelligent amorphous alloys design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing high-performance amorphous alloys is demanding for various applications. But this process intensively relies on empirical laws and unlimited attempts. The high-cost and low-efficiency nature of the traditional strategies prevents effective sampling in the enormous material space. Here, we propose material networks to accelerate the discovery of binary and ternary amorphous alloys. The network topologies reveal hidden material candidates that were obscured by traditional tabular data representations. By scrutinizing the amorphous alloys synthesized in different years, we construct dynamical material networks to track the history of the alloy discovery. We find that some innovative materials designed in the past were encoded in the networks, demonstrating their predictive power in guiding new alloy design. These material networks show physical similarities with several real-world networks in our daily lives. Our findings pave a new way for intelligent materials design, especially for complex alloys.</description>

      <title>Rough Fabry-Perot cavity: a vastly multi-scale numerical problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A commercial Fabry-Perot laser diode is characterized by highly disproportionate dimensions, which poses a significant numerical challenge, even for state-of-the-art tools. This challenge is exacerbated when one of the cavity mirrors is rough-ened, as is the case when fabricating random laser diodes. Such a system involves length scales from several hundred mi-crometres (length) to a few nanometres (roughness) all of which are relevant when studying optical properties in the visi-ble. While involving an extreme range of dimensions, these cavities cannot be treated through statistical approaches such as those used with self-similar fractal structures known to show well-studied properties. Here we deploy numerical meth-ods to compute cavity modes and show how random corrugations of the Fabry-Perot cavity wall affect statistical proper-ties of their spectral features. Our study constitutes a necessary first step in developing technologically essential devices for photonic computation and efficient speckle-free illumination.</description>

      <title>Signature of glassy dynamics in dynamic modes decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glasses are traditionally characterized by their rugged landscape of disordered low-energy states and their slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Far from equilibrium, dynamical forms of glassy behavior with anomalous algebraic relaxation have also been noted, for example, in networks of coupled oscillators. Due to their disordered and high-dimensional nature, such systems have been difficult to study theoretically, but data-driven methods are emerging as a promising alternative that may aid in their analysis. Here, we characterize glassy dynamics using the dynamic mode decomposition, a data-driven spectral computation that approximates the Koopman spectrum. We show that the gap between oscillatory and decaying modes in the Koopman spectrum vanishes in systems exhibiting algebraic relaxation, and thus, we propose a model-agnostic signature for robustly detecting and analyzing glassy dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through both a minimal example of a one-dimensional ODE and a high-dimensional example of coupled oscillators.</description>

      <title>Existence of Nonequilibrium Glasses in the Degenerate Stealthy Hyperuniform Ground-State Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stealthy interactions are an emerging class of nontrivial, bounded long-ranged oscillatory pair potentials with classical ground states that can be disordered, hyperuniform, and infinitely degenerate. Their hybrid crystal-liquid nature endows them with novel physical properties with advantages over their crystalline counterparts. Here, we show the existence of nonequilibrium hard-sphere glasses within this unusual ground-state manifold as the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ tends to zero that are remarkably configurationally extremely close to hyperuniform 3D maximally random jammed (MRJ) sphere packings. The latter are prototypical glasses since they are maximally disordered, perfectly rigid, and perfectly nonergodic. Our optimization procedure, which leverages the maximum cardinality of the infinite ground-state set, not only guarantees that our packings are hyperuniform with the same structure-factor scaling exponent as the MRJ state, but they share other salient structural attributes, including a packing fraction of $0.638$, a mean contact number per particle of 6, gap exponent of $0.44(1)$, and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ and structures factors $S(k)$ that are virtually identical to one another for all $r$ and $k$, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that stealthy hyperuniform packings can be created within the disordered regime ($0 &lt; \chi &lt;1/2$) with heretofore unattained maximal packing fractions. As $\chi$ increases from zero, they always form interparticle contacts, albeit with sparser contact networks as $\chi$ increases from zero, resulting in linear polymer-like chains of contacting particles with increasingly shorter chain lengths. The capacity to generate ultradense stealthy hyperuniform packings for all $\chi$ opens up new materials applications in optics and acoustics.</description>

      <title>Holstein mechanism in single-site model with unitary evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Holstein mechanism in a single-electron (one-site) system, where unitary evolution intrinsically involves both fermion and boson operators under nonadiabatic conditions. The resulting unitary dynamics and boson-frequency dependence reveal a quantum phase transition, evidenced by distinct short-time (power-law decay) and long-time (exponential decay) behaviors, which are manifested in the polaronic shift, bosonic energy, and dynamics of reduced density matrix. This observation is consistent with a non-Markovian to Markovian transition.</description>

      <title>Risk and cross validation in ridge regression with correlated samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04607v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Efficient training of machine learning potentials for metallic glasses: CuZrAl validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interatomic potentials are key to uncovering microscopic structure-property relationships, essential for multiscale simulations and high-throughput experiments. For metallic glasses, their disordered atomic structure makes the development of potentials particularly challenging, resulting in the scarcity of chemistry-specific parametrizations for this important class of materials. We address this gap by introducing an efficient methodology to design machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), benchmarked on the CuZrAl system. Using a Lennard-Jones surrogate model, swap-Monte Carlo sampling, and single-point Density Functional Theory (DFT) corrections, we capture amorphous structures spanning 14 decades of supercooling. These representative configurations, competing with the experimental time scale, enable robust model training across diverse states, while minimizing the need for extensive DFT datasets. The resulting MLIP matches the experimental data and predictions of the classical embedded atom method (EAM) for structural, dynamical, energetic, and mechanical properties. This approach offers a scalable path to develop accurate MLIPs for complex metallic glasses, including emerging multi-component and high-entropy systems.</description>
