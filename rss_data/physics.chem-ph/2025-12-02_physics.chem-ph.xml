      <title>An algorithm for atom-centered lossy compression of the atomic orbital basis in density functional theory calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large atomic-orbital (AO) basis sets of at least triple and preferably quadruple-zeta (QZ) size are required to adequately converge Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations towards the complete basis set limit. However, incrementing the cardinal number by one nearly doubles the AO basis dimension, and the computational cost scales as the cube of the AO dimension, so this is very computationally demanding. In this work, we develop and test a natural atomic orbital (NAO) scheme in which the NAOs are obtained as eigenfunctions of atomic blocks of the density matrix in a one-center orthogonalized representation. The NAO representation enables one-center compression of the AO basis in a manner that is optimal for a given threshold, by discarding NAOs with occupation numbers below that threshold. Extensive tests using the Hartree-Fock functional suggest that a threshold of $10^{-5}$ can yield a compression factor (ratio of AO to compressed NAO dimension) between 2.5 and 4.5 for the QZ pc-3 basis. The errors in relative energies are typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol when the compressed basis is used instead of the uncompressed basis. Between 10 and 100 times smaller errors (i.e., usually less than 0.01 kcal/mol) can be obtained with a threshold $10^{-7}$, while the compression factor is typically between 2 and 2.5.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Photodynamics Unveils a Controlled H$_2$ Loss Channel in Methaniminium Cation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The methaniminium cation, CH$_2$NH$_2^+$, plays an important role in Titan's N$_2$--CH$_4$ atmospheric chemistry. As the simplest protonated Schiff base (PSB), it also serves as a model for studying the nonadiabatic dynamics of retinal PSB, the chromophore central to vertebrate vision. While previous studies have established CN bond cleavage and photoisomerization as the primary pathways in the photochemistry of CH$_2$NH$_2^+$, we now report a new UV-induced photochemical pathway to HCNH$^+$, the dominant ion in Titan's upper atmosphere. Through high-level XMCQDPT2 and CASSCF(12,12) calculations, we identify a novel S$_1$/S$_0$ conical intersection that mediates the concerted double H-atom elimination from the carbon center of CH$_2$NH$_2^+$, yielding carbene CNH$_2^+$ as a direct precursor to HCNH$^+$. On-the-fly trajectory surface hopping dynamics confirm the presence of direct H$_2$ loss following excitation to either the S$_2$ or S$_1$ state. Furthermore, our large-scale, machine learning-accelerated simulations reveal that mode-specific pre-excitation can selectively funnel the dynamics into this new channel via the vibronically allowed S$_1$ state, enabling targeted control of the photochemical outcome.</description>

      <title>Accelerating CCSD(T) on Graphical Processing Units (GPUs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled cluster with singles, doubles and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) often provides ground state correlation energies within "chemical accuracy," but suffers from high computational cost and steep scaling with system size. We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of CCSD(T) in the TeraChem software package. The new implementation achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling the calculation of the (T) correction for a system with 63 atoms and more than 1000 basis functions in a little under 8 hours on a single node. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of our optimized implementation for the rapid calculation of full CCSD(T)/CBS stacking energies for all ten unique DNA base pair stacked tetramers. We expect that the TeraChem CCSD(T) implementation will enable the rapid calculation of high-level data that was not previously accessible in a reasonable timeframe.</description>

      <title>Quantized plasmon modes for metallic nanoparticles of arbitrary shape with a generic dielectric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an effective approach to quantize the electromagnetic response of plasmonic metallic nanostructures. Their shape is arbitrary and they feature a realistic description of the frequency-dependent metal dielectric function that is based on experimental data. The derived quantum modes correctly reproduce the linear response macroscopic polarization of the nanoparticle upon external drive according to classical macroscopic Maxwell equations in the quasistatic limit. Such methodology paves the way for accurate modeling of plexcitonic system, where strong plasmon-molecule coupling and/or strong-driving fields call for a quantized description of the plasmonic response.</description>

      <title>The Spin-MInt Algorithm: an Accurate and Symplectic Propagator for the Spin-Mapping Representation of Nonadiabatic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping methods, including the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) mapping and spin-mapping, are commonly utilised to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics by propagating classical mapping variable trajectories. Recent work confirmed the Momentum Integral (MInt) algorithm is the only known symplectic algorithm for the MMST Hamiltonian. To our knowledge, no symplectic algorithm has been published for the spin-mapping representation without converting to MMST variables and utilising the MInt algorithm. Here, we present the Spin-MInt algorithm which directly propagates the spin-mapping variables. First, we consider a two-level system which maps onto a spin-vector on a Bloch sphere and determine that the Spin-MInt is a symplectic, symmetrical, second-order, time-reversible, angle invariant and geometric structure preserving algorithm. Despite spin-variables resulting in a non-invertible structure matrix, we rigorously prove the Spin-MInt is symplectic using a canonical variable transformation. Computationally, we find that the Spin-MInt and MInt algorithms are symplectic, satisfy Liouville's theorem, provide second-order energy conservation and are more accurate than a previously-published angle-based algorithm. The Spin-MInt is significantly faster than the MInt algorithm for two electronic states. Secondly, we extend this methodology to more than two electronic states and present accurate population results for a three-state morse potential. We believe this to be the first known symplectic algorithm for propagating the nonadiabatic spin-mapping Hamiltonian and one of the first rigorously symplectic algorithms in the case of non-trivial coupling between canonical and spin systems. These results should guide and improve future simulations.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of Charge and Exciton Transport in One-Dimensional Systems Subject to Static and Dynamic Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature-dependence of dynamical properties (e.g., the asymptotic diffusion coefficient and the sub-diffusive exponent) are calculated for charges and excitons in one-dimensional systems subject to static and dynamic disorder. These properties are determined by three complementary methods. One approach is via the time-integration of the velocity autocorrelation function. The second is via the mean-squared-displacement of thermal wavepackets subject to stochastic collapse via Lindblad jump operators. These two methods are applicable in the high-temperature regime, where the noise is temporally uncorrelated. In this regime the noise causes particle localization and the transport is diffusive. The third approach -- applicable in the low-temperature regime -- is weak-coupling Redfield theory. Here, static disorder causes particle localization. When the dynamics is diffusive, the diffusion coefficient is a non-monotonic function of temperature, increasing with temperature in the low-temperature Environment Assisted Quantum Transport regime and decreasing with temperature in the high-temperature quantum-Zeno regime. For any temperature, static and dynamic disorder decreases the diffusion coefficient. The dynamics is non-diffusive for thermal energies deep within the manifold of local-ground-states, where the sub-diffusive exponent decreases with increasing disorder and decreasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Machine Learning Force Field for Predicting Thermal Conductivity of Organic Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity of organic liquids is a vital parameter influencing various industrial and environmental applications, including energy conversion, electronics cooling, and chemical processing. However, atomistic simulation of thermal conductivity of organic liquids has been hindered by the limited accuracy of classical force fields and the huge computational demand of ab initio methods. In this work, we present a machine learning force field (MLFF)-based molecular dynamics simulation workflow to predict the thermal conductivity of 20 organic liquids. Here, we introduce the concept of differential attention into the MLFF architecture for enhanced learning ability, and we use density of the liquids to align the MLFF with experiments. As a result, this workflow achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 14% for the thermal conductivity of various organic liquids, significantly lower than that of the current off-the-shelf classical force field (78%). Furthermore, the MLFF is rewritten using Triton language to maximize simulation speed, enabling rapid prediction of thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional tunnelling of molecules aligned by strong electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong electric fields can be used to align molecules. However, a non-polar molecule such as H$_2$ has no preference for its orientation. There are thus two equivalent configurations with equal energy separated by a potential-energy barrier. Quantum mechanically, the molecule can tunnel between these configurations resulting in a tunnelling splitting, which in the case of H$_2$, is the same as the ortho--para splitting. In this work, we generalize semiclassical instanton theory to calculate the energy splitting of molecules in electric fields in full dimensionality. This goes beyond a perturbative treatment of the field and takes into account changes in molecular geometry during the tunnelling process which influence its electrical properties and can have a significant impact on the result. We first study the case of H$_2$ in a static electric field and then show how it can be applied to larger polar molecules subjected to oscillating electric fields, where we find that even large-amplitude heavy-atom tunnelling can lead to observable splittings.</description>

      <title>Brownian dynamics simulations of electric double-layer capacitors with tunable metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient description of electrodes, characterized by their Thomas-Fermi screening length lTF inside the metal, for Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of capacitors. Within a Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the electron charge density inside the electrodes, we derive the effective many-body potential for ions in an implicit solvent between Thomas-Fermi electrodes, taking into account the constraints of applied voltage and of global electro-neutrality of the system, as well as the 2D periodic boundary conditions along the electrode surfaces. We derive the average charge and the fluctuation-dissipation relation for the differential capacitance, highlighting the contribution of the fluctuations of the net ionic dipole moment, as well as those from the solvent polarization and of the electron density, whose fluctuations are suppressed within the Born-Oppenheimer description. We demonstrate the relevance of this model by validating its predictions against known results for the force on ions as a function of the ion-surface distance in simple geometries. The equilibrium ionic density profiles from BD simulations are in excellent agreement with those from an explicit electrode model for perfect metals, and are obtained at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we discuss with the present model the effect of the Thomas-Fermi screening length on the equilibrium ionic density profiles and the capacitance. While limited to parallel plate capacitors, the present simulation method allows to consider larger systems, lower concentrations, and longer time scales concentrations than molecular simulations in order to predict the electrochemical properties of Thomas-Fermi capacitors and correlate them with the ion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generic rigidity and accidental modes in metal-organic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) combine high porosity with structural fragility, raising important questions about their mechanical stability. We develop a rigidity-based framework in which spring networks parameterized by UFF4MOF are used to construct rigidity and dynamical matrices. Large-scale analysis of 5,682 MOFs from the CoRE 2019 database shows that most frameworks are formally over-constrained yet cluster sharply near the isostatic threshold, revealing accidental geometric modes and placing many MOFs near mechanical instability. In the representative case of UiO-66, we show that auxiliary long-range constraints introduced by tuning the neighbor cutoff lift these modes into soft, flat, finite-frequency bands. The results show that rigidity-matrix analysis can rapidly identify MOFs likely to remain mechanically stable. This near-criticality mirrors behavior known from topological mechanics and points to a deeper design principle in porous crystals.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time correlation functions in single-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of quantum chaos, `out of time ordered correlators' (OTOCs) are commonly used to quantify the rate at which quantum information is scrambled. This rate has been conjectured by Maldecena et al. to obey a universal, temperature dependent bound. Recent studies have shown that instantons, delocalised structures that dominate tunnelling statistics over barriers, reduce the growth rate of OTOCs. For the case of the symmetric double well, this reduction ensures the bound is maintained for OTOCs generated using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a method with approximate dynamics but exact quantum statistics. In this report we set out to further understand the role of the instanton in the enforcement of the Maldacena bound and test whether RPMD is sufficient to satisfy the bound. We also investigate the impact of coherence on the flattening of of OTOCs by contrasting bounded with scattering systems. For the scattering system we observe a significantly smaller OTOC growth rate than that of the analogous bounded system, and a flattening in growth rate as time progresses. We attribute the first effect to influence of the Boltzmann operator, and the second to interference caused by anharmonicity of the potential. In our studies of RPMD, we find counterexamples showing that it is not sufficient to satisfy the bound. We develop a theory for OTOCs using (analytically-continued) Matsubara dynamics, revealing significantly different dynamical behaviour around the instanton compared to the predictions of RPMD. The instanton is found to be stationary in all coordinates but its collective angle $\Phi_0$, and fluctuations about it no longer resemble that of classical dynamics on a first order saddle as in RPMD.</description>

      <title>Optimized spectral and interferometric techniques for the certification of ETPA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Entangled Two-Photon Absorption (ETPA) presents a persistent controversy in the literature, evidenced by a wide disparity in the reported values for the $\sigma_E$ cross-sections. Much of this discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty in discriminating ETPA from various background processes that can mimic its signal, such as linear absorption or scattering. Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons. This asymmetry is used to generate a measurable distortion in the transmitted JSI, and, complementarily, as a reduction in the visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip. To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise. A preliminary experiment addressing the ETPA detection limits using the standard RhB dye is presented.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Specific Conditions for a Repeatable Mpemba Effect</title>

Abstract: Water exhibits many unique properties compared to other liquids, with some of these explained and others remaining enigmatic. Among them, it was proposed and extensively debated that hot water would freeze faster than cold water. Numerous studies have demonstrated the difficulty of successfully elucidating this effect, making explanations surrounding this phenomenon highly controversial. Here, we demonstrate that when two cups filled with cold and hot water are introduced simultaneously in a freezer saturated with ice-nucleating agents, the hot sample freezes faster and to a greater depth than the cold sample, particularly when the initial temperature difference is high. On the other hand, against some previous beliefs, the time to onset of crystallization is always and logically retarded for hotter samples. Under these conditions, where supercooling is eliminated and temperature recording is precisely controlled, robust experiments follow the same trend,regardless of whether hot versus room temperature (RT) samples or RT versus cold samples are tested.</description>

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are remarkable spectral degeneracies in a non-Hermitian system's parameter space, where both eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce. Here, we show that in non-Hermitian molecular chiral systems the position of EPs in the parameter space is enantiomer-specific. First, we show that encircling the EP of one enantiomer drives robust topological population transfer in the chiral molecule while its mirror twin remains unaffected, offering a new route for selective chiral control. Second, we reveal how resonant excitation of EPs in chiral molecules can amplify weak chiral effects, offering an alternative approach to the enhancement of chiral interactions. Third, we demonstrate that a twisted chiral fiber immersed in a liquid solution of chiral molecules exhibits topologically different behavior depending on the solution's enantiomeric excess, offering a new approach to the detection of molecular chirality. Our results combine high enantiosensitivity with topological robustness in chiral discrimination and control, paving the way for new approaches in the exploration of non-Hermitian and chiral phenomena.</description>
