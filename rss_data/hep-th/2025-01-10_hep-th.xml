      <title>Consistent Warped $\mathbb R\times T^{1,1}$ Reduction of Heterotic Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a curious duality between the bosonic sector of heterotic supergravity and the noncritical bosonic string with conformal anomaly. This allows us to map the Mink$_4\times S^3\times S^3$ vacuum of the bosonic string to a new warped $\mathbb R\times (T^{1,1}\times$Mink$_4)$ vacuum of the heterotic theory, which turns out to be supersymmetric, preserving $1/4$ of the supersymmetry. We perform consistent dimensional reduction of the heterotic theory on the warped $\mathbb R\times T^{1,1}$ internal space and obtain ${\cal N}=1$, $D=4$ supergravity, with one complex scalar multiplet and $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ Yang-Mills multiplets, where the gauge symmetry is originated from the isometry group of $T^{1,1}$.</description>

      <title>How to Minimize the Decoherence Caused by Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an experimentalist, Alice, who creates a quantum superposition of a charged or massive body outside of a black hole (or, more generally, in the presence of a Killing horizon). It was previously shown that emission of soft photons/gravitons into the black hole will result in the decoherence of the components of the superposition if it is held open for a sufficiently long span of time. However, at any finite time, $t_c$, during the process, it is not obvious how much decoherence has irrevocably occurred. Equivalently, it is not obvious how much information an observer inside the black hole can extract about Alice's superposition prior to time $t_c$. In this paper, we solve for the optimal experimental protocol to be followed by Alice for $t &gt; t_c$ so as to minimize the decoherence of the components of her superposition. More precisely, given the entangling radiation that has passed through the horizon prior to the cross-section $\mathcal C$ corresponding to the time $t = t_c$ in Alice's lab, we determine the "optimal purification" of this radiation beyond $\mathcal C$ such that the global quantum state of the radiation through the horizon has maximal overlap (quantum fidelity) with the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh vacuum. Due to the intricate low frequency entanglement structure of the quantum field theory vacuum state, we find this optimal purification to be nontrivial. In particular, even if Alice has already "closed" her superposition by bringing the components back together, we find that she can decrease the net decoherence of the components of her superposition somewhat by re-opening it and performing further manipulations.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Matching in 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ SCFTs from M5 Cobordism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anomalies of 6d $\mathcal{N} = (2, 0)$ superconformal field theories for any ADE gauge group using the modern characterization of anomalies by cobordism. We propose that, in order to account for all features of the anomaly, a bordism theory with exotic tangential structure is needed. We then attempt to match the anomaly in the IR effective theory on the tensor branch with a suitable WZW term. Once again, we show that the exotic bordism structure is necessary to achieve this. Our results suggest a natural explanation for the origin of the Hopf-Wess-Zumino term.</description>

      <title>Brane Cosmology from AdS/BCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the time-dependent dynamics of an end-of-the-world (EOW) brane in AdS with a scalar field localized on the brane. We mainly studied several aspects of holography and cosmology. Standard requirements in the AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ lead to a constraint on the conformal dimension in the dS$_d$/CFT$_{d-1}$. We also prove a time-like analog of g-theorem using the null energy condition in the context of AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$. In the cosmological interpretation, we rewrite the equation of motion of the brane as a Friedman-like equation, which enables us to consider its dynamics in analogy with the ordinal cosmology. And then we classify all possible solutions of the brane when the potential takes a constant value. We find that our brane cosmology model can describe a process of creating a universe via a big-bang. Additionally, we show that when the brane is close to a hyperplane, its effective action is given by a Liouville gravity with a scalar field matter. Finally, we also obtain brane solutions with boost symmetry, which are obtained by analytical continuation of Euclidean branes with a torus topology.</description>

      <title>General expression for three-loop $\beta$-functions of $\cal N =$ 1 supersymmetric theories with multiple gauge couplings regularized by higher covariant derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\cal N =$ 1 supersymmetric theories with multiple gauge couplings regularized by higher covariant derivatives, a general expression for three-loop gauge $\beta$-functions is obtained. For this purpose, using general statements about the validity of the NSVZ relations, a result is constructed for the $\beta$-functions defined in terms of the bare couplings. It is demonstrated that in the particular case of MSSM, it precisely reproduces the known expressions found earlier in another way. For the case where Yukawa couplings are absent, similar expressions for three-loop $\beta$-functions are also obtained in terms of the renormalized couplings in an arbitrary subtraction scheme and, in particular, in the $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reformulate the lifting problem in the D1-D5 CFT as a supercharge cohomology problem, and enumerate BPS states according to the fortuitous/monotone classification. Focusing on the deformed $T^4$ symmetric orbifold theory, cohomology classes in the $N=2$ theory are explicitly constructed and matched with the exact BPS partition function. For general $N$, an infinite set of monotone cohomology classes are characterized and conjectured to be exhaustive. We further describe how to assemble BPS states at smaller $N$ into BPS states at larger $N$, and interpret their holographic duals as black hole bound states and massive stringy excitations on smooth horizonless (e.g. Lunin-Mathur) geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01313v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we present the model-independent two-loop effective action up to dimension six after integrating out heavy scalar(s) employing the Heat-Kernel method. We compute the effective operators that emerge at two-loop for two example models: heavy electroweak complex Triplet and Doublet scalars. We present our results on the SILH basis. We also capture the effect in the fermion sector. For these two scenarios, we compute all the fermionic effective operators up to dimension six.</description>

      <title>Universal thermodynamic topological classes of black holes in perfect fluid dark matter background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the universal thermodynamic topological classes of a family of black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) background. Recent research on black hole thermodynamics suggests that all black holes can be classified into four universal thermodynamic classes, denoted by $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$. Our study reveals that the Schwarzschild black hole in PFDM belongs to the $W^{1-}$ class, and independence of black hole size thermodynamically unstable at both low- and high-temperature limits. The Reissner-Nordstr\"om, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman black holes in the PFDM background belong to the same universal thermodynamic class, $W^{0+}$, which represents small, stable black holes and large, unstable black holes at low-temperature limits, whereas no black hole state exists at high temperatures. The AdS black holes behave differently compared to their counterparts in PFDM. The Schwarzschild-AdS black hole belongs to the $W^{0-}$ class, indicating no black hole state at low temperatures, but small, unstable and large, stable black hole states at high temperatures. Furthermore, the Kerr-AdS black hole belongs to the $W^{1+}$ class, characterized by small, stable black holes at low temperatures, large, stable black holes at high temperatures, and unstable, intermediate-sized black holes at both low and high temperatures. These findings uncover the universal topological classifications underlying black hole thermodynamics, offering profound insights into the fundamental principles of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Ultraviolet Freeze-in in General Reheating Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of cosmic reheating, that is, on how the energy stored in the inflaton is transferred to the standard model (SM) thermal bath, is largely unknown. In this work, we show that the phenomenology of the nonbaryonic dark matter (DM) ultraviolet freeze-in production strongly depends on the dynamics of the cosmic-reheating era. Using a general parametrization for the Hubble expansion rate and SM temperature, we thoroughly investigate DM production during reheating, not only recovering earlier findings that focused on specific cases, but also exploring alternative scenarios. Additionally, we derive a generalized framework for DM production via inflaton decays and identify the viable parameter space, while simultaneously addressing constraints from CMB observations. As illustrative examples, we explore gravitational DM production through scatterings of SM particles or inflatons, deriving well-defined parameter regions for these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Quasi-Periodically Driven Quantum Critical Systems: Analytical Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study analytically the phase transitions in quasi-periodically driven one dimensional quantum critical systems that are described by conformal field theories (CFTs). The phase diagrams and phase transitions can be analytically obtained by using Avila's global theory in one-frequency quasiperiodic cocycles. Compared to the previous works where the quasiperiodicity was introduced in the driving time and no phase transitions were observed [1], here we propose a setup where the quasiperiodicity is introduced in the driving Hamiltonians. In our setup, one can observe the heating phases, non-heating phases, and the phase transitions. The phase diagram as well as the Lyapunov exponents that determine the entanglement entropy evolution can be analytically obtained. In addition, based on Avila's theory, we prove there is no phase transition in the previously proposed setup of quasi-periodically driven CFTs [1]. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of entanglement entropy on lattice models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continual production of gravitons during inflation endows loop corrections with secular logarithms which grow nonperturbatively large during a prolonged period of inflation. The physics behind these effects is reviewed, along with a catalog of the examples which have so far been found. Resummation can be accomplished by combining a variant of Starobinsky's stochastic formalism with a variant of the renormalization group. The issue of gauge independence is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Duality, asymptotic charges and algebraic topology in mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper the duality map between electric-like asymptotic charges of $p$-form gauge theories is studied. The outcome is an existence and uniqueness theorem and the topological nature of the duality map. The goal of this work is to extend that theorem in the case of mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories in order to have a deeper understanding of exotic gauge theories, of the non-trivial charges associated to them and of the duality of their observables. Unlike the simpler case of $p$-form gauge theories, here we need to develop some new mathematical tools. The crucial points are to view a mixed symmetry tensor as a Young projected object of the $N$-multi-form space and to develop an analogue of de Rham complex for mixed symmetry tensors. As a result, if the underlying manifold satisfy appropriate conditions, the duality map can be proven to exist and to be unique ensuring the charge of a description has information on the dual ones.</description>

      <title>Many body gravity and the bullet cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many body gravity (MBG) is an alternate theory of gravity, which has been able to explain the galaxy rotation curves, the radial acceleration relation (RAR) and the wide binary stars (WBS). The genesis of MBG is a novel theory, which models systems with thermal gradients, by recasting the variation in the temperature as a variation in the metric. Merging the above concept with Einstein's gravity, leads to the theory of thermal gravity in 5-D space-time-temperature. Thermal gravity when generalized for partially thermalized systems, results in the theory of many body gravity. The bullet cluster is supposed to be a smoking gun evidence for the presence of dark matter. However, this work demonstrates that the MBG theory can explain the weak gravitational lensing effect of the bullet cluster, without the need for yet undiscovered baryonic matter or dark matter.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies from deterministic non-locality in theory space Anderson localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nearest-neighbour or local mass terms in theory space among quantum fields, with their generic disordered values, are known to lead to the localisation of mass eigenstates, analogous to Anderson localisation in a one-dimensional lattice. This mechanism can be used to create an exponential hierarchy in the coupling between two fields by placing them at opposite ends of the lattice chain. Extending this mechanism, we show that when copies of such fields are appropriately attached to the lattice chain, it leads to the emergence of multiple massless modes. These vanishing masses are a direct consequence of the locality of interactions in theory space. The latter may break down in an ordered and deterministic manner through quantum effects if additional interactions exist among the chain fields. Such non-locality can induce small masses for the otherwise massless modes without necessarily delocalising the mass eigenstates. We provide examples of interactions that preserve or even enhance localisation. Applications to flavour hierarchies, neutrino mass, and the $\mu$-problem in supersymmetric theories are discussed.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on Naked Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves propagating in the background provided by a spacetime hosting a strong curvature, naked singularity, are fully studied. The analysis is performed not only in the realm of geometrical optics -- which, not surprisingly, proves to be inadequate in the strong field regime characterizing the vicinity of the singularity -- but also in the physical one in which the field amplitudes must necessarily be incorporated into the description. In addition to the expected divergent outcome with regard to the field amplitudes and power flux as the waves approach the singularity, we found a number of regular (bounded) solutions which seem to coexist with the unbridled effects of the spacetime curvature. In some of them, the singularity operates as a perfect mirror reflecting the surrounding fields. Strikingly, other solutions exhibit a perfectly well behaved, bounded power flux as they propagate towards the singularity, suggesting thus the possibility of having electromagnetic energy transference through it.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in Bosonic Stars: chains and rings from spherical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation phenomena between spherical and axisymmetric bosonic stars. By numerically solving for the zero-modes of spherical bosonic stars under specific axially symmetric perturbations, we discover that excited state spherical bosonic stars bifurcate into two types of axisymmetric bosonic stars under $\ell=2$ perturbations, with matter distributions resembling chains and rings, respectively. Meanwhile, $\ell=4$ axisymmetric perturbations lead spherical scalar bosonic stars to bifurcate into a new type of axisymmetric bosonic stars, exhibiting a mixed chain-like and ring-like matter distribution, which we refer to as gyroscope-like. Additionally, for the first time, we have constructed chains of scalar bosonic stars with 7 constituents and their corresponding ring-like scalar bosonic stars. Our results provide an explanation for the bifurcations in bosonic stars from the perspective of perturbations, and by analyzing physical quantities such as quadrupoles and energy densities we systematically discuss the impact of axisymmetric perturbations on spherical bosonic stars.</description>

      <title>Entropy flow in a parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computations of entropy in thermodynamics rely on discreteness of the spectra of the subsystems. We argue that, for cases with continuous spectra (typically, radiation), there is a useful definition of entropy flow based on discretizing the signal into Gabor's "atoms," say, by means of a windowed Fourier transform. In particular, applying this method to a parametric amplifier (paramp) driven by a classical pump and coupled to a zero-temperature Markovian bath, we find that the output entropy flux vanishes at large times, even though the energy and photon number fluxes remain nonzero. This is consistent with the manner in which the paramp is expected to release information about its initial state. We relate the quenching of the entropy flow to development of the off-diagonal coherences in the output and discuss possible relevance of this mechanism to the black-hole information problem. We also propose to use measurements of the off-diagonal coherences as a means of extracting the rates at which high-entropy subsystems release information to Gaussian environments.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Holomorphic Symplectic Manifolds: Analytic Continuation of Path Integrals and Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Berezin's quantization $q:M\to\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ to holomorphic symplectic manifolds, which involves replacing the state space $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ with its complexification $\text{T}^*\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}.$ We show that this is equivalent to replacing rank$\unicode{x2013}$1 Hermitian projections with all rank$\unicode{x2013}$1 projections. We furthermore allow the states to be points in the cotangent bundle of a Grassmanian. We also define a holomorphic path integral quantization as a certain idempotent in a convolution algebra and we prove that these two quantizations are equivalent. For each $n&gt;0,$ we construct a faithful functor from the category of finite dimensional $C^*$$\unicode{x2013}$algebras to to the category of hyperk\"{a}hler manifolds and we show that our quantization recovers the original $C^*$$\unicode{x2013}$algebra. In particular, this functor comes with a homomorphism from the commutator algebra of the $C^*$$\unicode{x2013}$algebra to the Poisson algebra of the associated hyperk\"{a}hler manifold. Related to this, we show that the cotangent bundles of Grassmanians have commuting almost complex structures that are compatible with a holomorphic symplectic form.</description>

      <title>Exploring Confinement in Anti-de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Yang-Mills theory on four dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. The Dirichlet boundary condition cannot exist at arbitrarily large radius because it would give rise to colored asymptotic states in flat space. As observed in [1] this implies a deconfinement-confinement transition as the radius is increased. We gather hints on the nature of this transition using perturbation theory. We compute the anomalous dimensions of the lightest scalar operators in the boundary theory, finding that the singlet gets a larger negative anomalous dimension compared to the adjoint. We also compute the correction to the coefficient $C_J$ and we estimate that the singlet operator reaches marginality before the value of the coupling at which $C_J=0$. These results favor the scenario of merger and annihilation as the most promising candidate for the transition. For the Neumann boundary condition, the lightest scalar operator is found to have a positive anomalous dimension, in agreement with the idea that this boundary condition extrapolates smoothly to flat space. The perturbative calculations are made possible by a drastic simplification of the gauge field propagator in Fried-Yennie gauge. We also derive a general result for the leading-order anomalous dimension of the displacement operator for a generic perturbation in Anti-de Sitter, showing that it is related to the beta function of bulk couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conformal field theory in $d=1$ space-time dimensions. We derive a dispersion relation for the 4-point correlation function of identical bosons and fermions, in terms of the double discontinuity. This extends the conformal dispersion relation of arXiv:1910.12123, which holds for CFTs in dimensions $d\geq 2$, to the case of $d=1$. The dispersion relation is obtained by combining the Lorentzian inversion formula with the operator product expansion of the 4-point correlator. We perform checks of the dispersion relation using correlators of generalised free fields and derive an integral relation between the kernel of the dispersion relation and that of the Lorentzian inversion formula. Finally, for $1$-$d$ holographic conformal theories, we analytically compute scalar Witten diagrams in $AdS_2$ at tree-level and $1$-loop.</description>

      <title>Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principles, Liouville theorem and density of states: Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modifications in quantum mechanical phase space lead to the changes in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which can result in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) or the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), introducing quantum gravitational effects at small and large distances, respectively. A combination of GUP and EUP, the Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP or EGUP), further generalizes these modifications by incorporating noncommutativity in both coordinates and momenta. This paper examines the impact of GEUP on the analogue of the Liouville theorem in statistical physics and density of states within the classical limit of non-relativistic quantum mechanics framework. We find a weighted phase space volume element, invariant under the infinitesimal time evolution, in the cases of Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models, presenting how GEUP alters the density of states, potentially affecting physical (thermodynamical) properties. Special cases, obtained in certain limits from the above models are discussed. New higher order types of GEUP and EUP are also proposed.</description>

      <title>Generalized volume-complexity for Lovelock black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time dependence of the generalized complexity of Lovelock black holes using the "complexity = anything" conjecture, which expands upon the notion of "complexity = volume" and generates a large class of observables. By applying a specific condition, a more limited class can be chosen, whose time growth is equivalent to a conserved momentum. Specifically, we investigate the numerical full time behavior of complexity time rate, focusing on the second and third orders of Lovelock theory coupled with Maxwell term, incorporating an additional term -- the square of the Weyl tensor of the background spacetime -- into the generalization function. Furthermore, we repeat the analysis for case with three additional scalar terms: the square of Riemann and Ricci tensors, and the Ricci scalar for second-order gravity (Gauss-Bonnet) showing how these terms can affect to multiple asymptotic behavior of time. We study how the phase transition of generalized complexity and its time evolution occur at turning point $(\tau_{turning})$ where the maximal generalized volume supersedes another branch. Additionally, we discuss the late time behavior, focusing on proportionality of the complexity time rate to the difference of temperature times entropy at the two horizons ($TS(r_+)-TS(r_-)$) for charged black holes, which can be corrected by generalization function of each radius in generalized case. In this limit, we also explore near singularity structure by approximating spacetime to Kasner metrics and finding possible values of complexity growth rate with different choices of the generalization function.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Extremal Couplings in AdS/CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an effective theory of massive scalar fields on a fixed AdS$_{d+1}$ background with a cubic extremal interaction among them. A bulk coupling is called extremal whenever the corresponding conformal dimension of any of the dual CFT$_d$ operators matches the sum of all the others. For cubic bulk couplings, this is $\Delta_i+\Delta_j=\Delta_k$. These bulk interactions are often disregarded in the literature since they do not appear in traditional models of AdS/CFT. Turning them on yields a divergent vertex in the dual CFT, and here we show that these divergences can be regulated. Once renormalized, we demonstrate that this coupling introduces non-trivial mixing between single- and double-trace operators, and we compute the anomalous dimensions of the corrected operators to leading order in perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

Abstract: We present a JT gravity setup coupled with $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills fields in two dimensions that reveals the onset of a small black hole to large black hole phase transition at finite chemical potential(s). We identify these black hole solutions as topological defects in the thermodynamic phase space and calculate the associated topological numbers following the standard procedure. We confirm the robustness of our model by estimating perturbative corrections to the bulk free energy at an arbitrary order in the Yang-Mills coupling. We also construct the Schwarzian for the boundary theory using the 2D gravitational action in the bulk and comment on the dual SYK like model where similar observations can be made.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a direct scattering in the bulk may not have a local boundary analog. A nonlocal implementation on the boundary requires $O(1/G_N)$ mutual information. This statement is formalized by the connected wedge theorem, which can be proven using general relativity within AdS$_3$ but also argued for using quantum information theory on the boundary, suggesting that the theorem applies to any holographic duality. We examine scattering within the static patch of asymptotically dS$_3$ spacetime, which is conjectured to be described by a quantum theory on the stretched horizon in static patch holography. We show that causality on the horizon induced from null infinities $\mathcal{I}^{\pm}$ is consistent with the theorem. Specifically, signals propagating in the static patch are associated with local operators at $\mathcal{I}^{\pm}$. Our results suggest a novel connection between static patch holography and the dS/CFT correspondence.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the possibilities of certain gauge transformations regarding some specific spinorial dual structures. To this end, we define a general structure, which can be expressed in terms of discrete symmetry operators associated with parity, charge conjugation, and time reversal. To this end, we consider the demand of tensor covariance of the spinor bilinears under space-time transformations and also deep algebraic considerations such as the invertibility of the dual structure which guarantee that the physical information remains unchanged (respecting the Fierz-Pauli-Kofink identities), and so on. Later, we examine the global gauge freedom implicated by each choice of dual and point out the physical implications. The final goal is achieved by establishing a well-defined coupling between the Elko and standard model neutrinos in a prelude for a new formulation of the hypothetical so-called sterile neutrino.</description>

Abstract: A huge progress in studying holographic theories is that holography can be interpreted via the quantum error correction, which makes equal the entanglement wedge reconstruction, the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh formula, the radial commutativity and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We call the equivalence the reconstruction theorem, whose infinite-dimensional generalization via algebraic language was believed to exclude the algebraic version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. However, recent developments regarding gravitational algebras have shown that the inclusion of the algebraic Ryu-Takayanagi formula is plausible. In this letter, we prove that such inclusion holds for the cases of type I/II factors, which are expected to describe holographic theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic censorship in anti-de Sitter space in holographic models in which the ground state is described by a good singularity. These include supersymmetric truncations of string/M-theory, for which a positive-energy theorem holds. At the boundary, our solutions describe a boost-invariant fluid in which the temperature decreases monotonically with time. On the gravity side, they correspond to black-brane spacetimes with a receding horizon. In classical gravity, curvature invariants at the horizon grow without bound. In the full theory this regime may or may not be reached. In some cases it is avoided by a phase transition to a regular geometry. In others it is reached but the boundary hydrodynamic evolution can be continued, provided the equation of state at parametrically small energies is known. Both cases require the inclusion of finite-$N$ or finite-coupling effects.</description>

The study of analytical methods in two-dimensional conformal field theory has developed over several decades, starting with BPZ. The development of analytical methods, particularly in rational conformal field theory (RCFT), has been remarkable, with complete classifications achieved for certain model groups. One motivation for studying CFT comes from its ability to describe quantum critical systems. Given that realistic quantum critical systems are fundamentally RCFTs, it is somewhat natural that the analytical methods of RCFT have evolved significantly.
  CFTs other than RCFTs are called irrational conformal field theories (ICFTs). Compared to RCFTs, the study of ICFTs has not progressed as much. Leaving aside whether there is physical motivation or not, ICFTs inherently possess a difficulty that makes them challenging to approach. However, with the development of quantum gravity, the advancement of analytical methods for ICFTs has become essential. The reason lies in the AdS/CFT correspondence. AdS/CFT refers to the relationship between $d+1$ dimensional quantum gravity and $d$ dimensional CFT. Within this correspondence, the CFT appears as a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity. Except in special cases, this CFT belongs to ICFT. Against this backdrop, the methods for ICFTs have developed rapidly in recent years. Many of these ICFT methods are indispensable for modern quantum gravity research. Unfortunately, these cannot be learned from textbooks on 2D CFTs, such as Yellow book. These lecture notes aim to fill this gap. Specifically, we will cover techniques that have already been applied in many studies, such as HHLL block and monodromy method, and significant results that have become proper nouns, such as Hellerman bound and HKS bound.</description>

      <title>Timelike and gravitational anomalous entanglement from the inner horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, the boundary causal development and the entanglement wedge of any boundary spacelike interval can be mapped to a thermal CFT$_2$ and a Rindler $\widetilde{\text{AdS}_3}$ respectively via certain boundary and bulk Rindler transformations. Nevertheless, the Rindler mapping is not confined in the entanglement wedges. While the outer horizon of the Rindler $\widetilde{\text{AdS}_3}$ is mapped to the RT surface, we also identify the pre-image of the inner horizon in the original AdS$_3$, which we call the inner RT surface. In this paper we give some new physical interpretation for the inner RT surface. First, the inner RT surface breaks into two pieces which anchor on the two tips of the causal development. Furthermore, we can take the two tips as the endpoints of a certain timelike interval and the inner RT surface is exactly the spacelike geodesic that represents the real part of the so-called holographic timelike entanglement entropy (HTEE). We also identify a timelike geodesic at boundary of the extended entanglement wedge, which represents the imaginary part of the HTEE. Second, in the duality between the topological massive gravity (TMG) and gravitational anomalous CFT$_2$, the entanglement entropy and the mixed state correlation that is dual to the entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) receive correction from the Chern-Simons term in the TMG. We find that, the correction to the holographic entanglement entropy can be reproduced by the area of the inner RT surface with a proper regulation, while the mixed state correlation can be represented by the saddle geodesic chord connecting the two pieces of the inner RT surface of the mixed state we consider, which we call the inner EWCS. The equivalence between the twist on the RT surface and the length of inner RT surface is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical properties of a deformed Schwarzschild black hole via Dunkl generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a deformed Schwarzschild black hole from the de Sitter gauge theory of gravity within Dunkl generalization and we determine the metric coefficients versus Dunkl parameter and parity operators. Since the spacetime coordinates are not affected by the group transformations, only fields are allowed to change under the action of the symmetry group. A particular ansatz for the gauge fields is chosen and the components of the strength tensor are computed as well. Additionally, we analyze the modifications on the thermodynamic properties to a spherically symmetric black hole due to Dunkl parameters for even and odd parities. Finally, we verify a novel remark highlighted from heat capacity: the appearance of a phase transition when the odd parity is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Delicate curvature bounces in the no-boundary wave function and in the late universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations motivate us to consider vacuum energy to be able to decay and to assume that the spatial geometry of the universe is closed. Combining both aspects leads to the possibility that the universe, or certain regions thereof, can collapse and subsequently undergo a curvature bounce. This may have occurred in the very early universe, in a pre-inflationary phase. We discuss the construction of the corresponding no-boundary instantons and show that they indeed reproduce a bouncing history of the universe, interestingly with a small and potentially observable departure from classicality during the contracting phase. Such an early bouncing history receives a large weighting and provides competition for a more standard inflationary branch of the wave function. Curvature bounces may also occur in the future. We discuss the conditions under which they may take place, allowing for density fluctuations in the matter distribution in the universe. Overall, we find that curvature bounces require a delicate combination of matter content and initial conditions to occur, though with significant consequences if these conditions are met.</description>

      <title>Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</description>

      <title>Experimental Bounds on Deformed Muon Lifetime Dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze Planck scale induced modifications of the relativistic time dilation using data from the Muon Storage Ring experiment at CERN. By examining the lifetimes of muons, we establish, for the first time, a constraint on such quantum gravity-inspired deformations using this channel. The magnitude of the effect indicates that the study of cosmic rays is a well suited arena for this scenario. We show, that the spectrum of muons would be significantly affected for particles at the PeV scale. Since this later observation of the effect of time dilation is more indirect compared to a direct lifetime measurement, we encourage to perform a high precision measurement of the muon lifetime as a function of the muons energy.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for differentially rotating galaxies in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of stationary axisymmetric solutions of Einstein's equations for isolated differentially rotating matter sources is presented. The low-energy asymptotic regime is extracted, requiring a self-consistent coupling of quasilocal energy and angular momentum. The Raychaudhuri equation reduces to a balance equation, with two important limits. These limits can be interpreted empirically for rotationally supported configurations such as galaxies. The net energy including quasilocal kinetic contributions vanishes on the inner vortex surface, and the outer rotosurface. These new geometrical objects potentially shed light on virialization. Whether or not abundant collisionless dark matter exists, the new solutions very strongly support previous suggestions that the phenomenology of galactic rotation curves be fundamentally reconsidered, for consistency with general relativity.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This can be tested in future observatories, for example, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET via second-order GW signals. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>T-Model Higgs Inflation and Metastable Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the formation of metastable cosmic strings (CSs) in the context of a supersymmetric (SUSY) left-right model. The SU(2)R symmetry breaking occurs during a stage of T-model (Higgs) inflation (TI) driven by an SU(2)R triplet superfield which inflates away the produced monopoles. The subsequent breaking of the remaining U(1)R x U(1)B-L symmetry, triggered due to an instability arising in the system of a pair of SU(2)R doublet superfields, leads to the production of CSs. TI is based on a quartic potential, is consistent with data thanks to the adopted hyperbolic Kaehler geometry and may be followed by successful non-thermal leptogenesis. The decay of produced CSs interprets the recent observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with values of the superpotential coupling constants close to 10^-6-10^-8 and symmetry-breaking scales a little lower than the SUSY grand unified theory scale. A solution to the mu problem of the MSSM is also accommodated provided that mu is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the gravitino mass. The issue of the gauge coupling unification is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Matching current observational constraints with nonminimally coupled dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a Universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. In particular, the nonminimal coupling in this model allows for the dark energy model to exhibit stable phantom crossing behavior, which seems to be suggested by the constraints on the dark energy equation of state coming from the most recent data. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Modified particle dynamics and thermodynamics in a traversable wormhole in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze various phenomena influenced by the gravitational field in a bumblebee gravity solution, with a particular emphasis on a traversable wormhole for massless particle modes. Specifically, we calculate the index of refraction, group velocity, time delay, modified distances, and interparticle potential, demonstrating the possibility of photon-photon interactions due to the wormhole geometry. For the latter aspect, we also extend the analysis to massive particle modes, resulting in a ``combination'' of modified Yukawa- and Couloumb-like potentials. These calculations are shown to be dependent on the wormhole's parameters, particularly the wormhole throat. In addition to these analyses, the Hawking temperature is derived using the trapping horizon method, yielding negative values. Furthermore, we derive the thermodynamic properties of photon-like modes by incorporating the modified dispersion relation arising from the wormhole geometry, focusing on non-interacting particle modes. Remarkably, all calculations are conducted in a fully analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out a hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory in which the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 2-form flat gauge field (the 't~Hooft flux) is explicitly treated as one of dynamical variables. We observe that our HMC algorithm in the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ theory drastically reduces autocorrelation lengths of the topological charge and of a physical quantity which couples to slow modes in the conventional HMC simulation of the $SU(2)$ theory. Provided that sufficiently large lattice volumes are available, therefore, the HMC algorithm of the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ theory could be employed as an alternative for the simulation of the $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory, because local observables are expected to be insensitive to the difference between $SU(N)$ and~$SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ in the large volume limit. A possible method to incorporate quarks (fermions in the fundamental representation of~$SU(N)$ with the baryon number~$1/N$) in this framework is also considered.</description>
