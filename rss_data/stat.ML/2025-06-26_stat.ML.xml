      <title>The final solution of the Hitchhiker's problem #5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent survey, nicknamed "Hitchhiker's Guide", J.J. Arias-Garc{\i}a, R. Mesiar, and B. De Baets, A hitchhiker's guide to quasi-copulas, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 393 (2020) 1-28, has raised the rating of quasi-copula problems in the dependence modeling community in spite of the lack of statistical interpretation of quasi-copulas. In our previous work (arXiv:2410.19339, accepted in Fuzzy Sets and Systems), we addressed the question of extreme values of the mass distribution associated with multivariate quasi-copulas. Using a linear programming approach, we were able to solve Open Problem 5 of the "Guide" up to dimension d = 17 and disprove a recent conjecture on the solution to that problem. In this paper, we use an analytical approach to provide a complete answer to the original question.</description>

      <title>Stable Minima of ReLU Neural Networks Suffer from the Curse of Dimensionality: The Neural Shattering Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flatness / low (loss) curvature and its effects on generalization in two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with multivariate inputs -- a problem well motivated by the minima stability and edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training. Existing work either requires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper presents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate inputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and (2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable minima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness does imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily deteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an exponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\`a-vis low-norm solutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat solutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely activate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in high dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the first systematic explanation for why flat minima may fail to generalize in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Manifold Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an active learning framework for manifold Gaussian Process (GP) regression, combining manifold learning with strategic data selection to improve accuracy in high-dimensional spaces. Our method jointly optimizes a neural network for dimensionality reduction and a Gaussian process regressor in the latent space, supervised by an active learning criterion that minimizes global prediction error. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate superior performance over randomly sequential learning. The framework efficiently handles complex, discontinuous functions while preserving computational tractability, offering practical value for scientific and engineering applications. Future work will focus on scalability and uncertainty-aware manifold learning.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on the Size of Markov Equivalence Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms typically recover causal graphs only up to their Markov equivalence classes unless additional parametric assumptions are made. The sizes of these equivalence classes reflect the limits of what can be learned about the underlying causal graph from purely observational data. Under the assumptions of acyclicity, causal sufficiency, and a uniform model prior, Markov equivalence classes are known to be small on average. In this paper, we show that this is no longer the case when any of these assumptions is relaxed. Specifically, we prove exponentially large lower bounds for the expected size of Markov equivalence classes in three settings: sparse random directed acyclic graphs, uniformly random acyclic directed mixed graphs, and uniformly random directed cyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Geopolitical Events with a Sparse Temporal Fusion Transformer and Gaussian Process Hybrid: A Case Study in Middle Eastern and U.S. Conflict Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting geopolitical conflict from data sources like the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is a critical challenge for national security. The inherent sparsity, burstiness, and overdispersion of such data cause standard deep learning models, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), to produce unreliable long-horizon predictions. We introduce STFT-VNNGP, a hybrid architecture that won the 2023 Algorithms for Threat Detection (ATD) competition by overcoming these limitations. Designed to bridge this gap, our model employs a two-stage process: first, a TFT captures complex temporal dynamics to generate multi-quantile forecasts. These quantiles then serve as informed inputs for a Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP), which performs principled spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty quantification. In a case study forecasting conflict dynamics in the Middle East and the U.S., STFT-VNNGP consistently outperforms a standalone TFT, showing a superior ability to predict the timing and magnitude of bursty event periods, particularly at long-range horizons. This work offers a robust framework for generating more reliable and actionable intelligence from challenging event data, with all code and workflows made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Multi-agent Learning Dynamics in Finite-state Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for approximating the learning dynamics of multiple reinforcement learning (RL) agents interacting in a finite-state Markov game. The idea is to rescale the learning process by simultaneously reducing the learning rate and increasing the update frequency, effectively treating the agent's parameters as a slow-evolving variable influenced by the fast-mixing game state. Under mild assumptions-ergodicity of the state process and continuity of the updates-we prove the convergence of this rescaled process to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This ODE provides a tractable, deterministic approximation of the agent's learning dynamics. An implementation of the framework is available at\,: https://github.com/yannKerzreho/MarkovGameApproximation</description>

      <title>Hyperspherical Variational Autoencoders Using Efficient Spherical Cauchy Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture that employs a spherical Cauchy (spCauchy) latent distribution. Unlike traditional Gaussian latent spaces or the widely used von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, spCauchy provides a more natural hyperspherical representation of latent variables, better capturing directional data while maintaining flexibility. Its heavy-tailed nature prevents over-regularization, ensuring efficient latent space utilization while offering a more expressive representation. Additionally, spCauchy circumvents the numerical instabilities inherent to vMF, which arise from computing normalization constants involving Bessel functions. Instead, it enables a fully differentiable and efficient reparameterization trick via M\"obius transformations, allowing for stable and scalable training. The KL divergence can be computed through a rapidly converging power series, eliminating concerns of underflow or overflow associated with evaluation of ratios of hypergeometric functions. These properties make spCauchy a compelling alternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical efficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Wild refitting for black box prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe and analyze a computionally efficient refitting procedure for computing high-probability upper bounds on the instance-wise mean-squared prediction error of penalized nonparametric estimates based on least-squares minimization. Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals, symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop sampling methods, which consist of Gaussian invariant versions of random walk Metropolis (RWM), Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) and second order Hessian or Manifold MALA. Unlike standard RWM and MALA we show that Gaussian invariant sampling can lead to ergodic estimators with improved statistical efficiency. This is due to a remarkable property of Gaussian invariance that allows us to obtain exact analytical solutions to the Poisson equation for Gaussian targets. These solutions can be used to construct efficient and easy to use control variates for variance reduction of estimators under any intractable target. We demonstrate the new samplers and estimators in several examples, including high dimensional targets in latent Gaussian models where we compare against several advanced methods and obtain state-of-the-art results. We also provide theoretical results regarding geometric ergodicity, and an optimal scaling analysis that shows the dependence of the optimal acceptance rate on the Gaussianity of the target.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Tree Sampling: Scalable inference-time alignment of diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation, DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$ effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to $5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>On Convolutions, Intrinsic Dimension, and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models, and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support. For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers, adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions. Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.</description>

      <title>Latent-space Field Tension for Astrophysical Component Detection An application to X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern observatories are designed to deliver increasingly detailed views of astrophysical signals. To fully realize the potential of these observations, principled data-analysis methods are required to effectively separate and reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components from data corrupted by noise and instrumental effects. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-frequency Bayesian model of the sky emission field that leverages latent-space tension as an indicator of model misspecification, enabling automated separation of diffuse, point-like, and extended astrophysical emission components across wavelength bands. Deviations from latent-space prior expectations are used as diagnostics for model misspecification, thus systematically guiding the introduction of new sky components, such as point-like and extended sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic multi-frequency imaging data and apply it to observational X-ray data from the eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) of the SN1987A region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our results highlight the method's capability to reconstruct astrophysical components with high accuracy, achieving sub-pixel localization of point sources, robust separation of extended emission, and detailed uncertainty quantification. The developed methodology offers a general and well-founded framework applicable to a wide variety of astronomical datasets, and is therefore well suited to support the analysis needs of next-generation multi-wavelength and multi-messenger surveys.</description>

      <title>Optimal Single-Policy Sample Complexity and Transient Coverage for Average-Reward Offline RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy, specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs, contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy, distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.</description>

      <title>Faster Fixed-Point Methods for Multichain MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study value-iteration (VI) algorithms for solving general (a.k.a. multichain) Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the average-reward criterion, a fundamental but theoretically challenging setting. Beyond the difficulties inherent to all average-reward problems posed by the lack of contractivity and non-uniqueness of solutions to the Bellman operator, in the multichain setting an optimal policy must solve the navigation subproblem of steering towards the best connected component, in addition to optimizing long-run performance within each component. We develop algorithms which better solve this navigational subproblem in order to achieve faster convergence for multichain MDPs, obtaining improved rates of convergence and sharper measures of complexity relative to prior work. Many key components of our results are of potential independent interest, including novel connections between average-reward and discounted problems, optimal fixed-point methods for discounted VI which extend to general Banach spaces, new sublinear convergence rates for the discounted value error, and refined suboptimality decompositions for multichain MDPs. Overall our results yield faster convergence rates for discounted and average-reward problems and expand the theoretical foundations of VI approaches.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Shallow Transformers for Wireless Symbol Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems, particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space, CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2 layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models, making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Linearity-based neural network compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally. Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural network models.</description>

      <title>On Uniform Weighted Deep Polynomial approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result in rational approximation theory that certain non-smooth or singular functions, such as $|x|$ and $x^{1/p}$, can be efficiently approximated using rational functions with root-exponential convergence in terms of degrees of freedom \cite{Sta, GN}. In contrast, polynomial approximations admit only algebraic convergence by Jackson's theorem \cite{Lub2}. Recent work shows that composite polynomial architectures can recover exponential approximation rates even without smoothness \cite{KY}. In this work, we introduce and analyze a class of weighted deep polynomial approximants tailored for functions with asymmetric behavior-growing unbounded on one side and decaying on the other. By multiplying a learnable deep polynomial with a one-sided weight, we capture both local non-smoothness and global growth. We show numerically that this framework outperforms Taylor, Chebyshev, and standard deep polynomial approximants, even when all use the same number of parameters. To optimize these approximants in practice, we propose a stable graph-based parameterization strategy building on \cite{Jar}.</description>

      <title>Robust Alignment via Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem provides a powerful framework for aligning heterogeneous datasets by matching their internal structures in a way that minimizes distortion. However, GW alignment is sensitive to data contamination by outliers, which can greatly distort the resulting matching scheme. To address this issue, we study robust GW alignment, where upon observing contaminated versions of the clean data distributions, our goal is to accurately estimate the GW alignment cost between the original (uncontaminated) measures. We propose an estimator based on the partial GW distance, which trims out a fraction of the mass from each distribution before optimally aligning the rest. The estimator is shown to be minimax optimal in the population setting and is near-optimal in the finite-sample regime, where the optimality gap originates only from the suboptimality of the plug-in estimator in the empirical estimation setting (i.e., without contamination). Towards the analysis, we derive new structural results pertaining to the approximate pseudo-metric structure of the partial GW distance. Overall, our results endow the partial GW distance with an operational meaning by posing it as a robust surrogate of the classical distance when the observed data may be contaminated.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Contextual Bandit Problem without Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, we investigate the high-dimensional linear contextual bandit problem where the number of features $p$ is greater than the budget $T$, or it may even be infinite. Differing from the majority of previous works in this field, we do not impose sparsity on the regression coefficients. Instead, we rely on recent findings on overparameterized models, which enables us to analyze the performance of the minimum-norm interpolating estimator when data distributions have small effective ranks. We propose an explore-then-commit (EtC) algorithm to address this problem and examine its performance. Through our analysis, we derive the optimal rate of the ETC algorithm in terms of $T$ and show that this rate can be achieved by balancing exploration and exploitation. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive explore-then-commit (AEtC) algorithm that adaptively finds the optimal balance. We assess the performance of the proposed algorithms through a series of simulations.</description>

      <title>SDE Matching: Scalable and Simulation-Free Training of Latent Stochastic Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Latent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is a powerful tool for time series and sequence modeling. However, training Latent SDEs typically relies on adjoint sensitivity methods, which depend on simulation and backpropagation through approximate SDE solutions, which limit scalability. In this work, we propose SDE Matching, a new simulation-free method for training Latent SDEs. Inspired by modern Score- and Flow Matching algorithms for learning generative dynamics, we extend these ideas to the domain of stochastic dynamics for time series and sequence modeling, eliminating the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that SDE Matching achieves performance comparable to adjoint sensitivity methods while drastically reducing computational complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the concentration of uniform generalization errors around their expectation in binary linear classification problems via an isoperimetric argument. In particular, we establish Poincar\'{e} and log-Sobolev inequalities for the joint distribution of the output labels and the label-weighted input vectors, which we apply to derive concentration bounds. The derived concentration bounds are sharp up to moderate multiplicative constants by those under well-balanced labels. In asymptotic analysis, we also show that almost sure convergence of uniform generalization errors to their expectation occurs in very broad settings, such as proportionally high-dimensional regimes. Using this convergence, we establish uniform laws of large numbers under dimension-free conditions.</description>

Abstract: When studying ecosystems, hierarchical trees are often used to organize entities based on proximity criteria, such as the taxonomy in microbiology, social classes in geography, or product types in retail businesses, offering valuable insights into entity relationships. Despite their significance, current count-data models do not leverage this structured information. In particular, the widely used Poisson log-normal (PLN) model, known for its ability to model interactions between entities from count data, lacks the possibility to incorporate such hierarchical tree structures, limiting its applicability in domains characterized by such complexities. To address this matter, we introduce the PLN-Tree model as an extension of the PLN model, specifically designed for modeling hierarchical count data. By integrating structured variational inference techniques, we propose an adapted training procedure and establish identifiability results, enhancing both theoretical foundations and practical interpretability. Experiments on synthetic datasets and human gut microbiome data highlight generative improvements when using PLN-Tree, demonstrating the practical interest of knowledge graphs like the taxonomy in microbiome modeling. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept implication of the identifiability results by illustrating the practical benefits of using identifiable features for classification tasks, showcasing the versatility of the framework.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12335v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this through a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations, along with a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.</description>

      <title>HyperINF: Unleashing the HyperPower of the Schulz's Method for Data Influence Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Influence functions provide a principled method to assess the contribution of individual training samples to a specific target. Yet, their high computational costs limit their applications on large-scale models and datasets. Existing methods proposed for influence function approximation have significantly reduced the computational overheads. However, they mostly suffer from inaccurate estimation due to the lack of strong convergence guarantees from the algorithm. The family of hyperpower methods are well-known for their rigorous convergence guarantees on matrix inverse approximation, while the matrix multiplication operation can involve intractable memory and computation costs on large-scale models. We propose HyperINF, an efficient and accurate influence function approximation method which leverages the hyperpower method, specifically Schulz's iterative algorithm. To deal with the computation-intensive matrix multiplication, we incorporate the generalized fisher information (GFIM) as a low-rank approximation of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the memory and computation overheads to constant costs independent of ranks on LoRA-tuned models. We first demonstrate the superior accuracy and stability of HyperINF compared to other baselines through a synthetic convergence simulation for matrix inversion. We further validate the efficacy of HyperINF through extensive real-world data attribution tasks, including mislabeled data detection and data selection for LLM and VLM fine-tuning. On LoRA-tuned models, HyperINF achieves superior downstream performance with minimal memory and computational overhead, while other baselines suffer from significant degradation. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/Blackzxy/HyperINF.</description>

      <title>New Bounds for Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse variational Gaussian processes (GPs) construct tractable posterior approximations to GP models. At the core of these methods is the assumption that the true posterior distribution over training function values ${\bf f}$ and inducing variables ${\bf u}$ is approximated by a variational distribution that incorporates the conditional GP prior $p({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ in its factorization. While this assumption is considered as fundamental, we show that for model training we can relax it through the use of a more general variational distribution $q({\bf f} | {\bf u})$ that depends on $N$ extra parameters, where $N$ is the number of training examples. In GP regression, we can analytically optimize the evidence lower bound over the extra parameters and express a tractable collapsed bound that is tighter than the previous bound. The new bound is also amenable to stochastic optimization and its implementation requires minor modifications to existing sparse GP code. Further, we also describe extensions to non-Gaussian likelihoods. On several datasets we demonstrate that our method can reduce bias when learning the hyperparameters and can lead to better predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Constrained Online Learning with Delays: Scheduling Frameworks and Regret Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study online learning with oblivious losses and delays under a novel ``capacity constraint'' that limits how many past rounds can be tracked simultaneously for delayed feedback. Under ``clairvoyance'' (i.e., delay durations are revealed upfront each round) and/or ``preemptibility'' (i.e., we can stop tracking previously chosen round feedback), we establish matching upper and lower bounds (up to logarithmic terms) on achievable regret, characterizing the ``optimal capacity'' needed to match the minimax rates of classical delayed online learning, which implicitly assume unlimited capacity. Our algorithms achieve minimax-optimal regret across all capacity levels, with performance gracefully degrading under suboptimal capacity. For $K$ actions and total delay $D$ over $T$ rounds, under clairvoyance and assuming capacity $C = \Omega(\log(T))$, we achieve regret $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{TK + DK/C + D\log(K)})$ for bandits and $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{(D+T)\log(K)})$ for full-information feedback. When replacing clairvoyance with preemptibility, we require a known maximum delay bound $d_{\max}$, adding ${\widetilde{O}(d_{\max})}$ to the regret. For fixed delays $d$ (i.e., $D=Td$), the minimax regret is $\Theta(\sqrt{TK(1+d/C)+Td\log(K)})$ and the optimal capacity is $\Theta(\min\{K/\log(K),d\})$ in the bandit setting, while in the full-information feedback setting, the minimax regret is $\Theta(\sqrt{T(d+1)\log(K)})$ and the optimal capacity is $\Theta(1)$. For round-dependent and fixed delays, our upper bounds are achieved using novel preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling policies, based on Pareto-distributed proxy delays, and batching techniques, respectively. Crucially, our work unifies delayed bandits, label-efficient learning, and online scheduling frameworks, demonstrating that robust online learning under delayed feedback is possible with surprisingly modest tracking capacity.</description>

      <title>Energy Matching: Unifying Flow Matching and Energy-Based Models for Generative Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10612v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most widely used generative models map noise and data distributions by matching flows or scores. However, they struggle to incorporate partial observations and additional priors--something energy-based models (EBMs) handle elegantly by simply adding corresponding scalar energy terms. We address this issue by proposing Energy Matching, a framework that endows flow-based approaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far from the data manifold, samples move along curl-free, optimal transport paths from noise to data. As they approach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize this dynamic with a single time-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a flexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. Our method substantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in terms of fidelity, while retaining simulation-free training of transport-based approaches away from the data manifold. Furthermore, we leverage the method's flexibility to introduce an interaction energy that supports diverse mode exploration, which we demonstrate in a controlled protein-generation setting. Our approach focuses on learning a scalar potential energy--without time-conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks--which marks a significant departure from recent EBM methods. We believe that this simplified framework significantly advances EBMs capabilities and paves the way for their wider adoption in generative modeling across diverse domains.</description>

Abstract: This tutorial provides a concise introduction to modern causal modeling by integrating potential outcomes and graphical methods. We motivate causal questions such as counterfactual reasoning under interventions and define binary treatments and potential outcomes. We discuss causal effect measures-including average treatment effects on the treated and on the untreated-and choices of effect scales for binary outcomes. We derive identification in randomized experiments under exchangeability and consistency, and extend to stratification and blocking designs. We present inverse probability weighting with propensity score estimation and robust inference via sandwich estimators. Finally, we introduce causal graphs, d-separation, the backdoor criterion, single-world intervention graphs, and structural equation models, showing how graphical and potential-outcome approaches complement each other. Emphasis is placed on clear notation, intuitive explanations, and practical examples for applied researchers.</description>

Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically, present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards addressing this challenge.</description>
