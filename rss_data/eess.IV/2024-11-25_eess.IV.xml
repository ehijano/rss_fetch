      <title>SegBook: A Simple Baseline and Cookbook for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most popular modalities for medical imaging. By far, CT images have contributed to the largest publicly available datasets for volumetric medical segmentation tasks, covering full-body anatomical structures. Large amounts of full-body CT images provide the opportunity to pre-train powerful models, e.g., STU-Net pre-trained in a supervised fashion, to segment numerous anatomical structures. However, it remains unclear in which conditions these pre-trained models can be transferred to various downstream medical segmentation tasks, particularly segmenting the other modalities and diverse targets. To address this problem, a large-scale benchmark for comprehensive evaluation is crucial for finding these conditions. Thus, we collected 87 public datasets varying in modality, target, and sample size to evaluate the transfer ability of full-body CT pre-trained models. We then employed a representative model, STU-Net with multiple model scales, to conduct transfer learning across modalities and targets. Our experimental results show that (1) there may be a bottleneck effect concerning the dataset size in fine-tuning, with more improvement on both small- and large-scale datasets than medium-size ones. (2) Models pre-trained on full-body CT demonstrate effective modality transfer, adapting well to other modalities such as MRI. (3) Pre-training on the full-body CT not only supports strong performance in structure detection but also shows efficacy in lesion detection, showcasing adaptability across target tasks. We hope that this large-scale open evaluation of transfer learning can direct future research in volumetric medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Hidden: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Underwater Image Enhancement and Its Impact on Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater imagery often suffers from severe degradation that results in low visual quality and object detection performance. This work aims to evaluate state-of-the-art image enhancement models, investigate their impact on underwater object detection, and explore their potential to improve detection performance. To this end, we selected representative underwater image enhancement models covering major enhancement categories and applied them separately to two recent datasets: 1) the Real-World Underwater Object Detection Dataset (RUOD), and 2) the Challenging Underwater Plant Detection Dataset (CUPDD). Following this, we conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses on the enhanced images and developed a quality index (Q-index) to compare the quality distribution of the original and enhanced images. Subsequently, we compared the performance of several YOLO-NAS detection models that are separately trained and tested on the original and enhanced image sets. Then, we performed a correlation study to examine the relationship between enhancement metrics and detection performance. We also analyzed the inference results from the trained detectors presenting cases where enhancement increased the detection performance as well as cases where enhancement revealed missed objects by human annotators. This study suggests that although enhancement generally deteriorates the detection performance, it can still be harnessed in some cases for increased detection performance and more accurate human annotation.</description>

      <title>BrightVAE: Luminosity Enhancement in Underexposed Endoscopic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhancement of image luminosity is especially critical in endoscopic images. Underexposed endoscopic images often suffer from reduced contrast and uneven brightness, significantly impacting diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Internal body imaging is challenging due to uneven lighting and shadowy regions. Enhancing such images is essential since precise image interpretation is crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we introduce BrightVAE, an architecture based on the hierarchical Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (hierarchical VQ-VAE) tailored explicitly for enhancing luminosity in low-light endoscopic images. Our architecture is meticulously designed to tackle the unique challenges inherent in endoscopic imaging, such as significant variations in illumination and obscured details due to poor lighting conditions. The proposed model emphasizes advanced feature extraction from three distinct viewpoints-incorporating various receptive fields, skip connections, and feature attentions to robustly enhance image quality and support more accurate medical diagnoses. Through rigorous experimental analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing low-light endoscopic images. To evaluate the performance of our architecture, we employ three widely recognized metrics-SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS-specifically on Endo4IE dataset, which consists of endoscopic images. We evaluated our method using the Endo4IE dataset, which consists exclusively of endoscopic images, and showed significant advancements over the state-of-the-art methods for enhancing luminosity in endoscopic imaging.</description>

      <title>Cross Group Attention and Group-wise Rolling for Multimodal Medical Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal MR image synthesis aims to generate missing modality image by fusing and mapping a few available MRI data. Most existing approaches typically adopt an image-to-image translation scheme. However, these methods often suffer from sub-optimal performance due to the spatial misalignment between different modalities while they are typically treated as input channels. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Group-wise Interaction Network (AGI-Net) that explores both inter-modality and intra-modality relationships for multimodal MR image synthesis. Specifically, groups are first pre-defined along the channel dimension and then we perform an adaptive rolling for the standard convolutional kernel to capture inter-modality spatial correspondences. At the same time, a cross-group attention module is introduced to fuse information across different channel groups, leading to better feature representation. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model on the publicly available IXI and BraTS2023 datasets, where the AGI-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance for multimodal MR image synthesis. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of nnUNet and MedNeXt for Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation in MRI-guided Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation therapy (RT) is essential in treating head and neck cancer (HNC), with magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)-guided RT offering superior soft tissue contrast and functional imaging. However, manual tumor segmentation is time-consuming and complex, and therfore remains a challenge. In this study, we present our solution as team TUMOR to the HNTS-MRG24 MICCAI Challenge which is focused on automated segmentation of primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and metastatic lymph node gross tumor volume (GTVn) in pre-RT and mid-RT MRI images. We utilized the HNTS-MRG2024 dataset, which consists of 150 MRI scans from patients diagnosed with HNC, including original and registered pre-RT and mid-RT T2-weighted images with corresponding segmentation masks for GTVp and GTVn. We employed two state-of-the-art models in deep learning, nnUNet and MedNeXt. For Task 1, we pretrained models on pre-RT registered and mid-RT images, followed by fine-tuning on original pre-RT images. For Task 2, we combined registered pre-RT images, registered pre-RT segmentation masks, and mid-RT data as a multi-channel input for training. Our solution for Task 1 achieved 1st place in the final test phase with an aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.8254, and our solution for Task 2 ranked 8th with a score of 0.7005. The proposed solution is publicly available at Github Repository.</description>

      <title>Cell as Point: One-Stage Framework for Efficient Cell Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular activities are dynamic and intricate, playing a crucial role in advancing diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, yet they often require substantial resources for accurate tracking. Despite recent progress, the conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches not only heavily rely on detection or segmentation results as a prerequisite for the tracking stage, demanding plenty of refined segmentation masks, but are also deteriorated by imbalanced and long sequence data, leading to under-learning in training and missing cells in inference procedures. To alleviate the above issues, this paper proposes the novel end-to-end CAP framework, which leverages the idea of regarding Cell as Point to achieve efficient and stable cell tracking in one stage. CAP abandons detection or segmentation stages and simplifies the process by exploiting the correlation among the trajectories of cell points to track cells jointly, thus reducing the label demand and complexity of the pipeline. With cell point trajectory and visibility to represent cell locations and lineage relationships, CAP leverages the key innovations of adaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling for addressing data imbalance in cell division events and the rolling-as-window (RAW) inference method to ensure continuous tracking of new cells in the long term. Eliminating the need for a prerequisite detection or segmentation stage, CAP demonstrates strong cell tracking performance while also being 10 to 55 times more efficient than existing methods. The code and models will be released.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Robustness of Optical Flow Estimation to Corruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical flow estimation is extensively used in autonomous driving and video editing. While existing models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, the robustness of these methods has been infrequently investigated. Despite some research focusing on the robustness of optical flow models against adversarial attacks, there has been a lack of studies investigating their robustness to common corruptions. Taking into account the unique temporal characteristics of optical flow, we introduce 7 temporal corruptions specifically designed for benchmarking the robustness of optical flow models, in addition to 17 classical single-image corruptions, in which advanced PSF Blur simulation method is performed. Two robustness benchmarks, KITTI-FC and GoPro-FC, are subsequently established as the first corruption robustness benchmark for optical flow estimation, with Out-Of-Domain (OOD) and In-Domain (ID) settings to facilitate comprehensive studies. Robustness metrics, Corruption Robustness Error (CRE), Corruption Robustness Error ratio (CREr), and Relative Corruption Robustness Error (RCRE) are further introduced to quantify the optical flow estimation robustness. 29 model variants from 15 optical flow methods are evaluated, yielding 10 intriguing observations, such as 1) the absolute robustness of the model is heavily dependent on the estimation performance; 2) the corruptions that diminish local information are more serious than that reduce visual effects. We also give suggestions for the design and application of optical flow models. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as a foundational resource for advancing research in robust optical flow estimation. The benchmarks and source code will be released at https://github.com/ZhonghuaYi/optical_flow_robustness_benchmark.</description>

      <title>Exploring Foundation Models Fine-Tuning for Cytology Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cytology slides are essential tools in diagnosing and staging cancer, but their analysis is time-consuming and costly. Foundation models have shown great potential to assist in these tasks. In this paper, we explore how existing foundation models can be applied to cytological classification. More particularly, we focus on low-rank adaptation, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method suited to few-shot learning. We evaluated five foundation models across four cytological classification datasets. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning the pre-trained backbones with LoRA significantly improves model performance compared to fine-tuning only the classifier head, achieving state-of-the-art results on both simple and complex classification tasks while requiring fewer data samples.</description>

      <title>Detecting Hallucinations in Virtual Histology with Neural Precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant biomedical research and clinical care rely on the histopathologic examination of tissue structure using microscopy of stained tissue. Virtual staining (VS) offers a promising alternative with the potential to reduce cost and eliminate the use of toxic reagents. However, the critical challenge of hallucinations limits confidence in its use, necessitating a VS co-pilot to detect these hallucinations. Here, we first formally establish the problem of hallucination detection in VS. Next, we introduce a scalable, post-hoc hallucination detection method that identifies a Neural Hallucination Precursor (NHP) from VS model embeddings for test-time detection. We report extensive validation across diverse and challenging VS settings to demonstrate NHP's effectiveness and robustness. Furthermore, we show that VS models with fewer hallucinations do not necessarily disclose them better, risking a false sense of security when reporting just the former metric. This highlights the need for a reassessment of current VS evaluation practices.</description>

      <title>RankByGene: Gene-Guided Histopathology Representation Learning Through Cross-Modal Ranking Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides essential spatial context by mapping gene expression within tissue, enabling detailed study of cellular heterogeneity and tissue organization. However, aligning ST data with histology images poses challenges due to inherent spatial distortions and modality-specific variations. Existing methods largely rely on direct alignment, which often fails to capture complex cross-modal relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that aligns gene and image features using a ranking-based alignment loss, preserving relative similarity across modalities and enabling robust multi-scale alignment. To further enhance the alignment's stability, we employ self-supervised knowledge distillation with a teacher-student network architecture, effectively mitigating disruptions from high dimensionality, sparsity, and noise in gene expression data. Extensive experiments on gene expression prediction and survival analysis demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, showing improved alignment and predictive performance over existing methods and establishing a robust tool for gene-guided image representation learning in digital pathology.</description>

      <title>Leapfrog Latent Consistency Model (LLCM) for Medical Images Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of accessible medical image data poses a significant obstacle in effectively training deep learning models for medical diagnosis, as hospitals refrain from sharing their data due to privacy concerns. In response, we gathered a diverse dataset named MedImgs, which comprises over 250,127 images spanning 61 disease types and 159 classes of both humans and animals from open-source repositories. We propose a Leapfrog Latent Consistency Model (LLCM) that is distilled from a retrained diffusion model based on the collected MedImgs dataset, which enables our model to generate real-time high-resolution images. We formulate the reverse diffusion process as a probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) and solve it in latent space using the Leapfrog algorithm. This formulation enables rapid sampling without necessitating additional iterations. Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in generating medical images. Furthermore, our model can be fine-tuned with any custom medical image datasets, facilitating the generation of a vast array of images. Our experimental results outperform those of existing models on unseen dog cardiac X-ray images. Source code is available at https://github.com/lskdsjy/LeapfrogLCM.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced unsupervised image segmentation for medical images analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide, necessitating the meticulous examination of mammograms by radiologists to characterize abnormal lesions. This manual process demands high accuracy and is often time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. Automated image segmentation using artificial intelligence offers a promising alternative to streamline this workflow. However, most existing methods are supervised, requiring large, expertly annotated datasets that are not always available, and they experience significant generalization issues. Thus, unsupervised learning models can be leveraged for image segmentation, but they come at a cost of reduced accuracy, or require extensive computational resourcess. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end quantum-enhanced framework for unsupervised mammography medical images segmentation that balances between performance accuracy and computational requirements. We first introduce a quantum-inspired image representation that serves as an initial approximation of the segmentation mask. The segmentation task is then formulated as a QUBO problem, aiming to maximize the contrast between the background and the tumor region while ensuring a cohesive segmentation mask with minimal connected components. We conduct an extensive evaluation of quantum and quantum-inspired methods for image segmentation, demonstrating that quantum annealing and variational quantum circuits achieve performance comparable to classical optimization techniques. Notably, quantum annealing is shown to be an order of magnitude faster than the classical optimization method in our experiments. Our findings demonstrate that this framework achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods, including UNet-based architectures, offering a viable unsupervised alternative for breast cancer image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Insect Monitoring: Ultra-Lightweight CNNs as On-Device Triggers for Insect Camera Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camera traps, combined with AI, have emerged as a way to achieve automated, scalable biodiversity monitoring. However, the passive infrared (PIR) sensors that trigger camera traps are poorly suited for detecting small, fast-moving ectotherms such as insects. Insects comprise over half of all animal species and are key components of ecosystems and agriculture. The need for an appropriate and scalable insect camera trap is critical in the wake of concerning reports of declines in insect populations. This study proposes an alternative to the PIR trigger: ultra-lightweight convolutional neural networks running on low-powered hardware to detect insects in a continuous stream of captured images. We train a suite of models to distinguish insect images from backgrounds. Our design achieves zero latency between trigger and image capture. Our models are rigorously tested and achieve high accuracy ranging from 91.8% to 96.4% AUC on validation data and &gt;87% AUC on data from distributions unseen during training. The high specificity of our models ensures minimal saving of false positive images, maximising deployment storage efficiency. High recall scores indicate a minimal false negative rate, maximising insect detection. Further analysis with saliency maps shows the learned representation of our models to be robust, with low reliance on spurious background features. Our system is also shown to operate deployed on off-the-shelf, low-powered microcontroller units, consuming a maximum power draw of less than 300mW. This enables longer deployment times using cheap and readily available battery components. Overall we offer a step change in the cost, efficiency and scope of insect monitoring. Solving the challenging trigger problem, we demonstrate a system which can be deployed for far longer than existing designs and budgets power and bandwidth effectively, moving towards a generic insect camera trap.</description>

      <title>U-Motion: Learned Point Cloud Video Compression with U-Structured Motion Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point cloud video (PCV) is a versatile 3D representation of dynamic scenes with many emerging applications. This paper introduces U-Motion, a learning-based compression scheme for both PCV geometry and attributes. We propose a U-Structured multiscale inter-frame prediction framework, U-Inter, which performs layer-wise explicit motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC) at different scales with varying levels of detail. It integrates both higher and lower-scale motion features, in addition to the information of current and previous frames, to enable accurate motion estimation at the current scale. In addition, we design a cascaded spatial predictive coding module to capture the inter-scale spatial redundancy remaining after U-Inter prediction. We further propose an effective context detach and restore scheme to reduce spatial-temporal redundancy in the motion and latent bit-streams and improve compression performance. We conduct experiments following the MPEG Common Test Condition and demonstrate that U-Motion can achieve significant gains over MPEG G-PCC-GesTM v3.0 and recently published learning-based methods for both geometry and attribute compression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal magnetic field variations from B0-inhomogeneity and diffusion-encoding-induced eddy-currents can be detrimental to rapid image-encoding schemes such as spiral, EPI and 3D-cones, resulting in undesirable image artifacts. In this work, a data driven approach for automatic estimation of these field imperfections is developed by combining autofocus metrics with deep learning, and by leveraging a compact basis representation of the expected field imperfections. The method was applied to single-shot spiral diffusion MRI at high b-values where accurate estimation of B0 and eddy were obtained, resulting in high quality image reconstruction without need for additional external calibrations.</description>

      <title>FLARE: FP-Less PTQ and Low-ENOB ADC Based AMS-PiM for Error-Resilient, Fast, and Efficient Transformer Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoder-based transformers, powered by self-attention layers, have revolutionized machine learning with their context-aware representations. However, their quadratic growth in computational and memory demands presents significant bottlenecks. Analog-Mixed-Signal Process-in-Memory (AMS-PiM) architectures address these challenges by enabling efficient on-chip processing. Traditionally, AMS-PiM relies on Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), which is hardware-efficient but requires extensive retraining to adapt models to AMS-PiMs, making it increasingly impractical for transformer models. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) mitigates this training overhead but introduces significant hardware inefficiencies. PTQ relies on dequantization-quantization (DQ-Q) processes, floating-point units (FPUs), and high-ENOB (Effective Number of Bits) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Particularly, High-ENOB ADCs scale exponentially in area and energy ($2^{ENOB}$), reduce sensing margins, and increase susceptibility to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, further compounding PTQ's challenges in AMS-PiM systems. To overcome these limitations, we propose RAP, an AMS-PiM architecture that eliminates DQ-Q processes, introduces FPU- and division-free nonlinear processing, and employs a low-ENOB-ADC-based sparse Matrix Vector multiplication technique. Using the proposed techniques, RAP improves error resiliency, area/energy efficiency, and computational speed while preserving numerical stability. Experimental results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art GPUs and conventional PiM architectures in energy efficiency, latency, and accuracy, making it a scalable solution for the efficient deployment of transformers.</description>

      <title>Facial Features Matter: a Dynamic Watermark based Proactive Deepfake Detection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current passive deepfake face-swapping detection methods encounter significance bottlenecks in model generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, proactive detection methods often use fixed watermarks which lack a close relationship with the content they protect and are vulnerable to security risks. Dynamic watermarks based on facial features offer a promising solution, as these features provide unique identifiers. Therefore, this paper proposes a Facial Feature-based Proactive deepfake detection method (FaceProtect), which utilizes changes in facial characteristics during deepfake manipulation as a novel detection mechanism. We introduce a GAN-based One-way Dynamic Watermark Generating Mechanism (GODWGM) that uses 128-dimensional facial feature vectors as inputs. This method creates irreversible mappings from facial features to watermarks, enhancing protection against various reverse inference attacks. Additionally, we propose a Watermark-based Verification Strategy (WVS) that combines steganography with GODWGM, allowing simultaneous transmission of the benchmark watermark representing facial features within the image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method maintains exceptional detection performance and exhibits high practicality on images altered by various deepfake techniques.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Multi-view UAV Image Geo-localization via Iterative Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) presents significant challenges due to the view discrepancy between oblique UAV images and overhead satellite images. Existing methods heavily rely on the supervision of labeled datasets to extract viewpoint-invariant features for cross-view retrieval. However, these methods have expensive training costs and tend to overfit the region-specific cues, showing limited generalizability to new regions. To overcome this issue, we propose an unsupervised solution that lifts the scene representation to 3d space from UAV observations for satellite image generation, providing robust representation against view distortion. By generating orthogonal images that closely resemble satellite views, our method reduces view discrepancies in feature representation and mitigates shortcuts in region-specific image pairing. To further align the rendered image's perspective with the real one, we design an iterative camera pose updating mechanism that progressively modulates the rendered query image with potential satellite targets, eliminating spatial offsets relative to the reference images. Additionally, this iterative refinement strategy enhances cross-view feature invariance through view-consistent fusion across iterations. As such, our unsupervised paradigm naturally avoids the problem of region-specific overfitting, enabling generic CVGL for UAV images without feature fine-tuning or data-driven training. Experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves geo-localization accuracy while maintaining robustness across diverse regions. Notably, without model fine-tuning or paired training, our method achieves competitive performance with recent supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Physically Interpretable Probabilistic Domain Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing domains is essential for models analyzing dynamic environments, as it allows them to adapt to evolving conditions or to hand the task over to backup systems when facing conditions outside their operational domain. Existing solutions typically characterize a domain by solving a regression or classification problem, which limits their applicability as they only provide a limited summarized description of the domain. In this paper, we present a novel approach to domain characterization by characterizing domains as probability distributions. Particularly, we develop a method to predict the likelihood of different weather conditions from images captured by vehicle-mounted cameras by estimating distributions of physical parameters using normalizing flows. To validate our proposed approach, we conduct experiments within the context of autonomous vehicles, focusing on predicting the distribution of weather parameters to characterize the operational domain. This domain is characterized by physical parameters (absolute characterization) and arbitrarily predefined domains (relative characterization). Finally, we evaluate whether a system can safely operate in a target domain by comparing it to multiple source domains where safety has already been established. This approach holds significant potential, as accurate weather prediction and effective domain adaptation are crucial for autonomous systems to adjust to dynamic environmental conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust medical Machine Learning (ML) models have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by accelerating clinical research, improving workflows and outcomes, and producing novel insights or capabilities. Developing such ML models from scratch is cost prohibitive and requires substantial compute, data, and time (e.g., expert labeling). To address these challenges, we introduce Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF), a suite of pre-trained, domain-specific foundation models, tools, and recipes to accelerate building ML for health applications. The models cover various modalities and domains, including radiology (X-rays and computed tomography), histopathology, dermatological imaging, and audio. These models provide domain specific embeddings that facilitate AI development with less labeled data, shorter training times, and reduced computational costs compared to traditional approaches. In addition, we utilize a common interface and style across these models, and prioritize usability to enable developers to integrate HAI-DEF efficiently. We present model evaluations across various tasks and conclude with a discussion of their application and evaluation, covering the importance of ensuring efficacy, fairness, and equity. Finally, while HAI-DEF and specifically the foundation models lower the barrier to entry for ML in healthcare, we emphasize the importance of validation with problem- and population-specific data for each desired usage setting. This technical report will be updated over time as more modalities and features are added.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently emerging conditional diffusion models seem promising for mitigating the labor and expenses in building large 3D medical imaging datasets. However, previous studies on 3D CT generation have yet to fully capitalize on semantic and textual conditions, and they have primarily focused on specific organs characterized by a local structure and fixed contrast. In this work, we present GuideGen, a controllable framework that generates anatomical masks and corresponding CT volumes for the entire torso-from chest to pelvis-based on free-form text prompts. Our approach includes three core components: a text-conditional semantic synthesizer for creating realistic full-torso anatomies; a contrast-aware autoencoder for detailed, high-fidelity feature extraction across varying contrast levels; and a latent feature generator that ensures alignment between CT images, anatomical semantics and input prompts. To train and evaluate GuideGen, we compile a multi-modality cancer imaging dataset with paired CT and clinical descriptions from 12 public TCIA datasets and one private real-world dataset. Comprehensive evaluations across generation quality, cross-modality alignment, and data usability on multi-organ and tumor segmentation tasks demonstrate GuideGen's superiority over existing CT generation methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for learned synergistic reconstruction of medical images using multi-branch generative models. Leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs), our model learns from pairs of images simultaneously, enabling effective denoising and reconstruction. Synergistic image reconstruction is achieved by incorporating the trained models in a regularizer that evaluates the distance between the images and the model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on both Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) datasets, showcasing improved image quality for low-dose imaging. Despite challenges such as patch decomposition and model limitations, our results underscore the potential of generative models for enhancing medical imaging reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13548v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we describe our approach to compete in the autoPET3 datacentric track. While conventional wisdom suggests that larger datasets lead to better model performance, recent studies indicate that excluding certain training samples can enhance model accuracy. We find that in the autoPETIII dataset, a model that is trained on the entire dataset exhibits undesirable characteristics by producing a large number of false positives particularly for PSMA-PETs. We counteract this by removing the easiest samples from the training dataset as measured by the model loss before retraining from scratch. Using the proposed approach we manage to drive down the false negative volume and improve upon the baseline model in both false negative volume and dice score on the preliminary test set. Code and pre-trained models are available at github.com/alexanderjaus/autopet3_datadiet.</description>

      <title>Sketched Equivariant Imaging Regularization and Deep Internal Learning for Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We then extend our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework -- Sketched Equivariant Deep Image Prior (Sk-EI-DIP), which can be efficiently applied for single-image and task-adapted reconstruction. Additionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient approach for accelerating both EI-DIP and Sk-EI-DIP via optimizing only the normalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve order-of-magnitude computational acceleration over standard EI-based counterpart in single-input setting, and network adaptation at test time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models are trained on massive amounts of data to distinguish complex patterns and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks with minimal computational resources. Here, we develop a foundation model for prostate cancer digital pathology called HistoEncoder by pre-training on 48 million prostate tissue tile images. We demonstrate that HistoEncoder features extracted from tile images with similar histological patterns map closely together in the feature space. HistoEncoder outperforms models pre-trained with natural images, even without fine-tuning or with 1000 times less training data. We describe two use cases that leverage the capabilities of HistoEncoder by fine-tuning the model with a limited amount of data and computational resources. First, we show how HistoEncoder can be used to automatically annotate large-scale datasets with high accuracy. Second, we combine histomics with commonly used clinical nomograms, significantly improving prostate cancer-specific death survival models. Foundation models such as HistoEncoder can allow organizations with limited resources to build effective clinical software tools without needing extensive datasets or significant amounts of computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and results in detrimental structural changes in human brains. Detecting these changes is crucial for early diagnosis and timely intervention of disease progression. Jacobian maps, derived from spatial normalization in voxel-based morphometry (VBM), have been instrumental in interpreting volume alterations associated with AD. However, the computational cost of generating Jacobian maps limits its clinical adoption. In this study, we explore alternative methods and propose Sobel kernel angle difference (SKAD) as a computationally efficient alternative. SKAD is a derivative operation that offers an optimized approach to quantifying volumetric alterations through localized analysis of the gradients. By efficiently extracting gradient amplitude changes at critical spatial regions, this derivative operation captures regional volume variations Evaluation of SKAD over various medical datasets demonstrates that it is 6.3x faster than Jacobian maps while still maintaining comparable accuracy. This makes it an efficient and competitive approach in neuroimaging research and clinical practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned underwater image analysis for marine monitoring faces two key challenges: (i) degraded image quality due to light attenuation and (ii) hardware storage constraints limiting high-resolution image collection. Existing methods primarily address image enhancement with approaches that hinge on storing the full-size input. In contrast, we introduce the Capsule Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder (CE-VAE), a novel architecture designed to efficiently compress and enhance degraded underwater images. Our attention-aware image encoder can project the input image onto a latent space representation while being able to run online on a remote device. The only information that needs to be stored on the device or sent to a beacon is a compressed representation. There is a dual-decoder module that performs offline, full-size enhanced image generation. One branch reconstructs spatial details from the compressed latent space, while the second branch utilizes a capsule-clustering layer to capture entity-level structures and complex spatial relationships. This parallel decoding strategy enables the model to balance fine-detail preservation with context-aware enhancements. CE-VAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image enhancement on six benchmark datasets, providing up to 3x higher compression efficiency than existing approaches.

      <title>Cinematic Gaussians: Real-Time HDR Radiance Fields with Depth of Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07329v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiance field methods represent the state of the art in reconstructing complex scenes from multi-view photos. However, these reconstructions often suffer from one or both of the following limitations: First, they typically represent scenes in low dynamic range (LDR), which restricts their use to evenly lit environments and hinders immersive viewing experiences. Secondly, their reliance on a pinhole camera model, assuming all scene elements are in focus in the input images, presents practical challenges and complicates refocusing during novel-view synthesis. Addressing these limitations, we present a lightweight method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes multi-view LDR images of a scene with varying exposure times, apertures, and focus distances as input to reconstruct a high-dynamic-range (HDR) radiance field. By incorporating analytical convolutions of Gaussians based on a thin-lens camera model as well as a tonemapping module, our reconstructions enable the rendering of HDR content with flexible refocusing capabilities. We demonstrate that our combined treatment of HDR and depth of field facilitates real-time cinematic rendering, outperforming the state of the art.</description>

      <title>WaveMamba: Spatial-Spectral Wavelet Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) has proven to be a powerful tool for capturing detailed spectral and spatial information across diverse applications. Despite the advancements in Deep Learning (DL) and Transformer architectures for HSI classification, challenges such as computational efficiency and the need for extensive labeled data persist. This paper introduces WaveMamba, a novel approach that integrates wavelet transformation with the spatial-spectral Mamba architecture to enhance HSI classification. WaveMamba captures both local texture patterns and global contextual relationships in an end-to-end trainable model. The Wavelet-based enhanced features are then processed through the state-space architecture to model spatial-spectral relationships and temporal dependencies. The experimental results indicate that WaveMamba surpasses existing models, achieving an accuracy improvement of 4.5\% on the University of Houston dataset and a 2.0\% increase on the Pavia University dataset.</description>

      <title>Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24060v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Lossless Image Compression: Next-Pixel Prediction in Language Space is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have recently witnessed that ``Intelligence" and `` Compression" are the two sides of the same coin, where the language large model (LLM) with unprecedented intelligence is a general-purpose lossless compressor for various data modalities. This attribute particularly appeals to the lossless image compression community, given the increasing need to compress high-resolution images in the current streaming media era. Consequently, a spontaneous envision emerges: Can the compression performance of the LLM elevate lossless image compression to new heights? However, our findings indicate that the naive application of LLM-based lossless image compressors suffers from a considerable performance gap compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) codecs on common benchmark datasets. In light of this, we are dedicated to fulfilling the unprecedented intelligence (compression) capacity of the LLM for lossless image compression tasks, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical and practical compression performance. Specifically, we propose P$^{2}$-LLM, a next-pixel prediction-based LLM, which integrates various elaborated insights and methodologies, \textit{e.g.,} pixel-level priors, the in-context ability of LLM, and a pixel-level semantic preservation strategy, to enhance the understanding capacity of pixel sequences for better next-pixel predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that P$^{2}$-LLM can beat SOTA classical and learned codecs.</description>
