      <title>Motif analysis and passing behavior in football passing networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strategic orchestration of football matchplays profoundly influences game outcomes, motivating a surge in research aimed at uncovering tactical nuances through social network analysis. In this paper, we delve into the microscopic intricacies of cooperative player interactions by focusing on triadic motifs within passing networks. Employing a dataset compiled from 3,199 matches across 18 premier football competitions, we identify successful passing activities and construct passing networks for both home and away teams. Our findings highlight a pronounced disparity in passing efficiency, with home teams demonstrating superior performance relative to away teams. Through the identification and analysis of 3-motifs, we find that the motifs with more bidirectional links are more significant. It reveals that footballers exhibit a strong tendency towards backward passes rather than direct forward attacks. Comparing the results of games, we find that some motifs are related to the goal difference. It indicates that direct and effective forward passing significantly amplifies a team's offensive capabilities, whereas an abundance of passbacks portends an elevated risk of offensive futility. These revelations affirm the efficacy of network motif analysis as a potent analytical tool for unveiling the foundational components of passing dynamics among footballers and for decoding the complex tactical behaviors and interaction modalities that underpin team performance.</description>

      <title>Cluster Formations of Free and Congested Flows in Urban Road Networks</title>

Abstract: Understanding traffic behavior is crucial for enhancing the stable functioning and safety of transportation systems. Previous percolation-based transportation studies have analyzed transition behaviors from free-flow to traffic-jam states, with a focus on robustness and resilience during congestion. However, relatively less attention is paid to the percolation analysis of the free-flow states, specifically how free-flow clusters form and grow. In this study, we investigate the percolation patterns of two opposing traffic scenarios -- traffic jam state and free-flow state -- within the same road network using Chengdu taxi data and compare their percolating behaviors. Our analysis reveals differences between the two scenarios in the growth patterns of the giant connected component (GCC), which is captured by a persistent gap between the GCC size curves, particularly during peak hours. We attribute these disparities to a long-range spatial correlation of traffic speed within a road network. Empirically, we find distinct long-range spatial correlations in traffic, using rescaled taxi speeds on roads, and we examine their relationship with each percolation pattern. Our analysis provides an integrated view of traffic dynamics and uncovers intrinsic traffic correlations within urban areas that drive these intriguing percolation patterns. Our findings also offer valuable metrics for effective traffic management and accident prevention strategies, aligning with urban transportation safety and reliability goals. These insights are beneficial for assessing and designing resilient urban road networks that maintain functionality under stress, ultimately improving the reliability of traffic assessments and reducing accidents.</description>

      <title>Network analysis reveals news press landscape and asymmetric user polarization</title>

Abstract: Unlike traditional media, online news platforms allow users to consume content that suits their tastes and to facilitate interactions with other people. However, as more personalized consumption of information and interaction with like-minded users increase, ideological bias can inadvertently increase and contribute to the formation of echo chambers, reinforcing the polarization of opinions. Although the structural characteristics of polarization among different ideological groups in online spaces have been extensively studied, research into how these groups emotionally interact with each other has not been as thoroughly explored. From this perspective, we investigate both structural and affective polarization between news media user groups on Naver News, South Korea's largest online news portal, during the period of 2022 Korean presidential election. By utilizing the dataset comprising 333,014 articles and over 36 million user comments, we uncover two distinct groups of users characterized by opposing political leanings and reveal significant bias and polarization among them. Additionally, we reveal the existence of echo chambers within co-commenting networks and investigate the asymmetric affective interaction patterns between the two polarized groups. Classification task of news media articles based on the distinct comment response patterns support the notion that different political groups may employ distinct communication strategies. Our approach based on network analysis on large-scale comment dataset offers novel insights into characteristics of user polarization in the online news platforms and the nuanced interaction nature between user groups.</description>

      <title>Analysing pandemics in phase-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the SIRD-model a new model including time-delay is proposed for a description of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. All data were analysed by representing all quantities as a function of the susceptible population, as opposed to the usual dependence on time. The total number of deaths could be predicted for the first, second and third wave of the pandemic in Germany with an accuracy of about 10\%, shortly after the maximum of infectious people was reached. By using the presentation in phase space, it could be shown that a classical SEIRD- and SIRD-model with constant parameters will not be able to describe the first wave of the pandemic accurately.</description>
