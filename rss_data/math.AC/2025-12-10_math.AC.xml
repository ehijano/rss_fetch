      <title>The Smith form of Sylvester and B\'ezout matrices for zero-dimensional ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field and let $f,g \in \mathbb{K}[x,y]$ be such that the ideal $\ideal{f,g}$ is zero-dimensional. We study the Sylvester and B\'{e}zout resultant polynomial matrices, built by interpreting $f$ and $g$ as univariate polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{K}[y]$. We characterize their Smith forms over $\mathbb{K}[y]$ in terms of the dual spaces of differential operators, that were defined and studied by H. M. M\"{o}ller et al. In particular, we show that, if the leading coefficients of $f$ and $g$ are coprime over $\mathbb{K}[y]$, then the partial multiplicities of the Sylvester and B\'{e}zout resultant matrices coincide with certain integers, that we call M\"{o}ller indices. These indices are uniquely determined by $\ideal{f,g}$, and can be easily computed from a Gauss basis, as defined in [M. G. Marinari, H. M. M\"{o}ller, T. Mora, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 348(8):3283--3321, 1996], of the dual spaces. We then generalize this result to the case of common factors in the leading coefficients, which correspond to intersections at $x=\infty$, again describing all the invariant factors of Sylvester and B\'{e}zout resultant matrices. As a corollary, this fully characterizes the algebraic multiplicity of all the roots of the resultant $\Res_x(f,g) \in \mathbb{K}[y]$ in terms of the intersection multiplicities for $f$ and $g$, including those arising from infinite intersections. We discuss both algebraic and computational implications of our results.</description>

      <title>A Weaker Notion of Atomicity in Integral Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical factorization theory, an integral domain is called \emph{atomic} if every nonzero nonunit element can be written as a finite product of irreducible elements. Here, we introduce and study a weaker notion of atomicity, which relaxes the requirement that all elements admit a factorization into irreducibles. Namely, we say that an integral domain is \emph{completely atomic} if every nonunit divisor of an atomic element is also atomic. We further consider several factorization properties associated with this notion. Then, we investigate the basic properties of such domains, provide examples, and explore the behavior of the completely atomic property under standard constructions such as localization, polynomial rings, and $D+M$ constructions. Our results highlight the independence of the completely atomic property from other classical factorization properties and introduce an important class of integral domains that lies between atomic and non-atomic domains.</description>

      <title>Segre classes and integral dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental property of Segre classes is their birational invariance. This invariance implies that the Segre class of a closed subscheme only depends on the integral closure of the defining ideal sheaf.
  In this paper, we show that, conversely, the Segre class of a closed subscheme encodes an integral dependence criterion for its defining ideal sheaf. As an application, we prove that Aluffi's Segre zeta function provides an integral dependence criterion for homogeneous ideals in polynomial rings.</description>

      <title>Curves on Frobenius nonclassical loci of hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ be an absolutely irreducible projective hypersurface defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, equipped with the $\mathbb{F}_q$-Frobenius map $\Phi_q$. In this paper, we investigate irreducible curves $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{S}_{\Phi_q}$, where $\mathcal{S}_{\Phi_q}$ is the $\mathbb{F}_q$-Frobenius nonclassical locus of $\mathcal{S}$. In particular, we show that every curve $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{S}_{\Phi_q}$ such that the restriction of the Gauss map of $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathcal{X}$ is inseparable is $\mathbb{F}_q$-Frobenius nonclassical. This provides a way to construct new Frobenius nonclassical curves, which are curves that tend to have many $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points. We also prove that a certain type of Frobenius nonclassical hypersurfaces $\mathcal{S}$ defined by separated variables are such that their Gauss maps restricted to any curve contained in $\mathcal{S}$ is inseparable. Finally, in parallel with the plane curve cases, we show that if the strict Gauss map $\Gamma$ of a $\mathbb{F}_q$-Frobenius nonclassical hypersurface $\mathcal{S}$ is given by $p$ powers, then $\Gamma$ is purely inseparable.</description>

Abstract: For any extension of commutative rings $A\subseteq B$ we first naturally define a group $\Cl(A,B)$, that we call the ideal class group of this extension (we will see that both the classical ideal class group and, surprisingly, the Picard group are special cases of this structure), then, as a first main result, we obtain the following exact sequence of Abelian groups: ...</description>

      <title>Formalization of Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion in Lean4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive formalization in the Lean4 theorem prover of the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion, which characterizes regular local rings as those Noetherian local rings with finite global dimension. Rather than following the well-known proof that computes the projective dimension of the residue field via quotient by regular sequences and uses the Koszul complex to bound the cotangent space dimension by the global dimension, our approach is built systematically on the formalization of depth defined via the vanishing of Ext functors. We establish key homological results including Rees' theorem, the Auslander--Buchsbaum formula, and Ischebeck's theorem, and further develop the theories of Cohen--Macaulay modules and rings, including a complete formalization of the unmixedness theorem for Cohen--Macaulay rings. To prove the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion, we show that maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules over regular local rings are free and establish a weakened form of the Ferrand--Vasconcelos theorem specific for the unique maximal ideal. As corollaries, we deduce that regularity can be checked at maximal ideals and formalize Hilbert's Syzygy Theorem. This work demonstrates how homological algebra can be effectively employed in the formalization of commutative algebra, providing extensive infrastructure for future developments in the field.</description>

      <title>Generalized weight properties of resultants and discriminants, and applications to projective enumerative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.10692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this text is to understand and prove a formula stated by Salmon, which gives the first terms of some Taylor expansion of the discriminant of a plane algebraic curve. Salmon uses his formula to derive various enumerative quantities for surfaces in $\mathbf{P}^3$. We provide complete proofs of this formula and its enumerative applications, and extend Salmon's considerations to hypersurfaces in a projective space of arbitrary dimension. To this end, we introduce the concept of reduced discriminant, and provide a thorough study of its weight properties; the latter are deeply linked to projective enumerative geometric properties.</description>
