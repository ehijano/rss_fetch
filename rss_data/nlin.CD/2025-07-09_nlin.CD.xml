      <title>Scaling invariance for the diffusion coefficient in a billiard system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the unbounded diffusion observed in a time-dependent oval-shaped billiard and its suppression owing to inelastic collisions with the boundary. The main focus is on the behavior of the diffusion coefficient, which plays a key role in describing the scaling invariance characteristic of this transition. For short times, the low-action regime is characterized by a constant diffusion coefficient, which begins to decay after a crossover iteration, thereby suppressing the unlimited growth of velocity. We demonstrate that this behavior is scaling-invariant concerning the control parameters and can be described by a homogeneous generalized function and its associated scaling laws. The critical exponents are determined both phenomenologically and analytically, including the decay exponent beta = -1, previously identified in the diffusion coefficient of the dissipative standard map.</description>

      <title>Does an intermittent dynamical system remain (weakly) chaotic after drilling in a hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems are often characterised by a positive Lyapunov exponent, which signifies an exponential rate of separation of nearby trajectories. However, in a wide range of so-called weakly chaotic systems, the separation of nearby trajectories is sub-exponential in time, and the Lyapunov exponent vanishes. When a hole is introduced in chaotic systems, the positive Lyapunov exponents on the system's fractal repeller can be related to the generation of metric entropy and the escape rate from the system. The escape rate, in turn, cross-links these two chaos properties to important statistical-physical quantities like the diffusion coefficient. However, no suitable generalisation of this escape rate formalism exists for weakly chaotic systems. In our paper we show that in a paradigmatic one-dimensional weakly chaotic iterated map, the Pomeau-Manneville map, a generalisation of its Lyapunov exponent (which we call `stretching') is completely suppressed in the presence of a hole. This result is based on numerical evidence and a corresponding stochastic model. The correspondence between map and model is tested via a related partially absorbing map. We examine the structure of the map's fractal repeller, which we reconstruct via a simple algorithm. Our findings are in line with rigorous mathematical results concerning the collapse of the system's density as it evolves in time. We also examine the generation of entropy in the open map, which is shown to be consistent with the collapsed stretching. As a result, we conclude that no suitable generalisation of the escape rate formalism to weakly chaotic systems can exist.</description>

      <title>Generative Lagrangian data assimilation for ocean dynamics under extreme sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing ocean dynamics from observational data is fundamentally limited by the sparse, irregular, and Lagrangian nature of spatial sampling, particularly in subsurface and remote regions. This sparsity poses significant challenges for forecasting key phenomena such as eddy shedding and rogue waves. Traditional data assimilation methods and deep learning models often struggle to recover mesoscale turbulence under such constraints. We leverage a deep learning framework that combines neural operators with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to reconstruct high-resolution ocean states from extremely sparse Lagrangian observations. By conditioning the generative model on neural operator outputs, the framework accurately captures small-scale, high-wavenumber dynamics even at $99\%$ sparsity (for synthetic data) and $99.9\%$ sparsity (for real satellite observations). We validate our method on benchmark systems, synthetic float observations, and real satellite data, demonstrating robust performance under severe spatial sampling limitations as compared to other deep learning baselines.</description>

      <title>PINN-Obs: Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Observer for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear dynamical systems is a critical challenge in control and engineering applications, particularly when only partial and noisy measurements are available. This paper introduces a novel Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Network-based Observer (PINN-Obs) for accurate state estimation in nonlinear systems. Unlike traditional model-based observers, which require explicit system transformations or linearization, the proposed framework directly integrates system dynamics and sensor data into a physics-informed learning process. The observer adaptively learns an optimal gain matrix, ensuring convergence of the estimated states to the true system states. A rigorous theoretical analysis establishes formal convergence guarantees, demonstrating that the proposed approach achieves uniform error minimization under mild observability conditions. The effectiveness of PINN-Obs is validated through extensive numerical simulations on diverse nonlinear systems, including an induction motor model, a satellite motion system, and benchmark academic examples. Comparative experimental studies against existing observer designs highlight its superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Failure of the conformal-map method for relativistic quantum billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the conformal-map method introduced by Robnik in 1984 for nonrelativistic quantum billiards is not applicable for the quantization of relativistic neutrino billiards (NBs) consisting of a massless non-interacting spin-1/2 particle confined to a two-dimensional domain. To be precise, we demonstrate in this work, that this method does not provide solutions of the associated Weyl (Dirac) equation, nor does it fulfill the boundary conditions imposed on the spinor eigenfunctions to ensure confinement of the particle to the domain of the billiard. We review in detail the wave equation, boundary conditions and quantization of NBs and derivation of relevant equations, to make the proof comprehensible for the general reader. Our results are corroborated with numerical results for non-relativistic and relativistic quantum billiards whose shapes depend on a parameter, which allows the study of the properties of their eigenstates as the classical dynamics experiences a transition from regular to chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>The interplay of inertia and elasticity in polymeric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addition of polymers modifies a turbulent flow in a manner that depends non-trivially on the interplay of fluid inertia, quantified by the Reynolds number $Re$, and the elasticity of the dissolved polymers, given by the Deborah number $De$. We use direct numerical simulations to study polymeric flows at different $Re$ and $De$ numbers, and uncover various features of their dynamics. Polymeric flows exhibit a multiscaling energy spectrum that is a function of $Re$ and $De$, owing to different dominant contributions to the total energy flux across scales. This behaviour is also manifested in the real space scaling of structure functions. We also shed light on how the addition of polymers results in slowing down the fluid non-linear cascade resulting in a depleted flux, as velocity fluctuations with less energy persist for longer times in polymeric flows. These velocity fluctuations exhibit intermittent, large deviations similar to that in a Newtonian flow at large $Re$, but differ more and more as $Re$ becomes smaller. This observation is further supported by the statistics of fluid energy dissipation in polymeric flows, whose distributions collapse on to the Newtonian at large $Re$, but increasingly differ from it as $Re$ decreases. We also show that polymer dissipation is significantly less intermittent compared to fluid dissipation, and even less so when elasticity becomes large. Polymers, on an average, dissipate more energy when they are stretched more, which happens in extensional regions of the flow. However, owing to vortex stretching, regions with large rotation rates also correlate with large polymer extensions, albeit to a relatively less degree than extensional regions.</description>

      <title>Study of entanglement and phase transitions in the coupled top systems with standard and nonstandard symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classical and quantum versions of a coupled top system in the absence and the presence of nonlinear torsion in the individual top. The model without the torsion and couples two identical tops is well-known in the literature as the Feingold-Peres (FP) model. The permutation and chiral symmetries are preserved in the FP model. This model is classified under the BDI or chiral orthogonal symmetry class, one of the recently proposed nonstandard symmetry classes. For the nonzero torsional cases, we study two different models:(i) identical torsional term in the individual top (NZT-I model); (ii) non-identical torsional term due to their opposite sign in the individual top (NZT-II model). The NZT-I model has the permutation symmetry but no chiral symmetry; hence, this model is classified under the standard three-fold symmetry classes. On the other hand, the NZT-II model does not have permutation symmetry but has chiral symmetry; hence, this model is also classified as a nonstandard BDI symmetry class. In this study, we investigate the role of underlying symmetries on the entanglement between the two tops. Moreover, we explore the interrelations among classical phase space dynamics, energy transitions, and the entanglement between the tops.</description>

      <title>Integrability is generic in homogeneous U(1)-invariant nearest-neighbor qubit circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrability is an exceptional property believed to hold only for systems with fine-tuned parameters. Contrary, we explicitly show that in homogeneous nearest-neighbor qubit circuits with a U(1) symmetry, i.e., circuits that repeatedly apply the same magnetization-conserving two-qubit gate, this is not the case. There, integrability is generic: all such brickwall qubit circuits are integrable, even with a randomly selected gate. We identify two phases with different conservation laws, transport properties, and strong zero edge modes. Experimentally important is the fact that varying any one of the parameters in the generic U(1) gate, one will typically cross the critical manifold that separates the two phases. Finally, we report on an unconventional time-reversal symmetry causing the system with open boundary conditions to be in the orthogonal class, while the one with periodic boundary conditions is in the unitary class.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and for predicting how its statistical properties change when a perturbation is applied. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieve enhanced practical applicability, response theory should be interpretable, capable of focusing on relevant timescales, and amenable to data-driven and equation-agnostic implementations. Along these lines, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we present linear and nonlinear response formulas for Markov chains. We obtain simple and easily implementable expressions that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as of higher-order correlations. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if the underlying evolution equations are unknown. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allows to elucidate the role of different time scales and modes of variability, and to find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. This is a major advantage of the framework proposed here. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) paradox, namely the lack of equipartition in the evolution of a normal mode in a nonlinear chain on unexpectedly long times, is arguably the most famous numerical experiment in the history of physics. Seventy years after the original publication, most studies in FPUT chains still focus on long wavelength initial states similar to the original paper. It is shown here that all characteristic features of the FPUT paradox are rendered even more striking if modes with short(er) wavelengths are evolved instead. Since not every normal mode leads to equipartition, we also provide a simple technique to predict which modes, and in what perturbation order, are excited starting from an initial mode (root) in $\alpha$-FPUT chains. The excitation sequences associated with a root are then numerically shown to spread energy at different speeds, leading to prethermalization regimes that become longer as a function of mode excitation number. This effect is visible in observables such as mode energies and spectral entropies and, surprisingly, also in the time evolution of invariant quantities such as Lyapunov times and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies. Our findings generalize the original FPUT experiment, provide an original look at the paradox's source, and enrich the vast literature dedicated to studying equipartition in classical many-body systems.</description>
