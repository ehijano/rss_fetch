      <title>Gauge gravitation theory in Riemann-Cartan space-time and the nonsingular Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge gravitation theory in the Riemann-Cartan space-time is investigated in order to solve the fundamental problems of the general relativity theory. The constraints for indefinite parameters of the theory under which solutions of isotropic cosmology describe a nonsingular accelerating Universe are given. Numerical solutions of cosmological equations near the limiting energy density by transition from gravitational compression to expansion in dependence on energy density in the case of flat, closed and open models are obtained. Some physical consequences of gauge gravitational theory in the Riemann-Cartan space-time in astrophysics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes in Black Hole Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the excitation of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in gravitational lensing by a Schwarzschild black hole using a scalar field model. By employing a time-domain mode-sum method, we analyze the complex interplay between an incident burst signal and the black hole spacetime. We find that the incident waves can non-resonantly excite a substantial number of high-$l$ modes, with amplitudes for modes as high as l=20 remaining significant compared to the fundamental l=0 mode. We confirm through QNM template fitting that the late-time behaviors of these excited modes are indeed QNMs. After passing through the black hole, we find that the lensed waves form a highly directional and coherent Gaussian beam whose cross-sectional intensity profile is well-described by a Gaussian profile. Unlike spherical waves, this beam's amplitude does not decrease with distance from the black hole but remains nearly constant in the near-field region. Moreover, due to the superposition of numerous QNMs, oscillations largely cancel each other out. The lensed temporal waves do not exhibit typical oscillatory patterns.</description>

      <title>From MOND entropy to extended uncertainty principles: A unified framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the relation between generalised entropies and the extended uncertainty principle (EUP) models. Starting from the higher-order extended uncertainty principle (HOEUP), we obtain the modified entropy-area relation. Then, we derive the modified Friedmann equations through three different approaches: the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon, the entropic gravity case, and the emergence of cosmic space. Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\it Phys. Dark Universe} {\bf 49} (2025) 101967]. Motivated by this connection, we derive a novel EUP, referred to as MOND EUP, from a reverse procedure. This novel EUP reproduces to EUP relations associated with R\'enyi and dual Kaniadakis entropies in the limiting cases. Moreover, we show that HOEUP corresponds to perturbative limit of MOND entropy. The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case. In principle, the method can be applied to other generalised entropy formalisms, suggesting that our findings may establish a unified framework that bridges the generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models. In particular, the corresponding modified uncertainty principles may have effective cutoff mechanisms for the entropy forms, which do not explicitly display cutoff mechanisms. Thus, these entropies may have cutoff mechanism due to their corresponding modified uncertainty principles.</description>

      <title>Analytic discrete self-similar solutions of Einstein-Klein-Gordon at large D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discretely self-similar solutions govern critical gravitational collapse and have been known only numerically since Choptuik's pioneering work. We construct, in closed analytic form, an infinite family of such solutions of the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon system using the large-D expansion. We characterize their structure and compare them with numerical critical solutions at finite D, identifying both universal features and distinctly large-D behavior.</description>

      <title>Higher Harmonics of Double White Dwarfs in the Centihertz Band: Linking LISA and DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the detectability of post-Newtonian higher harmonics from Galactic double white dwarfs in the centihertz band ($\sim 0.01$ Hz). Using a synthetic population, we show that, unlike the quadrupole mode, higher harmonics remain undetectable with LISA except for rare nearby systems. In contrast, planned mid-band (decihertz) observatories such as DECIGO and BBO will be able to detect the third harmonic for about 10\% of inspiral binaries above $\sim 5$ mHz, enabling statistical constraints on mass ratios. These results highlight the successive roles of LISA and future decihertz missions in establishing a coherent strategy for space-based gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>The role of angular momentum in general relativity: heuristic and covariant interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the role of angular momentum in general relativity from both heuristic and fully covariant perspectives, with the aim of clarifying conceptual ambiguities that arise when Newtonian intuition is extrapolated into the relativistic regime. Focusing on free--fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test--particle limit, we employ an effective--potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black--hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case.</description>

      <title>Polarized Radiative Transfer of Kerr-Newman Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this analysis, we investigate the polarization radiation imaging of Kerr-Newman black holes, with a particular focus on the impact of black hole charge on photon propagation and polarization characteristics. By extending the traditional Walker-Penrose method, which is limited by its reliance on specific symmetric structures and Killing tensors, we overcome these limitations by constructing an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerical framework that combines the photon orbit equation with the polarization parallel transport equation. This allows for the self-consistent evolution of photon trajectories and polarization states in any spacetime backgrounds without relying on specific symmetries. Using this framework, we analyze the effects of black hole spin and charge on the polarization characteristics of radiation from both prograde and retrograde accretion disks. Our results show that black hole charge can significantly modify photon trajectories and polarization patterns: increasing charge compresses and distorts the EVPA structure on photon-ring scales, inducing localized rotations and asymmetries that may provide a potential diagnostic of a nonzero black hole charge.</description>

      <title>The relativistic restricted three-body problem: geometry and motion around tidally perturbed black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of a tidally deformed, rotating black hole and timelike geodesics in its vicinity. Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes.</description>

      <title>Effects of massive spin-2 fields on gravitational wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive spin-2 fields in addition to the standard massless graviton arise naturally in extensions of General Relativity, such as massive bigravity or models with extra dimensions. This work explores the observational signatures of these fields on the propagation of gravitational waves. Adopting a phenomenological framework consistent with such theories, we derive an analytical transfer function in the ultrarelativistic limit and establish detectability bounds. Finally, we provide forecasts for the accessible parameter space using current and future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Exact general solutions for cosmological scalar field evolution in a vacuum-energy dominated expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive exact general solutions (as opposed to attractor particular solutions) for the evolution of a scalar field $\phi$ in a universe dominated by a background fluid with equation of state parameter $w_B = -1$, extending earlier work on exact solutions with $w_B &gt; -1$. Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln \phi$, $V = V_0 \phi^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/\phi$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B &gt; -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B &gt; -1$.</description>

      <title>DeepInflation: an AI agent for research and model discovery of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \textbf{DeepInflation}, an AI agent designed for research and model discovery in inflationary cosmology. Built upon a multi-agent architecture, \textbf{DeepInflation} integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a symbolic regression (SR) engine and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) knowledge base. This framework enables the agent to automatically explore and verify the vast landscape of inflationary potentials while grounding its outputs in established theoretical literature. We demonstrate that \textbf{DeepInflation} can successfully discover simple and viable single-field slow-roll inflationary potentials consistent with the latest observations (here ACT DR6 results as example) or any given $n_s$ and $r$, and provide accurate theoretical context for obscure inflationary scenarios. \textbf{DeepInflation} serves as a prototype for a new generation of autonomous scientific discovery engines in cosmology, which enables researchers and non-experts alike to explore the inflationary landscape using natural language. This agent is available at https://github.com/pengzy-cosmo/DeepInflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a remarkably simple expression for the exact solution to the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with the prepotential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$, which represents a five-dimensional static Kaluza-Klein black hole with squashed $S^3$ horizons and four independent electric charges. It is asymptotically locally flat and has a spatial infinity $R \times S^1 \hookrightarrow S^2$. We compute its conserved charges via the counterterm method and demonstrate that the thermodynamic quantities satisfy both the first law and Bekenstein-Smarr mass formula, provided the length of the compact extra dimension is treated as a thermodynamic variable.</description>

      <title>Sample-efficient non-Gaussian noise reduction in gravitational wave data via learnable wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{WaveletNet}$, a wavelet-based neural network architecture to identify and reduce non-Gaussian noise in gravitational wave data. Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as a flexible machine learning method to mitigate non-Gaussian noise. However, training CNNs requires many data samples, especially when the input data segments are long. Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline. We take potential GW candidates from the pipeline, and then downweight the candidates having noisy strain regions in their vicinity. We use our framework in a modular way: we provide an output score which can be added to the pipeline's existing detection statistic score for the candidates. We test our method using candidates from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and show that it improves the search sensitive volume by up to 15% for high-mass, asymmetric binaries.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Masses with Enhanced $B-L$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming all three known neutrinos are Dirac fermions, $U(1)_{B-L}$ can be an exact symmetry. We show that, if the condition of charge quantization is relaxed, the anomaly-free $B-L$ charges of two out of three right-handed neutrinos can be enhanced by arbitrarily large factors, while all other fermions retain their canonical charges. We call this setup as `enhanced $B-L$ symmetry' and promote it to be local. As long as this enhanced $B-L$ gauge symmetry remains unbroken, neutrinos stay chiral and massless at low energies. Nonzero neutrino masses then require sub-eV-scale symmetry breaking order parameters, which we associate with gravity-induced neutrino condensate. If the enhancement is large and the $B-L$ gauge boson $A'$ is lighter than the heaviest neutrino, then the neutrino decay into $A'$ directly constrains the gauge coupling, which can be significantly stronger than the baryon-based fifth-force tests. Through kinetic mixing with the photon, $A'$ can also mediate neutrino-electron and coherent neutrino-nucleus scatterings, leading to possible signatures in neutrino observatories and dark matter detectors.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and dynamics in the Sauter-Schwinger effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, entanglement entropy under spatial bipartitioning serves as a powerful information-theoretic probe of quantum correlations. In this work, we present the first comprehensive numerical study of the dynamical evolution and geometric scaling of entanglement entropy in a nonperturbative, strong-field QED setting -- specifically, in the context of the Sauter-Schwinger effect. While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior. Finally, we provide interpretations based on the behavior of the low-energy pair-creation spectrum and discuss how these insights could inform future investigations of related phenomena.</description>

      <title>Amplifying the Cosmological Collider with Ghost Spectators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ghost inflation is a well-known framework in which cosmological fluctuations can generate enhanced primordial non-Gaussianity, typically of the equilateral type. In its original form, however, it is in tension with current observational constraints. Here we instead consider a setup in which a standard inflaton drives the background evolution, while excitations of a ghost condensate act as spectator fields that interact with the inflaton. This proposal fits naturally within the cosmological collider program: the exchanged particle has a modified dispersion relation, $\omega \propto k^2$. We show that this ghost-inspired dynamics weakens the usual Boltzmann suppression, similarly to models with a very small effective sound speed, yielding an enhanced bispectrum signal relative to standard cosmological collider scenarios. At the same time, the horizon-crossing scale remains a free parameter of the theory. As a result, the model shares features of both the de Sitter bootstrap and boostless frameworks. Finally, we derive the differential equations governing cosmological correlators in the ghost-collider setup. Their structure reflects the quadratic momentum dependence of the dispersion relation and distinguishes this scenario from conventional relativistic cases.</description>

      <title>Searching for Isolated Black Hole Candidates within 15 pc of the Solar System in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical models predict that the Galaxy hosts $10^8$-$10^9$ black holes formed from the complete gravitational collapse of heavy stars and that most of these black holes are isolated, without any companion. Within 15 pc of the Solar System ($\sim 50$ ly), there may be a few black holes. If located inside one of the Local Interstellar Clouds - which occupy 5-20% of this local volume - an isolated black hole could produce detectable electromagnetic emission via accretion from the interstellar medium, given the capabilities of current or near-future observatories. However, precise predictions remain challenging due to large uncertainties in the expected accretion spectra. Outside these clouds, the accretion rate would be too low in any standard model to yield a detectable electromagnetic signal. While astrometric detection via gravitational perturbation of nearby stars is conceivable, the local stellar density is too low for this method to be realistically successful. We have searched the Gaia DR3 catalog for candidate isolated black holes accreting from the interstellar medium and identified five sources. All candidates lie close to the Galactic plane, making them likely spurious astrometric solutions, for instance caused by unmodelled background sources (crowding) and/or unmodelled binarity; nevertheless, they cannot be definitively ruled out without follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Nonrestoration in the Pati-Salam Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that symmetry need not be restored in the Pati-Salam model, so that $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R\otimes SU(4)_c$ remains broken to the Standard Model group at temperatures above the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale. Including the leading finite-temperature corrections, suitable quartic couplings prevent a restoration transition, thereby avoiding the thermal production of 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles after inflation, even if the reheating temperature is very high. This removes monopole-based constraints on the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Amplitudes to Spacetime Geometry: a Multipolar Framework for Black Hole Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops a unified framework that reconstructs the full classical content of General Relativity from the classical limit of quantum scattering amplitudes. By interpreting the analytic structure of amplitudes as the field-theoretic imprint of spacetime geometry, the work establishes a direct correspondence between quantum processes and classical gravitational observables such as metrics, deflection angles, and multipole moments. Starting from the effective-field-theory description of gravity, the thesis shows that loop amplitudes encode not only quantum corrections but also the nonlinear classical self-interaction of the gravitational field, enabling the systematic derivation of the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational quantities by rewriting the Einstein equations in terms of graviton scattering processes. Building upon this foundation, the framework is applied to rotating and charged sources in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. A momentum-space formulation of the energy-momentum tensor is then developed, introducing gravitational form factors and source multipoles that link, for the first time, the internal matter distribution to the external multipolar field in a completely relativistic framework. Furthermore, the thesis completes the transition from the microscopic amplitude picture to the macroscopic description of gravitational sources by engineering a multipole-based framework for black hole mimickers, then applied to build horizon-less compact objects mimicking the multipolar structure of Kerr black holes. Finally, exploiting the Kerr-Schild gauge, the Fourier transforms of rotating black hole metrics are computed in closed form, bridging perturbative and non-perturbative descriptions of gravity, and allowing to probe the multipolar structure of higher-dimensional solutions employing scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>The First Upper Bound on the Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Cross-Correlation signal using 15-year NANOGrav Data and DESI Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of a common-spectrum stochastic signal by multiple pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has provided tentative evidence for a nanohertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). This signal can be widely interpreted as originating from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Current PTA analyses primarily constrain the SGWB power spectrum and its auto-angular power spectrum. However, the supermassive black holes will produce an underlying correlation with the large-scale structure of the Universe, which can help in understanding the formation and evolution of the binaries. In this work, we develop a new analysis pipeline PyGxGW-PTA for studying the cross-correlation of nHz GW signal with galaxy surveys ($C^{\rm g\, GW}_\ell$) and obtain the first constraint on the SGWB and galaxy distribution cross-correlation using the NANOGrav 15-year dataset in combination with the DESI galaxy catalog. We find no statistically significant correlation between the SGWB and the large-scale distribution of DESI galaxies and using an optimal estimator we put an upper bound on $C^{\rm g\, GW}_{\ell=8} &lt; 0.0083$ at $95\%$ C.I. This yields the first observational upper limit on the spatial correlation between the nHz SGWB and the large-scale structure of the Universe, establishing the observational groundwork for future multi-tracer analyses that will combine PTA data with next-generation galaxy surveys to unveil the SMBHB-galaxy correlation.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement in the quantum tetrahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ of SU(2)-invariant four-valent tensors, also known as intertwiners, can be understood as the quantum states of a tetrahedron in Euclidean space with fixed areas. In loop quantum gravity, they are states of the smallest "atom of space" with non-zero volume. At the same time they correspond to four-party tensor product states invariant under global rotations. We consider the multipartite entanglement of states in $\mathrm{Inv}(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4)$ using the recently proposed entropic fill.
  Numerically evaluating entropic fill in the case of equal spins between $1/2$ and $11$, we find that the distributions of entanglement are very different for intertwiners as compared to generic tensors, and for coherent intertwiners as compared to generic ones. The peak in the distribution seems to be at the highest entanglement for generic intertwiners and at the lowest for generic tensors, but in terms of average entanglement, the roles are switched: average entanglement is highest in arbitrary tensors and lower in intertwiners, at least in the regime of large $j$. We also find that entanglement depends on the geometric data of coherent intertwiners in a complicated way.</description>

      <title>Revealing massive black hole astrophysics: The potential of hierarchical inference with extreme mass-ratio inspiral observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) will enable sub-percent measurements of massive black hole parameters and provide access to the demographics of compact objects in galactic nuclei. During the LISA mission, multiple EMRIs are expected to be detected, allowing statistical studies of massive black hole populations and their formation pathways. We perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on simulated EMRI catalogues to assess how well LISA could constrain the astrophysical population using parametrised population models. We test our inference framework on a variety of populations, including heterogeneous and homogeneous mixtures of parametrised subpopulations, and scenarios in which the assumed model is deliberately misspecified. Our results show that population parameters governing distributions with sharp features can be tightly constrained. Mixed populations can be disentangled with as few as $\sim20$ detections, and even with model misspecification, the inference retains sensitivity to key population features. These results demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of EMRI population inference, providing guidance for constructing realistic astrophysical population models for LISA analysis.</description>

      <title>De Sitter Momentum Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a natural and nonperturbative momentum space for quantum field theory on $(d+1)$-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime in the Poincar\'e slicing, adapted to early Universe cosmology. In particular, we identify the dS frequency as the unitary-representation label of the dS isometry group $\mathrm{SO}(1, d+1)$. By diagonalizing the quadratic Casimir together with spatial translations, we provide a harmonic expansion of operators in what we call the Kontorovitch-Lebedev-Fourier (KLF) space. This momentum space shares many structural properties with its Minkowski counterpart, for instance: equations of motion reduce to algebraic equations, and the quadratic dynamics provides a simple propagator analogous to flat space. We reformulate the perturbative computation of in-in correlators in KLF momentum space, showing from first principles how time integrals turn into frequency-space integrals over meromorphic functions. We show how our construction streamlines computations, naturally accommodates the contributions from principal and complementary series in the K\"all\'en-Lehmann spectral decomposition of composite operators, and leads to an inversion formula for the spectral density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological data favour phantom-crossing dark energy, motivating models with non-minimal couplings that induce a fifth force on structure formation. Reconciling these models with local tests often requires strong screening, leading to environment-dependent clustering. We investigate such effects via a late-time structure-induced phase transition driven by a non-minimally coupled scalar field. For this purpose, we introduce norns, a fully relativistic cosmological particle-mesh code that self-consistently evolves a complex scalar field - a generalisation of the symmetron producing global U(1) strings rather than domain walls. Using simulations, we compare string and wall-forming models, quantifying impacts on the matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and defect dynamics. Strong environment-dependent effects can generate significant departures from LCDM in underdense regions while keeping the overall power spectrum changes modest (~ 4-15% at k~0.3-0.5 h Mpc^-1, sub-percent for z &gt; 0.2). We find that an attractive fifth force can locally suppress structure growth in voids while enhancing it in surrounding overdense regions by driving outflows from the voids. These effects leave distinctive signatures in the matter density probability density function and in marked halo power spectra, which are likely detectable in low-redshift data.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Transformations and Indeterminism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory is widely regarded as fundamentally indeterministic, yet classical frameworks can also exhibit indeterminism once infinite information is abandoned. At the same time, relativity is usually taken to forbid superluminal signalling, yet Lorentz symmetry formally admits superluminal transformations (SpTs). Dragan and Ekert have argued that SpTs entail indeterminism analogous to the quantum one. Here, we derive a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, which can be interpreted as: superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist. Any theory accommodating SpTs must therefore allow unbounded information content, leading to a deterministic ontology akin to that of classical theories formulated over the real numbers. Thus, any apparent indeterminism arising from superluminal transformations reflects only probabilities arising from subjective ignorance, unlike the objective nature of probabilities in quantum theory, indicating that the claimed indeterminacy from superluminal extensions is not quantum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that an ansatz for $1+3+n$ dimensional static spacetime with spherical symmetry in three dimensions and Euclidean symmetry in $n$ dimensions, parametrized by only one function of radial coordinate, leads to a limited set of vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations. They can also be identified as Weyl solutions. We investigate properties of these spacetimes through the Kretschmann scalar, Newtonian mass defined through the Newtonian limit, Komar mass, Einstein, Landau--Lifshitz, and ADM mass. In addition to $1+3+n$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime, there are two classes of solutions. The first class is a trivial product of the Schwarzschild spacetime and Euclidean spaces in extra dimensions, while the second class is non-trivial. In the case with no horizon, there is a naked singularity, all masses are equal, and they are negative. In the case when there is a horizon, this horizon accommodates a physical singularity, which corresponds to Kaluza--Klein bubbles featuring exotic properties. Einstein, Landau--Lifshitz, and ADM masses are positive, while Newtonian and Komar masses are negative. This differentiates these solutions from trivial higher-dimensional extensions of the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continuation of the similarly titled paper on the $e^2 &lt; m^2$ Reissner -- Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) metric (arXiv 2409.03786), in this paper it was verified whether it is possible to send (by means of timelike and null geodesics) messages to one's own past in the maximally extended {\it extreme} ($e^2 = m^2$) RN spacetime with the asymptotically flat regions being identified. Numerical examples show that timelike and nonradial null geodesics originating outside the horizon have their turning points to the future of the past light cone of the future copy of the emitter. This means that they cannot reach the causal past of the emitter's future copy. Ingoing radial null geodesics hit the singularity at $r = 0$ and stop there. So, unlike in the $e^2 &lt; m^2$ case, identification of the asymptotically flat regions does not lead to causality breaches. A formal mathematical proof of this thesis (as opposed to the numerical examples given in this paper) is still lacking and desired.</description>

Abstract: Bianchi I cosmological solutions in f(T) gravity are discussed. We start from diagonal metrics and tetrads and show that their dynamical equations are pretty much tractable analytically, with a possible arena for physical applications. Then we derive a very bad unpredictability of the teleparallel connection in these configurations. Namely, even for the simple isotropic Friedmann universes, one might apply an arbitrary time-dependent spatial rotation to the standard tetrad without changing anything in the cosmological equations.</description>

      <title>Transformer Networks for Continuous Gravitational-wave Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wide-parameter-space searches for continuous gravitational waves using semi-coherent matched-filter methods require enormous computing power, which limits their achievable sensitivity. Here we explore an alternative search method based on training neural networks as classifiers on detector strain data with minimal pre-processing. Contrary to previous studies using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we investigate the suitability of the transformer architecture, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT). We establish sensitivity benchmarks using the matched-filter $\mathcal{F}$-statistic for ten targeted searches over a ten day timespan, and ten directed and six all-sky searches over a one day timespan. We train ViTs on each of these benchmark cases. The trained ViTs achieve essentially matched-filter sensitivity on the targeted benchmarks, and approach the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic detection probability of $p_{\mathrm{det}}$ = 90% on the directed ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 85-89 %) and all-sky benchmarks ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 78-88 %). Unlike the CNNs in our previous studies, which required extensive manual design and hyperparameter tuning, the ViT achieves better performance with a standard architecture and minimal tuning.</description>

      <title>Conundrum of regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields has sprouted numerous candidates, each exhibiting certain virtues but often accompanied by significant drawbacks. We demonstrate that Komar mass, electric charge and magnetic charge are mutually dependent in regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields, defined by a Lagrangian which is a function of both electromagnetic invariants, $F_{ab} F^{ab}$ and $F_{ab}{\star F}^{ab}$, regardless of the specific weak field limit of the theory. Also, we generalize one of the key no-go theorems by showing that static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black holes in a theory respecting the relaxed Maxwellian weak field limit do not admit a bounded Kretschmann scalar. Finally, we address one of the long-standing niche questions, whether regular black hole solutions can exist when both electric and magnetic charges are present, by constructing an exotic family of regular dyonic black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields in theories respecting the Maxwellian weak field limit. Mounting evidence suggests that regularizing black holes through simplistic nonlinear extensions of Maxwell's electromagnetism entails a high cost in the form of unorthodox theoretical assumptions.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Gravity Beyond General Relativity: Insights from Torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a semiclassical theory of modified gravity with nontrivial spacetime torsion. In particular, we show that the semiclassical treatment can be axiomatized in the case of Einstein--Cartan theory with a nonminimally coupled, free Klein--Gordon field, in four dimensions. Using Hadamard renormalization, we obtain well-defined expectation values for both, the energy--momentum and spin--density operators. These objects exhibit scale and renormalization ambiguities; we identify the latter by constructing a renormalization Lagrangian in terms of differential forms, which are particularly well suited for this purpose. Furthermore, we analyze the conformal anomaly, which persists in the presence of torsion.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in semi-open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study perturbations of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in semi-open systems by using the Heun functions. For the semi-open system, a partially reflective wall is added around the event horizon. Three aspects of this model are investigated, namely the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra, the greybody factor (GF), and the exceptional point (EP). For the QNM aspect, we identify three distinct behaviors as the frequency-independent reflectivity $\mathcal{K}$ increasing. The first-type modes approach the real axis and form long-lived quasi-bound states. The second-type modes move toward but do not reach the real axis and retain a finite decay rate. The third-type modes eventually lie on the imaginary axis becoming purely decaying modes. For the GF aspect, GFs exhibit strong oscillations controlled by the distance between the potential and the reflective wall with a real constant reflectivity. In contrast, a Boltzmann-type reflectivity produces only small corrections. Finally, by promoting $\mathcal{K}$ to a complex parameter, the modified boundary conditions give rise to a second-order EP. Parameterizing the vicinity of such EP, we observe the mode exchange phenomenon, and the deviation of spectra scale with the square root of the deviation of the parameter, as predicted by a Puiseux series expansion.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the Quantum Stress Tensor Fluctuations and the Limits of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor and its fluctuations in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$. A generally accepeted condition for the conceptual consistency of semiclassical gravity, where $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$ represent the sources of the Einstein equations, is that the fluctuations of the energy momentum tensor remain small compared to its expectation value. We study the renormalization of both the energy-momentum tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x)\rangle_{\rm ren}$ and the fluctuation tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x) T_{cd}(x) \rangle_{\rm ren}$ for suitable Hadamard states, using the operator product expansion for a free scalar field on a fixed curved background. We show that states (usually referred to as `squeezed vacua') -- arising naturally in black hole evaporation and in inflationary cosmology -- fail to satisfy the natural semiclassicality criterion.</description>

      <title>Constraints on gravitational waves from the 2024 Vela pulsar glitch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among known neutron stars, the Vela pulsar is one of the best targets for gravitational-wave searches. It is also one of the most prolific in terms of glitches, sudden frequency changes in a pulsar's rotation. Such glitches could cause a variety of transient gravitational-wave signals. Here we search for signals associated with a Vela glitch on 29 April 2024 in data of the two LIGO detectors from the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run. We search both for seconds-scale burst-like emission, primarily from fundamental (f-)mode oscillations, and for longer quasi-monochromatic transients up to four months in duration, primarily from quasi-static quadrupolar deformations. We find no significant detection candidates, but for the first time we set direct observational upper limits on gravitational strain amplitude that are stricter than what can be indirectly inferred from the overall glitch energy scale. We discuss the short- and long-duration observational constraints in the context of specific emission models. These results demonstrate the potential of gravitational-wave probes of glitching pulsars as detector sensitivity continues to improve.</description>

      <title>Radiation properties and images of loop quantum Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole with a thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the characteristics of circular geodesics around loop quantum Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole (LQRNBH) and the radiation properties and observational appearance of a thin accretion disk around it. By calculating the shadow radius and utilizing observational data from M87* and Sgr A*, we derive constraints on the quantum parameter $\zeta$ and charge parameter $Q$. The timelike circular geodesics around LQRNBH and the influence of the model parameters on the circular motion are also discussed. It is found that contrary to the case of the parameter $Q$, the increase of the quantum parameter $\zeta$ leads to the increase of the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Then, by considering a thin accretion disk model, various radiation properties of the LQRNBH and the effects of the model parameters on them are studied. Concrete examples are provided for quantitative comparison of the radiation properties between LQRNBH and Schwarzschild black hole. With the ray-tracing method, the isoradial curves, redshift distributions, and the observed radiation fluxes of the direct and secondary images of the LQRNBH with the thin accretion disk for various model parameters and observation angles are numerically calculated and discussed. These results are beneficial for our understanding of the physical consequences of loop quantum gravity effect.</description>

      <title>Quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity -- Part I: Classical reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the non-perturbative reduced phase space quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a nonpositive cosmological constant. In this Part I we focus on the classical reduction process, and the description of the reduced phase space, while in Part II we discuss the quantization of the phase space and quantum aspects of the causal diamonds. The system is defined as the domain of dependence of a spacelike topological disk with fixed boundary metric. By solving the constraints in a constant-mean-curvature time gauge and removing all the spatial gauge redundancy, we find that the phase space is the cotangent bundle of Diff^+(S^1)/PSL(2,R), i.e., the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle modulo the projective special linear subgroup. Classically, the states correspond to causal diamonds embedded in AdS_3 (or Mink_3 if $\Lambda = 0$), with fixed corner length, and whose Cauchy surfaces have the topology of a disc.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Mapping the Magnetic QCD Phase Diagram via Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD phase diagram is crucial for understanding strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, with major implications for cosmology, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. We present a novel holographic QCD model utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to map the QCD phase diagram under magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, and temperature $T$. By solving the inverse problem of constructing a gravitational theory from Lattice QCD data, we reveal an unprecedentedly rich phase structure at finite $B$, including multiple critical endpoints (CEPs) in strong magnetic fields. Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 115.9 \, \mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 244.0 \, \mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location, and the conventional scaling relations can be violated in the presence of strong magnetic fields. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA.</description>

      <title>Scalar and vector dark matter admixed neutron stars with linear and quadratic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark scalar- and vector-mediated interactions on dark matter admixed neutron stars, employing the two-fluid formalism. We adopt three different nuclear equations of state -- BSk22, MPA1 and APR4 -- to describe the baryonic sector, while the dark component consists of fermionic particles within a relativistic mean field framework. We consider both linear and quadratic scalar interactions with the dark fermion, including a quartic self-interaction in the latter case. The parameters of the dark matter models are inferred via a Bayesian analysis that incorporates data from NICER observations and binary neutron star merger detections. The neutron star configurations obtained from the selected model parameters develop dark matter cores, leading to more compact objects with smaller masses and radii. Our findings suggest that scalar interactions generally have a weaker impact on the stellar structure compared to vector-mediated ones, though quantitative differences arise. In particular, quadratic scalar couplings suppress the net attractive interaction, allowing for larger dark matter fractions to be accreted. We also compute the sound speed of DM, finding that the scalar and quadratic interactions modify the stiffness of the dark equation of state while respecting causality: vector repulsion enhances the sound speed, whereas scalar attraction tends to soften it. We compare our results with GW1708017, GW190425 and NICER data and constrain DM couplings and mass.</description>

      <title>Today's Experiments Suffice to Indirectly Verify the Quantum Essence of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravity-mediated entanglement experiments employ concepts from quantum information to argue that if entanglement due to gravitational interaction is observed, then gravity cannot be described by a classical system. However, the proposed experiments remain beyond out current technological capability, with optimistic projections placing the experiment outside of short-term future. Here we argue that current matter-wave interferometers are sufficient to indirectly prove that gravitational interaction creates entanglement between two systems. Specifically, we prove that if we experimentally verify the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a single delocalized system interacting gravitationally with an external mass, then, under one of two reasonable assumptions, the time evolution of two delocalized systems will lead to gravity-mediated entanglement.</description>

      <title>Reduction of topological invariants on null hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational helicity flux density represents the angular distribution of helicity flux in general relativity. In this work, we explore its relationship to the reduction of topological invariants at future null infinity. Contrary to initial expectations, the Pontryagin term, which contributes to the gravitational chiral anomaly, is not related to the gravitational helicity flux density. Instead, the Nieh-Yan term, another topological invariant within the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR), can reproduce this flux density. We also reduce these two topological invariants to null hypersurfaces describing near-horizon geometry. In this near-horizon context, the Pontryagin term yields a non-trivial quantity that may characterize a Carrollian fluid helicity relevant to near-horizon physics.</description>

      <title>Suppression of scalar perturbations due to a heavy axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fast-rolling axion can transfer its kinetic energy to gauge fields via the Chern-Simons coupling, leading to copious production of gauge quanta during inflation. The amplified gauge fields act as a source for both scalar and tensor perturbations. In this work, we propose a mechanism for suppressing scalar perturbations while sourcing strong tensor perturbations. We present an implementation of such a mechanism, demonstrating that sourced tensor perturbations are expected to be detected by upcoming next-generation CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>A Practical Framework for Estimating the Repetition Likelihood of Fast Radio Bursts from Spectral Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The repeating behavior of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is regarded as a key clue to understanding their physical origin, yet reliably distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters with current observations remains challenging. Here we propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable classification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality reduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the spectral running $r$ and spectral index $\gamma$ as the most critical parameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME/FRB sample. In the $\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy regions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in flatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We further construct an empirical probability map in the $\gamma$-$r$ space, showing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\sim 65\%$ in the high-repetition region to $\sim 5\%$ in the low-repetition region. Combining this with Gaussian Mixture Model posterior analysis, we identify several apparent non-repeaters with high inferred repetition probability, recommending them as priority targets for future monitoring. This framework provides a simple and generalizable tool for assessing repeatability in the CHIME/FRB sample and highlights the diagnostic power of spectral morphology in unveiling FRB origins.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Collider Gravitational Waves sourced by Right-handed Neutrino production from Bubbles: Testing Seesaw, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a minimal type-I seesaw framework in which a first-order phase transition (FOPT), driven by a singlet scalar, produces right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) through bubble collisions, realizing a cosmic-scale collider that probes ultra-high energy scales. The resulting RHN distribution sources novel low-frequency gravitational-waves (GWs) in addition to the standard bubble-collision contribution. A stable lightest RHN can account for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance for masses as low as $M_{1} \equiv m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, with the associated novel GW signal accessible in LISA, ET and upcoming LVK detectors. If the RHNs are unstable, their CP-violating decays generate the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis for $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and phase transition temperatures $T_* \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, for which the novel GW spectrum is detectable in ET, BBO and upcoming LVK. If RHN decays also populate a dark-sector fermion with mass $m_{\chi} \in [10^{-4},10^{4}],\mathrm{GeV}$, successful co-genesis of baryons and asymmetric dark matter occurs for $T_* \gtrsim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, naturally explaining $\Omega_{\rm DM} \simeq 5\Omega_{\rm B}$. The corresponding GW signals are testable with LISA, ET, and BBO. Finally, we analyze a UV-complete multi-Majoron model, based on a global $U(1)_N \times U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ extension, motivated from the hierarchy of lepton masses, which we dub as Mojaron collider. The corresponding FOPT in this model leaves a distinctive GW signature arising from RHN production during $U(1)_N$ symmetry breaking detectable by BBO, ET and upcoming LVK. Successful leptogenesis is realized for heaviest RHN mass $M_3 \sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and a $U(1)_N$ breaking vev $v_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$, which sets the seesaw scale.</description>

      <title>Geodesics, One Point Functions and Black Hole Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic black holes exhibit a striking relation between thermal boundary one-point functions and bulk geodesic lengths. In the large conformal-dimension limit, the one-point function of a primary operator is given by the exponential of the geodesic length from its boundary insertion point to the horizon. We test the robustness of this relation under perturbations by considering an arbitrary radial deformation of an Euclidean BTZ black hole and working to first order in the perturbation. We find that the relation remains robust: the corrected one-point function at large conformal dimension is still governed by an exponent proportional to the modified boundary-to-horizon geodesic length. The result is established using WKB and saddle-point methods, with the validity of the WKB approximation justified by exact analyses.</description>

      <title>Cluster number counts in dark energy model with energy and momentum coupling to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The influences on the cluster number counts from the coupling between dark energy and dark matter with momentum transfer are investigated. We find that the extrapolated linear density contrast computed from the spherical collapse model is suppressed when the strength of momentum transfer is increased. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, the cluster number counts are computed. The minimum mass limit in the mass integration for each redshift bin is determined by matching the predicted number counts from the $\Lambda$CDM model with the result from eROSITA surveys. We find that the number of clusters is maximal at a higher redshift bin, and the number of clusters in a maximum redshift bin is enhanced when the strength of momentum and energy transfers increases due to the reduction of extrapolated linear density contrast. Setting the parameters of the dark energy model with momentum coupling according to the observational constraints in \cite{bestfit}, the predicted number counts from the coupled dark energy is larger than the result from eROSITA surveys. The statistical analysis yields a $p$-value of 0.189 for the proposed model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Consequently, there is no statistically significant evidence of an improved fit over the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework based on the eROSITA cluster number counts.</description>
