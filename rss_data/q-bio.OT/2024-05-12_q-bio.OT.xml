      <title>Characterization of mood and emotion regulation in females with PMS/PMDD using near-infrared spectroscopy to assess prefrontal cerebral blood flow and the mood questionnaire</title>

Abstract: Many sexually mature women experience premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric mood disorder (PMDD). Current approaches for managing PMS and PMDD rely on daily mental condition recording, which many discontinue due to its impracticality. Hence, there's a critical need for a simple, objective method to monitor mental symptoms. One of the principal symptoms of PMDD is a dysfunction in emotional regulation, which has been demonstrated through brain-function imaging measurements to involve hyperactivity in the amygdala and a decrease in functionality in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, most research has been focused on PMDD, leaving a gap in understanding of PMS. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures brain activity by spectroscopically determining the amount of hemoglobin in the blood vessels. This study aimed to characterize the emotional regulation function in PMS. We measured brain activity in the PFC region using NIRS when participants were presented with emotion-inducing pictures. Furthermore, moods highly associated with emotions were assessed through questionnaires. Forty-six participants were categorized into non-PMS, PMS, and PMDD groups based on the gynecologist's diagnosis. POMS2 scores revealed higher negative mood and lower positive mood in the follicular phase for the PMS group, while the PMDD group exhibited heightened negative mood during the luteal phase. NIRS results showed reduced emotional expression in the PMS group during both phases, while no significant differences were observed in the PMDD group compared to non-PMS. It was found that there are differences in the distribution of mood during the luteal and follicular phase and in cerebral blood flow responses to emotional stimuli between PMS and PMDD. These findings suggest the potential for providing individuals with awareness of PMS or PMDD through scores on the POMS2 and NIRS measurements.</description>
