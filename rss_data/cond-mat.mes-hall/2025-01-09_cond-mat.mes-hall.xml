      <title>Quantum Electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels in a deep-subwavelength hyperbolic phonon polariton cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal ballistic transport in multi-layer Weyl Semimetal films with surface engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetal (WSM) thin films possess unique electronic properties that differ from bulk materials. In this article, we study the nonreciprocal ballistic transport of the WSM thin films caused by surface modification. We find that the surface states contribute predominantly to the nonreciprocity, while the bulk states provide a negative correction. Our calculation shows a kind of quantum size effect that the nonreciprocal signal decreases as the WSM film becomes thicker, and diverges when the Fermi energy is near the bottom of a sub-band. On the other hand, it is found that the density of states in multi-layer systems possesses some properties roughly independent of thickness. A single-variable theory is developed to explain it</description>

      <title>Skin-inspired in-sensor encoding of strain vector using tunable quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human skin provides crucial tactile feedback, allowing us to skillfully perceive various objects by sensing and encoding complex deformations through multiple parameters in each tactile receptor. However, replicating this high-dimensional tactile perception with conventional materials' electronic properties remains a daunting challenge. Here, we present a skin-inspired method to encode strain vectors directly within a sensor. This is achieved by leveraging the strain-tunable quantum properties of electronic bands in the van der Waals topological semimetal Td -WTe2. We observe robust and independent responses from the second-order and third-order nonlinear Hall signals in Td -WTe2 when subjected to variations in both the magnitude and direction of strain. Through rigorous temperature-dependent measurements and scaling law analysis, we establish that these strain responses primarily stem from quantum geometry-related phenomena, including the Berry curvature and Berry-connection polarizability tensor. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that the strain-dependent nonlinear Hall signals can efficiently encode high-dimensional strain information using a single device. This capability enables accurate and comprehensive sensing of complex strain patterns in the embossed character "NJU". Our findings highlight the promising application of topological quantum materials in advancing next-generation, bio-inspired flexible electronics.</description>

      <title>Tilted chiral spin textures in confined nanostructures with in-plane magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that nanoconfinement effects and in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) can lead to tilted chiral spin textures in magnetic nanostructures, based on the analysis and simulation of theoretical models of micromagnetism. The tilted skyrmions are induced in confined nanoscale magnets with IMA under perpendicular magnetic fields. The chiral magnetic structures depend significantly on the size of the nanostructures. A controlled string of periodic skyrmion states emerges within the central magnetic domain wall, which can be tuned by the steady magnetic fields and the size of the nanostructures. Non-trivial topological states with non-integer topological charges are achieved by tuning the magnetic fields or the sizes of the nanostructures. Importantly, the periodic switching between the trivial and the non-trivial topological configurations is realized using an alternating magnetic field. Our study reveals an important mechanism for controlling novel skyrmion states via nanoconfinement effects and the IMA in magnetic nanostructures, and also provides a new approach for the development of magnetic field-modulated spin nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of PbTe nanowires with and without a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic behaviors in PbTe and PbTe-Pb hybrid nanowires. In previous studies on PbTe, wire-to-wire variations in anisotropy indicate poor device control, posing a serious challenge for applications. Here, we achieve reproducible anisotropy in PbTe nanowires through a substantial reduction of disorder. We then couple PbTe to a superconductor Pb, and observe a pronounced deviation in the anisotropy behavior compared to bare PbTe nanowires. This deviation is gate-tunable and attributed to spin-orbit interaction and orbital effect, controlled by charge transfer between Pb and PbTe. These results provide a guidance for the controlled engineering of exotic quantum states in this hybrid material platform.</description>

      <title>Observation of topological Anderson Chern insulator phase in MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation of topology and disorder has attracted great intention due to appropriate disorder could induce the phase transition between trivial and nontrivial topological states. While it is widely recognized that strong disorder can produce rich phase diagrams in topological nontrivial states, moderate disorder has been proposed to induce transitions into topologically nontrivial phases counter-intuitively, leading to the concept of topological Anderson insulators. This phenomenon has been theoretically explored and simulated in various systems, yet experimental realization in solid state systems has remained elusive due to challenges in controlling disorder. Here, we report the experimental observation of Chern insulator state signed by the coexistence of quantized Hall plateau and zero longitudinal resistance in monolayer MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ Hall bar device, which originally hosts a trivial insulating state with Chern number $C$ = 0 in clean limit. We demonstrate that the observed trivial to nontrivial transition in this monolayer device can be attributed to disorder, evidenced by universal conductance fluctuations. Our findings substantiate the existence of a long-sought topological Anderson Chern insulator in real materials, a unique variant of the topological Anderson insulator characterized by broken time-reversal-symmetry.</description>

      <title>Hypersonic acoustic wave control via hyperuniform phononic nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling hypersonic surface acoustic waves is crucial for advanced phononic devices such as high-frequency filters, sensors, and quantum computing components. While periodic phononic crystals enable precise bandgap engineering, their ability to suppress acoustic waves is limited to specific frequency ranges. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the control of surface acoustic waves using a hyperuniform arrangement of gold nanopillars on a lithium niobate layer. The hyperuniform structure exhibits characteristics of both random and ordered systems, leading to an overall reduction in acoustic transmission and the formation of bandgap-like regions where phonon propagation is strongly suppressed. We further demonstrate effective waveguiding by incorporating linear and S-shaped waveguides into the hyperuniform pattern. Both simulations and experiments confirm high transmission through the waveguides at frequencies within the bandgaps, demonstrating the flexibility of hyperuniform structures to support waveguides of complex shapes. These findings provide a novel approach to overcoming the limitations of traditional phononic crystals and advancing acoustic technologies in applications such as mechanical quantum computing and smartphone filters.</description>

      <title>Anomalous topological edge modes in a periodically-driven trimer lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have a longstanding reputation for establishing rich topological phenomena beyond their static counterpart. In this work, we propose and investigate a periodically driven extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with three sites per unit cell, obtained by replacing the Pauli matrices with their $3\times 3$ counterparts. The system is found to support a number of edge modes over a range of parameter windows, some of which have no static counterparts. Among these edge modes, of particular interest are those which are pinned at a specific quasienergy value. Such quasienergy-fixed edge modes arise due to the interplay between topology and chiral symmetry, which are typically not expected in a three-band static model due to the presence of a bulk band at the only chiral-symmetric energy value, i.e., zero. In our time-periodic setting, another chiral-symmetric quasienergy value exists at half the driving frequency, which is not occupied by a bulk band and could then host chiral-symmetry-protected edge modes ($\pi$ modes). Finally, we verify the robustness of all edge modes against spatial disorder and briefly discuss the prospect of realizing our system in experiments.</description>

      <title>Reflections of topological properties in the planar-Hall response for semimetals carrying pseudospin-1 quantum numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigations of the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar-Hall and planar-thermal Hall configurations, involving three-dimensional nodal-point semimetals, by considering here nodes hosting pseudospin-1 quasiparticles. Such systems exemplify multifold semimetals, as they have three bands crossing at a nodal point. We derive the explicit expressions of the electric, thermoelectric, and thermal coefficients, when the nodes are subjected to the combined influence of an electric field (and/or temperature gradient) and a weak (i.e., nonquantizing) magnetic field. In order to have a complete description, we consider the effects of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment on an equal footing, both of which originate from the underlying topological features of the bandstructure. Going beyond our previous works, we determine the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, and chalk out the effects of internode-scatterings as well. Our theoretical explorations shed light on the mechanisms of transport in multifold semetals, which are being investigated in contemporary experiments.</description>

      <title>Signatures of higher order skyrmionic textures revealed by magnetic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order skyrmions and antiskyrmions are topologically protected spin textures with an integer topological charge other than $\pm 1$ and nucleate from topological point defects in regular Bloch walls, known as vertical Bloch lines. So far, they have only been observed using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. In this work, we show that higher-order spin textures coexisting in Co/Ni multilayers at room temperature can be visualized by high-resolution magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The experimental results are supported by micromagnetic simulations confirming that different spin objects give rise to distinct MFM contrast in full agreement to our observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate experimentally and theoretically the behavior of the confined dark exciton in an InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dot, under the application of an external magnetic field in Voigt configuration. We show that by varying the magnitude and direction of the external field one can accurately control the dark-exciton fine-structure splitting. In addition, we show that the dark-exciton spin state is approximately polarized along the cubic crystallographic directions [100] or equivalents. By comparing our experimental results with a model for the exchange and Zeeman interactions, we find the conditions for nullifying the fine-structure splitting between the two eigenstates of the dark exciton, thereby stopping its qubit precession.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dephasing-tolerant protocol for quantum sensing of transverse magnetic fields which exploits spin qudit sensors with embedded fault-tolerant (FT) quantum error correction. By exploiting longitudinal drives, the transverse field induces logical Rabi oscillations between encoded states, whose frequency is linear in the transverse field to be probed. Numerical simulations show that the present FT protocol enables the detection of very small fields, orders of magnitudes below the limit imposed by the coherence time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single nanoparticles are essential building blocks for next-generation quantum photonic technologies, however, scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies have remained largely out of reach. Here, we present a new electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model that exploits nanoscale dielectrophoretics to precisely print single colloidal quantum dots (QDs) with accuracies allowing for fully-additive nanoscale photonics integration. Using colossal-shelled QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this method overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic limitations, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and the first single-photon emission from printed QDs. This additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process offers a scalable, sustainable pathway for heterointegrating nanomaterials down to the single particle level.</description>

      <title>Optimal qubit-mediated quantum heat transfer via non-commuting operators and strong coupling effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer in quantum systems is a current topic of interest due to emerging quantum technologies that attempt to miniaturize engines and examine fundamental aspects of thermodynamics. In this work, we consider heat transfer between two thermal reservoirs in which a central spin degree of freedom mediates the process. Our objective is to identify the system-bath coupling operators that maximize heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling strengths. By employing a Markovian embedding method in the form of the reaction-coordinate mapping, we study numerically heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling energy and for general system-bath coupling operators between the baths and the central qubit system. We find a stark contrast in the conditions required for optimal heat transfer depending on whether the system is weakly or strongly coupled to the heat baths. In the weak-coupling regime, optimal heat transfer requires identical coupling operators that facilitate maximum sequential transport, resonant with the central qubit. In contrast, in the strong-coupling regime, non-commuting system-bath coupling operators between the hot and cold reservoirs are necessary to achieve optimal heat transfer. We further employ the Effective Hamiltonian theory and gain partial analytical insights on the observed phenomena. We discuss the limitations of this approximate method in capturing the behavior of the heat current for non-commuting coupling operators, calling for its future extensions to capture transport properties in systems with general interaction Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Controlled probing of Anderson localization and non-Hermitian skin effect via topolectrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson localization (AL) and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) are two distinct wavefunction-localization phenomena arising out of disorder and non-reciprocity, respectively. An integration of both in a single framework will provide a platform to study the interplay between the two. In this connection, we consider the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model, which has garnered significant attention among the disordered models due to its self-dual properties. Hence, we investigate a non-reciprocal AA model with complex phase modulation and implement it in suitably designed topolectrical circuits featuring an interface, segregating two non-equivalent circuit networks. In the circuit, the voltage profile localizes at the interface due to the NHSE, while the AL limits localization phenomena within the vicinity of the excitation node. This competing phenomenon leads to a controllable, node-dependent localization or even partial delocalization of the output voltage. Our results not only provide a practical platform for experimentally studying and controlling the wave localization phenomenon but also highlight the potential of circuit architectures in designing highly sensitive sensors and information transfer in communication devices.</description>

      <title>Meson-polariton and string dynamics via cavity coupling in Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the real time meson and string dynamics of one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays in presence of a collective cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. Single domain walls on top of ordered states behave differently from those found in Ising models, featuring strong anisotropy because of the $U(1)$ invariant coupling between light and matter. The non-local nature of the cavity mode is instead affecting meson and string dynamics drastically. Meson hybridizes coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polariton excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy and propagate freely thanks to the non-local interaction between the underlying domain-walls mediated by the cavity mode. We conclude by examining the effect of cavity losses, proposing a state-preparation protocol which actively uses the cavity mode, and presenting a concrete experimental blueprint.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of BIC generation via single-photon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits. The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics in non-ideal cases, which turn out to be optimal for the BIC generation strategy.</description>

      <title>Reducing disorder in PbTe nanowires for Majorana research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Material challenges are the key issue in Majorana research where surface disorder constrains device performance. Here, we tackle this challenge by embedding PbTe nanowires within a lattice-constant-matched crystal. The wire edges are shaped by self-organized growth instead of lithography, resulting in nearly-atomic-flat facets along both cross-sectional and longitudinal directions. Quantized conductance is observed at zero magnetic field with channel lengths maximally reaching 1.7 $\mu$m, significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art of III-V nanowires (an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to InSb). Coupling PbTe to a Pb film unveils a flat interface spanning microns and a large superconducting gap of 1 meV. Our result not only represents a stride toward meeting the stringent low-disorder requirement for Majoranas, but may also open the door to various hybrid quantum devices requiring a low level of disorder.</description>

Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional electron gas interacting with a quantized cavity mode. We find that the coupling between the electrons and the photons in the cavity enhances the superconducting gap. Crucially, all terms in the Peierls phase are kept, in contrast to more naive approaches, which may result in spurious superradiant phase transitions. We use a mean-field theory to show that the gap increases approximately linearly with the cavity coupling strength. The effect can be observed locally as an increase in the gap size via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements for a flake of a 2D material (or for a Moir\'e system where the enhancement is expected to be more pronounced due to a large lattice constant) interacting with a locally-structured electromagnetic field formed by split-ring resonators. Our results are also relevant for quantum optics setups with cold atoms interacting with the cavity mode, where the lattice geometry and system parameters can be tuned in a vast range.</description>

      <title>Influence of surface relaxations on scanning probe microscopy images of the charge density wave material 2H-NbSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy is the method of choice for characterizing charge density waves by imaging the variation in atomic-scale contrast of the surface. Due to the measurement principle of scanning tunneling microscopy, the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom are convoluted, making it difficult to disentangle a structural displacement from spatial variations in the electronic structure. In this work, we characterize the influence of the displacement of the surface-terminating Se atoms on the 3 x 3 charge density wave contrast in scanning probe microscopy images of 2H-NbSe$_2$. In scanning tunneling microscopy images, we observe the 3 x 3 charge density wave superstructure and atomic lattice at all probed tip-sample distances. In contrast, non-contact atomic force microscopy images show both periodicities only at small tip-sample distances while, unexpectedly, a 3 x 3 superstructure is present at larger tip-sample distances. Using density functional theory calculations, we qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings and indicate that the 3 x 3 superstructure at different tip-sample distances in non-contact atomic force microscopy images is a result from different underlying interactions. In addition, we show that the displacement of the surface-terminating Se atoms has a negligible influence to the contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy images. Our combined experimental and theoretic work presents a method on how to discriminate the influence of the surface corrugation from the variation of the charge density to the charge density wave contrast in scanning probe microscopy images, which can provide insights into the influence of structural disorder to a charge density wave ground state.</description>

      <title>Non-Majorana-origin of the half-integer conductance quantization elucidated by multi-terminal superconductor-quantum anomalous Hall insulator heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral one-dimensional transport can be realized in thin films of a surface-insulating ferromagnetic topological insulator called quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). When superconducting (SC) pairing correlations are induced in the surface of such a material by putting an $s$-wave superconductor on the top, the resulting topological superconductivity gives rise to chiral Majorana edge-modes. A quantized two-terminal conductance of $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$ was proposed as a smoking-gun evidence for the topological SC phase associated with a single chiral Majorana edge-mode. There have been experiments to address this proposal, but the conclusion remains unclear. Here, we formulate the edge transport in a multi-terminal superconductor-QAHI heterostructure using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Compared to the original proposal for the $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$-quantization based on a simple two-terminal model, our formalism allows for deeper understanding of the origin of the quantization. The analysis of our experiments on multi-terminal devices unambiguously shows that the half-integer conductance quantization arises from the equilibration of the potentials of the incoming edge states at the SC electrode, and hence it is not of Majorana origin.</description>

      <title>Vision transformer based Deep Learning of Topological indicators in Majorana Nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 1D superconductor-semiconductor nanowires are leading candidates for topological quantum computation due to their ability to host Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, standard methods for identifying MZMs are often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many properties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial disorder induced Andreev bound states. Recent works clearly indicate the need for developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this study, we utilize a Vision Transformer-based neural network to predict using tunnel conductance measurements, both whether a device manifests a topological MZMs phase, and also to map out the entire topological phase diagram. We show the ability of our method up to arbitrary confidence ($P&gt;0.9998$) classify a device as possessing a non-trivial MZM-carrying topological phase for a wide variety of disorder parameters. Further, within these regimes we demonstrate an ability to predict from conductance measurements alternative (to the extensively used scattering-matrix-invariant topological indicator) Majorana indicators based on local density of states (LDOS). This work serves as a significant advance offering a step towards the practical realization of Majorana-based quantum devices, enabling a deep-learning understanding of the topological properties in disordered nanowire systems. We validate our method using extensive simulated Majorana results in the presence of disorder, and suggest using this technique for the analysis of experimental data in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Majorana platforms.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect in Centrosymmetric and Noncentrosymmetric Systems: Insights from Bilayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both intrinsic and extrinsic orbital Hall effects (OHE) in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are investigated in the presence of short-range disorder using quantum kinetic theory. Bilayer TMDs provide an ideal platform to study the effects of inversion symmetry breaking on transport properties due to their unique structural and electronic characteristics. While bilayer TMDs are naturally inversion symmetric, applying a finite gate voltage to create a bias between the layers effectively breaks this symmetry. Our findings reveal that slightly away from the band edges, the extrinsic OHE becomes the dominant contribution in both inversion-symmetric and asymmetric cases, with its prominence increasing significantly as the Fermi energy rises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that breaking inversion symmetry greatly enhances the extrinsic OHE. This enhancement arises from the fundamentally distinct behavior of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in centrosymmetric systems, where intraband components vanish due to symmetry constraints. As a result, in centrosymmetric systems, only the off-diagonal components of the density matrix contribute to the extrinsic OHE. In contrast, in noncentrosymmetric systems, both diagonal and off-diagonal components play a role. Our study suggests that in experimentally relevant, highly doped systems, the OHE is predominantly extrinsic in nature, regardless of whether the system is centrosymmetric or noncentrosymmetric. Importantly, we infer that even a weakly breaking of inversion symmetry can lead to a dramatic enhancement of the OHE, a finding with significant implications for experimental investigations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Aleppo spin ice geometry, another variation of decimated square ice patterns, which in contrast to similar systems previously studied, does not exhibit vertex frustration. Using synchrotron-based photoemission electron microscopy, we directly visualize low-energy states achieved after thermal annealing, in addition to temperature-dependent moment fluctuations. The results reveal the observation of ground state patterns and the absence of ergodicity-breaking dynamics. Our observations further confirm vertex frustration to be an important criterion for the emergence of ergodicity transitions.</description>

      <title>Origins of suppressed self-diffusion of nanoscale constituents of a complex liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to uncover their dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. We find the wavevector-dependent fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the colloidal phase and relative to observations of densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase, which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Using coarse-grained simulations, we find that the extracted shape and strength of the interparticle potential explains the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in complex fluids and other nanoscale soft matter, such as densely packed proteins and non-equilibrium self-assembly processes, in addition to designing microscopic strategies to avert gelation.</description>

      <title>Photonic "hourglass" design beyond the standard bulk model of phonon decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of mechanical vibrations on the performance of the photonic "hourglass" structure, which is predicted to emit single photons on-demand with near-unity efficiency and indistinguishability. Previous investigations neglected the impact of vibrational modes inherent to this quasi-1D geometry, relying instead on a three-dimensional bulk assumption for the phonon modes. However, it has been shown that phonon decoherence has a much stronger impact in 1D structures as compared with bulk media. Here, we surprisingly demonstrate the robustness of the photonic hourglass design, achieving close-to-unity indistinguishability even by incorporating a detailed description of the vibrational modes. We explain this unexpected result in terms of the large Purcell enhancement of the hourglass single-photon source, which eliminates the negative effect of phonons. Our findings highlight the key role of high-Q optical cavities in mitigating the detrimental effect of phonon decoherence, even for structures of reduced dimensionality.</description>

Abstract: The ferroelectric domain structure of a freestanding BiFeO$_3$ film was visualized by ptychographic dichroic imaging with linearly polarized X-rays at the O K-edge around 530 eV. The dichroic contrast is maximized at the energy of the hybridization of the O 2p state and the Fe 3d orbitals, which is split by the octahedral crystal field of the perovskite structure. The microscopy images thus obtained complement the ptychographic imaging of the antiferromagnetic contribution at the Fe L$_3$-edge. The approach can be extended to the separation of different ferroic contributions in other multiferroic oxides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental aspect of physics of ferroelectric materials is the screening of uncompensated bound charges by the dissociative adsorption of ionic charges from the environment. The adsorption of ions can be especially strong when the ferroelectric undergoes the temperature-induced transition from the paraelectric phase to the ferroelectric state. Here we demonstrate that the adsorption of ions and free radicals by the polar surface of ferroelectric nanoparticles can be very efficient in aqueous solutions due to the strong ferro-ionic coupling in the nanoparticles. Obtained results can be useful for the elaboration of alternative methods and tools for adsorption of the cations (Li+, K+, Na+, etc.), anions (Cl-, Br-, J-), and/or free radicals (CO-, NH4+, etc.) from aqueous solutions by the lead-free uniaxial ferroelectric nanoparticles. The results may become an alternative way for the environment-friendly laboratory-scale purification of different aqueous solutions from ionic contamination using controllable cyclic temperature variations.</description>

Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>A bosonic matrix product state description of Read-Rezayi states and its application to quasi-hole spins</title>

Abstract: We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Magnetoroton and Chiral Graviton Modes of Fractional Chern Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00247</link>

Abstract: Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model with hard-core bosons. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor, acquire a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. The sharper and more concentrated spectral weight of the roton mode is observed when approaching the FCI-CDW transition while the single-particle gap remains intact. We also resolve the graviton mode around $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone by measuring the dynamic quadrupolar density correlations. Interestingly, we not only reveal the graviton response is chiral for a certain FCI, but also show the different chiralities of the graviton of opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time. Our results offer the clear spectral observations of magnetoroton and chiral graviton in a lattice model of FCI and will have relevance towards the on-going experiments of tunable FCIs in quantum moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention for Adaptive Dynamics in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to modifying Transformer architectures by integrating graph-aware relational reasoning into the attention mechanism, merging concepts from graph neural networks and language modeling. Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.</description>
