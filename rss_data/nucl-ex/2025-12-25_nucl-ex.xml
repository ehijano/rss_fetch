      <title>Isoscalar Giant Resonances in Highly-Deformed $^{172}$Yb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the isoscalar giant resonances in a deformed case, background-free $\alpha$-particle inelastic scattering measurements using a 386 MeV $\alpha$ beam were performed on the highly-deformed $^{172}$Yb nucleus using the Grand Raiden spectrometer at the Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP) at very forward angles, including $0^\circ$. The strength distributions for the isoscalar giant resonances up to $L \leq 3$ were obtained using multipole decomposition analysis. The isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) strength exhibits a splitting into two components, interpreted as the coupling of the ISGMR with the $K=0$ component of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance (ISGQR). A \textit{bimodal} structure is observed in the strength distribution of the isoscalar giant dipole resonance. The ISGQR strength shows an enhancement near 25 MeV, attributed to the excitation of an overtone mode, while the broadening of the main-tone peak is associated with nuclear deformation. The experimental results are well reproduced by theoretical strength distributions calculated using the quasiparticle finite amplitude method for $L \leq 3$.</description>

      <title>Study of SIDIS Unpolarized Cross Sections from a $^3$He Target with the Solenoidal Large Intensity Device at JLab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a detailed impact study of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering unpolarized cross sections' measurements using the proposed SoLID apparatus at Jefferson Lab. This type of data, collected at large Bjorken $x_{bj}$, moderate values of $Q^2$ and small values of the transverse momentum of produced hadrons, $P_{hT}$, allows to study transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution and fragmentation functions in a still poorly explored region. We present the projected results for charged light mesons based on simulated data. For the azimuthal-angle integrated cross sections we adopt the TMD framework up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (N3LL) accuracy, while a simpler TMD parton model is employed for the study of azimuthal angular dependencies.</description>

      <title>Electron spectral shape of the third-forbidden $\beta$-decay of $^{87}$Rb measured using a Rb$_2$ZrCl$_6$ crystal scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, interest in experimental studies of $\beta$-decay electron spectra -- often referred to as $\beta$ spectra -- has been growing. This is particularly true for $\beta$ transitions where the electron spectra are sensitive to the effective value of the weak axial coupling, $g_{\rm A}$. Such measurements serve as important benchmarks for nuclear physics calculations and can also be used to characterize background in astroparticle physics experiments. In this work, a dedicated experiment has been carried out to investigate the spectral shape of the third-forbidden $^{87}$Rb $\beta$-decays, with the goal of estimating the effective $g_{\rm A}$ value for this transition and of deriving the T$_{1/2}$ value. This was done by comparing the experimental spectral shape with the estimates from various phenomenological models. The $^{87}$Rb source was embedded directly within the detector material of a new Rb$_2$ZrCl$_6$ crystal scintillator; the data taking was performed deep underground at Gran Sasso National Laboratory. The obtained experimental half-life value for the studied process is T$_{1/2} = 5.08(13) \times$ 10$^{10}$ yr; while a $g_{\rm A}$ value in the range 0.4 to 0.6 is obtained when accounting for uncertainties and depending on the model adopted as discussed in detail in the text.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of neutron-rich carbon isotopes on light targets at 27.5 MeV/nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental and theoretical investigation of the fragmentation reaction in Fermi-energy domain is currently of particular importance for not only the nuclear physics but also some interdisciplinary fields. In the present work, neutron-rich $^{14}$C and $^{16}$C ion beams at 27.5 MeV/nucleon were used to bombard carbon and polyethylene (CD$_{2}$)$_{n}$ targets. Energy and angular distributions of the produced fragments were measured. Background events originating from the carbon content in (CD$_{2}$)$_{n}$ target were efficiently excluded using an extended $E-P$ plot method. Experimental results are systematically analyzed by using HIPSE-SIMON dynamic model. The comparison reveals that, for the carbon target, the HIPSE-SIMON calculation overestimates the yields of the beam-velocity component for fragments near the projectile and also the energy phase space for fragments far away from the projectile, suggesting fine tuning of the overall interaction profile adopted in the model. In contrast, for reactions with the deuteron target, the model calculation can reasonably reproduce the experimental data. The implication of the fragmentation mechanism to the validity of the invariant mass method, as frequently used to reconstruct the clustering resonant structures in light nuclei, is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Calibration of an Irradiated Prototype for the EIC Zero-Degree Calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the response of a prototype Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) detector to irradiation equivalent to 10$^{11}$ 1-MeV protons/cm$^2$, which matches the expected exposure after one year of operation at full nominal luminosity at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The prototype consists of 563 channels and represents about 10 percent of the final ZDC design in terms of both channel count and detector volume. It was irradiated at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) with a dose equivalent to 10$^{11}$ protons/cm$^2$. We demonstrate that, despite significant radiation damage to the SiPMs and non-uniform degradation across the detector volume, the detector can be successfully calibrated on a channel-by-channel basis using cosmic-ray data. The damage profile, similar to what is expected in the experiment, varies by an order of magnitude or more across the detector. Even for the most heavily damaged channels, the signal-to-noise ratio for a MIP signal remains above 5. This study provides a realistic test of the system's performance under irradiation. It complements previous SiPM-specific irradiation studies and will inform the future operation of the ZDC and other detectors that use SiPM-on-tile technology.</description>

      <title>Connected and disconnected contributions to nucleon form factors and parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of generalized parton distribution, we provide a unified interpretation of the connected and disconnected contributions from the ab-initio Euclidean path-integral formulation of the hadronic tensor in both the nucleon elastic form factors and the parton distribution functions. We develop a phenomenology to elucidate non-perturbative contributions to deep inelastic structure functions, which can be extended to observables in heavy-ion collisions probing baryon junctions.</description>

      <title>Supernova Pointing Capabilities of DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of the direction of a stellar core collapse via its neutrino emission is crucial for the identification of the progenitor for a multimessenger follow-up. A highly effective method of reconstructing supernova directions within the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is introduced. The supernova neutrino pointing resolution is studied by simulating and reconstructing electron-neutrino charged-current absorption on 40Ar and elastic scattering of neutrinos on electrons. Procedures to reconstruct individual interactions, including a newly developed technique called ``brems flipping'', as well as the burst direction from an ensemble of interactions are described. Performance of the burst direction reconstruction is evaluated for supernovae happening at a distance of 10 kpc for a specific supernova burst flux model. The pointing resolution is found to be 3.4 degrees at 68% coverage for a perfect interaction-channel classification and a fiducial mass of 40 kton, and 6.6 degrees for a 10 kton fiducial mass respectively. Assuming a 4% rate of charged-current interactions being misidentified as elastic scattering, DUNE's burst pointing resolution is found to be 4.3 degrees (8.7 degrees) at 68% coverage.</description>

      <title>Dynamic scaling and quenching for heavy quark in the linear expanding medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that scaling is a good approximation for the energy loss of the heavy quark propagating through linear expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the effective quenching parameter does not depend on quark mass.</description>
