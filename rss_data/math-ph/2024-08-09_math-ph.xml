      <title>A Higher Spin Statistics Theorem for Invertible Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every unitary invertible quantum field theory satisfies a generalization of the famous spin statistics theorem. To formulate this extension, we define a `higher spin' action of the stable orthogonal group $O$ on appropriate spacetime manifolds, which extends both the reflection involution and spin flip. On the algebraic side, we define a `higher statistics' action of $O$ on the universal target for invertible field theories, $I\mathbb{Z}$, which extends both complex conjugation and fermion parity $(-1)^F$. We prove that every unitary invertible quantum field theory intertwines these actions.</description>

      <title>Quantum integrable system associated with the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum integrable system associated with the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra is studied. By using the fusion technique, we obtain the closed recursive relations among the fused transfer matrices. Based on the polynomial analysis, we obtain the exact energy spectrum and the associated Bethe ansatz equations of the system. Both the periodic and the non-diagonal open boundary conditions are studied in a unified way. For the later case, we also obtain the crossing symmetries of the transfer matrix and the fused ones.</description>

      <title>Fiber decomposition of non-commutative harmonic oscillators by 2p-quantum Rabi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-commutative harmonic oscillators (NcHO) and 2p-quantum Rabi models (2pQRM) are extensions of harmonic oscillators. The purpose of this paper is to give a relationship between NcHO and 2pQRM, and the fiber decomposition of NcHO by 2pQRM is shown. We also construct Feynman-Kac formulas of NcHO and 2pQRM It is then considered the asymptotic behaviors of the spectral zeta function of 2pQRM.</description>

      <title>Absence of Normal Heat Conduction in Strongly Disordered Interacting Quantum Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that in strongly disordered, interacting, quantum chains, the conductance of a chain of length $L$ vanishes faster than $1/L$. This means that transport is anomalous in such chains. This phenomenon was first claimed in \cite{Basko2006,gornyi2005interacting} and a pioneering treatment appeared in \cite{Imbrie2016a}</description>

      <title>On the incompleteness of the classification of quadratically integrable Hamiltonian systems in the three-dimensional Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an example of an integrable Hamiltonian system with scalar potential in the three-dimensional Euclidean space whose integrals of motion are quadratic polynomials in the momenta, yet its Hamilton-Jacobi / Schrodinger equation cannot separate in any orthogonal coordinate system. This demonstrates a loophole in the derivation of the list of quadratically integrable Hamiltonian systems in [Makarov et al., A systematic search for nonrelativistic systems with dynamical symmetries. Nuovo Cimento A Series 10, 52:1061-1084, 1967] where only separable systems were found, and the need for its revision.</description>

      <title>Local Central Limit Theorem for unbounded long-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the equivalence between the integral central limit theorem and the local central limit theorem for two-body potentials with long-range interactions on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\ge 1$. The spin space can be an arbitrary, possibly unbounded subset of the real axis with a suitable a-priori measure. For general unbounded spins, our method works at high-enough temperature, but for bounded spins our results hold for every temperature. Our proof relies on the control of the integrated characteristic function, which is achieved by dividing the integration into three different regions, following a standard approach proposed forty years ago by Campanino, Del Grosso and Tirozzi. The bounds required in the different regions are obtained through cluster-expansion techniques. For bounded spins, the arbitrariness of the temperature is achieved through a decimation ("dilution") technique, also introduced in the later reference.</description>

      <title>Berry Phases in the Bosonization of Nonlinear Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider chiral, generally nonlinear density waves in one dimension, modelling the bosonized edge modes of a two-dimensional fermionic topological insulator. Using the coincidence between bosonization and Lie-Poisson dynamics on an affine U(1) group, we show that wave profiles which are periodic in time produce Berry phases accumulated by the underlying fermionic field. These phases can be evaluated in closed form for any Hamiltonian, and they serve as a diagnostic of nonlinearity. As an explicit example, we discuss the Korteweg-de Vries equation, viewed as a model of nonlinear quantum Hall edge modes.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Kitaev's honeycomb model from braided fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusion surface models, as introduced by Inamura and Ohmori, extend the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, taking fusion 2-categories as their input. In this work, we construct and analyze fusion surface models on the honeycomb lattice built from braided fusion 1-categories. These models preserve mutually commuting plaquette operators and anomalous 1-form symmetries. Their Hamiltonian is chosen to mimic the structure of Kitaev's honeycomb model, which is unitarily equivalent to the Ising fusion surface model. In the anisotropic limit, where one coupling constant is dominant, the fusion surface models reduce to Levin-Wen string-nets. In the isotropic limit, they are described by weakly coupled anyon chains and are likely to realize chiral topological order. We focus on three specific examples: (i) Kitaev's honeycomb model with a perturbation breaking time-reversal symmetry that realizes chiral Ising topological order, (ii) a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalization proposed by Barkeshli et al., which potentially realizes chiral parafermion topological order, and (iii) a novel Fibonacci honeycomb model featuring a non-invertible 1-form symmetry.</description>

      <title>Contact angle hysteresis and static friction for 2-dimensional droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact angle hysteresis of droplets will be examined in light of static friction between liquid drop and solid surface. Unlike frictions in solid-solid interfaces, pinning forces at contact points (2D) or contact lines (3D) would be the cause of friction. We will define coefficients of static friction and relate them with advancing and receding contact angles for the case of 2-dimensional droplets. In our work sessile drops in an inclined plane, and pendent drops in a slanted ceiling will all be analyzed within a single framework with the inclination angle as a free parameter. We can then visualize the gradual change of shapes of a droplet put on a plane as the inclination angle changes adiabatically to make a complete turn. We also point out that there could be two distinct stable configurations of pendent droplets for the same physical conditions, i.e. the bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Weyl-Einsteinian-Cubic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a Weyl-gauging of strongly coupled Einsteinian-Cubic gravity (ECG) in Weyl's geometry via upgraded Weyl's curvature tensors, which include abelian gauge fields, and properly tuned compensating real scalar fields. The model is free from any dimensionful parameters. The bare ECG emerges as the lower energy limit of the Weyl-ECG in the local non-conformal-invariant vacua (i.e., broken phase) in the maximally symmetric spacetimes fixing the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field to the Planck mass scale. Here, the natural presence of (anti-) de Sitter backgrounds spontaneously breaks Weyl's local conformal symmetry akin to the Higgs mechanism, while it is radiatively broken at the renormalization scale at the one-loop level in flat vacua through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The model allows anti-de Sitter and flat spaces but does not allow de Sitter to be vacuum spacetime solutions. The properties of the model deserve further exploration, specifically, those of nonperturbative (e.g., instantons and/or anti-instantons) contributions, for example, in the resurgence or tachyon condensation context requires detailed study.</description>

      <title>Adelic and Rational Grassmannians for finite dimensional algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Wilson's adelic Grassmannian ${\mathrm{Gr}}^{\mathrm{ad}}(R)$ and Segal-Wilson's rational Grasssmannian ${\mathrm{Gr}}^ {\mathrm{rat}}(R)$ associated to an arbitrary finite dimensional complex algebra $R$. We provide several equivalent descriptions of the former in terms of the indecomposable projective modules of $R$ and its primitive idempotents, and prove that it classifies the bispectral Darboux transformations of the $R$-valued exponential function. The rational Grasssmannian $ {\mathrm{Gr}}^{\mathrm{rat}}(R)$ is defined by using certain free submodules of $R(z)$ and it is proved that it can be alternatively defined via Wilson type conditions imposed in a representation theoretic settings. A canonical embedding ${\mathrm{Gr}}^{\mathrm{ad}}(R) \hookrightarrow {\mathrm{Gr}}^{\mathrm{rat}}(R)$ is constructed based on a perfect pairing between the $R$-bimodule of quasiexponentials with values in $R$ and the $R$-bimodule $R[z]$.</description>

      <title>Constrained volume-difference percolation model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a percolation model with restrictions on the opening of sites on the square lattice. In this model, each site $s \in \mathbb{Z}^{2}$ starts closed and an attempt to open it occurs at time $t=t_s$, where $(t_s)_{s \in \mathbb{Z}^2}$ is a sequence of independent random variables uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$. The site will open if the volume difference between the two largest clusters adjacent to it is greater than or equal to a constant $r$ or if it has at most one adjacent cluster. Through numerical analysis, we determine the critical threshold $t_c(r)$ for various values of $r$, verifying that $t_c(r)$ is non-decreasing in $r$ and that there exists a critical value $r_c=5$ beyond which percolation does not occur. Additionally, when $t=1$ and $1 \leq r \leq 9$, we estimate the averages of the density of open sites, the number of distinct cluster volumes, and the volume of the largest cluster.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and large deviations for the linear statistics of the one-dimensional trapped Riesz gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical trapped Riesz gas, i.e., $N$ particles at positions $x_i$ in one dimension with a repulsive power law interacting potential $\propto 1/|x_i-x_j|^{k}$, with $k&gt;-2$, in an external confining potential of the form $V(x) \sim |x|^n$. We focus on the equilibrium Gibbs state of the gas, for which the density has a finite support $[-\ell_0/2,\ell_0/2]$. We study the fluctuations of the linear statistics ${\cal L}_N = \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)$ in the large $N$ limit for smooth functions $f(x)$. We obtain analytic formulae for the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ for general $k&gt;-2$. For long range interactions, i.e. $k&lt;1$, which include the log-gas ($k \to 0$) and the Coulomb gas ($k =-1$) these are obtained for monomials $f(x)= |x|^m$. For short range interactions, i.e. $k&gt;1$, which include the Calogero-Moser model, i.e. $k=2$, we compute the third cumulant of ${\cal L}_N$ for general $f(x)$ and arbitrary cumulants for monomials $f(x)= |x|^m$. We also obtain the large deviation form of the probability distribution of ${\cal L}_N$, which exhibits an "evaporation transition" where the fluctuation of ${\cal L}_N$ is dominated by the one of the largest $x_i$. In addition, in the short range case, we extend our results to a (non-smooth) indicator function $f(x)$, obtaining thereby the higher order cumulants for the full counting statistics of the number of particles in an interval $[-L/2,L/2]$. We show in particular that they exhibit an interesting scaling form as $L/2$ approaches the edge of the gas $L/\ell_0 \to 1$, which we relate to the large deviations of the emptiness probability of the complementary interval on the real line.</description>

      <title>Edge modes of topologically ordered systems as emergent integrable flows: Robustness of algebraic structures in nonlinear quantum fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these decades, it has been gradually established that edge modes of a wide class of topologically ordered systems are governed by the bulk-edge correspondence and anyon condensation. The former has been studied many times because it can be summarized as the correspondence between conformal field theory and topological quantum field theory, but the latter has captured attention more recently because it suggests that one can deform the theories from one to another condensable or Witt equivalent. We reinterpret this phenomenon as the appearance of integrable flow at the edges of a topologically ordered system. By revisiting the existing phenomena from this view, one can relate the anyon condensation to the existing formalism of integrable models and their renormalization group flow. Moreover, we observe the robustness of the bulk-edge correspondence even under the existence of irrelevant perturbations at the edges. This formulation can enable one to analyze edge modes at the level of quantum fluid (non-linear) dynamics, or mixed state topological order even in non-Hermitian systems. Moreover, especially in the study of a class of non-Hermitian systems, we show a fundamental necessity to revisit Rogers-Ramanujan type identities as an appearance of the hidden (fractional) supersymmetric model which has a close relation to string field theories. Our view can give a unified paradigm to study edge modes of topologically ordered systems at the level of their dynamics potentially in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>How to escape atypical regions in the symmetric binary perceptron: a journey through connected-solutions states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the binary symmetric perceptron model, and in particular its atypical solutions. While the solution-space of this problem is dominated by isolated configurations~\cite{aubin2019storage}, it is also solvable for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. We provide in this paper a statistical measure probing sequences of solutions, where two consecutive elements shares a strong overlap. After simplifications, we test its predictions by comparing it to Monte-Carlo simulations. We obtain good agreement and show that connected states with a Markovian correlation profile can fully decorrelate from their initialization only for $\kappa&gt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$ ($\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}\sim \sqrt{0.91\log(N)}$ for $\alpha=0.5$ and $N$ being the dimension of the problem). For $\kappa&lt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$, we show that decorrelated sequences still exist but have a non-trivial correlations profile. To study this regime we introduce an $Ansatz$ for the correlations that we label as the nested Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Diffusive hydrodynamics from long-range correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the hydrodynamic theory, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system is approximated, at large scales of space and time, by irreversible relaxation to local entropy maximisation. This results in a convective equation corrected by viscous or diffusive terms in a gradient expansion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Diffusive terms are evaluated using the Kubo formula, and possibly arising from an emergent noise due to discarded microscopic degrees of freedom. In one dimension of space, diffusive scaling is often broken as noise leads to super-diffusion. But in linearly degenerate hydrodynamics, such as that of integrable models, diffusive behaviors are observed, and it has long be thought that the standard diffusive picture remains valid. In this letter, we show that in such systems, the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down beyond linear response. We demonstrate that diffusive-order corrections do not take the form of a gradient expansion. Instead, they are completely determined by ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations, and obtained from the non-local two-point correlations recently predicted by the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory (BMFT); the resulting hydrodynamic equations are reversible. To do so, we establish a regularised fluctuation theory, putting on a firm basis the recent idea that ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations determines fluctuations and correlations beyond the Euler scale. This extends the idea of "diffusion from convection" previously developed to explain the Kubo formula in integrable systems, to generic non-equilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy of the low density Bose gas with two-body and three-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we study the low density Bose gas in the thermodynamic limit interacting via two-body and three-body interaction potentials. We prove that the leading order of the ground state energy is entirely characterised by both the scattering length of the two-body potential and the scattering energy of the three-body potential. The corresponding result for two-body interactions was proven in seminal papers of Dyson (1957) and of Lieb-Yngvason (1998), and the result for three-body interactions was proven by Nam-Ricaud-Triay. The present result resolves a conjecture of Nam-Ricaud-Triay.</description>

      <title>Point potentials on Euclidean space, hyperbolic space and sphere in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dimensions d= 1, 2, 3 the Laplacian can be perturbed by a point potential. In higher dimensions the Laplacian with a point potential cannot be defined as a self-adjoint operator. However, for any dimension there exists a natural family of functions that can be interpreted as Green's functions of the Laplacian with a spherically symmetric point potential. In dimensions 1, 2, 3 they are the integral kernels of the resolvent of well-defined self-adjoint operators. In higher dimensions they are not even integral kernels of bounded operators. Their construction uses the so-called generalized integral, a concept going back to Riesz and Hadamard.
  We consider the Laplace(-Beltrami) operator on the Euclidean space, the hyperbolic space and the sphere in any dimension. We describe the corresponding Green's functions, also perturbed by a point potential. We describe their limit as the scaled hyperbolic space and the scaled sphere approach the Euclidean space. Especially interesting is the behavior of positive eigenvalues of the spherical Laplacian, which undergo a shift proportional to a negative power of the radius of the sphere.
  We expect that in any dimension our constructions yield possible behaviors of the integral kernel of the resolvent of a perturbed Laplacian far from the support of the perturbation. Besides, they can be viewed as toy models illustrating various aspects of renormalization in Quantum Field Theory, especially the point-splitting method and dimensional regularization.</description>

      <title>A conformal approach to the stability of Einstein spaces with spatial sections of negative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.08919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, it is shown how the extended conformal Einstein field equations and a gauge based on the properties of conformal geodesics can be used to analyse the non-linear stability of de Sitter-like spacetimes with spatial sections of negative scalar curvature. This class of spacetimes admits a smooth conformal extension with a space-like conformal boundary. Central to the analysis is the use of conformal Gaussian systems to obtain a hyperbolic reduction of the conformal Einstein field equations for which standard Cauchy stability results for symmetric hyperbolic systems can be employed. The use of conformal methods allows us to rephrase the question of the global existence of solutions to the Einstein field equations into considerations of finite existence time for the conformal evolution system.</description>

      <title>From logarithmic delocalization of the six-vertex height function under sloped boundary conditions to weakened crossing probability estimates for the Ashkin-Teller, generalized random-cluster, and $(q_{\sigma},q_{\tau})$-cubic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To obtain Russo-Seymour-Welsh estimates for the height function of the six-vertex model under sloped boundary conditions, which can be leveraged to demonstrate that the height function logarithmically delocalizes under a broader class of boundary conditions, we formulate crossing probability estimates in strips of the square lattice and the cylinder, for parameters satisfying $a\equiv b$, $c \in [1,2]$, and $\mathrm{max} \{ a , b \} \leq c$, in which each of the first two conditions respectively relate to invariance under vertical and diagonal reflections enforced through the symmetry $\sigma \xi \geq -\xi$ for domains in strips of the square lattice, and satisfaction of FKG, for the height function and for its absolute value. To determine whether arguments for estimating crossing probabilities of the height function for flat boundary conditions from a recent work due to Duminil-Copin, Karila, Manolescu, and Oulamara remain applicable for sloped boundary conditions, from the set of possible slopes given by the interior of the set of rational points from $[-1,1] \times [-1,1]$, we analyze sloped Gibbs states, which do not have infinitely many disjointly oriented circuits. In comparison to Russo-Seymour-Welsh arguments for flat boundary conditions, arguments for sloped boundary conditions present additional complications for both planar and cylindrical settings, in which crossing events that are considered in the strip, and then extended to the annulus and cylinder, must be maintained across rectangles of large aspect ratio, in spite of the fact that some proportion of faces within the strip freeze with positive probability.</description>

      <title>An asymmetrical body: example of analytical solution for the rotation matrix in elementary functions and Dzhanibekov effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11518v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solved the Poisson equations, obtaining their exact solution in elementary functions for the rotation matrix of a free asymmetrical body with angular velocity vector lying on separatrices. This allows us to discuss the temporal evolution of Dzhanibekov's nut directly in the Laboratory system, where it is observed. The rotation matrix depends on two parameters with clear physical interpretation as a frequency and a damping factor of the solution. Qualitative analysis of the solution shows that it properly describes a single-jump Dzhanibekov effect.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Deformation of the Gaiotto-Rap\v{c}\'{a}k Corner VOA and the Associated Partially Symmetric Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno-Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family.</description>

      <title>On trilinear and quadrilinear equations associated with the lattice Gel'fand-Dikii hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduced in 2012, by Zhang, Zhao, and Nijhoff, the trilinear Boussinesq equation is the natural form of the equation for the $\tau$-function of the lattice Boussinesq system. In this paper we study various aspects of this equation: its highly nontrivial derivation from the bilinear lattice AKP equation under dimensional reduction, a quadrilinear dual lattice equation, conservation laws, and periodic reductions leading to higher-dimensional integrable maps and their Laurent property. Furthermore, we consider a higher Gel'fand-Dikii lattice system, its periodic reductions and Laurent property. As a special application, from both a trilinear Boussinesq recurrence as well as a higher Gel'fand-Dikii system of three bilinear recurrences, we establish Somos-like integer sequences.</description>
