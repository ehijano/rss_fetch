      <title>Cosmological information content of Betti curves and $k$-nearest neighbor distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the cosmological constraints that can be obtained from halo clustering on non-linear scales ($2 h^{-1}$ Mpc &lt; $r$ &lt; $50 h^{-1}$ Mpc) using Betti curves, a topological summary statistic, and $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) distributions. We quantify the information content of each summary statistic through Fisher matrices computed from the Quijote simulations. Due to the use of simulation-based Fisher forecasts, we pay careful attention to the convergence of the Fisher matrices by looking at their eigendecompositions. We find that, in general, only two directions in the parameter space have constraints that are well converged given the number of Quijote simulations available. We then compare the information content of each summary statistic in the reduced parameter space $\{\Omega_m, \sigma_8\}$. We find that almost all of the information present in the Betti curves comes from the first two, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, which track the number of connected components and one-dimensional loops respectively, and almost no constraining power comes from $\beta_2$ which tracks the number of topological voids. In comparison, we find that the $k$NNs provide very competitive constraints along with several potential advantages in regards to real data. Finally, we find that while the $k$NNs and Betti curves provide some complementary constraints, they are not fully independent, potentially indicating a connection between the two statistics.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Improved SN Ia colors through expanded dimensionality with SALT3+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are a key probe in modern cosmology, as they can be used to measure luminosity distances at gigaparsec scales. Models of their light-curves are used to project heterogeneous observed data onto a common basis for analysis. The SALT model currently used for SN Ia cosmology describes SNe as having two sources of variability, accounted for by a color parameter c, and a "stretch parameter" x1. We extend the model to include an additional parameter we label x2, to investigate the cosmological impact of currently unaddressed light-curve variability. We construct a new SALT model, which we dub "SALT3+". This model was trained by an improved version of the SALTshaker code, using training data combining a selection of the second data release of cosmological SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the existing SALT3 training compilation. We find additional, coherent variability in supernova light-curves beyond SALT3. Most of this variation can be described as phase-dependent variation in g-r and r-i color curves, correlated with a boost in the height of the secondary maximum in i-band. These behaviors correlate with spectral differences, particularly in line velocity. We find that fits with the existing SALT3 model tend to address this excess variation with the color parameter, leading to less informative measurements of supernova color. We find that neglecting the new parameter in light-curve fits leads to a trend in Hubble residuals with x2 of 0.039 +/- 0.005 mag, representing a potential systematic uncertainty. However, we find no evidence of a bias in current cosmological measurements. We conclude that extended SN Ia light-curve models promise mild improvement in the accuracy of color measurements, and corresponding cosmological precision. However, models with more parameters are unlikely to substantially affect current cosmological results.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Effects of a Small Primordial Black Hole Passing Through the Human Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational effects of a primordial black hole (PBH) passing through the human body are examined, with the goal of determining the minimum mass necessary to produce significant injury or death. Two effects are examined: the damage caused by a shock wave propagating outward from the black hole trajectory, and the dissociation of brain cells from tidal forces produced by the black hole on its passage through the human body. It is found that the former is the dominant effect, with a cutoff mass for serious injury or death of approximately $M_{PBH} &gt; 1.4 \times 10^{17} {\rm g}$. The number density of primordial black holes with a mass above this cutoff is far too small to produce any observable effects on the human population.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM and early dark energy in latent space: a data-driven parametrization of the CMB temperature power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the best parametrization for cosmological models in the absence of first-principle theories is an open question. We propose a data-driven parametrization of cosmological models given by the disentangled 'latent' representation of a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained to compress cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature power spectra. We consider a broad range of $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies with an additional early dark energy (EDE) component. We show that these spectra can be compressed into 5 ($\Lambda$CDM) or 8 (EDE) independent latent parameters, as expected when using temperature power spectra alone, and which reconstruct spectra at an accuracy well within the Planck errors. These latent parameters have a physical interpretation in terms of well-known features of the CMB temperature spectrum: these include the position, height and even-odd modulation of the acoustic peaks, as well as the gravitational lensing effect. The VAE also discovers one latent parameter which entirely isolates the EDE effects from those related to $\Lambda$CDM parameters, thus revealing a previously unknown degree of freedom in the CMB temperature power spectrum. We further showcase how to place constraints on the latent parameters using Planck data as typically done for cosmological parameters, obtaining latent values consistent with previous $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmological constraints. Our work demonstrates the potential of a data-driven reformulation of current beyond-$\Lambda$CDM phenomenological models into the independent degrees of freedom to which the data observables are sensitive.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Bursts Calibrated from the Observational $H(z)$ Data in Artificial Neural Network Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we calibrate the luminosity relation of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) framework for reconstructing the Hubble parameter \unboldmath{$H(z)$} from the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) obtained with the cosmic chronometers method in a cosmology-independent way. We consider the physical relationships between the data to introduce the covariance matrix and KL divergence of the data to construct the loss function and calibrate the Amati relation ($E_{\rm p}$--$E_{\rm iso}$) by selecting the optimal ANN model with the A219 sample and the J220 sample at low redshift. Combining the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with GRBs at high redshift in the Hubble diagram with Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method, we find that the $\Lambda$CDM model is preferred over the $w$CDM and CPL models with the joint constraints by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).</description>

      <title>CMB lensing tomography with clustering estimation of lens redshift distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a clustering-based redshift estimation approach for CMB lensing tomography, focusing on the kernel function of the lensing galaxies. Within a linear galaxy bias framework, we derive estimators for this kernel from two-point cross-correlations between lens mass and reference samples. The reconstructed kernel then enables a theoretical prediction for the angular cross-power spectrum \(C_{g\kappa}\) between CMB lensing convergence and lens galaxies. As a proof of concept, we measure \(C_{g\kappa}\) by correlating the \emph{Planck} PR4 convergence map with NVSS+SUMSS radio galaxies (\(0\lesssim z\lesssim 3\)). We estimate the radio-galaxy kernel by collectively cross-correlating their distribution with spectroscopic and photometric surveys (2MPZ, LOWZ-CMASS, eBOSS DR16 LRGs, and Gaia-unWISE QSOs). From the measured \(C_{g\kappa}\), we obtain \(\sigma_8 = 0.86^{+0.12}_{-0.09}\) when the density parameter is set to the {\it Planck} value of $\Omega_m = 0.315$; this is in good agreement with the \emph{Planck} normalisation of $\sigma_8 = 0.812$.</description>

      <title>The Power Spectrum of the Thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power spectrum of unresolved thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) clusters is extremely sensitive to the amplitude of the matter fluctuations. This paper present an analysis of the tSZ power spectrum using temperature power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) rather than maps of the Compton y-parameter. Our analysis is robust and insensitive to the cosmic infrared background. Using data from Planck, and higher resolution CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
  and the South Pole Telescope, we find strong evidence that the tSZ spectrum has a shallower slope and a much lower amplitude at multipoles l &gt; 2000$compared to the predictions of the FLAMINGO hydrodynamic simulations of the LCDM cosmology.
  Recent results on CMB lensing, cross-correlations of CMB lensing with galaxy surveys and full shape analysis of
  galaxies and quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument suggests that this discrepancy cannot be resolved by lowering the amplitude of the matter fluctuations. An alternative possibility is that the impact of baryonic feedback in the FLAMINGO simulations is underestimated.</description>

      <title>An overview of what current data can (and cannot yet) say about evolving dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and distance moduli from Type Ia supernovae suggest a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) scenarios characterized by a time-varying equation of state (EoS). This focused review assesses its robustness across independent measurements and surveys. Using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization to describe the evolution of the DE EoS, we analyze over 35 dataset combinations, incorporating Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, three independent Type Ia supernova (SN) catalogs (PantheonPlus, Union3, DESY5), BAO measurements from DESI and SDSS, and expansion rate measurements $H(z)$ inferred from the relative ages of massive, passively evolving galaxies at early cosmic times known as Cosmic Chronometers (CC). This review has two main objectives: first, to evaluate the statistical significance of the DDE preference across different dataset combinations, which incorporate varying sources of information. Specifically, we consider cases where only low-redshift probes are used in different combinations, others where individual low-redshift probes are analyzed together with CMB data, and finally, scenarios where high- and low-redshift probes are included in all possible independent combinations. Second, we provide a reader-friendly synthesis of what the latest cosmological and astrophysical probes can (and cannot yet) reveal about DDE. Overall, our findings highlight that combinations that \textit{simultaneously} include PantheonPlus SN and SDSS BAO significantly weaken the preference for DDE. However, intriguing hints supporting DDE emerge in combinations that do not include DESI-BAO measurements: SDSS-BAO combined with SN from Union3 and DESY5 (with and without CMB) support the preference for DDE.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonians to all Orders in Perturbation Theory and Higher Loop Corrections in Single Field Inflation with PBHs Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the action and the interaction Hamiltonians to all orders in perturbation theory in the model of single field inflation with a transient ultra slow-roll phase. Employing the formalism of EFT of inflation, we obtain a compact non-perturbative expression for the interaction Hamiltonian in terms of the Goldstone field $\pi$ in the decoupling limit. In addition, we also present a non-linear relation between $\pi$ and the curvature perturbations to all orders in perturbation theory. These are powerful results which enable us to calculate the cosmological correlators and loop corrections to any order in perturbation theory. As a non-trivial example, we calculate the $L$-loop corrections on long CMB scale perturbations in the USR models which are used for PBHs formation. We show that the loop corrections scale like $(\Delta N {\cal P}_e L) ^L$ in which ${\cal P}_e$ is the peak of the power spectrum and $\Delta N$ is the duration of the USR phase. This indicates that the loop corrections grow quickly out of perturbative control for large values of $L$. In the conventional USR setup for PBHs formation with $\Delta N \simeq 2.5$, this happens at $L=4$.</description>

      <title>Flipped Rotating Axion Non-minimally Coupled to Gravity: Baryogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the co-genesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be achieved through the rotation of an axion-like particle, driven by a flip in the vacuum manifold's direction at the end of inflation. This can occur if the axion has a periodic non-minimal coupling to gravity, while preserving the discrete shift symmetry. In non-oscillating inflation models, after inflation there is typically a period of kination (with $w = 1$). In this case, it is shown that the vacuum manifold of the axion is flipped and the axion begins rotating in field space, because it can slide across the decreasing potential barrier as in Ricci reheating. Such a rotating axion can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through spontaneous baryogenesis, while at later epochs it can oscillate as dark matter. The period of kination makes the primordial gravitational waves (GW) generated during inflation sharply blue-tilted which constrains the parameter space due to GW overproduction, while being testable by next generation CMB experiments. As a concrete example, we show that such a cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be realized for the axion as the Majoron in the Type-I seesaw setup, predicting mass ranges for the Majoron below sub eVs, with right-handed neutrino mass above $\mathcal{O}(10^{8})$ GeV. We also show that in order to avoid fragmentation of the axion condensate during the rotation, we require the non-minimal coupling \mbox{$\xi \sim (f/m_P)^2 $} or somewhat larger, where $f$ is the axion decay constant.</description>

      <title>$R_V$ from multi-waveband galaxy polarimetry in supernovae vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peculiar dust extinction laws have been reported for some type Ia supernovae (SNe) with the parameter $R_V$ much lower than the average value for the Milky Way (MW) of 3.1. Using optical photopolarimetry of supernova (SN) host galaxies, a few years after the explosion, we estimate $R_V$ in the vicinity of each SN and compare it with the extinction law calculated directly from SN observations. Multiband photopolarimetric data of nine galaxies, hosts of eleven SNe, acquired with VLT-FORS2 in IPOL mode, are used to map the polarization angle and the polarization degree in each galaxy. Data are processed with a custom-built reduction pipeline that corrects for instrumental, background, and MW interstellar polarization effects. The validity of Serkowski relations is tested at different locations in the galaxy to extract the wavelength of the maximum polarization {\lambda}max and obtain 2D maps for RV . When the fit to {\lambda}max at the SN location is poor, or impossible, an approximate Bayesian spatial inference method is employed to obtain an estimate of {\lambda}max using well-fitted neighboring locations. The estimated local $R_V$ for each SN is compared with published values from the SN light curves. We find $R_V$ values from optical photopolarimetry at SNe locations consistent with the average MW value and a median difference of &gt; 3{\sigma} with the low peculiar $R_V$ obtained from the analysis of some reddened SN Ia light curves. The $R_V$ estimates obtained with BVRI photopolarimetry for the SNe vicinity are statistically similar to the hosts global $R_V$. Conclusions. The discrepancy between the local $R_V$, inferred from photopolarimetry in the SN vicinity, and RV obtained from SNe light curves suggests that the extinction laws obtained directly from the SNe may be driven by more local effects, perhaps from the interaction of light from the SN with very nearby material.</description>

      <title>C-parity, magnetic monopoles and higher frequency gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to the left-right symmetric model $SU(3)_c \times SU(3)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ with C-parity also unbroken [$C$ converts $Q\to -Q$, where $Q$ is the electric charge operator in $SO(10)$.] This breaking produces the topologically stable GUT monopole as well as a GUT scale C-string. The subsequent breaking at an intermediate scale of C-parity produces domain walls bounded by C-strings, found by Kibble, Lazarides and Shafi. A limited number of inflationary $e$-foldings experienced during these breakings can yield an observable number density of primordial GUT monopoles. The C-strings also experience this inflationary phase, and the subsequent string-wall network decays through the emission of gravitational waves. We estimate the gravitational wave spectrum from these composite structures over a range of values of the domain wall tension $\sigma$. Depending on $\sigma$ the spectrum displays a peak in the higher frequency range between $10^2$ to $10^5$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Effective theory of light Dirac neutrino portal dark matter with observable ${\Delta N_{\rm eff}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of light Dirac neutrino portal dark matter (DM) in an effective field theory (EFT) setup. Dirac nature of light neutrino automatically includes its right chiral part $\nu_R$ which, in our setup, also acts like a portal between DM and the standard model (SM) particles. Considering a Dirac fermion singlet DM stabilised by an unbroken $Z_2$ symmetry, we write down all possible dimension-6 effective operators involving DM-$\nu_R$ as well as $\nu_R$-SM which conserve $Z_2$, global lepton number and SM gauge symmetries. DM thermalisation also ensures the thermalisation of $\nu_R$, leading to enhanced effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$, within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We study the complementarity among DM and CMB related observations for different Lorentz structures of effective operators. We also propose two UV completions based on the popularly studied gauges $\rm B-L$ and left-right symmetric model frameworks.</description>

      <title>How new physics affects primordial neutrinos decoupling: Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological observations from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer crucial insights into the Early Universe, enabling us to trace its evolution back to lifetimes as short as 0.01 seconds. Upcoming CMB spectrum measurements will achieve unprecedented precision, allowing for more accurate extraction of information about the primordial neutrinos. This provides an opportunity to test whether their properties align with the predictions of the standard cosmological model or indicate the presence of new physics that influenced the evolution of the MeV-temperature plasma. A key component in understanding how new physics may have affected primordial neutrinos is solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation. In this paper, we address this question by developing a novel approach -- neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC). We discuss it in-depth, highlighting its model independence, transparency, and computational efficiency -- features that current state-of-the-art methods lack. Then, we introduce a proof-of-concept implementation of the neutrino DSMC and apply it to several toy scenarios, showcasing key aspects of the primordial plasma's evolution in the presence of new physics.</description>

      <title>Black Holes as Fermion Factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00741v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons near rotating black holes can undergo significant growth through superradiant energy extraction, potentially reaching field values close to the Planck scale and transforming black holes into effective transducers for these fields. The interaction between boson fields and fermions may lead to parametric production or Schwinger pair production of fermions, with efficiencies significantly exceeding those of perturbative decay processes. Additionally, the spatial gradients of scalar clouds and the electric components of vector clouds can accelerate fermions, resulting in observable fluxes. This study considers both Standard Model neutrinos and dark sector fermions, which could contribute to boosted dark matter. Energy loss due to fermion emissions can potentially quench the exponential growth of the cloud, leading to a saturated state. This dynamic provides a framework for establishing limits on boson-neutrino interactions, previously constrained by neutrino self-interaction considerations. In the saturation phase, boson clouds have the capacity to accelerate fermions to TeV energies, producing fluxes that surpass those from atmospheric neutrinos near black holes. These fluxes open new avenues for observations through high-energy neutrino detectors like IceCube, as well as through dark matter direct detection efforts focused on targeted black holes.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Multi-phase analysis of a star-forming galaxy at $z \sim 5.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19008v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a detailed multiphase analysis of HZ4, a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z ~ 5.5, known for being a turbulent rotating disk and having a detection of a [CII] outflow in the ALMA observations. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode with low- and high-spectral resolution that allow us for the first time to spatially resolve the rest-frame UV and optical emission of the galaxy to investigate the galaxy properties. In particular, the high-resolution dataset allows us to study the kinematics of the ionized gas phase, and the conditions of the interstellar medium, such as the excitation mechanism, dust attenuation, and metallicity. The lower-spectral resolution observations allow us to study the continuum emission and infer the stellar populations' ages and properties. Our findings suggest that HZ4 is a galaxy merger rather than a rotating disk as previously inferred from lower resolution [CII] data. The merger is associated with an extended broad, blueshifted emission, potentially indicative of an outflow originating from a region of intense star formation and extending up to 4 kpc. In light of these new observations we reanalyzed the ALMA data to compare the multiphase gas properties. If we interpret the broad components seen in [CII] and [OIII]$\lambda$5007\.A as outflows, the neutral and ionized components are co-spatial, the mass loading factor of the ionized phase is significantly lower than that of the neutral phase, aligning with trends observed in multi-phase systems at lower redshifts. Nonetheless, additional observations and larger statistical samples are essential to determine the role of mergers and outflows in the early Universe and to clarify the origin of the broad emission components observed in this system.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Galaxy Stellar Properties on the Primordial Spin Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical discovery that the observable stellar properties of present galaxies retain significant dependences on the primordial density and tidal fields. Analyzing the galaxy catalogs from the TNG300-1 simulations, we first compute the primordial spin factor, $\tau$, defined as the mean degree of misalignments between the principal axes of the initial density and potential hessian tensors at the protogalactic sites. Then, we explore in the framework of Shannon's information theory if and how strongly each of six stellar properties of the present galaxies, namely two stellar sizes ($R_{90\star}$ and $R_{50\star}$), ages, specific star formation rates, optical colors and metallicities, share mutual information with $\tau$, measured at $z=127$. Deliberately controlling the TNG galaxy samples to have no differences in the mass, environmental density and shear distributions, we single out net effects of $\tau$ on each of the galaxy stellar properties. In the higher stellar mass range of $M_{\star}/(h^{-1}\,M_{\odot})\ge 10^{10}$, significant amounts of mutual information with $\tau$ are exhibited by all of the six stellar properties, while in the lower range of $M_{\star}/(h^{-1}\,M_{\odot})&lt; 10^{10}$ only four of the six properties except for the specific star formation rates and colors yield significant signals of $\tau$-dependence. Examining how the mean values of the six stellar properties vary with $\tau$, we also show that the galaxies originated from the protogalactic sites with higher $\tau$ values tend to have larger sizes, later formation epochs, higher specific star formation rates, bluer colors and lower metallicities. It is also discovered that the galaxy stellar sizes, which turn out to be most robustly dependent on $\tau$ regardless of $M_{\star}$, follow a bimodal Gamma distribution, the physical implication of which is discussed.</description>

      <title>Primordial neutrinos and new physics: novel approach to solving neutrino Boltzmann equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how new physics influences the dynamics of cosmic neutrinos during their decoupling is crucial in light of upcoming precise cosmological observations and the need to reconcile cosmological and laboratory probes. Existing approaches to solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation are often model-dependent, computationally inefficient, and yield contradictory results. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel method to comprehensively study neutrino dynamics. We apply this method to several case studies, resolving the discrepancy in the literature about the impact of non-thermal neutrinos on $N_{\rm eff}$ and providing important insights about the role of decaying new physics particles on MeV plasma.</description>

      <title>Combining neural networks with galaxy light subtraction for discovering strong lenses in the HSC SSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses are valuable objects for a variety of astrophysical and cosmological applications. Strong lensing galaxies are rare, so efficient search methods, such as convolutional neural networks, are often used on large imaging datasets. In this work, we apply a new technique to improve the performance of supervised neural networks by subtracting the central (lensing) galaxy light from both the training and test datasets. We use multiband imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP) as our training and test datasets. By subtracting the lensing galaxy light, we increase the contrast of the lensed source compared to the original imaging data. We also apply the light subtraction to non-lenses in order to compare them to the light-subtracted lenses. Residual features resulting from poor light subtraction can adversely affect the performance of networks trained on the subtracted images alone. We find that combining the light-subtracted images with the original gri-band images for training and classification can overcome this and improve the overall classification accuracy. We find the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve can be improved to 0.841 using the combination of the fiducial images and light-subtracted images, compared to 0.808 for the fiducial imaging dataset alone. This may be a promising technique for improving future lens searches using CNNs.</description>

      <title>The MUSE Ultra Deep Field: A 5 Mpc stretch of the z $\approx$ 4 cosmic web revealed in emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from a ~5 Mpc-long (comoving) portion of the cosmic web hosting an overdensity ($\delta \approx 25$) of 19 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\approx 4$ within the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF), reaching an average surface brightness (SB) of $5\times 10^{-20}~\rm{erg~s^{-1}~ cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$. This large-scale structure has an average SB similar to the filament across the two MUDF quasars at $z\approx 3.22$. However, deep multiwavelength data do not show a clear presence of active galactic nuclei, suggesting that the emission is mainly regulated by the underlying gas density. We find $\approx 0.2$ dex higher star formation compared to control samples and a remarkable predominance (5/7) of blue-peaked emission lines in the spectra of the embedded LAEs, indicative of favorable conditions for gas accretion. Lastly, we quantify the contribution of intragalactic gas to the Ly$\alpha$ SB profile at large distances from LAEs. By studying samples of filaments detected in emission within diverse environments, we are finally gaining new insight into the physics of gas accretion within the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>VEGA: Voids idEntification using Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic voids, the nearly empty regions nestled between walls and filaments, are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. However, a consensus on the definition of voids remains elusive, as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density based on the method that were used. In this paper, we introduce an innovative void identification method that utilizes Genetic Algorithm analysis. VEGA employs the Voronoi tessellation technique and the Convex Hull algorithm to partition the dataset plane into distinct regions and calculate the volume of each region. For the first time, VEGA integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with the luminosity density contrast function to identify and locate the possible void region candidates. This method utilizes a set of grid points, which enhances the implementation of Voronoi tessellation and enables VEGA to more effectively access the dataset space for the identification of void regions candidates, finding the center and the ultimate structure of voids. Finally, we applied the VEGA and Aikio-M\"ah\"onen (AM) methods to the same test dataset and compared the cosmic voids identified by VEGA with those identified by the AM method. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void-finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.</description>
