      <title>Geometric Uncertainty of Patient-Specific Blood Vessels and its Impact on Aortic Hemodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of numerical simulations of the vascular system, local geometric uncertainties have not yet been examined in sufficient detail due to model complexity and the associated large numerical effort. Such uncertainties are related to geometric modeling errors resulting from computed tomography imaging, segmentation and meshing. This work presents a methodology to systematically induce local modifications and perform a sufficient number of blood flow simulations to draw statistically relevant conclusions on the most commonly employed quantities of interest, such as flow rates or wall shear stress. The surface of a structured hexahedral mesh of a patient-specific aorta is perturbed by displacement maps defined via Gaussian random fields to stochastically model the local uncertainty of the boundary. Three different cases are studied, with the mean perturbation magnitude of $0.25$, $0.5$ and $1.0~$mm. Valid, locally perturbed meshes are constructed via an elasticity operator that extends surface perturbations into the interior. Otherwise, identical incompressible flow problems are solved on these meshes, taking physiological boundary conditions and Carreau fluid parameters into account. Roughly $300\,000$ three-dimensional non-stationary blood flow simulations are performed for the three different perturbation cases to estimate the probability distributions of the quantities of interest. Convergence studies justify the spatial resolution of the employed meshes. Overall, the results suggest that moderate geometric perturbations result in reasonable engineering accuracy (relative errors in single-digit percentage range) of the quantities of interest, with higher sensitivity for gradient-related measures, noting that the observed errors are not negligible.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical Dynamics of the Heart: A Study of Cardiac Hysteresis During Physical Stress Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are best diagnosed using multiple modalities that assess both the heart's electrical and mechanical functions. While effective, imaging techniques like echocardiography and nuclear imaging are costly and not widely accessible. More affordable technologies, such as simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiography (PCG), may provide valuable insights into electromechanical coupling and could be useful for prescreening in low-resource settings.
  Using physical stress test data from the EPHNOGRAM ECG-PCG dataset, collected from 23 healthy male subjects (age: 25.4+/-1.9 yrs), we investigated electromechanical intervals (RR, QT, systolic, and diastolic) and their interactions during exercise, along with hysteresis between cardiac electrical activity and mechanical responses.
  Time delay analysis revealed distinct temporal relationships between QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals, with RR as the primary driver. The diastolic interval showed near-synchrony with RR, while QT responded to RR interval changes with an average delay of 10.5s, and the systolic interval responded more slowly, with an average delay of 28.3s. We examined QT-RR, systolic-RR, and diastolic-RR hysteresis, finding narrower loops for diastolic RR and wider loops for systolic RR. Significant correlations (average:0.75) were found between heart rate changes and hysteresis loop areas, suggesting the equivalent circular area diameter as a promising biomarker for cardiac function under exercise stress.
  Deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks, estimated the QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals from RR data, confirming the nonlinear relationship between RR and other intervals. Findings highlight a significant cardiac memory effect, linking ECG and PCG morphology and timing to heart rate history.</description>
